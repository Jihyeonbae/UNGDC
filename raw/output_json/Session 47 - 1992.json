        "file_text": "It gives me pleasure at the outset to join the speakers who preceded \nme in congratulating you. Sir, on your election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its forty-seventh session. My delegation is confident \nthat your wide experience and diplomatic skill will contribute to the success \nof the session. \nI should like also to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi, \nfor the exemplary manner in which he conducted the affairs of the forty-sixth \nsession of the General Assembly. \nI am pleased also to convey our appreciation and praise to the \nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for this \nconsistent efforts, in the face of numerous impediments, to strengthen the \nrole of the Organization in achieving the purposes and principles of the \nUnited Nations Charter, as well as for his Agenda for Peace proposals aimed at \nenhancing the role of the United Nations in preserving international peace and \nsecurity, ensuring justice and protecting human rights. \nI should like too to welcome the new Members of the Organization: \nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, \nSlovenia, Moldova, San Marino, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and \nGeorgia. Their accession to the Organization's membership is a further step \ntowards the complete universality of our Organization. It also enhances \ninternational acceptability of the principles and purposes of this great \nOrganization and boosts its efforts to achieve justice, prosperity, progress \nand international peace and security. \n\nSince the last session, international relations and the international \nbalance of power have undergone profound changes and transformations. Those \nchanges have resulted in, among other things, the collapse and disintegration \nof what was known as the Soviet Union, and the end of bipolarity. The world \nhas begun to seek the establishment of an alternative order whose features \nhave not crystallized. In the meantime, there are signs that several of the \ncold-war problems such as certain regional conflicts, the dismantling of the \napartheid system in South Africa and the slowing down of the arms race may \nbe amenable to solution. These developments in international relations have \ncreated new opportunities and new challenges. The challenges must be \nconfronted by the international community with all seriousness and \ndetermination.' This should be done by strengthening the spirit of \nunderstanding and reconciliation that now prevails in international relations. \nHowever, this optimism should not stop us from conceding that certain old \nquestions and problems have not been resolved yet. Furthermore, those \ndevelopments have created new hotbeds of tension in certain areas of the \nworld, as evidenced by the eruption of the ethnic conflicts and civil wars \nthat have cast their shadows on the international arena. Such unwelcome \ntrends make it incumbent upon the international community to do more to \nstrengthen the positive trends in international relations so that we may \nresolve the residual and the new problems alike. \nWithin that context, my country supports the efforts of the States of the \nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to reach a speedy solution \nto the Liberian problem. \nWe also urge the international community to encourage the Afghans to \nsettle their differences in a manner that would spare them new confrontation. \n\nAnd we call on the international community to work seriously to end the bloody \nconflict in the Balkans by encouraging the republics of the former Yugoslavia \nto settle their disputes through dialogue and negotiation instead of force and \nviolence. \nThe international community should redouble its efforts to put an end to \nthe human tragedy of the Somali people and to take appropriate measures to \nreach a rational reconciliation, thereby guaranteeing a dignified life for the \nSomalis, who are facing a massive famine. \nAs for the conflict between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United \nArab Emirates, over the islands of Abu Mousa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb, we \nwould like to state the need to adhere to the international norms and \nconventions that prohibit the occupation by force of the territory of another \nState. We call upon our brethren in Iran and the United Arab Emirates to \nallow reason, respect for good-neighbourliness, and the principle of \nsovereignty to prevail, and to search for a peaceful solution to this \nconflict, thereby sparing the region an escalation in tensions. \nThe just cause of the Palestinian people has been with the United Nations \nsince its inception. Notwithstanding the adoption of numerous resolutions by \nthe General Assembly, the Security Council and other organs, the Organization \nremains unable to implement its own resolutions. As the Secretary-General \nstates in his report to the Security Council on preventive diplomacy, \n\\\"The principles of the Charter should be applied consistently, not \nselectively, for if the perception should be of the latter, trust will \nwane and with it the moral authority which is the greatest and most \nunique quality of that instrument.\\\" (A/47/277, para. 82) \n\nDue to clear discrimination against the Palestinian people who remain \nunder the yoke of Israeli occupation and suffer all forms of oppression, \nrepression, enslavement and injustice caused by an international community \nwhich employs double standards that people rose up in an intifadah against \nIsraeli occupation, insisting, properly, on their right to self-determination \nand demonstrating that the will of peoples cannot be crushed by repression. \n\nWe should like to reaffirm from this rostrum our support for the \nintifadah of the Palestinian people against injustice and for that people's \nright to liberate their land, to exercise self-determination and to establish \ntheir own independent and sovereign State. We urge the international \ncommunity to translate its support of the Palestinian people into practical \nmeasures by pressing for the immediate halting of Jewish immigration to \nPalestine and the occupied Arab territories, the complete halting of the \nbuilding of Israeli settlements, the protection of the Palestinian people and \nthe implementation of all resolutions relevant to the Palestinian question and \nto the occupied Arab territories, so that peace and justice may prevail in all \nparts of the Middle East. \nDespite all the encouraging developments in South Africa over the past \ntwo years, recent events have shown that the situation there is still a source \nof tension and cause for concern. The recent eruption and escalation of \nviolence is an ominous sign of a possible explosion that may jeopardize the \nprocess designed to abolish apartheid through negotiation. While welcoming \nthe steps recently taken by the international community in this respect, my \ncountry will continue its support of the South African people's struggle to \neradicate the system of apartheid, which, it seems, is unwilling to desist \nfrom its racist practices voluntarily and, chameleon-like, is desperately \ntrying to disguise itself. Therefore, all of us must maintain the pressure on \nthat regime to make it heed the will of the majority, the will of the \ninternational community and the relevant United Nations resolutions. \nThe remarkable changes and developments in today's world impose new \nresponsibilities on the United Nations in performing its role as an instrument \n\nof preserving world peace and security and promoting stability, \nreconciliation, development and prosperity for all. Small and vulnerable \ncountries have taken heart from the Organization's increased capabilities, \nespecially now that the Organization has achieved marked success in the \nsettlement of disputes in Cambodia and Afghanistan, in the realization of \nNamibia's independence and in supporting the legitimate struggle of the people \nof South Africa to dismantle apartheid. \nNotwithstanding those positive indications in the Organization's work, it \nhas been noted that some still continue to dominate the Organization and to \nuse it, under various pretexts, to serve their own political purposes through \nthe law of force rather than the force of the law, and by pursuing policies of \npolitical and military intervention as well as economic pressure. The \npressures to which Libya has been subjected are part and parcel of those \npolicies. The same is true of what has been visited upon the Iraqi people. \nThus, we call for an end to the embargo imposed against the people of Iraq, \nfor an end to their starvation, for respecting their sovereignty and for \nnon-interference in their internal affairs. \nWhat has become known as the Lockerbie Case is one of the by-products of \nthe present international situation and illustrates its effect on small \ncountries that pursue independent policies and take independent positions. \nThe case also shows the need to introduce basic changes in the mechanism by \nwhich resolutions are adopted in the United Nations, and especially in the \nSecurity Council, so as to make them more expressive of the will of the \ninternational community. The case also pinpoints the dangers inherent in the \ntendency of certain States to use the powers of the Security Council to \n \nachieve their own private objectives and to use double standards in dealing \nwith issues before the Council in a manner that deals high-handedly and \narbitrarily with the sovereignty and rights of small and vulnerable countries. \nThe Lockerbie Case was raised and forced upon the Security Council and \ndealt with under Chapter VII of the Charter, which does not apply, since Libya \nneither threatened world peace nor threatened or committed aggression against \nanother country, actions it would have to have taken to be liable under the \nprovisions of Chapter VII, which relates to the maintenance of international \npeace and security. Conscious of that, and based on its abhorrence of \nterrorism, of which it is a victim, my country expressed, in good will, its \nsincere willingness to cooperate in uncovering the facts and circumstances \nrelating to the case. Upon being notified of the matter, my country took all \nrequired legal measures consistent with international law and conventions that \ndo not violate Libya's sovereign rights. Regrettably, however, the interested \nparties refused to cooperate with the Libyan legal authorities, which had \noffered to conduct joint investigations of the two Libyan suspects. When the \nStates concerned referred the matter to the Security Council, which adopted \nresolution 731 (1992) calling upon Libya to cooperate, my country, in letters \nto the United Nations Secretary-General, expressed its acceptance of the \nresolution and proposed a series of initiatives to implement it. Throughout, \nmy country has been motivated by a desire to reach a settlement that would \nguarantee the rights of all parties and spare the region the dangers of \n \ntension and instability. However, the Libyan initiatives concerning the \nimplementation of the provisions of the resolution met the same fate as \nearlier ones, for the countries concerned rushed to the Security Council to \nseek adoption of another resolution imposing unjust sanctions against the \nsmall, peaceful Libyan people, without any legal basis or moral \njustification. That action completely ignored my country's declared \ncommitment to effective cooperation in the implementation of Security Council \nresolution 731 (1992), as set out clearly in document S/23917 of 14 May 1992. \nThe commitment was welcomed by the great majority of the family of nations as \nrepresented in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, the Organization of \nAfrican Unity, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the League of \nArab States, all of which expressed solidarity with the fair Libyan position \nfrom the very start of the crisis. In all of their decisions and final \nstatements issued in September 1992 those organizations were unanimous on the \nfollowing points. \n\nFirst, praised Libya's cooperation in seeking a peaceful settlement of \nthe crisis within the context of Libya's national sovereignty, international \nlaw, and the principles of the United Nations Charter that govern relations \nbetween independent States. \nSecondly, called on the parties concerned to respond positively to \nLibya's initiatives calling for dialogue, negotiation, and non-escalation, in \norder to reach a solution to the crisis under Chapter VI of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations and under the auspices of the Secretary-General, in a manner \nthat would be conducive to ending the crisis and its repercussions peacefully, \nfairly and quickly. \nThirdly, called upon the Security Council to lift the measures imposed on \nLibya, which has expressed its commitment to resolution 731 (1992) \nAs part of its initiatives, Libya has recently called on the \nSecretary-General of the United Nations to send an international committee to \nverify that Libya has met all the requirements of Security Council resolution \n731 (1992) related to terrorism. Once again, the parties concerned prevented \nthe Secretary-General from responding to this proposal, and - at a time when \nmy country had expected the Council to lift or reduce the unjust sanctions in \nthe light of Libya's positive response to the requirements of resolution \n731 (1992) concerning terrorism, which we unequivocally condemn, and its \ncomplete willingness to provide a fair and unbiased trial for the suspects, \nwhich has been agreed to sought to persuade the Security Council to adopt a \nnew resolution extending the sanctions for four more months. My country still \ncalls for a peaceful settlement to this situation, a settlement that will \n\nsafeguard the rights of all, maintain the principles of international law, and \nsave the world from escalation and confrontation. \nThe unjust sanctions against my country have caused a great deal of human \nand material harm, loss and suffering to the Libyan people. My country has \nalready detailed those losses and damages in official circulating documents of \nthe Security Council. The embargo has affected numerous sectors, especially \nin the fields of health and social services. One example of this is the fact \nthat the delay in the arrival of medical supplies and instruments has led to \nthe deaths of a large number of children, and pregnant women who died in \nlabour. It was also impossible to send abroad over 3,000 medical cases that \ncan not be treated locally, including cases of heart disease, kidney \ntransplants, bone-marrow transplants, neurosurgery, and burns. One hundred \nand fifty gravely ill patients, who could not be treated locally, died while \nbeing transported overland to airports in Tunisia and Egypt. In addition, the \noveruse of land routes to and from the Jamahiriya resulted in an increase in \nroad accidents during the last four months of this year compared to the same \nperiod in 1991. The number of accidents rose from 2,401 in 1991 to 3,788 over \nthe past four months. Deaths from these accidents rose from 389 to 528, an \nincrease of about 35 per cent. \nAs for economic losses resulting from the air embargo, they have amounted \nto $2,157 million as a result of the fall in revenues generated by exports of \nfruits and vegetables, in addition to a 44 per cent drop in non-oil exports. \nThe sanctions also resulted in the interruption of many industrial activities \ndue to the shortage in means of production and spare parts, not to mention \nagriculture. The losses in animal and agricultural production, for example. \n\nare estimated at $1,062,803,000.00 as a result of the non-arrival of medicines \nand sera necessary for protecting the livestock sector against animal \nepidemics and communicable diseases. \nThose who prompted the Security Council to impose these sanctions on our \nsmall, peaceful population which has limited resources and has threatened no \none bear the political, legal, and moral responsibility for the deaths of \nwomen, children, the aged, the handicapped, and the sick. They also bear \nresponsibility for the decline in the standard of living, the slow pace of \ndevelopment, the spread of epidemics, and the imprisonment of an entire people \ninside its own borders. There is no doubt that all of this relates directly \nto human rights. History will bear witness to what is being perpetrated in \nthe name of the Security Council against a small, peaceful population. \nThus, my country would like from this rostrum to call upon the \ninternational Organization and the international Security Council, out of \nrespect for the principles of justice, to lift these sanctions, which have \nharmed the Libyan people and the peoples of neighboring States. It also \ninvites the concerned parties to engage in dialogue and to cooperate in order \nto reach a solution to this dispute based on sovereignty and mutual respect in \naccordance with international norms and laws. \nI must put before this international forum some facts that are no doubt \nuniversally accepted. The first fact is that all countries, large and small, \nmust respect the Charter of the United Nations and uphold international law if \nthe world is not to slip into a state of anarchy, which is in no one's \ninterest. The objective of the United Nations should be the protection of the \nsovereignty of States and respect for their laws. The second fact is that the \n\nSecurity Council, the authority entrusted with maintaining international peace \nand security, should not become a tool used by some world Powers as a cover \nfor their hegemonistic designs. The third fact is the need for an \ninternational judicial organ entrusted with trying those who commit acts of \nterrorism of any sort or source. Hence, we welcome the call for the \nestablishment of an international criminal court to look into international \ncriminal cases. \nThe consolidation of security and cooperation in the Mediterranean region \nis high on the agenda of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, for we believe that \nsecurity and peace in that region is vital, not only to the coastal States, \nbut also to the peace and security of the world. Thus, my country remains \nconvinced that effective security in the region can be achieved only after the \ncauses of tension that beset the Mediterranean are removed and after the \nforeign navies and military bases are withdrawn from it. Moreover, \ncooperation among its coastal States should be increased, coordinated and \nintensified. That is why my country would like to underscore the findings in \nthe final declaration of the Tenth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement \nCountries, which called for supporting the efforts aimed at transforming the \nMediterranean into a zone of peace, security and cooperation on the basis of \nthe principles of respect for the equality and sovereignty of States, \nnon-intervention in the internal affairs of others, and the non-use or threat \nof force. \n \nMy country has consistently affirmed that it supports disarmament because \nit is aware of the terrible dangers that armaments pose to our planet. In \nthis context, Libya submitted to the Assembly a proposal calling on the United \nNations General Assembly to look into the serious phenomena of concern to all \nnations, such as international terrorism how to deal with its causes and how \nto eradicate it; weapons of mass destruction, and offensive strategic weapons, \nwhich constitute a terrifying danger for all, including those who own them. \nThe proposal refers also to offering compensation to the peoples who were \ncolonized and subjected to repression and suppression by their colonizers. \nOur proposal deals also with other important issues, such as the question of \nrefugees, exiles and the kidnapped, in addition to reviewing the Charter of \nthe United Nations. It proposes studying various economic and social problems \nand the ills that afflict humanity with a view to finding a solution for all \nthese problems and to realizing stability, prosperity and happiness for the \nwhole world. \nIn addition to this, it is important to solve certain political questions \nwhich have been with the United Nations since its inception. All those \nquestions are contained in document A/46/840 of 9 January 1992. \nOnce again, my country renews its call for disarmament through the \nelimination of all weapons of mass destruction of all countries which possess, \nproduce or stockpile them, without exception or discrimination. My country, \nas party to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty and to the Treaty on the \nprohibition of bacteriological weapons and the Geneva Protocol, supports all \nefforts aimed at curbing the arms race and at eliminating nuclear weapons. \nThat is why we welcome the recent agreement between the United States of \nAmerica and the Russian Federation further to reduce their nuclear weapons. \n\nMy country also welcomes France's accession to the non-proliferation Treaty. \nTo further expand this tendency, my country supports the establishment of \nzones that are free of all nuclear, chemical and bacteriological weapons, \nincluding Africa and the Middle East. It also supports the proposal of the \nArab Republic of Egypt which calls for declaring the Middle East an area free \nof weapons of mass destruction. This objective, however, is obstructed by \npersistent difficulties resulting from Israel's continued production, \npossession and stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction as well as its \ntesting of these weapons and its refusal to heed repeated international \nappeals to submit its nuclear facilities to the safeguards regime of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. \nIn this present era of change one concrete fact emerges, namely that the \ninternational community has not shown the same concern over questions of \neconomic development as it did in regard to other questions such as those of \npolitical crises. Economic problems, which are a significant factor in the \nobstruction of development and growth, are still with us. This does not seem \nlogical, especially at a time when the world looks forward to a new era of \nsecurity and stability. If this new era is to materialize, appropriate \nmeasures should be taken to solve the intractable economic problems of the \ndeveloping countries in particular. These include the problems arising from \nprotectionism, lack of transfer of technology, reverse flows of resources, \nexternal debts and low commodity prices. Furthermore, the imposition of \narbitrary measures and sanctions, such as economic embargoes, trade \nrestrictions and the freezing of funds and assets by certain developed \ncountries against a number of developing countries, must be halted. In \n\naddition, it is very important for the international community to honour its \ncommitments vis-a-vis certain programmes, such as the United Nations New \nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. Africa expects a great \ndeal from this programme which is supposed to bolster development efforts \nstarted on the continent at the regional level by establishing the African \neconomic community, and at the subregional level in the form of groupings such \nas the Arab Maghreb Union, to which my country is honoured to belong. This \nunion aims at intensifying cooperation among its member countries and with the \nrest of the continent. It also seeks to enter into wider cooperation with \nother countries of the world, especially the European Mediterranean countries, \nand to enhance cooperation between the countries of the South and the North. \nThe results of the Summit on environment and development which was held \nin the middle of this year are a great achievement that bespeaks the \ninternational community's determination to protect the world's natural \nresources. The commitment of the world to preserve the environment was \nevident in the agreements on climatic change and biological diversity that \nwere reached at that Conference. The important thing now is to cooperate \ninternationally and effectively in implementing the conclusions and \nrecommendations of the Earth Summit. In this respect, my country welcomes the \ndecision of the Summit concerning the setting up of a standing developmental \ncommittee and hopes that this committee will become a forum for implementing \nthe decisions of Agenda 21 which are aimed at preserving the environment while \npursuing development. \nConservation of the environment requires both international cooperation \nand national efforts. My country participated in the Rio de Janeiro \nConference and signed its conventions and agreements. At the national level \n \nmy country accords top priority to questions of development. Accordingly, my \ncountry has begun to combat drought and desertification through the great \nman-made river project which will carry millions of cubic metres of water from \nthe southern part of Libya to the arable land in the coastal area where the \ngreatest part of our population lives. Our national plans aim at the \nreclamation of thousands of hectares of land for both agriculture and human \nsettlement. Despite all this, my country still suffers from a severe shortage \nof water which is necessary for its economic development plans. This shortage \nnot only threatens my country, but will imperil the continuation of life in \nNorth Africa and the Middle East unless it is dealt with through international \ncooperation. \nI must state here that our aspirations after development face certain \ndifficulties which my country has raised in several regional and international \nforums, including the General Assembly. The Secretary-General himself spoke \nabout those difficulties in his report. An Agenda for Peace. I am here \nreferring to mines and the remnants of war. During the Second World War, \nLibyan territory was used as one of the main theatres for military \noperations. Our people have paid an exorbitant material and human price for a \nwar in which our country had no stake. Since the end of that war, the Libyan \npeople have continued to suffer from the remnants of the war and the mines and \nexplosives planted by the warring armies in its territory. \nMany regional and international organizations, including the General \nAssembly, have adopted resolutions calling upon the countries responsible to \nsubmit the required information and technical assistance needed for the \nremoval of those mines and remnants, and to pay compensation for the damage \ncaused by them. \n\nToday, we reiterate our call to those countries to act in a responsible \nmanner, to respond positively to the appeals of the international community \nand to implement the provisions of General Assembly resolutions relating to \nthe remnants of war. \nThe environment in my country is also threatened by the harmful effects \nof pollution in the Mediterranean, caused by the wastes poured into its water \nby foreign navies stationed in the area, the over-consumption and \nover-production of the developed Mediterranean countries and the dumping of \nhundreds of tons of pesticides and combustibles in its waters. This has \ncaused an environmental imbalance that is being further aggravated by the \nexploitation of the Mediterranean by countries from outside the region. \n\nHuman rights issues are the focus of the international community's \nattention and are at the top of its scale of priorities. While appreciating \nthe role of the United Nations in ensuring the exercise of human rights and \nbasic freedoms, we must state that those rights are not scrupulously respected \nin a number of regions. In addition, the double standards and the selectivity \nthat mar the conduct of certain countries in the area of protecting human \nrights have prevented the United Nations, and especially the Commission on \nHuman Rights, from effectively performing their role in this area. We hope \nthat the World Conference on Human Rights, to be held in Vienna in mid-1993, \nwill afford us opportunities to deliberate on all these questions and will \nadopt practical measures to deal with them and identify the ways and means \nwhereby human rights may be protected and defended against violations.* \nMy country attaches great importance to human rights and to the dignity \nand welfare of man. This was reaffirmed in the great green document on human \nrights, which includes numerous basic principles for the promotion of human \nrights. This has been crowned by effective and legal procedures, such as the \nlaw on enhancing freedoms, which was promulgated in 1991, the establishment of \na national human rights commission and an international committee for the \nQaddafi human rights award. Furthermore, Libya has acceded to most \ninternational agreements and instruments relating to human rights and measures \nare being taken to meet our commitments arising from accession to these \nagreements and instruments. \n\nOne of the items on the international agenda is the setting up of a new \nworld order. There is no doubt that such a world order will not function \nproperly and effectively unless we overcome and rectify certain shortcomings \nof the United Nations, since the Organization will be the world body that will \nplay a fundamental role in the management and coordination of that new world \norder. Thus, the most urgent task now is to reinvigorate the United Nations, \nrestructure and democratize it. My country welcomes the efforts being made at \npresent to reform the Organization and enhance its effectiveness, including \nthe encouraging initiatives of the Secretary-General. \nHowever, a great deal remains to be done in this respect, such as \nensuring full respect for the Charter, and consistent adherence to its \nprovisions, without selectivity and without any breach of its principles. We \nmust also ensure that the Organization is not dominated by any one and that \nits resolutions are respected and implemented non-selectively. Furthermore, \nthe role of the General Assembly should be strengthened in a manner that would \nensure the effective and full implementation of all its resolutions, as those \nresolutions are the true expression of the sum-total of the positions of all \nthe Member States. Also, the current composition of the Security Council \nshould be reviewed and expanded in order for it to reflect the increase in \nmembership of the United Nations. It is also highly important to review some \nof the provisions of the Charter. We would like specifically to focus \nattention on the veto right in the Security Council. My country was the first \nto call for the abolition of that privilege, because it is one of the main \nimpediments to the most important role for which the United Nations was \nestablished, namely, the maintenance of international peace and security. We \n\nhave lately felt satisfaction at the expansion of this call. Many countries, \nincluding some current members of the Security Council, have voiced similar \nviews, and have come to share our conviction that a system of collective \nsecurity that continues to be subject to a veto by some countries can never be \ndepended on to maintain peace and security. \nIn a few years time, we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the \nUnited Nations. Over the past four decades, the Organization has performed a \nremarkable role in decolonization and has worked tirelessly for the \nconsolidation of international peace and security. It has taken many \ninitiatives towards the achievement of economic development and social \nwell-being. Hence, my country's welcome for the call to convene an \nInternational Conference on Human Rights in 1993 and an International \nConference on Population in 1994, as both conferences will afford an \nopportunity for the re-assessment of international programmes of assistance to \ndeveloping countries, with a view to achieving an optimum balance between \npopulation growth and development resources. \nMy country welcomes also the call for convening an International \nConference on Women in 1995, and attaches great importance to the World Summit \nfor Social Development, because it will give political impetus to national, \nregional and international efforts and activities aimed at meeting the social \nneeds of many developing countries. \nAs all those world conferences will take place under circumstances of \ninternational change and transformation, my country looks forward to their \nresults and hopes that they will lead to the laying of solid foundations and \nthe formulation of clear-cut approaches that would lead to international \n\nefforts aimed at the strengthening of peace, security and stability for all as \nwell as the creation of opportunities for the progress of all mankind. \nIn these critical times and in the context of this unstable international \nsituation, the small countries of the world look towards the United Nations \nwith all their hopes for a brave new world of peace, security, justice and \nequality for all that would be built by the hands of all nations alike, large \nand small, wealthy and poor; a brave world in which the values of freedom, \ndemocracy and human rights are upheld and which will be free of violence, \ninjustice and dictatorship; a world of love and brotherhood, where God's light \nshines above the whole Earth the one God, who is Lord of the universe. We \nsincerely hope that the United Nations will rise to the great challenges that \nface it. The President of the Assembly can count on my country's cooperation \nin every endeavour that will promote, enhance and realize these principles and \nobjectives I have spoken of. With peace and love from the small, peaceful \nLibyan people to all your peace-loving peoples. \n"

        "file_text": "Let me congratulate you. Sir, and the Republic \nof Bulgaria upon your election as President of the General Assembly at its \nforty-seventh session. Your experience as a respected political leader and \njurist augurs well for the success of our deliberations. \nI wish to acknowledge the work of Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi \nArabia and his inspired and constructive presidency of the General Assembly at \nits forty-sixth session. \nI present my compliments to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, \nwhose election was supported by Brazil from the beginning. His experience and \nstatesmanship, which I had the occasion to witness at the United Nations \nConference on Environment and Development, will certainly stand him in good \nstead in the exercise of his high office. \nBrazil welcomes the representatives of the new States Members of the \nUnited Nations: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, \nGeorgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan and Uzbekistan. My country wishes to explore the possibilities \nof cooperation with the new Member States. \nThe opening of the general debate requires that we should call forth \nnational and regional aspirations without losing sight of our concern for the \nuniversal. It requires that we should seek to fulfil our individual \nidentities in a harmonious whole, that should we be both effective and just. \nHistorical change should not be viewed as the chaotic workings of nature, \nwhich, like a storm, are beyond control. Nor does it bear comparison to a \ntheatrical play whose plot and outcome are known to the author and the \nperformers in advance but which the audience discovers only as the play \nunfolds. The most pertinent metaphor for understanding the lessons of history \nwould be that of a labyrinth. Conceived of as a labyrinth, history unfolds \nunpredictably. This, however, does not deny the rational creativity of man \nand of peoples. Rational creativity lies in identifying by trial and error \nthe blind alleys in the maze of collective experience, while trusting that \nthere are exit points and struggling to reach them. \nToday the role of reason in the search for a way out lies in resorting to \nhistorical experience to promote those values which may ensure better and \nhigher ways of life in an organized society: freedom, democracy, human \nrights, sustainable development, justice and peace. In times of change it is \nimportant to stop and think about the values and concepts that lie at the \nfoundation of international relations. \nThe process I have described gives rise both to hopes and to concerns. \nIt reflects the interaction of centripetal forces that tend towards the \nuniversal and of centrifugal forces that call attention to diversity. On the \none hand, societies are embracing standards and practices that are well on the \nway to becoming universal, as witnessed by the strengthening of democracy and \nhuman rights, of sustainable development and of free enterprise and market \nintegration. \nOn the other hand, we witness the rebirth of nationalism and ethnic \nstrife, religious fervour taken to extremes and forms of discrimination which \nmultiply tension and threaten world peace. \nThe United Nations, and in particular the General Assembly, should serve \nas the natural point of convergence for the various trends that shape the \ncomplexity of our time. That complexity requires building a new international \norder based on the democratic participation of all States, as stressed by the \nSecretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization. \nIn conformity with its commitment to dialogue and cooperation, Brazil \nwishes to make its contribution to the common task of ensuring the equitable \nfulfilment of the historical aspirations of mankind. Brazil takes pride in \nits diplomatic tradition. With 10 neighbours and nearly 17,000 kilometres of \nborders, all of which were peacefully negotiated, Brazil's destiny is civil \nand fruitful coexistence with all countries. \nThe democracy we enjoy today at the domestic level is an assurance of \nunity and stability. It teaches us to accept the diversity and divergence \ninherent in a pluralistic society. It permits us to face crises and \nvicissitudes within the rule of law and the strict boundaries of \nconstitutional order. At the same time, democracy encourages us to uphold its \nprinciples and methods in our relations with other nations. In a democracy \nthe rules of the game relate to the sharing and limitation of power. \nGovernment must belong to the many, so that it can resist imposition by the \nfew. Power must be constrained by law, so as to avoid the arbitrary \ndiscretion of those who wield it. \nThe acknowledgement of these rules aims at the qualitative transformation \nof life in society the passage from the realm of violence to the realm of \nnon-violence achievable by the taming of power through law. This is what \nconfers on the law an irrevocable ethical content. In the realm of public \ninternational law, this ethical content finds its expression in the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes, since its procedures for choosing among available \noptions for action seek precisely to dispel the fears that derive from the \nrule of violence. It is in that spirit of democratic civility that Brazil \nintends to participate in the process of reorganizing the international system. \nThe unprecedented historical crossroads at which we find ourselves calls \nfor a new agenda, an agenda embodying an awareness of the present and a vision \nof the future. The drafting of this agenda must take into account all the \ndimensions of value. All values have to be susceptible of fulfilment and are \ninexhaustible. To subsist, they must be translated into normative and social \nreality. However, the fulfilment of values in history does not exhaust their \ncontent. For example, we can and may always obtain more freedom and more \njustice. \nThe foreign policy of Brazil stresses these twin dimensions in its \nresponse to the new international situation and stresses them through a \ncreative adaptation and vision of the future. These concepts, we think, are \nappropriate as we consider the items on the agenda of the General Assembly. \nThe starting-point for a rethinking of the international system lies in \nthe acknowledgement that peace, security and disarmament are inseparable. \nThe suggestions put forward by Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali in his \ndocument \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277) lend new contours and an enlarged \nscope to discussions on the role of the United Nations. All Member States \nshould participate in an in-depth consideration of the provocative and \ncreative suggestions put forward by the Secretary-General. Brazil will \ncontribute actively to their consideration at the present session of the \nGeneral Assembly. \nThe \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" comprises timely issues, such as preventive \ndiplomacy, peace-making and post-conflict peace-building. Such innovative \nconcepts are, by their very nature, still fluid. They open up new \nperspectives which remain to be explored, albeit cautiously, as befits an \nencounter between unknown realities and bold and imaginative ideas. \nThe dream of a better world cannot, however, be excluded from the \ndebate. Though realism is the starting-point of all political action, it \nshould not be taken as its final objective. Justice is the ultimate value \nthat should, in the final analysis, permeate the concept of order. \nPeace-building is a continuous task and an evolving process. In addition \nto the concepts related to the means of tackling conflict situations, we \nshould also seek to define the logical corollary of preventive peace-building, \nnamely the forestalling of crises deriving from economic and social factors. \nTo that end, we must strengthen the role of the United Nations, not only in \nrestoring peace and security, but also in fostering economic and social \nprogress. \nOther elements should therefore be added to those put forward in the \n\\\"Agenda for Peace\\\", such as the promotion of a more just international economic \nenvironment, full respect for human rights and the rule of law, general and \ncomplete disarmament, and the democratization of international relations based \non sovereign equality and the non-use of force. \nIt is essential to avoid the temptation of a selective application of the \nprovisions of the Charter. The instruments for the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security must not serve to consolidate imbalances \nbased on power relations, which are not more legitimate because they are \nreal. The fundamental attribute of legitimacy consists in the \nall-encompassing perspective of humanity. \nIt is of paramount importance to uphold the provision of the Charter \nwhereby the maintenance of international peace and security is the collective \nresponsibility of all Member States. \nIn carrying out its primary responsibility for the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security, the Security Council acts on behalf of all \nMember States of the United Nations. Now that the Council is being called \nupon to play an increasingly decisive role, there is a clear need for an \nin-depth discussion of the representative nature of its composition, the scope \nof its competence and the powers of its members. \nWe should consider, with prudence no less than with foresight, such \nreadjustments as would permit the Council to discharge its functions in a more \nrepresentative manner. Brazil is prepared to contribute constructively to \nthis effort, taking fully into account the institutional balance among the \norgans of the United Nations provided for in the San Francisco Charter. \nThe contribution of Brazil to United Nations peace-keeping operations \nreflects our commitment to implementing the principle of collective \nresponsibility. \nThe issue of disarmament has been momentarily overshadowed by that of \nsecurity in the wake of the unstable situations which followed the collapse of \nglobal confrontation. The progressive reduction of arms stockpiles, \nespecially of weapons of mass destruction, remains, however, fundamental. \nMuch has indeed been accomplished in the field of disarmament, yet much \nremains to be done. \nBrazil and Argentina have jointly entered into an agreement with the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency on the application of safeguards. With \nArgentina and Chile, we launched an initiative to ensure the full entry into \nforce of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America \nthe Treaty of Tlatelolco. The entry into force of the Treaty of Tlatelolco \nwill make Latin America the first nuclear-weapon-free zone in the world. This \nrepresents a balanced agreement on non-proliferation with equality of rights \nand obligations. We have banned chemical and biological weapons from our \nterritory through the Mendoza Agreement, which we concluded with our \nneighbouring States. We have thus advanced the application of the convention \non chemical weapons, which sets down uniform rules of disarmament and \nverification binding on all signatories. We hope similarly universal and \nnon-discriminatory disarmament conventions will be concluded in the future. \nRegarding the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic, we \nwelcome the opportunity to work with our partners on both sides of the ocean \nin a process of dialogue and joint endeavour aimed in particular at the \nprotection of the marine environment. \nSecurity and disarmament are only means to achieve the highest goal to \nwhich mankind truly aspires the goal of peace. Peace, not as the mere \nabsence of war, but as an affirmative value, peace as a state of satisfaction \nin which relations among States can be ruled by law and disputes settled by \npeaceful means. \nPeace must be linked to cooperation, of which justice is an integral \npart, for common interests are rooted in a balanced relation among States. \nIt is widely acknowledged that there is a close link between the \ndemocratic system of government and the inclination of States towards peace, \nand conversely, a link between authoritarian regimes and a greater propensity \nto conflict. The values inherent in democracy pluralism, majority rule, \ntolerance, consensus, the rule of law extend naturally to the external \naffairs of the State. The strengthening of democracy on a planetary scale \nrepresents therefore a decisive contribution to the building of a more \npeaceful international system. \nAn unquestionable value in the domestic order, democracy also projects \nitself as an organizing principle of the international order, through the \nstrengthening of multilateral diplomacy and the search for a broad \nparticipation in the international decision-making process. \nBrazil is convinced that relations among States must be governed \npredominantly by incentives to cooperation and not by disincentives. That \namounts to promoting a positive and not a negative agenda for international \nrelations, an agenda that must be negotiated in a democratic manner. \nThe improvement of international cooperation to ensure adequate and \neffective treatment of world-wide issues, such as those of humanitarian, \ndevelopmental or environmental character, is to bf: pursued within the basic \nprinciples of international law, foremost among which is respect for State \nsovereignty. \nFortunately, a new perception has evolved in the field of human rights \nthat focuses on the need for special protection for the most vulnerable groups \nin each country. Cultural, religious and ethnic minorities, women, children, \nrefugees and immigrants are social groups frequently exposed to intolerance \nand to the abuse of their most basic rights. We must strive to bridge the gap between what is achievable and what is \ndesirable. Respect for human rights must be universal in scope, just as the \n1948 Declaration is universal and just as the provisions of the basic \ncovenants and conventions on this matter are universal. In short, human \nrights must not be violated under any pretext whatsoever. \nThe full enjoyment of individual rights requires material conditions of \nsocial and economic organization grounded in the idea of justice. The holding \nin 1993 of the World Conference on Human Rights, as well as the proposed world \nsummit on social development, will provide opportunities to strengthen the \nprotection and the promotion of human dignity. \nThe Government of Brazil is doing everything in its power to protect and \npromote human rights. We maintain an open dialogue with international \norganizations governmental and non-governmental and we have acceded to the \nmain legal instruments on this matter. To be assured of success in our \nendeavours, we further need constructive international cooperation to address \nbetter the perverse consequences of extreme poverty and to equip democratic \nStates with conditions to reinforce their preventive and corrective actions in \nthese areas, where serious violations of individual rights still occur. \nOne of the most urgent tasks of the United Nations will be to promote in \nall countries a strong campaign against all forms of discrimination. It is \nhigh time we reaffirmed the classic concept of tolerance as an essential \nconstituent element of life in an enlightened society. Equality can be \ngenuine only when there is respect for diversity, where there is respect for \nheterogeneity. Policies of racial segregation, by any name, will always be \nhateful. The idea that a nation or a social group is somehow superior because \nit is ethnically homogeneous is flatly wrong. \nThe world has not lived through the horrors of a world war, the anguish \nof 45 years of the cold war and the hardship of conflicts that have offended \nthe conscience of mankind to witness now the resurgence of the spectre of \nxenophobia, of exclusive nationalism, or of ethnic, cultural or religious \nintolerance. We cannot allow the concept of nationhood to serve as a cloak \nfor the practices of oppression. Brazil, as a multiracial country proud of \nits roots, rejects outright attitudes that are inimical to the human race. \nJust as our societies cannot coexist with the marginalization of parts of \ntheir population, so the new international society we seek to build cannot \ncoexist with the marginalization of entire peoples. \nThe interdependence of the world economy paradoxically highlights the \nshortcomings of global cooperation. The gap between the North and the South \nis widening before our eyes. This situation cannot persist. We must work \ntogether to foster economic growth in all countries. There will be no peace \nor security so long as such disparities continue to distort the international \nsystem. \nIn an increasingly open and interdependent international community, the \nleverage from international trade is extraordinary. We must therefore prevent \nprotectionist pressures linked to short-term parochial interests from \nundercutting the negotiating effort of the Uruguay Round, inspired by free \ncompetition and the multiplication of benefits. The difficulties and \nsluggishness inherent in the process of multilateral-trade liberalization \nshould not prompt us to opt indiscriminately for self-contained regional \nblocks. We see, and would like others to see, regional-trade liberalization \nas a form of creating additional opportunities for international trade as a \nwhole, without inflicting losses on third parties. This is how we view the \nSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), the regional basis for our competitive \nintegration in the international economy. \nBrazil is a global trader. We trade with all regions of the world and we \nare modernizing our economy through trade liberalization and openness towards \nthe world economy. Negotiations with foreign creditors have produced positive \nresults. Science and technology today represent the crucial variable of \neconomic success. Promoting their dissemination and ensuring greater \ntransparency and equity in the access to knowledge is fundamental for \ndevelopment. That is the spirit that guides the Brazilian initiative now \nunder consideration in the United Nations Disarmament Commission, aiming at \nthe definition of non-discriminatory and universally acceptable principles to \nregulate international transfers of sensitive technologies for peaceful \npurposes. \nLast June Brazil hosted the United Nations Conference on Environment and \nDevelopment, which was the largest diplomatic event in the history of the \nOrganization and set new patterns of international understanding and \ncooperation. We worked creatively to face the challenges of the present and \nboldly in the preparations for the future. The Rio Conference was not aimed \nat simply reorganizing this or that aspect of economic activity or of life in \nsociety. It was aimed, rather, at reshaping the very notion of development, \nto conceive it on a more rational, more just and more generous foundation \nthat of sustainable development. \nThe Rio Declaration, Agenda 21, the Declaration on Forests, the climate \nConvention and the biodiversity Convention outline a legal framework and a \npolitical project of paramount importance for international cooperation. The \nsignificance of these instruments will be even more evident over time. \nAdherence to the principles that have been agreed upon and prompt ratification \nof the two Conventions will usher in a new era of international cooperation. \nThe Rio Conference set up a new paradigm, a new social contract, on the \nbasis of the fundamental concept of sustainable development. It established \nas a primary concern the need to ensure the most rational balance between \nlegitimate development goals, on the one side, and the preservation of the \nhealth of our planet and the well-being of future generations, on the other. \nSustainable development is the contemporary expression of progress. It is the \nbasis for a new international environment and development order. \nIn welcoming the Heads of State and Government who honoured us with their \npresence. President Fernando Collor stated that \n\\\"The world has decided to assemble here to address no more, no less than \nthe life itself on the surface of the planet.\\\" \nThe Conference concluded that we cannot allow the persistence of social \nimbalances in the current international system marked by inhuman situations of \npoverty and by the coexistence of want and waste. As stated by the Brazilian \nHead of State, as President of the Conference, \n\\\"We cannot have an environmentally sound planet in a socially unjust \nworld\\\". \nThe Rio Conference therefore fostered an awareness of the fact that \ndevelopment must be sustainable. Sustainability requires due attention not \nonly to environmental but also to economic and social factors. \nThat and all the other achievements of the Conference were made possible \nthanks only to the unprecedented engagement of the community of nations at the \nhighest level, allowing for the consideration of problems of universal \ninterest through the equal participation of all countries. Let me stress this \npoint: The Rio Conference was exemplary in that it brought to a higher level \nthe practice of democracy in international relations, thus strengthening \nmultilateral diplomacy. At the Conference, all countries - large and small, \nrich and poor gave proof that they were and are capable of linking their own \nspecific interests with larger, more general interests. \nThis is the \\\"spirit of Rio\\\", which we hope will guide the United Nations \nin other areas as well: mutual confidence among States, a willingness to act \ndecisively with a view to achieving common goals, and the grandeur of joint \nendeavours in devising forms of enhanced cooperation in line with norms \ndefined democratically and on the basis of consensus. \nThis session of the General Assembly is called upon to address the task \nof taking the first steps in implementing the conclusions of the Conference \nand in honouring the commitments entered into at Rio. We therefore attribute \ngreat importance to the establishment of the Commission on Sustainable \nDevelopment. Sustainable development requires new and additional financial \nresources on an adequate and predictable basis, as reflected in chapter 33 of \nAgenda 21. We expect that, at the present session, the developed countries \nwill announce initial plans to give effect to the goals of the Conference. \nEqually crucial is the availability of technology to developing \ncountries, so as to ensure the feasibility of established programmes. Action \nor follow-up measures are also necessary in other areas; among these I stress \nthe development of small island States and the convening of a negotiating \ncommittee on desertification. \nBrazil wishes to make an additional contribution to the accomplishments \nof the Rio Conference by offering to host an international centre for studies \non sustainable development. We count on public and private support for this \ninitiative, which was welcomed in a resolution adopted at the Conference and \nfor the implementation of which we have already laid the groundwork. As an \nacademic institution, the centre will provide an international research and \nexchange forum for the application of decisions adopted at Rio. \nWhen I spoke about the dichotomy between the real and the ideal necessary \nfor the construction of a new order, I referred to the great opportunities for \ncooperation among nations to solve problems in the areas of peace and \nsecurity, democracy, human rights, development and environment. The world \nexpects the work of the Organization to be concentrated on those priority \nareas. \nThe capacity for joint action by the United Nations must spring from the \nvoice of each and every Member State. That action becomes all the more \nlegitimate as the basic decision-making process grows more representative and \nmore democratic. \nBrazil views the ongoing work on the restructuring and revitalization of \nthe economic and social sectors of the United Nations as eminently relevant. \nIt should lead to greater efficiency, together with a wider scope for \ninternational cooperation for development. \nAn agenda for peace cannot overlook the agenda for development. Ultimate \nsuccess in this enterprise requires a realistic willingness to endow the \nUnited Nations with the necessary instruments and the prospective vision to \nmake this universal forum the core of collective efforts for the improvement \nof relations among peoples and countries. \nIn Brazil, as elsewhere in Latin America and other regions, bold and \nnecessary reforms have been set in motion to eliminate obstacles to \ndevelopment, to economic competitiveness, to technological progress and to the \nfree exercise of innovation and entrepreneurship based on the market. \nBrazil joins other nations with an open mind, aware of the need for \ncreative adaptation to new realities and convinced that new challenges require \na vision of the future endowed with generosity.

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Ethiopian delegation and \nmyself I wish to extend heartfelt congratulations to you. Sir, on your \nelection as President of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. \nMy delegation is confident that, under your wise guidance, the current session \nof the General Assembly will achieve outstanding successes. In this \nconnection I wish to assure Your Excellency of my delegation's full \nco-operation in the discharge of your responsibilities. \nI also wish to express my delegation's sincere appreciation to your \npredecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for his able \nstewardship of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. \nLikewise, I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-General, for his vigorous efforts to \nfulfil the mandate bestowed upon him by the world community. We are confident \nthat under his able leadership the stature and credibility of the United \nNations will be further enhanced. We wish him every success in his endeavours. \n\nMy delegation is also pleased to extend a cordial welcome to all the new \nMembers of the United Nations which have joined our family during the last 12 \nmonths. \nThe end of the cold war, which was a great turning-point in history, was \nfollowed by further positive changes in the international political climate. \nHowever, it is a matter of concern to us that there are still conflicts raging \nin many parts of the world. The thaw in the relations between East and West \ndid not necessarily lead to total peace, devoid of human suffering and \nhardship. \nIn this regard, I should like to draw the Assembly's attention to the \nunfolding tragedy in Somalia, which defies imagination and affronts our senses \nand sensibilities. Over the past two years, the situation in the country has \ndeteriorated so much that the State has ceased to exist. Law and order, peace \nand stability and the basic infrastructure necessary for the life of a \nfunctioning society are virtually non-existent. These have all been destroyed \nby acts of internecine warfare, the extent of whose damage and the consequent \nhuman suffering combine to make Somalia one of the worst humanitarian crises \nin living memory. \nIt is lamentable that Somalia should be bleeding to death by the actions \nof its own sons. Nearly half the total population of the country has been \ndislocated by war and famine. Scores of children and old people are dying \nevery day, while thousands have perished. The Somali people have left their \nhomes and fled to neighbouring and other countries. \nGiven the situation in Somalia today, it is pertinent to ask why the \nvarious factions are doing all this to their own country and people. Why this \n\nwanton destruction for the sake of political power over a disintegrating \ncountry? How can one explain what is being done to the people of Somalia, \nsomething which goes beyond any conceivable political cause or justification \nwhen we see women, children and the elderly being killed indiscriminately \nmerely because they belong to this clan or that sub-clan? \nThis nightmare must come to an immediate end. The Ethiopian people can \nspeak from their own history of 30 years of conflict: war and the application \nof brute force and senseless destruction cannot by any means provide the \nsolution to a country's political problems. We believe that the bloodletting \nin Somalia during the past two years should serve as a sufficient lesson to \nthe various factions that the path of conflict can only lead to more \ncatastrophe. Historical knowledge confirms beyond a reasonable doubt that the \nuse of force or war never achieved lasting results in the conduct of human \naffairs. It is our firm conviction that the protagonists in the current \ncrisis in Somalia should make the welfare and interests of the country and the \npeople they claim to represent uppermost in their minds. \nIt must be stated that Somalia's neighbours, the countries of the Horn \nof Africa, did not spare the slightest effort to bring about a peaceful \nresolution of the tragic conflict. \nIt will be recalled that a Horn of Africa summit meeting on humanitarian \nissues was convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in April 1992. Its main \nobjective was to examine the serious humanitarian crisis in the subregion and \nwork with regional organizations and the United Nations in order to save lives \nand ultimately bring the warring factions together with a view to seeking a \nsolution to the fratricidal conflict. At the end of the summit meeting, a \nDeclaration, Framework of Cooperation and Programme of Action was issued. This \n\nwas followed by the Horn of Africa Conference on Humanitarian Issues, held to \nformulate modalities for the effective implementation of the summit \nDeclaration. A resolution on the situation in Somalia was subsequently \nadopted which, inter alia, provided for a cease- fire among the warring \nfactions, the holding of immediate peace talks leading to national \nreconciliation and lasting political settlement in the country, and the \nunhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people in need. Most \nsignificantly, the summit meeting decided to establish a high-level Standing \nCommittee of the Horn of Africa on Somalia to coordinate ongoing efforts to \nbring about a peaceful resolution of the conflict. \nIn fulfilment of its mandate, the Committee convened an all-party \nmeeting on Somalia in Bahr-Dar, Ethiopia, in May 1992. At that meeting \nagreement was reached on the effective distribution of humanitarian assistance \nand on convening a national reconciliation conference. To follow up the \nimplementation of these two agreements, the Chairman and other members of the \nCommittee visited Somalia twice in May and August 1992 and held talks with \nleaders of various political organizations. The result of the mission has \nbeen generally satisfactory under the circumstances. The Committee is still \nactively seized of the crisis in Somalia in all its aspects. \nThe effort of the countries of the Horn of Africa is a practical \nmanifestation of the principle that regional conflicts should, as far as \npossible, be resolved by the countries of the area concerned. Although the \nsituation in Somalia has for some time been ignored and left on the sidelines, \nit is encouraging to note that the United Nations and donor Governments are \ngiving it the necessary attention it so rightly deserves. The international \neffort to distribute humanitarian assistance to those in need should be \nfurther intensified as a matter of top priority. \n\nThe efforts under way by the Governments of the Horn of Africa, the \nUnited Nations, the Organization of African Unity, and others, to bring about \nlasting peace in Somalia should henceforth be pursued in a coordinated \nmanner. We should all speak with one voice to the parties in the conflict. \nThe message they should get should be one, and only one: that they cannot \ncontinue with their callous disregard for the interests and welfare of the \npeople of Somalia; that the existence of Somalia as a nation should, first and \nforemost, be of paramount importance; that there is no way they can achieve \ntheir aims through war; and that they should be prepared to resolve their \ndifferences by peaceful means. \nIn this connection, it is sad to note that certain quarters are \nundermining the peaceful resolution of the crisis by supplying weapons to the \nwarring factions instead of relief assistance to the suffering people of \nSomalia, or dumping industrial toxic waste on Somali territory instead of \nproviding medicine to take care of the sick and wounded, and plundering the \nlivestock and marine resources of Somalia instead of providing critically \nneeded humanitarian assistance. We call on these quarters to desist from \nattempts to polarize the region of the Horn of Africa and instead work with us \nin partnership in our efforts to restore lasting peace and stability in \nSomalia. \n\nI should like now to turn to another issue of concern to us. We have \nbeen following closely the positive developments in South Africa. However, we \nstill have serious misgivings about the prospects for the peaceful \ntransformation of that country, as the system of apartheid remains in place. \nWe are deeply committed to the decisions and positions of the Organization of \nAfrican Unity (OAU) and of the United Nations decisions and positions that \nhave been emphasized repeatedly over the years as well as to the principled \nstand of the democratic forces in South Africa to end the apartheid system \nonce and for all and set in motion an irreversible process of change to a \nmultiracial and democratic political order in that country. \nThe current efforts to create the conditions necessary for the success of \npeaceful negotiation should be encouraged. In this connection, the recent \nagreement between the African National Congress and the Government to resume \nnegotiations is a positive development, as is the release of political \nprisoners. We look forward to the initiation of talks between all the \ndemocratic forces in South Africa and the Government, with a view to the \nestablishment of an interim Government to supervise the process of preparing a \nconstitutional order for a multiracial and democratic South Africa. \nLikewise, we are gravely concerned about the tragic situation in the \nformer Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This crisis, which \nis fast getting out of control, is a serious threat to international peace and \nsecurity. The continuing bloodshed should be brought to an end and a \npolitical solution acceptable to all parties should be found as soon as \npossible. In this respect, we hope that the conference currently being held \nin Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations and the European Community \nwill have concrete results. \n\nWe are also following the current peace process in the Middle East. \nDespite the international community's repeated efforts to broker peace, the \nsituation in the Middle East still hangs in the balance. Nevertheless, the \nprospects for peace in the area are better today than they have been for a \nlong time. We are therefore hopeful that the question of Palestine, which is \nat the core of the Middle East problem, will eventually be resolved in \naccordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions so that a just, \ndurable and comprehensive settlement for the region as a whole may be achieved. \nWe are gratified by the outcome of the efforts of the Conference on \nDisarmament with regard to chemical weapons. The draft treaty prohibiting the \nproduction, use, transfer and stockpiling of chemical weapons represents an \nimportant step in the global effort to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. \nWe derive special satisfaction from the success of nearly 25 years of effort \nin the disarmament process and from Ethiopia's contribution as a member of the \nConference on Disarmament. In view of current trends towards democracy and \nrespect for human rights, there is a need for the disarmament negotiations to \ninclude conventional weapons. It should be emphasized that the \\\"peace \ndividend\\\" from disarmament efforts should be channelled into fighting the \nproblems of poverty, disease and backwardness in developing countries. \nIt goes without saying that the opportunities created in the past few \nyears to secure a more just and stable international order cannot bear fruit \nunless there is a parallel effort, deployed with increased vigour, to bring \nabout positive change in international economic relations. In this regard, \nmuch more is expected from the United Nations. The United Nations Conference \non Environment and Development, held in Rio, Brazil, in the middle of this \n\nyear demonstrated the great importance that the international community \nattaches to the pressing issues of the environment and development. \nEnvironmental protection and economic development bear on the future of \nmankind and affect every country. Therefore, our collective and individual \nstrategic planning activities should be aimed at solving these two global \nproblems, which call for effective international cooperation and mutual \nconsultation. The Rio Declaration and Agenda 21, as well as the two \nConventions, the Convention on climate change and the Convention on biological \ndiversity, lay a good foundation for enhanced international cooperation in \nthis area. However, there has yet to be sufficient focus on the problems of \nenvironmental pollution and ecological degradation and desertification. \nWe should like to share certain fundamental thoughts about the promotion \nand strengthening of democracy and democratic institutions in the context of \ncurrent international relations. Although democracy may have certain \nuniversal features, it is equally true that it has unique characteristics \npeculiar to a particular country's socio-political situation. In effect, \nthere cannot be a standard prescription for building democracy applicable to \nall societies and situations. Realization of this fact should restrain any \nattempt to prescribe uniform modalities and processes for the establishment of \ndemocracy and democratic institutions in different countries. \nIt is incumbent upon those who claim to stand for democracy to help newly \ndemocratizing peoples in their effort to consolidate that process, rather than \nconfine themselves to levelling criticism from the sidelines. If those forces \nthat advocate the strengthening of democracy fail to extend a helping hand to \nus in our unrelenting struggle to democratize our country, and instead simply \n \nwatch from a distance, any weakening or failure of the process of \ndemocratization will be attributable, at least in part, to their lack of \ncooperation. \nIt goes without saying that democracy is unthinkable without peace and \nstability, both internal and inter-State. Thus support by the forces of \ndemocracy for internal democratization processes would be a significant step \nforward in the resolution of internal conflicts. Inter-State conflicts can be \nsettled by democratizing inter-State relations and by scrupulously observing \nnorms of international law for inter-State relations. Although the parties to \nan inter-State dispute are primarily responsible for the peaceful resolution \nof their problems, the United Nations and the international community can, and \nshould, play a significant role in encouraging the peaceful settlement of \ndisputes. Sanctions could be applied as a last resort against a recalcitrant \nparty violating basic norms of inter-State relations once all other attempts \nto resolve disputes had been fully exhausted. \nIt is evident that democracy cannot be nurtured and sustained to grow \ninto a robust institution in countries characterized by economic deprivation \nand destitution. It is therefore imperative to democratize the international \neconomic order with the same vigour as we are deploying to democratize the \ninternational political order, if we are to strengthen democracy and \ndemocratic institutions. \n \nTo this end, developing countries, as a whole, should be given assistance to \nextricate themselves from the quagmire of poverty and underdevelopment. \nFailure by the developed countries to do so would mean exacerbating \ninternational tension and conflict in a different form, thereby adversely \naffecting all our efforts towards lasting peace and socio-economic \ndevelopment. In order to forestall such an eventuality, the United Nations \nand the international community should go beyond paying lip-service to \ndemocracy and development and provide meaningful economic assistance to \ndeveloping countries. Only then will we be able to say that international \npeace and development are guaranteed. \nAt this juncture, allow me to say a few words on developments in Ethiopia \nsince the establishment of the Transitional Government just over a year ago. \nThe demise of the repressive military regime in May 1991, the assumption \nof power by democratic forces and the endorsement of the Transitional Charter \nhave heralded a new chapter in the history of our country in which freedom, \nequal rights and self-determination of all peoples are the guiding principles \nof political, economic and social life. \nDuring this short period, while striving to ensure durable peace and \nstability after 30 years of bloody civil war, we have been able to lay the \ngroundwork for the creation of a new political order in a country where very \nlittle was known about democratic political and institutional machinery. \nThe Transitional Charter laid the basis for the establishment of a \nbroad-based administration incorporating a wide spectrum of political views, \nregional interests and national aspirations. The Council of Representatives, \nwhich is the highest legislative authority, consists of dozens of political \nand social organizations. Moreover, with a view to paving the way for the \nimplementation of the right to self-determination of all peoples in Ethiopia \n\nas enshrined in our Transitional Charter, we have taken the the first \nsignificant step by holding the first successful democratic, local and \nregional elections in the country's history in the presence of international \nobservers. An administration aimed at the consolidation of peace, stability, \ndemocracy, reconstruction and development in the country is now firmly in \nplace. \nThe protection of human rights is at the top of the agenda of the \nTransitional Government. For the first time, internationally recognized human \nrights and fundamental freedoms are fully guaranteed in Ethiopia. The \nTransitional Government is fully committed to upholding and protecting the \nrights of individuals and peoples based on the Universal Declaration of Human \nSights. To that end, we have initiated a process by which Ethiopia is to \naccede to the various international Covenants on human rights. \nThe Transitional Government of Ethiopia was established under \ncircumstances left by the country's former absolute dictatorship. It was a \nsituation where government accountability and responsibility were unknown, \ndemocratic culture and institutions were non-existent and where the country's \ninfrastructure was devastated by a long drawn-out war and recurrent drought \nand famine. \nAlthough the absence of a pluralistic political culture and institutional \nmachinery, as well as Ethiopia's only recent emergence from an extended period \nof intense civil war, has had a significant impact on democratization, in \ngeneral the process of democratization, decentralization and devolution of \npower in Ethiopia is right on track. However, this does not mean that the \ntransition from war to peace and from dictatorship to democracy is a smooth \none. Indeed, we chose to go through a transition process with a view to \n\nmaking it possible for us to lay down the necessary preconditions for a \nfull-fledged democratic order. We have made significant progress in all these \nareas during the past year of the transitional period. As part of the \ncontinuing process of democratization, the Council of Representatives has \nissued a proclamation on the setting up of a Constitution Drafting Commission, \nwhich is about to embark upon its important task as soon as organizational \nmatters are finalized. \nThe lesson we have drawn from the first year of the transitional period \nis that the establishment of democracy, dependable democratic institutions and \ndemocratic culture in a least developed country such as Ethiopia, with an \neconomy devastated by war and natural calamities, is an extremely arduous \nundertaking. However committed one may be or however strenuously one may \nstrive to achieve this goal, the process is bound to be very slow and full of \ndifficulties and complications. This is not a sign of despair but an \nacknowledgment of a concrete reality, which is a necessary first step to \nsuccess in any undertaking. \nUndaunted by the adverse internal situation at the outset, the \nTransitional Government took, and is taking bold and decisive steps to lay the \ngroundwork for the socio-economic transformation and democratization of the \ncountry. Thus, building democratic institutions, carrying out major economic \nreforms, instituting human rights and fundamental freedoms previously unknown \nin Ethiopia, such as freedom of assembly and association, freedom of \nexpression without censorship, encouraging the formation of numerous political \norganizations which are now exercising democratic rights without any \nhindrance: these are only the most salient achievements of the Transitional \nGovernment in the brief period of one year. As a result, we can assert with \n\nfull confidence that a new democratic culture and new democratic institutions \nare taking shape in our country today. \nThe unity of Ethiopia is being guaranteed on the basis of the unswerving \nrecognition and accommodation of diversity. Bold, and in many ways unique, \nsteps are again being taken to resolve the country's internal problems. \nAlthough problems may persist, our internal experiment aimed at their solution \nis already paying dividends. \nThe Eritrean question has also been resolved by the recognition of the \nright to self-determination of the Eritrean people. A referendum will be held \nearly next year in the presence of international observers, including the \nUnited Nations, to determine definitively the future status of Eritrea. \nThe decision to resolve the Eritrean question through a referendum has \nbeen subscribed to without reservation by both the Transitional Government of \nEthiopia and the Provisional Government of Eritrea. They have also declared \nin no uncertain terms that they will accept the results of the referendum. In \neffect, the decision is ours, and ours alone, and belongs in no way to any \nexternal force. We are confident that once the people of Eritrea have freely \ndecided their own future, no matter what the outcome of the referendum, the \nexisting and fast-developing economic, trade and social relations between the \ntwo peoples based on mutual trust and benefit will be the trail-blazer for \neconomic and social integration in the Horn of Africa subregion, which we hope \nwill materialize in the not-too-distant future. \n\nAs regards our economic situation, it has been repeatedly stated that \nEthiopia's economic potential contrasts sharply with its socio-economic \nunderdevelopment. In addition to drought, war and famine, the mismanagement \nof the national economy over the years by the former regime has militated \nagainst steady growth by the national economy. Under these rather difficult \ncircumstances, the transitional Government of Ethiopia has embarked upon a \ncomprehensive programme of new economic policy measures and institutional \nreform aimed at increasing the role of the private sector in the national \neconomy, and is rationalizing the public enterprises by improving their \nmanagement and generally allowing the promotion of market-economy principles \nand mechanisms. \nIt is imperative for us to exert the maximum effort to overcome the \nmultifaceted problems facing the country today and revitalize our national \neconomy. However, it is evident that such an undertaking calls for the \navailability of vast resources which cannot be mobilized at the national level \nalone. We therefore call on the international community to extend \nhumanitarian as well as development assistance to supplement our domestic \nefforts to cope with the emergency situation. The positive response and good \nwill demonstrated by various donor countries and international organizations \nover the past year in support of our economic recovery and reconstruction \nprogramme are encouraging. We are hopeful that that support will continue. \nThe changes under way in Ethiopia are having an impact on the country's \nexternal relations. Thus, for the first time in several decades, our \nrelations with all our neighbours in the Horn of Africa are being strengthened \non a qualitatively new level. Harmonious cooperation in all fields is fast \ndeveloping in our subregion. Our relations with other countries are also \ndeveloping on the some basis and are showing encouraging results. \n\nIn this new experiment of nation-building, Ethiopia has from the outset \nenjoyed the good will of many countries. Some have also extended material \nassistance. We wish to express our deep gratitude to all who have helped us \nin one way or another. Nevertheless, we have, regrettably, to admit the fact \nthat the assistance we have so far received, in particular material \nassistance, falls short of what is needed to make our effort at socio-economic \ndevelopment a success. We therefore call again upon all our friends to \nprovide us with meaningful assistance at this crucial phase in our history. \nIn conclusion, I should also like to reiterate Ethiopia's readiness to \nparticipate in all endeavours aimed at enhancing the role of our Organization \nin the maintenance of international peace and security and in assisting the \ndeveloping countries in their efforts to achieve a greater degree of economic \ndevelopment and self-reliance. I am hopeful that at the present session the \nAssembly will review and assess the world situation with a new perspective and \ntake a bold approach in order to meet the imperatives of the time. We must \nencourage and promote the positive trends already evident in international \nrelations, and at the same time guard against certain tendencies which \npatently carry within them the seed of new crises. \n"

        "file_text": " Permit me to begin. Sir, by taking this opportunity to convey to \nyou the congratulations of the delegation of the Dominican Republic on your \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh \nsession. Coming from a region that is taking on a new dimension in the \ninternational community, you will no doubt take a realistic view of the major \nchallenges posed by the world situation. You have first-hand experience of \nthe transformations taking place in the world. You are thus superbly \nqualified to guide with composure the deliberations of the Assembly. \nWe wish also to pay a warm tribute to the distinguished Saudi diplomat. \nHis Excellency Mr. Samir S. Shihabi, the outgoing President, for his skill and \nfor the fruitful results he achieved in his work. \nOn the new international landscape, with the dissolution of the Soviet \nUnion and the collapse of communism, the likelihood of a world war has \nvanished. But in many regions it remains possible that conflicts of an \nunpredictable nature could take place. \nHence the international community should remain vigilant, because though \nit is true that the danger of nuclear war has disappeared, it is no less true \nthat another menace is still with us, that of the continued quest, on the part \nof some countries, for technology for the production of nuclear weaponry, \nbehind the back of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Agency \ndeserves to be revitalized so that it will be able to work effectively in its \nefforts to prevent the proliferation of those terrible weapons. \nMankind is still burdened with problems arising out of the so-called \nconventional weapons, which are becoming more and more destructive, and what \nis needed is a degree of international control to limit them. That would make \navailable resources that, if properly used, could contribute to the \ndevelopment of the countries of the third world, which are already suffering \nbecause of heavy public debt and restrictive and protectionist measures \nimpeding international trade. \nThat is the most important challenge facing mankind, and this forum is \nthe right place to discuss those issues and create conditions and lay down \nguidelines to improve the lot of the two thirds of mankind that today finds \nitself threatened, not only by the economic crisis and the inequalities \nbetween North and South but also by the continued deterioration of the \nenvironment, which has been degraded by our own deliberate or unwitting use \nand abuse of it. \nI have expressed these thoughts because I come from a country, the \nDominican Republic, that is small in size, with an area of only 48,400 square \nkilometres and a population of 7,500,000, and we feel the ill effects of the \nproblems I have mentioned: burdensome external debt and declining trade \nbecause of restrictive and protectionist practices in the countries \nto which we export our agricultural products, whose prices are constantly \nfalling in world markets. Our adverse trade situation means that we are \nlosing significant resources that could be devoted to our development. \nNevertheless, over the last two years the Dominican economy has undergone \na successful process of adjustment that has made it possible to eliminate \ninflation, stabilize the national currency and bring the budgetary deficit \nunder control, all as a result of the adoption of a restrictive monetary \npolicy. This has helped to rebuild confidence in the production sectors. We \nbelieve that confidence in our country's business sector in the immediate \nfuture is indispensable for the achievement of an accelerated and sustained \nrecovery of the Dominican economy. Even more important in that regard is the \ncountry's ability in the short term to increase the foreign-exchange income \nthat it needs for its development, at a time when the export of raw materials \nis being replaced by service-sector products. \nThe Dominican Republic is now pursuing closer ties with the States \nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), with a view to bringing about \nour definitive entrance into CARICOM, on the basis of the great significance \nthat the Dominican Government attaches at this time to the achievement of a \nmore advantageous position vis-a-vis the European Economic Community as a \nState member of the Lome Convention, and the Dominican Republic is thus aiming \nto bring about greater openness in markets when it comes to selling its \nproducts internationally. \nThe achievements of the Dominican Republic, despite the grave economic \ncrisis suffered in recent years by Latin American and Caribbean countries, \nhave been the result of good government, presided over by \nDr. Joaquin Balaguer, a champion of democracy who gives us an example of what \na leader can do with the scant resources of a poor State when they are used \njudiciously to create conditions favourable to the people. Those achievements \ninclude, among other things, the construction of thousands of dwellings, \nhundreds of kilometres of highways and local roads, as well as schools and \nhospitals to provide vital social services to a constantly growing population. \nLet me now turn to the situation of our fraternal neighbour, Haiti. \nUnfortunately, throughout its existence as an independent country Haiti has \nendured a chronic situation of economic penury and the impoverishment of its \nsoil. This has forced its population to emigrate in waves across our borders \nand by sea in search of a better life. Today that situation is made even more \ntragic by the political crisis our Haitian brothers are going through. \nThe Dominican authorities and people are not indifferent to that \nsituation, which stems from the COUP d'etat that cut short \nPresident Aristide's experiment in democracy. \nThat development was condemned by the Organization of American States (OAS), \nwhich imposed a trade embargo to compel the current authorities to restore \nlegality. So far as the Dominican Government, presided over by \nMr. Joaquin Balaguer, is concerned, negotiation and dialogue within the \ncontext of absolute respect for the norms of international law are the most \nappropriate instruments in the quest for peace. Accordingly, we have been and \ncontinue to be providing disinterested support to all the parties to the \nconflict, in the hope that a solution that would resolve existing differences \ncan be found and that all institutions in the Republic of Haiti can again \nfunction normally. \nOur Government is deeply democratic, respects human rights and jealously \nguards its prerogative of guaranteeing the liberties of those inhabiting the \nRepublic. \nWe deplore the fragmentation of the former Yugoslavia as well as the \ntragedy that has befallen its people. Bereft of any guarantee of their \nrights, they are suffering the onslaught of a tragic fratricidal war that is \ntaking a heavy toll in human lives, particularly those of women and children, \nwho are subjected to constant air attacks and shellings and are deprived of \nthe food and medicine they need in order to subsist and treat their wounds and \nillnesses. We support the measures adopted by the United Nations with regard \nto the former Yugoslavia, measures that urge the parties to respect human \nrights and forcefully condemn the loathsome practice of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\". \nIt is a source of satisfaction to my delegation to see the communication \nthat is developing between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's \nRepublic of Korea, aimed at reuniting the Korean family. We regret, however, \nthat the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is persisting in its nuclear \nresearch with the aim of building nuclear weapons. \nBy the same token, we are optimistic about the situation developing among \nthe Arab peoples and the people of Israel, and we hope that this atmosphere of \ndialogue and negotiation will gain even greater momentum so that those \nconcerned may live in peace and harmony on their lands while moving towards a \nfuture of prosperity and progress. \nThough the cold war is a thing of the past, the danger and the tragedy of \nregional conflicts are still with us. Settling those conflicts requires \ninternational cooperation and the good will of the parties involved. However, \nanother serious threat to peace and to the well-being of our peoples still \nfaces the Americas and other parts of the world. We refer here to drug \ntrafficking and the destruction and social and moral harm which that scourge \nentails for all our communities. Our country supports every single measure \ntaken by the United Nations to cope with this serious problem, and calls for \ncontinued efforts to resolve and do away with this global scourge. \nIn this vein, the Dominican Republic has been taking forceful steps to \nconfront this evil, pursuing a dynamic drug-abuse-prevention drive and at the \nsame time launching major administrative, legislative and judicial \ninitiatives, not only against drug production, but also against the marketing \nof and the trafficking in drugs. Moreover, we have signed bilateral accords \nalong these lines with countries in our region and are in the final phase of \npreparations leading to our accession to the 1988 United Nations Convention \nAgainst Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. \nThe facts in terms of the state of the environment the world over are \ngrowing ever more alarming and must be a source of concern to, and a reason \nfor solidarity among, all States Members of the Organization. \nBecause of interdependence, damage done to the environment anywhere in \nthe world has an impact upon us all. Accordingly, international cooperation \nis necessary so that the States of the third world as well as the \nindustrialized nations can strive together to ensure that present and future \ngenerations will be able to enjoy a clean planet Earth, where life will be \neasier and happier. The Dominican Government, aware of these facts, has \nembarked on a process of reforesting our country and of conserving our natural \nresources. We support whatever steps the international community may take \nalong these lines, and, to demonstrate this, we are submitting to the Congress \nof our Republic, with a view to accession, the 1985 Vienna Convention for the \nProtection of the Ozone Layer, along with its Protocol on Substances that \nDeplete the Ozone Layer. \nAt this point, we should like to refer to the matter of racial \ndiscrimination, yet another major problem that still shocks the conscience of \nhumankind and continues to represent a major challenge to and violation of the \nmost elementary norms of human rights. \nIn this sense, our country has repeatedly, in this very forum, stated its \nrejection and repudiation of the apartheid system. Two years ago, right here, \nwe expressed satisfaction at the announcement by the President of South \nAfrica, Frederick de Klerk, of the recognition of the rights of other races in \nthat country to ensure that an end would be put to the system of apartheid. \nHowever, today racial tensions continue to escalate, and it is not possible to \ndiscern any rapid progress in the process of change in South Africa. The \npolicy of apartheid constitutes a crime against the conscience and the dignity \nof human beings and, therefore, it must be totally eliminated, so that a \ngenuine democracy, based on a multi-ethnic and pluralist system, may be \nestablished in South Africa. \nThe 1990s have begun with great frustration, but also with great hope \nfrustration because of the stagnation or backsliding in terms of social \nprogress, which the 1980s left as a legacy to the majority of developing \ncountries; hope because what is taking place is a real revolution in thinking, \nwhich makes imperative a review and a revision of proposals for the promotion \nof development. \nIn the economic arena, there is a constant search for ways and means of \nfostering the resumption of growth and modernization, as well as the more \nactive participation of those countries in the world economy. The data on the \nsocial condition of the majority of the world's population, and the \npossibility that those data may worsen as a result of economic measures that \nhave been adopted, have made it necessary to place the issue of the social \ndimension in the world at the heart of our debate. \nThe concept that social issues are a secondary matter, in contrast with \nthe primary process taking place in political forums, is a grave and extremely \ncostly mistake. In fact, if we do not deal with the social problems they turn \nvery quickly into political problems. The groan of hunger does more than \nbreak the silence; eventually it rends peace asunder. That is why the \nDominican Republic backs unreservedly the convening of a world summit for \nsocial development. We take the view that the concept of human security, \nwhich that proposal reflects, refers directly to the important - indeed, the \noverriding task facing all societies: the provision of food, clothing and \nhousing in quantities sufficient for all, while promoting social progress in \nharmony with the environment, and supporting those institutions that respond \nto the noblest aspirations that human beings cherish throughout their lives. \nEven if only in terms strictly of a cost-benefit analysis, it is cheaper to \ndeal with social problems now. Dealing with them later involves paying the \nprice of social upheaval. We literally cannot afford to ignore that truth. \nWe have great pleasure in taking advantage of this opportunity to \nreaffirm our resolute support for the International Research and Training \nInstitute for the Advancement of Women. The Dominican Republic is profoundly \ncommitted to the success of that body. \nToday, the United Nations constitutes that ecumenical, common forum where \nwe set forth our ideas as we seek solutions intended to bring about a better \nlife in the world in which we live a world free from discrimination and \nwaste. It is our desire to see the work of this Organization revitalized so \nthat it may be able more effectively to do its job and live up to its \nobligations. We give it our fullest support, and we express our faith and \nhope in universal peace and harmony. "

        "file_text": "It is a great honour \nfor me to address the Assembly at the commencement of its forty-seventh \nsession and in so doing to mark my country's first full year of membership of \nthe United Nations. For a people that has been ruled by others, the privilege \nof at last having an equal voice in the community of nations is uniquely \nfulfilling. With that voice I now express our gratitude for the openness and \ngenerosity that we encountered among the members and within the Secretariat as \nwe undertook our initial participation in the work of this great body. \nWe join other members in extending heartiest congratulations to \nMr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria on his election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its forty-seventh session. We wish also to thank his predecessor, \nMr. Shihabi, for his truly outstanding service as President of the General \nAssembly at its forty-sixth session. It is indeed fortunate for us and for \nfuture generations that in the most challenging of times this body has \navailable the leadership of individuals possessing the highest skills, energy, \ndedication and integrity. \n \nIn speaking of leadership, I must also, of course, mention with respect \nand appreciation our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. He has \nalready shown himself to be more than equal to the tremendous tasks associated \nwith his high office. He is assured of our prayers and our continuing support. \nLast year, the Federated States of Micronesia was privileged to be one of \nthe seven nations admitted to membership in the early days of the forty-sixth \nGeneral Assembly. Subsequently, within the forty-sixth General Assembly, \nhistory of a special kind was written when 13 other nations were admitted to \nmembership, and so I gladly extend the warm congratulations of my Government \nand people to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, \nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, San Marino, Slovenia, \nTajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan on their admission to the United \nNations. We are confident that in sharing with them this unique moment in \nhistory we will maintain a common bond that transcends geographic differences \nand gives added meaning to the concept of the brotherhood of man and nations. \nThe extensive and comprehensive agenda to be addressed by this session of \nthe Assembly is testimony to the ever-increasing interconnectedness of the \nworld's nations and their peoples. While we were a non-self-governing people, \nwe of the Federated States of Micronesia strived long and hard to achieve \nindependence, only to find that once we had it, full self-sufficiency is \nneither possible nor desirable in today's world. \nI had the honour, recently, to accompany my President, \nHis Excellency Mr. Bailey Olter, to the Earth Summit in Rio. That historic \nmeeting served, among other things, to deepen our understanding of the \npossibilities for global international cooperation on a basis of common, but \ndifferentiated responsibilities. \n\nAmong the many statements made at Rio by Heads of State, I was struck by \na most appropriate quotation from Sir Francis Bacon offered by the President \nof Iceland Her Excellency Madame Finnbogadottir. He said, \n\\\"No one makes a greater mistake than he who decides to do nothing because \nhe can do so little.\\\" \nThe President's suggestion of that thought in the context of the Earth Summit \nwas truly inspired, but if I may be permitted, it also gives guidance to my \ncountry over the entire spectrum of international cooperation. \nWe now realize that the Charter was meant to challenge every Member, \nlarge and small, developed and developing, to play its part in the \nimplementation of collective decisions to approach the question, \\\"What can I \ndo?\\\" not as a basis for inaction, but rather as a springboard for action \nwithin our means, however modest. Only by doing our rightful part do we earn \nthe right to hope that the world community will deal effectively with such \nuniversal problems as the environment, poverty and war. Only by doing our \nrightful part do we earn the right to expect the direct assistance of the \nworld community in dealing with those problems of social and economic \ndevelopment at home that are beyond our means to solve. \nThus, my Government wishes once again to thank all those in this body and \nthroughout the United Nations community for our kind reception here, and to \nrenew, now with broader understanding, our commitment to the Charter and our \nobligations thereunder. \nTo the modest extent that the Federated States of Micronesia has made its \npresence known within the past year, it has been mostly in the context of the \nenvironment, and particularly in the intergovernmental negotiating committee \n\nfor the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Since we are a \ncountry whose land is comprised of low-lying, small islands, our entire nation \nfinds itself in the front line, along with others similarly situated, who will \nbe the first to suffer the devastating consequences of unchecked global \nwarming. Rising sea levels would ultimately cover our islands, but long \nbefore that our protective coral reefs would bleach and fall victim to \nincreasing storm surges, our agricultural crops would be ruined and our \nfreshwater sources rendered unfit for human consumption. We are facing \nnothing less than the end of island civilizations that have endured for \nthousands of years. \nWe participated actively throughout all the sessions of the \nintergovernmental negotiating committee, and we had no hesitation in signing \nthe Framework Convention in Rio because the final text of the Convention goes \nfar to recognize the particular vulnerability of the low-lying island States \nto the consequences of human-induced climate change. The real effectiveness \nof the Convention, however, will be measured by its protocols yet to be \nnegotiated and in the operation of its conference of the parties and other \nmechanisms. \nThat statement is particularly applicable in the case of the Framework \nConvention because, as we stressed to the intergovernmental negotiating \ncommittee, the scientific evidence from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange shows a need for significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. \nEven the modest emissions cuts to which the industrialized countries found \nthemselves unwilling to commit themselves at Rio must immediately be replaced \nby more stringent goals set by the dictates of science rather than of politics. \n \nIt is ironic that the peoples of small island countries, in seemingly \nidyllic settings, distanced from the stresses of industrial societies, should \nbe the peoples with the greatest sense of urgency to get on with the business \nof protecting the planet. It is, nevertheless, island people who are \nbeginning to suffer the effects of global warming; island people who are \nwitnessing the swift and disastrous alteration of ancient weather patterns; it \nis island people whose homelands will be the first victims of rising sea \nlevels. \nBut this sad reality does not mean that the rest of the world can afford \nto wait, for by the time the world witnesses the effects of global warming on \nthe islands it will be too late for the rest of the world then to take the \nnecessary steps to save itself. \nThus, we are encouraged by the adoption of the Framework Convention on \nClimate Change, but we look anxiously towards its prompt implementation and \npray that its operation will quickly lead to actions and restraints by the \nindustrial countries on the scale necessary in order to reach the Convention's \nobjective. That objective is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in \nthe atmosphere at levels which do not adversely affect the climate. \nStabilization at such levels cannot be achieved by half-hearted efforts. \nAs United States Senator Gore recently wrote in his book \\\"Earth in the \nBalance\\\", \n\\\"The tide of this battle will turn only when the majority of people in \nthe world become sufficiently aroused by a shared sense of urgent danger \nto join an all-out effort.\\\" \n\nLet us earnestly hope that the signing of the Framework Convention by \n155 countries at the Earth Summit was evidence of such a shared sense, and \nsignalled the beginning of an all-out effort. \nThe President of the Federated States of Micronesia also joined most of \nthe other Heads of State at Rio in signing the Convention on Biological \nDiversity. We accept our State responsibility for conserving the biodiversity \nof our islands and waters, and for using those resources in a sustainable \nmanner. \nWe welcome the reference in the Convention to the precautionary principle \nwith regard to applying measures to avoid or minimize threats to \nbiodiversity. We are reassured by the specific recognition in the Convention \nthat small island States will need new and additional financial resources and \nappropriate access to relevant technologies in meeting their obligations. We \nlook forward to an early convening of the conference of the parties. \n \nAgenda 21, in both letter and spirit, at last brings into focus the \nconcerns of the developed and the developing world for securing an \nenvironmentally sustainable future. I believe that in a world no longer \npreoccupied with the super-Power conflict. Agenda 21 will come to be seen as \nthe single most important social instrument ever negotiated. Of course, in \nlegal effect it is only a guide, and despite its length it is only a \nframework. But its future impact on the domestic and foreign policies of \nevery nation is certain to be pervasive. \nThe establishment of the commission on sustainable development is a \nlandmark achievement of the United Nations Conference on Environment and \nDevelopment, and with it we see realistic hopes for turning Agenda 21 into \nactions. We strongly urge that the commission be situated in New York. \nDeveloping countries must participate significantly in the work of the \ncommission, and in our case, being a small Government with limited financial \nresources, we are far better able to attend activities at United Nations \nHeadquarters than anywhere else. \nAs a Pacific island country, we ascribe particular importance to \nchapter 17 of Agenda 21, which addresses the protection of the oceans. This \nis a subject many would have put aside, feeling that the oceans are so vast \nand our knowledge of them so limited that we are better off concentrating on \nperfecting land sciences. But it appears mankind is slowly realizing that \nhuman activities on the planet can significantly affect our oceans and bring \nabout disastrous consequences for our food supplies and even our weather. \n \nThus, we strongly support the call in Agenda 21 for conferences to exchange \nexperience on coastal-zone management and on the sustainable development of \nsmall island States, and we hope that they will take place on schedule. \nChapter 17 also addresses constructively the need for intergovernmental \ncooperation to control indiscriminate and harmful practices in harvesting sea \nresources. While we welcome the approaching total ban on drift nets, which \nhave been accurately called \\\"curtains of death\\\", much needs to be done with \nreference to the high seas, and straddling fish stocks and highly migratory \nspecies of fish, in order to reverse already notable trends towards the \ndisappearance of species that were once thought inexhaustible. We support the \ncall for a conference on those topics. \nChapter 18 of Agenda 21 recognizes the pressing need for improved climate \nforecasting, in the context of freshwater resources for human survival. The \nFederated States of Micronesia, along with many other island States in the \nmiddle of great oceans, has suffered repeatedly in recent years from droughts \nbrought on by little-understood climate mechanisms. In addition. Pacific \nisland States are already suffering widespread damage caused by tropical \nstorms of increasing frequency, range and intensity, which we have little or \nno capacity to predict. This fact was stressed by the South Pacific Forum \ncountries at the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, which responded \nby adopting resolution 46/234, calling for relief measures that include \nimproved forecasting capabilities. We should like to reiterate our deep \ngratitude to the many sponsors of the resolution and to the Assembly as a \nwhole for adopting it. \n \nOur deep concern for the oceans and their resources also causes us to \nfocus very closely on the provisions of chapters 19 through 22 of Agenda 21, \nwhich deal with the management of toxic chemicals, hazardous wastes, solid \nwastes and sewage and radioactive wastes. In his address to the Rio \nConference, President Olter of the Federated States of Micronesia expressed \nthe hope of overcoming the attitude of developed countries \\\"that the Pacific \nIsland region is a great, unpopulated void\\\" offering opportunities \n\\\"for convenient disposal of toxic, radioactive or otherwise harmful \nwastes, and for the conduct of any dangerous or obnoxious activity that \ncannot for reasons of public safety be carried out on home territory\\\". \nWe maintain high expectations that what President Olter called the \\\"world's \nemerging sense of environmental ethics\\\" will prevail over past attitudes. \nThere are already some good signs, notable among which is the decision by \nFrance to suspend nuclear-weapon testing in the South Pacific. We applaud \nFrance for taking that initiative and pray that the ugly history of nuclear \nexperimentation in the Pacific region has reached a permanent end. But \nrealistically, that cannot be assured so long as nations continue to \nmanufacture, stockpile and threaten to use weapons of mass destruction. Thus, \neven our small islands have a large stake in the continued progress of \nnuclear, chemical and biological disarmament, and we look forward to \nsupporting the implementation and extension of comprehensive treaties on these \nsubjects. \nThe Federated States of Micronesia especially welcomes the recent \nconclusion of negotiations on a chemical-weapon convention and is pleased to \n \nbe one of the original sponsors of the draft resolution to be considered at \nthe forty-seventh session of the General Assembly endorsing the convention. \nMy Government wants to express its gratitude and congratulations to those \nesteemed nations that have successfully negotiated that long-awaited \nconvention and calls on the Assembly to adopt the draft resolution. I wish to \nrecognize with appreciation the active role that Australia, from our region, \ntook in negotiating the chemical-weapon convention and for its outstanding \ncontribution to the global movement towards arms control and disarmament. \nUnfortunately, the forsaking of nuclear, chemical and biological weaponry \nserves to intensify the already serious problems associated with the movement \nand disposal of wastes. Large stocks of chemical weapons must be eliminated, \nbut uncertainties surrounding the technology for their disposal result in \npressures on less powerful and more remote peoples, such as Pacific islanders, \nto bear the associated risks. Frightening quantities of weapon-grade \nPlutonium must either be safely stored or utilized in questionable enterprises \nthat involve hazardous and secretive shipments through the waters of maritime \nnations. \nUp to this point the efforts of the world's nations to deal with these \nproblems have produced a patchwork of conventions some implemented, some \nnot most of which are of limited effectiveness because of technicalities and \npolitical self-interest. Worthwhile instruments such as the London Dumping \nConvention need to be strengthened on an accelerated basis. Vital \narrangements such as the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary \nMovements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal need to be implemented. The \nrole of the International Atomic Energy Agency with regard to safeguards must \nbe brought up to the pace of current events. \n\nBut even if all these things are done, dangers and risks will continue to \nbe imposed upon the poorer, less powerful and more remote peoples of the world \nunless the following principle is universally respected: the nation from \nwhich the material originates bears the complete responsibility for the cost \nand safety of its storage, shipment and disposal; that nation should \nadequately inform other nations potentially affected and should not utilize \nthe global commons in any action related thereto over their objection. \nI am aware of the implications of that statement, both politically and in \nterms of international law, but unless the spirit it expresses can enter our \ninternational conscience and influence the behavior of nations, I fear that \nthe passing threat of wartime holocaust will be replaced by an even less \nrestrained and in some ways equally horrifying danger. \n\nThe roads towards so many of the worthy goals to be sought by the \nAssembly, whether related to economics, the environment, development, human \nrights or international security, are haunted by the spectre of poverty. \nPoverty causes much environmental degradation. Poverty makes human rights \nirrelevant to many people of our planet, and tempts others to exploitation. \nPoverty contributes to destabilization of political institutions and endangers \nthe world. \nNo matter how dedicated are the efforts made by governments towards \nsustainable development and lasting international peace, and no matter how \nmassively those efforts might be funded, I fear that a single factor fuelling \nthe engine of poverty could render all the expenditures of resources \nineffective. I am referring to exploding and uncontrolled population growth. \nMembers are familiar with the statistics, past, present and projected. They \nare particularly disturbing in that the greatest rate of growth occurs in the \nmost poverty-stricken segments of the population. Clearly, this is one of the \nmost sensitive and difficult problems to deal with in a multilateral setting, \nand I respect the diversity of views on the subject. For that reason, I \nrespect its treatment in Agenda 21, knowing that many preferred stronger and \ndirect statements. Nevertheless, we hope that the mechanisms of Agenda 21 \nwill help to influence the developed countries to increase funding for \npopulation-related activities. We also look forward to the International \nConference on Population and Development to be held in Cairo in 1994. \nWith regard to the protection of human rights, the Federated States of \nMicronesia is pleased to associate itself with the exemplary efforts made by \nthe United States of America and other like-minded nations for the \n\nimplementation of the standards for the protection of human rights as set \nforth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In so doing, the \nFederated States of Micronesia joins in the condemnation of abuses of human \nrights by members of the international community. They insult our sense of \ncommon decency and the values we attach to human life - the very values \ngovernments are established to protect. \nHardly a speaker in this debate has failed to voice support for the \nhistoric efforts being made by the United Nations to reorganize and reorient \nitself so as to cope with its emerging roles in advancing the cause of \nmankind. We are no exception, and in our judgement the Secretary-General has \nso far provided wise leadership along a most difficult path. \nOne of the most challenging current problems is to determine the fairest \nand most effective means of meeting the costs associated with the \nOrganization's expanded role in the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity. We are all aware that these costs have virtually skyrocketed over \nthe past years, and the question of their proper allocation, we would suggest, \nis more complex than the simple formulas that served the purpose in former \ntimes. It is a question, naturally, involving the limits of the resources of \nsmall islands, but in our case it also involves predictability. We are \ndetermined to meet all our obligations under the Charter, financial and \notherwise, but the need for us to budget strictly for developmental and other \nimmediate requirements leaves us little flexibility to meet unforeseen demands \nof substantial proportions. \n\nWe look forward, during this session, to participating in the exploration \nof ways and means to devise the fairest and most effective system for \nfinancing the role of this body in the new world order. We also look forward \nwith confidence to the enhancement of this role as the age of multilateral \ncooperation truly dawns and the interdependence of all peoples of the world is \nseen to be the overshadowing practical reality of the future. \n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure, Sir, to \ncongratulate you on your election to the high office of President of the \nGeneral Assembly. We are happy to have a distinguished leader from a \nneighbouring country at the helm of the Assembly for the next 12 months. Our \nrelations with Bulgaria are excellent, and we are very glad to have supported \nyour candidacy. \nThe forty-sixth session of the General Assembly was remarkable and \neventful in a number of ways. Ambassador Samir Shihabi, the President at the \nlast session, deserves a special tribute for his distinctive contribution to \nthe efforts to enhance the stature of this universal forum. The competence \nand wisdom he displayed in guiding our work have justified the confidence we \nplaced in him. \n\nWe are fortunate that, in the person of Mr. Boutros-Ghali, the United \nNations has found the experience and wisdom to which it can entrust itself for \nguidance to success. My Government is confident that this distinguished \nstatesman from Africa, who is the product of the ancient and glorious \ncivilization of Egypt, will provide the right mix of continuity and change in \nthe renewal and restructuring of this world body. We wish our new \nSecretary-General success, and pledge him our support. \n \nMy delegation welcomes and salutes the 13 new Members of our \nOrganization. We take special pride in the fact that Turkey enjoys ties of \nkinship, language and culture with some of them. They will surely enrich and \nstrengthen our global family. \nIn the past few years we have witnessed one of the great turning-points \nof history. The cold war has come to an end. The international landscape, \ncharacterized for so long by ideological confrontation and nuclear stalemate, \nhas undergone a fundamental change. The bitter East-West rivalries that \ndominated every aspect of international affairs are finally behind us. These \nmomentous developments have made it possible to settle a number of conflicts \nwhich were a direct result of the cold war. From Africa to Asia to Latin \nAmerica, people have been able to lay aside ideological disputes and get on \nwith the business of reconciliation and peacemaking. The United Nations may \nrightly take pride for having played an important part in bringing together \nformer ideological adversaries and brokering agreements. It has demonstrated \nhow effective it can be by playing a leading role in the liberation of Kuwait, \nshowing that it can function as its founders intended nearly half a century \nago. \nWe were at last able to look forward to a world liberated from the awful \nthreat of nuclear destruction, with nations enjoying the fruits of commerce \nand industry in peace, security, freedom and democracy. However, it now \nappears that we were all perhaps carried too far by the new wave of optimism. \nFrom the Balkans and the Black Sea basin to the Transcaucasus, and from \nAfghanistan to Somalia, there have emerged new conflicts pitting nations and \nethnic communities against one another. Now peace and security are threatened \nby destruction and economic ruin, compounded by the horrors of \\\"ethnic \ncleansing\\\" and mass starvation. \n\nThe most severe challenge to the new order has been posed by the series \nof crises engulfing the former Yugoslavia. The international reaction to the \nsinister designs of the former Yugoslav army in Croatia last year was not \nforceful enough to deter the aggressors at that time. \nToday the bitter consequences of our inadequate response are being \nharvested throughout the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose \nsovereignty and territorial integrity have been violated in defiance of \ninternational law and the Charter of the United Nations. \nWhile the international community has condemned Serbian aggression and \nthe abhorrent practice of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" and demanded an immediate end to \nall violations of international humanitarian law, the suffering in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina goes on. People are still getting killed. Mandatory resolutions \nof the Security Council are yet to be fully implemented. Hundreds of \nthousands of Bosnian refugees face an uncertain future away from their homes. \nThose surviving in the ruins of once-flourishing cities and towns are \nthreatened by starvation and disease. As winter approaches, the need to \nprovide security and shelter to the population becomes ever more pressing. I \nhave myself had a chance to glimpse the suffering in Sarajevo. \nIn addition to our international responsibility and obligations as a \nmember of the world community, the historical and cultural bonds which my \ncountry shares with the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the presence in \nTurkey of a large number of citizens of Bosnian descent place us in a special \nrelationship to the fate of this country. \nAt a time when Bosnia and Herzegovina are being carved up by the \naggressors, priority has been given to the provision of humanitarian \nassistance. Therefore, while supporting other efforts to reach a peaceful \n \nsettlement, we have also put forward an action plan that consists of a set of \nconcrete and effective measures designed to stop the fighting in that \ncountry. We fear that further continuation of the Bosnian conflict could lead \nto greater dangers. We remain prepared to assist any concerted international \naction to bring about an end to the Bosnian tragedy. \nOn Iraq, we remain concerned two years after the Gulf crisis. Baghdad \nhas yet to demonstrate that it truly wishes to take its rightful place in the \ninternational community. The Iraqi Government should comply fully with the \nrelevant Security Council resolutions. My Government will be the first to \nwelcome a return to normality and the restoration of normal relations between \nIraq and its neighbours. \nFrom this rostrum Turkey has on many occasions expressed its consistent \nstand on the question of Palestine. Today, I wish to reaffirm our support for \nthe negotiating process on the Middle East conflict launched in Madrid in \nOctober 1991. This is a very important opportunity for peace, and we call on \nall the parties to seize it to arrive at a comprehensive and lasting \nsettlement on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and \n338 (1973). \nAs a neighbouring country, Turkey follows very closely the developments \nin the Caucasus. In this region, the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan \nis a source of deep concern for us because of its implications for peace and \nsecurity in the whole area. Turkey holds the view that in this region there \ncan be no place for adventurism and reckless behaviour. Armenia should \ndisengage from Nagorno-Karabakh and withdraw its forces from Azerbaijani \nterritories. We urge the parties to achieve a negotiated political solution \non the basis of respect for the inviolability of international borders, for \n\nminority rights and for the principles of the United Nations Charter and \nrelevant Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) obligations \nand commitments. We shall continue to work for peace in this region. \nIn the same spirit, we look forward to further progress in establishing \ndemocracy and restoring peaceful conditions in our neighbour and friend, \nGeorgia. \nIn Afghanistan, we had hoped that all would put aside their differences \nand start the process of reconciliation. However, we have been greatly \ndismayed by the recent eruption of fighting in Kabul. Turkey calls on all \nsides in Afghanistan to put an end to this fratricide and to start working for \npeace, so that the reconstruction and rehabilitation of this devastated \ncountry may begin and millions of Afghan refugees may finally return to their \nhomes. \nIn South Africa, we fully support the democratization process, which \nshould lead to a complete dismantling of apartheid and to the creation of a \nnew non-racial society in that country, based on due respect for the human \nrights of all South Africans. \nThe search for a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question continues. \nThe proximity talks which started on 18 June within the framework of the \nSecretary-General's good offices mission have registered some progress and \nresulted in the beginning of face-to-face talks between the leaders of the two \ncommunities. \n\nThis positive turn in the negotiating process has been achieved in great \npart owing to the constructive contribution of President Denktas. However, \nmuch remains to be done before we can reach our objective. \nIt is our sincere hope that prior to the resumption of the direct talks \non 26 October between the leaders of the two communities, sufficient ground \nwill be covered so that an early completion of the work on the set of ideas \nwill be possible. Once that stage is reached, Turkey stands ready to \nparticipate in the four-party conference to conclude an overall framework \nagreement. \nWe are gratified to note that in our day democratic pluralism, the rule \nof law, free and fair elections and respect for human rights have finally \nbecome the universally accepted attributes of a modern State. The best \nguarantee of respect for human rights is the existence of a democratic form of \ngovernment. In other words, democracy and human rights are inseparable. \nWe welcome the progress of democracy in all regions of the world. We \nexpect the United Nations to play a more active role in the strengthening of \ndemocratic institutions. We regard the ever-growing number of requests being \nreceived at the United Nations to assist in the holding of elections as a very \nencouraging development. \nIn the field of human rights, no country can claim to have attained \nperfection. All countries experience violations of human rights, and all \nmust, whatever their records may be, strive to improve their performance in \nthis area. \nIn Turkey our human-rights legislation and practices are kept under \nconstant review in order to eliminate abuses and rectify shortcomings. As a \nparty to all of the European instruments and control mechanisms aimed at \n\nprotecting human rights, as well as to the Convention against Torture and \nOther Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, our objective is to \nguarantee everyone the fullest enjoyment of human rights and to prevent any \nviolations or malpractices. We have made important strides in Turkey, and we \nare resolved to maintain this course. \nOn a broader plane, we are concerned with the growing incidence of \nxenophobia and new forms of racism that increasingly threaten the very \nexistence of migrant communities in Europe. Turkey is directly affected by \nthis negation of human values, since there are more than 2 million Turkish \ncitizens living in European countries, either as migrant workers or as their \ndependents. Like all individuals, these people too are entitled to enjoy \nsecurity of person and protection by the State against random violence, \nthreats or intimidation. We urge the host countries to ensure the protection \nof these individuals, to see to it that their human rights are duly respected, \nand effectively to prevent and punish violence and racist crimes against \nthem. All manifestations of xenophobia and discrimination must be curbed if \ntolerance and mutual understanding are to put down deep and lasting roots. \nNon-governmental organizations should spend more time and energy in monitoring \nviolations of the human rights of migrant communities. \nMy delegation would like to draw the attention of the General Assembly to \nthe widespread phenomenon of subversive violence carried out by terrorist \ngroups. Such violence constitutes a most serious infringement of human rights \nand fundamental freedoms, including the basic right to life. It aims at \nnothing less than the destruction of democracy. This is a crucial fact which \nwe must never forget. We think the time has come for the relevant United \nNations bodies, the Rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights, and the \n\nnon-governmental organizations to address this question of terrorist violence \nas a matter of priority. \nHaving experienced rapid social change and urbanization, Turkey today \nseeks to improve the quality of life of its population, to ensure equal \nadvancement opportunities for all and to promote both individual initiative \nand community solidarity. We are focusing on protecting vulnerable groups so \nthat they can play a productive role in society. In other words, Turkey \nstrives to achieve economic growth with a human and social dimension. \nMy Government believes that social problems affecting the international \ncommunity will be increasingly difficult and costly to overcome if concerted \naction is not taken promptly. Turkey attaches great importance to \ninternational efforts directed at easing social problems and tensions and \nsupports the convening of a world summit for social development. The \nGovernment of Chile should be commended for its imaginative initiative in this \ndirection. \nI should now like to turn to international economic issues. The \npolitical developments in Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Union, the \naftermath of the Gulf crisis and the protracted recession in the \nindustrialized countries have had negative effects on the world economy. The \nWorld Economic Survey reports that for the first time since the First World \nWar the global economy has lot grown. The events of the past year have \ncontinued to obstruct and render fruitless the efforts of the developing \ncountries to restructure their economies. \nWith the economic policies of all countries converging as never before, \nthe time has come to launch a concerted effort to create an international \neconomic environment more congenial to growth and sustained development. \n\nCountries with economies in transition are continuing their efforts to ensure \nintegration into the world economy. The major difficulties of the developing \ncountries are well known. \nWe regret that the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations has not yet been \nconcluded. This raises fears of protectionism. Since trade is a major \nvehicle for developing countries to break free of the burden of foreign debt \nand pursue their development efforts, the necessary political will must be \ndisplayed for these negotiations to be concluded successfully. \nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development was a major \nstep towards broadening the scope of economic development in a sustainable \nmanner. The Conference accelerated the universal push towards global \nsustainable development. Turkey believes that this momentum is now \nirreversible. We must look beyond the Conference and devise policies that \nwould help to perpetuate and strengthen this momentum. \nTurkey holds the view that a good way to work towards the objectives of \npeace, political and social stability as well as economic development is \nthrough regional cooperation. The political changes of the past few years \nhave broadened the opportunities for such cooperation. In full awareness of \nthis promising trend, Turkey has taken the initiative of launching a \ncomprehensive scheme for expanded cooperation between the countries of the \nBlack Sea region. The aim of this regional cooperation is to ensure that the \nBlack Sea becomes an area of peace, stability and prosperity in which regional \ncooperation can be used as a tool to accelerate the integration of the \nparticipating States into the global economy. \n\nAt the high-level segment of the Economic and Social Council last \nJuly, there was a focused discussion on restructuring the economic system \nof the United Nations. The economic and social structure of the United \nNations needs to be developed in a way that will enable it better to \nrespond to the growing challenges of our changing world. \nWith the addition of new Members, the question of the distribution of \nseats in United Nations bodies to geographical regions comes up for \nconsideration. It would be desirable also to consider whether the current \ngeographical groupings conform to our present-day needs. We know that the \nartificial division of Europe between East and West in the United Nations \nis the result of ideological differences which have ceased to exist. The \nquestion of merging the Group of Western European and Other States with \nthe Eastern European Group should be given active consideration. \nThe challenges before the United Nations are as great as ever. \nDespite the ending of the cold war, conflicts rage on in many parts of the \nworld and threaten to proliferate. Economic problems persist, made worse \nby a recession which will not go away. The humanitarian problems \nconfronting the international community have never been more daunting. \nThere continue to be massive violations of human rights in many parts of \nthe world, while the environment raises problems which we must solve if we \nare to survive on this planet. \nGreat as these challenges are, we have in the United Nations a \ncomprehensive framework within which we can operate and address mankind's \nproblems. The end of ideological conflicts makes this possible. The \nrestructuring carried out in the Secretariat under the leadership of our \nnewly elected Secretary-General is a good beginning in strengthening our \n\nnewly elected Secretary-General is a good beginning in strengthening our \nOrganization. There is a new spirit in the Security Council and in the \nEconomic and Social Council. The General Assembly has never been more \nrepresentative. The report of the Secretary-General entitled \\\"An Agenda for \nPeace\\\" (A/47/277) provides, in a timely manner, the intellectual foundation \nfor our future activities. The United Nations must not only set the tone and \nprovide political guidance to regional organizations in their efforts to \nsecure peace, but must also be prepared to assume its leadership role. It \nmust not fail to live up to its responsibilities under the Charter. The \nconditions are right for the great challenges to be met successfully. For the \nUnited Nations to pass the test, everything depends on the Members who must \nact in concert and with courage. My delegation undertakes to work with other \ndelegations in a spirit of cooperation and compromise so that our Organization \nmay live up to its high promise and serve mankind at this crucial time. \n"

        "file_text": "On \nbehalf of the delegation of Viet Nam, permit me at the outset to extend my \nwarmest congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev, Minister for \nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Bulgaria, on his election to the presidency \nof the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. I am sure Mr. Ganev's \nguidance of this session of the General Assembly will make it a success. We \nalso wish to express our appreciation for the outstanding contribution of His \nExcellency Mr. Samir S. Shihabi, President of the General Assembly at its \nforty-sixth session. We should also like to express our great appreciation of \nthe untiring and dynamic efforts of by His Excellency \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United Nations, in the \nnoble cause of peace, security and cooperation among nations. \nOn this occasion I cannot fail to convey warm greetings to the new \nMembers of our great family, the United Nations. \nSince the last session of the General Assembly, we have continued to \nwitness profound and far-reaching changes on a global scale. Those changes \nhave led to the disintegration of the international order that came into being \nafter the Second World War and that had existed for nearly half a century. \nThe new world situation opens up new opportunities for but at the same time \npresents acute challenges to the peace, security and prosperity of each \nnation, as well as that of the international community as a whole. With the \nthreat of annihilation by nuclear war receding and no longer hanging over the \npeoples of the world like the sword of Damocles, all nations might expect to \nlive in a world of peace, security, justice and prosperity, with egalitarian, \nmutually beneficial cooperation and the joint application of the miraculous \nachievements of the modern scientific and technological revolution to the \nbenefit of each country's and the whole world's development and well-being. \n\nRegrettably, the overall picture of today's world is far from being \npromising. We fully share the view expressed by the leaders of the \nnon-aligned countries in the Jakarta Message of 6 September 1992: \n\\\"The world today is still far from being a peaceful, just and secure \nplace. Simmering disputes, violent conflicts, aggression and foreign \noccupation, interference in the internal affairs of States, policies of \nhegemony and domination, ethnic strife, religious intolerance, new forms \nof racism and narrowly conceived nationalism are major and dangerous \nobstacles to harmonious coexistence among States.\\\" \nConcurrently with the settlement of some regional conflicts, we have \nwitnessed the outbreak of a series of new conflicts on several continents, \neven in the heart of Europe, a continent that should have enjoyed peace and \nstability thanks to the Helsinki mechanism of cooperation and security. In \npractice, policies of embargo, coercion and diktat are still being pursued by \nsome countries or groups of countries against others, thus hindering the \nlatter's development. \nThe global economic environment also contains elements of uncertainty. \nThe rate of economic growth has fallen to its lowest level in many years. The \nsymptoms of a new financial crisis, which could shake the international \nmonetary system, can be perceived. Tendencies towards greater protectionism \nand the deadlock in the Uruguay Round are only worsening the economic \nsituation of many countries, especially the developing countries. \nEven more worrisome is the inexorably widening gap between the developed \nindustrial countries and the developing countries. We cannot remain \nindifferent to the poverty and hunger suffered daily by millions of men and \n\nwomen across the continents. The famine in many countries, most severe in \nsome African countries like Somalia and the Sudan, is deeply moving and calls \nfor vast emergency assistance from other countries and from international \norganizations. \nIn view of the above-mentioned opportunities and challenges, it is \nimperative for States and nations to step up cooperation to promote their own \ndevelopment and at the same time to join forces in solving global problems and \nin contributing to the building of a new, sounder and better world order based \non truly democratic and egalitarian international relations, mutual respect \nand reciprocal benefit for the sake of the overall objectives of peace and \ndevelopment. \nIn this regard, we welcome the initial results of the United Nations \nConference on Environment and Development at Rio, especially Agenda 21, aiming \nat the goal of sustainable development. The immediate question, however, is \nthat of securing the financial and technological resources needed to implement \nAgenda 21. \nThe social dimension, including the concern for children, assumes the \nsame long-term significance as regards both sustainable development and the \nenvironment. As is shown in the report of the Secretary-General, in the \nfollow-up to the Plan of Action adopted by the World Summit for Children, much \nhas been done in the past two years, but our commitment and our action need to \nbe imbued with even greater universality. For its part, Viet Nam was the \nfirst country in Asia to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We \nhave finalized our national programme of action and have just submitted, \nwithin the specified time-frame, our first national report on the \nimplementation of the Convention. \n\nAgainst the backdrop of the evolving international situation, Asia and \nthe Pacific reflect fairly clearly the characteristics of today's world. \nWhile several nations have seized opportunities to achieve rapid development, \nnot a small number of others remain mired in a state of underdevelopment, \ndeprivation and poverty. Alongside the trend towards cooperation, some seeds \nof potential conflicts are being sown. \nWe are pleased to note that South-East Asia is now entering a new stage \nwith fine prospects for peace and prosperity. The erstwhile complicated \nbilateral relations have been and are being normalized and the trend towards \nregional cooperation and integration, in order to achieve stability and \ndevelopment, is gaining great momentum. Relations of good-neighbourliness, \nmutual trust and understanding are gradually being established in the region. \nThese are indeed historic developments in the international relations of \nSouth-East Asia, which had been a constant hotbed of war and tension for the \npast half century. However, as in many other areas in the world, there remain \nlatent factors of destabilization, factors that are a legacy of the past or \narise from recent events, especially those relating to territorial borders \neither on the land or on the sea, between the countries of South-East Asia and \nthose near to them. This is a cause of concern for countries within and \noutside the region because of the danger of destabilization in that important \npart of the world. \nIt is our view that global security is indivisible. This is true at the \nglobal as well as the regional level. Security can be achieved in South-East \nAsia only when security is assured for each country in the region, it being \n\nunderstood that such security is multifaceted: military, political and \neconomic. To that end, various positive initiatives and proposals have been \nput forward by countries in the region, such as the Zone of Peace, Freedom and \nNeutrality in South-East Asia (ZOPFAN), the Free Trade Area (AFTA) of the \nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the ASEAN Manila Declaration \nof 22 July 1992, Malaysia's East Asian Economic Grouping (EAEG), Indonesia's \nForum on Cooperation in the Eastern (South China) Sea, and the seven \nprinciples governing relations among the countries of South-East Asia set \nforth by the Lao People's Democratic Republic. These proposals and \ninitiatives have contributed, and are still contributing, to a large extent to \nthe strengthening of mutual trust and understanding among nations in the \nregion, thus fostering further regional cooperation. \nWith regard to the problems that emerged recently over the Eastern Sea, \nit is our view that they should be solved appropriately through peaceful \nnegotiations, without resort to force or the threat of force that is, on the \nbasis of fundamental principles acceptable to all the parties concerned; \notherwise, the situation may take a negative and complex turn. \nFor Viet Nam's part, while firmly resolved to defend our sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity, we advocate the settlement of all disputes through \ndialogue between the parties concerned, so as to achieve an appropriate \nsolution together. Pending such a solution, Viet Nam will exercise the utmost \nrestraint and refrain from any action that might adversely affect efforts \ntowards confidence-building and the relaxation of tension in the relations \namong countries of the region, and hopes that other parties concerned will do \nthe same. We are convinced that with good will on the part of all parties \n\nconcerned, an appropriate solution can be found to any dispute, no matter how \ncomplex it may be. In this spirit, we reiterate our full support for the four \nprinciples put forward in the ASEAN Declaration of 22 July 1992 to serve as a \nbasis for the settlement of disputes and to ensure security in the Eastern \nSea. These principles are as follows: First, all sovereignty and \njurisdictional issues pertaining to the Eastern (South China) Sea shall be \nresolved by peaceful means, without resort to force; secondly, all parties \nconcerned shall exercise restraint with a view to creating a positive climate \nfor the eventual resolution of all disputes; thirdly, the possibilities of \ncooperation in the Eastern Sea shall be explored without prejudicing the \nsovereignty and jurisdiction of countries having direct interests in the area; \nand, fourthly, the principles contained in the Treaty of Friendship and \nCooperation in South-East Asia shall be applied as the basis for establishing \na code of international conduct over the Eastern Sea. \nFruitful discussions in a spirit of constructive cooperation, based on \nequality and mutual respect between Viet Nam and, respectively, Malaysia, \nIndonesia and Thailand, on questions relating to the Eastern Sea, have proved \nto be the best way to settle problems in relations among countries of the \nregion. \nThe countries of the region and the international community support the \nimplementation of the Paris Agreements on Cambodia, with a view to building a \npeaceful, independent and neutral Cambodia, living in national harmony, \nenjoying friendly relations with all countries and contributing to regional \npeace and stability. However, we share the international community's concern \nthat the implementation of the Paris Agreements is being impeded and we call \n\nupon all the parties concerned to cooperate in order to ensure the strict \nand full implementation of these Agreements. For its part, as a signatory \nto the Paris Agreements, Viet Nam reaffirms its strict observance and full \nimplementation of the provisions concerning Viet Nam, as stipulated by the \nAgreements. At the same time, Viet Nam denounces the acts of ostracism \nand persecution against Vietnamese residents in Cambodia and categorically \nrejects the slanderous allegations against Viet Nam by those whose only \naim is to cover up their activities which undermine the Paris Agreements. \n\nThe internationalization of the world economy and the trend towards \neconomic restructuring require reform and resolute participation of national \neconomies, including that of Viet Nam, in the international division of \nlabour, economic cooperation and world trade. Over the last 5 years, thanks \nto the judicious policy pursued and the exceptional efforts exerted by the \nVietnamese people, the cause of reform and renewal in Vietnam has effectively \nbecome part of everyday life and brought about initial but very significant \nachievements in all spheres of social life. The energies of all economic \nsectors in our country have been released and multiplied. Together with the \nexpansion of cooperation with the outside world, such developments have \nbrought about visible changes in the economic and social make-up of the \ncountry which is thus poised to forge ahead. \nLife however always poses new demands. While carrying out the task of \neconomic reform as the centrepiece of our efforts we are at the same time \nstepping up political reform and renewal. These are the two facets of one \nsingle process which interact and stimulate each other. The political reform \nis aimed at extending the democratic freedoms of our citizens in all respects, \nrestructuring the political system and building a State governed by the rule \nof law, truly of the people, by the people and for the people. Our new \nConstitution, promulgated in April this year, is not only a concrete \nembodiment but also the institutionalization of this reform process. One of \nthe essential elements of this new Constitution is to ensure strict respect \nfor the fundamental rights of the citizen. Proceeding from the great \nprinciples enshrined in Viet Nam's 1945 Declaration of Independence, whereby \n\\\"all peoples of the world are born equal; every nation is entitled to the \n\nsame rights to life, happiness and freedom\\\", we hold the view that each State \nand each nation strives for the ideal of democracy and freedom in its own way, \ncreatively rather than through a stereotyped or dogmatic approach, and still \nless through the adoption of models imposed from outside. Each nation is \nentitled to the sacred right freely to choose its own socio-political system, \nto chart its own path of development and to tackle its own problems in \naccordance with its historical, cultural and social traditions. It is \nunacceptable for one nation to impose standards of democracy and human rights \nupon another nation, and it is all the more unacceptable for one nation to \nstand as judge over another nation. \nCarrying out its foreign policy of broad openness, diversification and \ngreater multilateral emphasis in its international relations, during recent \ntimes Viet Nam has strengthened and expanded its relations with many countries \nin the world on the bases of mutual respect for each other's independence, \nsovereignty and territorial integrity, of non-interference in each other's \ninternal affairs, and of equality and mutual benefit. We attach special \nimportance to improving and strengthening relations of friendship and \ncooperation with countries in our region and to making a positive contribution \ntowards a South-East Asia of peace, stability, cooperation and development. \nRelations between Viet Nam and the countries of the Association of South-East \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) have entered a completely new phase. Our country's \naccession to the Treaty on Amity and Cooperation in South-East Asia, signed at \nBali in 1976, and its becoming an observer in ASEAN constitute the foundation \nfor a qualitatively new development of the relations of friendship and \ncooperation between Viet Nam and the ASEAN countries. Relations between Viet \nNam and China have been normalized on the basis of the five principles of \n\npeaceful coexistence, in keeping with the aspiration and interests of the two \npeoples and with the trend towards peace, stability and development in the \nregion. We believe that these fundamental interests will help the two \ncountries settle in a satisfactory manner and through peaceful negotiations \noutstanding as well as newly emerging problems in their relations on the basis \nof respect for each other's independence, sovereignty and legitimate interests. \nOur foreign policy is geared to combining continuity and dynamism in our \nrelations with all countries, large and small. We are doing our utmost to \nconsolidate and renew traditional relations with friendly countries and with \ncountries members of the Non-Aligned Movement, and we continue to extend \nsolidarity and support to the cause of the Palestinian and South African \npeoples and to all other peoples struggling for peace, national independence, \ndemocracy and social progress. We continue to strengthen existing relations \nwith countries in various continents and at the same time enter into relations \nwith countries in regions with which we have had only rare contacts in the \npast, such as recently with countries in the South Pacific, the Gulf and Latin \nAmerica. \nThe normalization of relations between Viet Nam and the United States \nwill benefit not only the Vietnamese and the American peoples but also peace \nand stability in South East Asia. We have turned the page on past history and \nlook forward to the future. Proceeding from this spirit and from our \nhumanitarian policy, we have done whatever possible in cooperating effectively \nwith the United States to settle the question of Americans missing in action \nduring the Viet Nam war. Our constructive efforts and goodwill have been \nwelcomed by the American public and acknowledged by the United States \nAdministration. \n\nWe are of the view that today multilateralism, especially as embodied by \nthe United Nations, occupies an increasingly significant position. However, \nwe should define the appropriate degree of separation and correlation between \nthe multilateral dimension and the national dimension. It should be \nemphasized that isolationism is outmoded but national sovereignty forever \nremains a sacred value, which all countries, large and small, are determined \nto defend. \nWorld developments over the past year have rendered ever more imperative \nthe demand for the democratization of international life and inter-State \nrelations, including the democratization of multilateral forums, especially \nthe United Nations. In the new context, the composition of the Security \nCouncil and the balance between the Council, the General Assembly and the \nSecretary-General of the United Nations must reflect the realities of a world \nwhich has radically changed as compared with the time when the United Nations \nwas born, and even with only a few years ago. \n\nWe endorse the idea of re-examining and enlarging the composition of the \nSecurity Council, with due attention to developing countries, with a view to \nfully implementing the principle of equality between all Member States and \nensuring that the voice of the majority is duly heard in the process of making \ndecisions on issues of critical importance to the international community. \nOur world body must be revitalized so that it can really be an effective \nmultilateral tool for keeping and safeguarding peace, contributing to the \nsolution of global issues and especially for building a sounder and more \nequitable new world order that will be the fruit of our truly common endeavour. \nWithin its foreign policy of sovereign independence, peace, cooperation \nand openness, Vietnam will do its best to participate actively in the work of \nmultilateral institutions and forums, thereby to promote further its \nintegration into the international community and the world economy and to \ncontribute to shaping a sound and equitable new world order that really meets \nthe legitimate expectations of the community of nations. \n"

        "file_text": "For me it is a \ngreat pleasure and an agreeable duty to participate in the work of the General \nAssembly at its forty-seventh session. For almost half a century the United \nNations has been working to lead mankind to the more human condition of peace \nand international solidarity. \nAllow me to take this early opportunity to discharge the duty an honour \ngiven to me by Major Pierre Buyoya, President of the Republic of Burundi of \nconveying to Mr. Ganev, the President of the General Assembly at its current \nsession, a message of peace and solidarity, in keeping with the fundamental \npurposes set out in the Charter. Allow me also, on behalf of my delegation, \nmy Government and the people of Burundi, to join other representatives in \ncongratulating Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency. There is no doubt \nthat his distinguished qualities, together with his rich experience, will lead \nto the success that everyone expects of our deliberations. \nOur congratulations go also to the members of the General Committee, who, \nI am sure, will spare no effort to support the President in the discharge of \nhis responsibilities. \nAt the same time I express our very good wishes to Mr. Ganev's eminent \npredecessor as President, who conducted the work of the General Assembly at \nits forth-sixth session with remarkable competence. \nFurthermore, I should like to pay a very well deserved tribute to the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his determination to see \nthat peace and security in the world are preserved. \nThe Republic of Burundi warmly welcomes the countries that have just \njoined the family of the United Nations. \nMankind is going through a period of contrasts. Current events are \ncharacteristic of the transition from one era to another. Indeed, the world \ngives the impression that it is seeking a new balance, which, we hope, will \nenable men and women to live together more harmoniously. Whereas the ending \nof the cold war and the remarkable disarmament efforts have resulted in \nsignificant progress in the field of international security, bloody conflicts \ncontinue to tear the planet apart. \nWhile a series of events, of which everyone is aware, is persuading \npeoples to work together to achieve economic and even political integration, \nnations are being torn apart by very bloody fratricidal conflicts. One has \nonly to consider the extremely worrying situation in Somalia to realize that \nthe world is still a theatre for tragedies that one cannot bear to watch. \nIn recent years the winds of liberty have been blowing throughout the \nworld, and all nations have been rising up in a crusade for human rights and \nthe dignity of the human person, yet men and women continue to be deprived of \nelementary rights the right to life, the right to a homeland and the right \nto development. This is the case in South Africa, where apartheid, even in \nits death throes, continues to claim victims, and where people, here and \nthere, continue to be deprived of a homeland. \nWhile steady scientific progress is enabling mankind to master natural \nforces and is preparing him to subdue other planets, men and women continue to \nwallow in deprivation. This is especially true of the African continent, \nwhere ignorance, hunger and sickness still reign on a grand scale. The \npicture so eloquently presented by Abdou Diouf in his capacity as President of \nthe Organization of African Unity fully conveys the concerns of Africa and of \nAfricans, and we agree completely with what he said. \nAt the Rio Conference the international community took a major step in \nits awareness of the need to preserve the quality of the environment on Earth, \nwhich is our common home. Paradoxically, however, as we seek means of \nsubsistence we continue to destroy things that we need to enable us to live \nand breathe. This becomes more and more evident when we look at the intimate \nrelationship between the environment and development a relationship that the \nRio Conference very rightly set out for us. \nWe are living in an era of paradox. On one hand, it seems that the world \nhas been moving ahead at full speed in terms of peace and security, freedom, \nwell-being and progress, but, on the other hand, we are witnessing war, \npoverty, hunger and misery. In these conditions mankind has no chance of \nmaking progress. Thus the objectives set out in the Charter of the United \nNations are still relevant. \nIn this the last decade of the twentieth century we must show that we are \ndetermined to preserve international peace and security. We must also \ndemonstrate greater solidarity, as an injury to the little finger causes \nsuffering to the entire body. Like the illustrious founders of this \nOrganization, we must proclaim our faith in a better world and must turn the \nUnited Nations into an Organization capable of maintaining international peace \nand security and of ensuring justice and respect for human rights. \nMoreover, the Organization must be able, in accordance with its Charter, \nto promote social progress and better standards of life for all peoples of the \nworld. The Republic of Burundi therefore pays a tribute to all those who are \nstriving daily to maintain peace in the world and welcomes the signs of \nsolidarity whereby all peoples may be enabled to live life to the full, in \nkeeping with the aspirations and values that underlie the United Nations. \nIn that connection, the report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" submitted to the \nGeneral Assembly by the Secretary-General deserves the international \ncommunity's close attention. For its part, the Republic of Burundi reiterates \nits faith in the United Nations Charter and its commitment to work with the \ninternational community in achieving the triumph of its ideals. \nThe rostrum of the United Nations, which is provided to us each year, is \na special place for dialogue and exchanges of views that enable us better to \nunderstand one another and share our experiences. Allow me, therefore, \nbriefly to share with representatives the principal paths that my country has \ndecided to take in rebuilding and making its modest contribution to the \nrealization of the Organization's goals. \nIn the not-too-distant past my country went through some tragic \nexperiences caused by continuing divisive conflicts, essentially ethnic. They \nwere followed by tragedies that resulted in loss of human life and a large \nexodus of refugees seeking asylum in neighbouring countries and elsewhere in \nthe world. That situation had a serious effect on social relations. Rancour, \nmistrust and hatred took root in the hearts of brothers and sisters who should \nhave been living together in a single, age-old nation. \nIt was in this context an uneasy one, to say the least that on \n3 September 1987 the people of Burundi rose up to change the unhappy course of \ntheir history. Five years later, I am pleased to announce that Burundi is \nonce again a united nation. Indeed, with the proclamation of the Third \nRepublic, Burundi has turned the page and is now embarked upon the \nconstruction of a new society of peace, justice and social harmony. Under the \ndynamic and farsighted leadership of Major Pierre Buyoya, President of the \nRepublic, the people of Burundi are in the process of burying once and for all \nthe quarrels and divisions from which they have suffered for so long. To \nachieve that goal, the Government has based its actions on three fundamental \nfactors: national reconciliation, democratization and development. \nFirst, the people of Burundi set out to realize internal reconciliation. \nTo remove the divisions that had rent the fabric of Burundi society, the \npeople determined, with a supreme effort, to pull themselves together and \nexperience the forgiveness of national reconciliation. Witness to this is the \nproclamation of faith contained in the Charter of National Unity, in which \nBurundis, with historic conviction, stated: \n\\\"We are determined to break with the past and to embark upon a new era in \norder to build a more promising future free of hatred and mistrust.\\\" \nThe national reconciliation now achieved has been the result of a \ncomplete process. The first requirement was to engage in an examination of \nconscience, which inspired Burundis to join together and to tell themselves \nthe truth. That process began with the establishment of a National Commission \nmade up of citizens of all ethnic groups, all regions and all religious and \nsocio-professional sectors. The Commission's task was to diagnose the disease \nof division and then to propose appropriate cures. After seven months of \narduous work the Commission submitted a report setting forth an analysis of \nthe situation and proposals for a better future. \nHowever, as President Buyoya has so pertinently said, the construction \nand deepening of a people's unity cannot be accomplished by the President of \nthe Republic alone, nor by his Government. Therefore, based on the \nCommission's report, a national debate on the important question of national \nunity was organized among ill sectors of society. \nIn making such a thorough examination of a subject so long taboo, the \npeople of Burundi has discovered the virtues of dialogue and joint effort, \nelevated into a form of government. The national debate was crowned with the \ncreation of the Charter of National Unity, which was adopted with the support \nof more than 89 per cent of the population in a referendum held on \n5 February 1991. \nSince that time the Charter of National Unity has become the pre-eminent \npoint of reference for all of the nation's political life and a pact by which \nall Burundis have sealed an alliance to consolidate their regained unity. \nWith the Charter we, the people of Burundi have proclaimed our faith in \nlasting national unity and condemned and forever rejected all divisions of any \nkind. We have thus committed ourselves to uprooting from our society any \ntendency to violence, physical extermination and vengeance. \nMore positively, we have committed ourselves to rigorous respect for the \nethic of national unity. This is translated into respect for human life, the \npromotion of justice and the safeguarding and consolidation of peace and \nsecurity. \nIn parallel with that process, which was aimed principally at reconciling \nhearts and minds, the process of consolidating national unity has been marked \nby a series of specific measures undertaken with a concern to administer the \nState in keeping with the ethic of national unity. \nIn October 1988 the President of the Republic established a new \nGovernment called the Government of National Unity, whose composition reflects \nthe concern of high-level State authorities to bring all elements of society \ninto the management of public affairs. The Government has the political \nmission of stimulating a new spirit in all sectors of national life. At every \nlevel of society responsibilities have been entrusted to citizens from all \nwalks of life, without any discrimination whatsoever. In this undertaking the \nGovernment has given pride of place to other values cherished by the Third \nRepublic: equality of all citizens, the cult of excellence and total \ntransparency in the management of public affairs. \nWith national unity regained and national reconciliation an accomplished \nfact, we are able give all due attention to grappling with the thorny problem \nof refugees. Everyone agrees that the fact that there are so many millions of \nrefugees throughout the world is a result of internal or inter-State conflicts \nthat Governments have been powerless to resolve. Furthermore, the \ninternational community owes a big debt to the refugees, inasmuch as its \ninability to manage harmoniously has led to the violation of a basic human \nright, the inalienable right to live somewhere in one's homeland, with no risk \nof having no home. \nFortified by those convictions, and having laid the foundations for \ndomestic peace, the Government of the Republic of Burundi has undertaken a \nvast programme of voluntary repatriation for Burundi refugees. It feels that \nvoluntary repatriation is by far the best lasting solution to the refugee \nquestion. Thus, in carrying out this work of national reconciliation our \ncountry's highest bodies have offered those of our compatriots who have gone \ninto exile the opportunity to return freely to their country. In so doing, \nour ambition is to see that soon no Burundians will be living with the \ndegrading label of refugee. \nFrom this rostrum and before the entire international community, I should \nlike to repeat what Major Pierre Buyoya, President of the Republic, said, and \nsolemnly reiterate my Government's appeal to all refugees from Burundi, \nwherever they may be, to freely return to their homeland. We shall welcome \nthem with open arms. \nI am pleased to note at this point that the results already achieved in \nthis programme are extremely encouraging. \nIn 1988, following the unrest that disrupted peace and security in two of \nour communities, we succeeded in repatriating approximately 50,000 people who \nhad moved to neighbouring countries. Thanks to the assistance of the \ninternational community, we were able without difficulty to set them up again \non their own land, to build new homes for them and to help reintegrate them \ninto our production networks. \nIn that same spirit, my Government is continuing to welcome those of the \nrefugees who left their country some 20 years ago that freely choose to return. \nEven as we speak, more than 25,000 of them have already returned home, \nand others continue to arrive. \nThanks to national and international solidarity, those who were \nrepatriated have rejoined society in complete dignity. The Government has \nmade an inventory of all available lands that could accommodate them, and they \nare being given assistance that allows them to meet their needs until they can \nsubsist on the fruits of their own labour. In collaboration with local \nadministrative authorities, they are receiving all the help necessary to build \na decent home, and they even have health insurance so that they can easily \nobtain health care. Their children have been integrated into the school \nsystem, and those among the repatriated who have some training are receiving \nall the help needed to secure a position in the work force. \nI take this opportunity to thank the countries and the organizations that \nhave supported us in carrying out this programme, and we also appeal to the \ninternational community to continue to help us in this process, of which my \npeople are so proud. \nIn sealing this pact of national unity, the people of Burundi placed \nspecial emphasis on the absolute need to see to it that the management of the \nState is democratically assured. That is why, in keeping with the \nconsolidation of national unity, Burundi has undertaken to democratize our \ninstitutions. \nI would be remiss not to share with the Assembly information about the \nsteps that my country has taken. This was for us an original move, and we \nhave every reason to be satisfied with it. Indeed, in this process as well as \nin the one that led to national reconciliation, the Government has always been \ncareful to involve all segments of the population. Through frank and sincere \ndialogue with the people, the political class has always been honest and wise \nenough to put itself in the hands of the people, being convinced that no work \ncan last unless the citizens are involved, for in the final analysis they are \nthe ones who do the work and who benefit from all changes. \nThus, throughout all of last year the people were closely involved with \ndrawing up a new constitution, which was subsequently adopted by referendum on \n9 March 1992 by more than 90 per cent of the population. The new constitution \nestablishes a multiparty system and gives special attention to respect for \nfundamental human rights. \nIn this way, Burundi has put an end to 26 years of a single-party system \nand has restored order, serenity and national harmony. Since that time, the \nGovernment has worked to implement the guidelines contained in the \nconstitution. \nThe process of effectively implementing pluralism was accelerated in such \na way that today, seven political parties are already on the political scene. \nAppropriate legislation was also passed promptly to promote the right to free \nassociation and freedom of the press, which are indispensable foundations for \na vital multiparty system. \nIn terms of human rights, independent leagues have been established. In \nthis particular area, which is very dear to us, we have just established a \ncentre for the promotion of human rights whose mission is to instil into \nsociety, through teaching and various means of communication, the values that \nunderlie respect for human dignity. \nIn Burundi, the democratization of our institutions is therefore \nproceeding in this manner, and the Government is strongly determined to keep \nmoving forward. That is why, in keeping with the guidelines that the \nPresident has already laid down, the Government is planning to hold general \nelections in the early months of 1993. Once the constitution has clearly \ndefined the institutional structure that is to guide the country and the \ncompeting partners, that is, the political parties, are on the scene, we \nbelieve that it would be a reprehensible step backwards to prolong this period \nof transition indefinitely. \nOur intention is to give to a sovereign people the opportunity to speak, \nso that they can democratically elect the leaders of their choice. We do so \nin what we term the Burundi way, that is to say in complete openness, through \ndialogue and joint efforts. \nI should not like to take advantage of your kind attention. Sir. None \nthe less, I should be remiss if, before ending my statement, I did not mention \nwhat we consider to be a pillar of unity and democracy that is, development. \nI should not like to take advantage of your kind attention. Sir. None \nthe less, I should be remiss if, before ending my statement, I did not mention \nwhat we consider to be a pillar of unity and democracy that is, \ndevelopment. Speaking of national unity, we say that unity and development \nare inseparable realities and that it would be difficult to achieve one \nwithout the other. The same is true of democracy. Indeed, without enjoying \nthe public freedoms that are the structure of true democracy, people cannot \nfully express their creativity. Similarly, democratic freedoms that are not \nbased on the satisfaction of elementary human needs would only be wishful \nthinking and would rapidly become void of any substance. \nFollowing these principles, the Government has undertaken a series of \nprogrammes of action for development. For a country such as ours, development \nis not a difficult concept to define. Essentially, it boils down to \nsatisfying the basic needs of the population, such as drinking water, health \nservices, schooling for their children, decent homes and also food security. \nTo succeed in this development enterprise, the authorities of the third \nRepublic initiated a structural adjustment programme with the support of the \nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Implementation of the \nprogramme is intended to stabilize the finances of our country and to \ntransform our productive structures with a view to achieving economic growth. \nThis reform, moreover, is guided by the principles of good management of \npublic affairs and of liberalizing the economy. \nIn so doing, important efforts have been made to promote the private \nsector. This new manner of conducting development emphasizes the growing \ndisengagement of the State and the giving of responsibility to individuals and \ncorporations. In this framework, the Government has, since 1991, embarked \non a major economic programme to privatize public enterprises. What is \ninvolved is the partial or total opening up of public enterprises to private \ncapital. It also involves restructuring those enterprises that need it in \norder to be more profitable and to establish more effective mechanisms for \nmanaging them. \nThe liberalization of Burundi's economy has just entered a new stage with \nthe creation of a free trade zone regime. This reform, intended to promote \ninvestment in order to bring about the diversification of our exports, grants \ntax and other advantages which some consider to be among the most advantageous \nin the world. \nInvestors who so desire can come and work with us. I can guarantee that \nthey will not regret doing so. The political reforms that have taken place \nwithin the framework of strengthening national unity and of democratization of \ninstitutions have created in our country a political and social environment \nwhich is very favourable to business. \nI have given a thumbnail sketch of the situation in Burundi today. As I \nindicated at the beginning of my statement, the Government and people of \nBurundi are working to achieve national reconciliation. The steps we have \ntaken allow us to welcome our brothers and sister who were refugees and enable \nthem to regain their dignity by returning freely to their homeland. Thanks to \nthe national unity we have regained, the democratization of our institutions \nis also taking place in an atmosphere of peace, order and serenity. We have \ncommitted ourselves to ambitious development programmes in order to establish \nan environment and a social infrastructure that can support social peace. \nIn this way, in full cooperation with the international community, \nBurundi feels that it is 01 the right path, one which will allow it, moreover, \nto make its contribution t) building a better world of peace, security and \ninternational solidarity. This is the best inheritance we could leave to our \nchildren. \nHow could we not in chis United Nations body give some thought to the \nchildren, who are the future of us all? This is why we wish especially to \nrecall that today, 30 September 1992, marks the second anniversary of the \nWorld Summit for Children. We express to the Secretary-General our \nappreciation for the report (A/47/264) he has just submitted to us on the \nfollow-up to the Summit. It deserves our attention. \nWe should also like to take this opportunity to say that we have high \nhopes that the forthcoming conference on this subject, which is to take place \nin Dakar, Senegal, next November will study the issue of the future of \nAfrica's children.

        "file_text": "I bring to the General Assembly the \ngreetings of the people and Government of Mauritius. I assure you. Sir, of \nour unstinted cooperation and support in the discharge of the important task \nthat you have assumed upon your election to the high office of President of \nthe General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. I join those who have \nalready congratulated you on this singular honour, which is also a tribute to \nyour country. \n\nI should like also to offer my felicitations to all the other officers of \nthe Assembly and to wish them success as they take the reins for the current \nsession. \nIn addition, I want to put on record our appreciation of the masterly \nmanner in which your distinguished predecessor conducted the affairs of the \nGeneral Assembly at its forty-sixth session, which was held at a time when the \nmost crucial transformation on which the Organization has embarked was taking \nplace. He can take pride in the commendable achievements of the Organization \nunder his wise guidance. \nIt is an equally pleasant duty to welcome the 13 States of Eastern Europe \nthat have joined our ranks as members of this comity of free nations. Their \nmembership in the United Nations can only reinforce the foundations of the \nOrganization and make a positive contribution to the new agenda that it has \nassumed. \nThe beginning of the current session of the General Assembly follows a \nyear which was very eventful on the international scene but, more important, \nwithin the Organization itself. Indeed, during the past year the United \nNations has witnessed, and in some cases has triggered, major developments. \n \nWhen I addressed the Assembly during the general debate last year, I referred \nto the selection of a new man to take the helm of the Organization. I said \nthat we were in a new era and that the new Secretary-General would have to \ntackle a different agenda and face new challenges as we approached the \ntwenty-first century. I also said that it would be appropriate to have a \nSecretary-General from the South and, indeed, from Africa. In that respect we \nhave been served well. \n \nIt is therefore with pride that I record as one of the important \ndevelopments in our system the brilliant choice of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali \nas Secretary-General, which has kindled in many a Member nation fresh hope \nthat its just aspirations will be addressed and fulfilled. \nMr. Boutros-Ghali's election to lead this world body has been welcomed with \nelation by the international community, and with great expectation by those of \nus who are from Africa. We take pride in the fact that this wise man of \nproven distinguished leadership and excellence is an Egyptian son of Africa. \n\nMauritius would like to associate itself with all those who have \ncommended the Secretary-General on the laudable actions he has undertaken so \nfar in his bid to initiate the much-needed reform of the Organization. It is \nconceded that reform of an organization like the United Nations is not an easy \ntask, but it is more than overdue, especially at a time when the cold war has \ndefinitely been laid to rest. The drop of the curtain on the cold-war era has \nbrought the reform and restructuring of the United Nations within the realm of \npossibility. The task is mammoth for sure, but it is one that is imperative, \ngiven the new priorities on the international agenda. \nThe Secretary-General deserves all the encouragement possible in his \nendeavours along this difficult path. His task becomes even more exacting \nwhen it is placed in the perspective of the forthcoming fiftieth anniversary \nof the Organization in 1995, which, incidentally, is also the year when the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will come up for renewal. \nThe years leading up to 1995 are, to our mind, absolutely crucial for the \nUnited Nations. Now, more than ever before, it is of paramount importance \nthat the United Nations address, with renewed vigour but within the parameters \nof the Charter, the various and complex issues that preoccupy the \ninternational community. \nIt is with those preoccupations in mind that we in Mauritius have \nwelcomed the Secretary-General's \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" submitted under the \nmandate issued at the end of the historic and first-of-its-kind summit meeting \nof the Security Council held on 31 January last. We share the \nSecretary-General's optimism when he states: \n\\\"A conviction has grown, among nations large and small, that an \nopportunity has been regained to achieve the great objectives of the \n \nCharter a United Nations capable of maintaining international peace and \nsecurity, of securing justice and human rights and of promoting, in the \nwords of the Charter, 'social progress and better standards of life in \nlarger freedom.'\\\" (A/47/277, para. 3) \nYes, we agree that this opportunity must not be allowed to pass, must not \nbe squandered. It is for us Member States to ensure that the Charter is \nstrengthened to create the appropriate conditions for the Organization to \nassume the role to which we want it to aspire. Our faith in the United \nNations should be reinforced, and we should match our words with action to \ngive the innovative structures proposed by the Secretary-General a chance to \nwork, and thus move the Organization out of the paralysis that characterized \nit during the cold-war era. The first steps out of this paralysis have been \ntaken, but there are still miles to go. In our endeavours to achieve the \nredefined objectives meant to ensure international peace and security we must \nbe wary that no attempt is made, deliberate or otherwise, to overstretch the \ninterpretation of the Charter to suit any hidden political or even economic \nagendas. \nThe universal membership of the United Nations should make it possible \nfor the international community to discuss with equity, fairness and justice \nany issue that is likely to jeopardize or bring into question the atmosphere \nof international peace and security in which we aspire to live. In that \nperspective, I should like to commit the support of Mauritius to the proposals \nof the Secretary-General with respect to preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, \npeace-keeping and confidence-building measures envisaged for the United \nNations and its executing organs. But, as the Secretary-General has said in \nhis annual report, the demands on the United Nations are not matched by an \n \nequivalent provision of resources, expecially by those who can well afford \nsuch resources. The Secretary-General's report informs us that since 1988 \n13 new peace-keeping operations have been organized and that the Organization \nis at present administering 12 peace-keeping operations in various regions of \nthe world, operations that are estimated to cost close to $3 billion in the \ncurrent 12-month period. \nIf we expect the United Nations to fulfil the new role that we are \ndesigning for it we must collectively ensure that we provide as well the \nfinancial support that it requires. It is only with secure financial \nfoundations that the United Nations will be able to respond adequately and \nsatisfactorily to our aspirations. I should therefore like to appeal to \nfellow Member States to honour their financial obligations within a reasonable \ntime and thus remove the current pecuniary constraints faced by the \nOrganization. I must also add that my country, which is among those Member \nStates that religiously pay up their annual assessed contributions, will give \nfavourable consideration to the Secretary-General's proposals to deal with the \ncash-flow problems, as outlined in his report. \nI should not like to leave the issue of reform of the Organization \nwithout joining my voice with those that have called for a review of the \nresponsibilities of the Security Council in this changed environment of ours. \nWe must be cautious lest we fall easy prey to the dangers that a unipolar \nworld can trigger. It is evident that a new world order is emerging. Let us \ncommit ourselves not to take a limited view of this new world order or, \nindeed, give it a limited concept. We welcome the ever-increasing activities \nof the Security Council to the extent that, as the Secretary-General informs \nus in his report, during the first 7 months of this year, 46 resolutions were \n\nadopted by the Council compared to 14 in all in 1987. We should, however, \nbeware of allowing ambiguities to crop up in those resolutions, ambiguities \nthat may make it dangerously possible for various interpretations to be given \nto those resolutions, the implementation of which may perpetuate the situation \nof conflicts that unfortunately pervades our globe. Indeed, criticism has \nbeen levelled at the Council for its seemingly ad hoc approach to matters \nrelating to international security. There is therefore a need to define set \nconsiderations, which, in turn, would determine what situations constitute \nthreats to international peace and security requiring action by the Security \nCouncil. \nFurthermore, it has been rightly and forcefully argued that while a more \nvigorous and dynamic role is being envisaged for the Security Council, this \nmagnified mandate of the Council should be matched by enhanced transparency \nand democracy. We fully concur with the Secretary-General, who, in the \nintroduction to his report, while arguing that the current international \nsituation rquires an Organization capable of dealing comprehensively with the \neconomic, social, environmental and political dimensions of human development, \nunderlines that: \n\\\"This requires the full application of the principles of democracy within \nthe family of nations and within our Organization.\\\" (A/47/1, para. 9) \nIn this context, we await with keen interest the results of the \ndeliberations of the high-level Working Group for the Restructuring of the \nUnited Nations set up by the recent summit meeting of the Movement of \nNon-Aligned Countries. \nEarlier on I said that while 1995 will mark the fiftieth anniversary of \nthe Organization, it will also be the year when the Treaty on the \n\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will come up for review and renewal. \nLast year in my address to the Assembly, I dwelt at length on the issue of \ndisarmament, principally because it constitutes especially to us smaller \nStates of the world the only path to lasting security. I expressed the hope \nthen that in the wake of the dramatic announcements made by \nPresident Gorbachev, the leader of the then-Soviet Union, President Bush and \nPresident Mitterrand the disarmament race would be confirmed. It is with deep \nsatisfaction that my country notes the tremendous progress achieved over the \npast year in that race. We welcome the vote by the United States Senate two \nmonths ago for a nine-month moratorium on United States nuclear testing and an \nend to all such tests by September 1996, which came in the wake of the French \nand Russian moratoriums. Those developments lead us to assert that the time \nhas now come for all of us seriously to consider a comprehensive \nnuclear-test-ban treaty, the more so in that the international community \nhailed the agreement by Presidents Bush and Yeltsin in Washington D.C. in June \nof this year to cut the number of long-range nuclear-missile warheads on the \nUnited States and Russian sides by about two thirds. \nAnother encouraging event in the field of disarmament has been the \npromise kept by China and France, which have deposited their instruments of \naccession to the non-proliferation Treaty. Speaking of that Treaty brings me \nto reiterate the dire need for an informal dialogue to be undertaken between \nnow and 1995 between States Parties to the Treaty and non-party States, with a \nview to addressing in the best possible way those provisions of the Treaty \nthat have so far prevented it from acquiring a universal dimension. \n \nWe also look forward to the establishment in 1993 of the Preparatory \nCommittee for the 1995 nuclear non-proliferation Treaty renewal Conference and \nare confident that it will have fruitful and conclusive deliberations. \nWe applaud the progress that has been achieved in the formulation of a \nchemical weapons convention and congratulate the negotiators in Geneva who \nhave put in arduous hours to ensure that the target date of 1992 for the \ncompletion of such a convention be met. I am pleased to inform the Assembly \nthat Mauritius will co-sponsor with others the resolution on that convention \nand will be among its original signatories when it comes up for ratification. \nWe believe that, with the end of the cold war and in this new era, \ncomplete nuclear disarmament and the elimination of weapons of mass \ndestruction are no longer a dream but are now very much in the realm of \nreality. On the way towards that ideal objective, Mauritius will support all \nplausible initiatives, including the elaboration of a convention providing for \na \\\"cut off\\\" in the production of fissile nuclear material for weapons \npurposes, as well as an international convention on negative nuclear security \nassurances. \nWhile we welcome the positive elements in the field of disarmament, some \nof which I have just mentioned, we deplore the continued movement of highly \ndangerous nuclear material on land and on the high seas. We have also taken \ncognizance with grave concern of the movement of plutonium and other toxic \nwaste across the world. We exhort the countries involved in such trade to \nrefrain from such actions and pay heed to the genuine concerns that have been \nexpressed and continue to be voiced by the international community. \nMauritius deplores the fact that some private companies based in Europe \nare shamefully exploiting the situations of disarray and complete chaos \n\nprevailing in Somalia to dump toxic waste on its territory, thereby adding to \nthe calamities that are already claiming a heavy toll of human lives. The \ninternational community should, with o single voice, condemn such abominable \nactions. It is indeed regrettable that while we, within the context of the \nnew role of the United Nations and other regional organizations, are trying to \nresolve the conflicts that beset the world, others, with no qualms whatsoever, \nare exploiting those conflicts for their own material benefit. \nAs regards the situation of conflicts throughout the world, a sad sight \nunfolds before our eyes. In certain areas, especially after the historic \ncollapse of one ideological bloc, new dangers loom heavily over entire \npopulations enmeshed in ethnic and nationalist bickering. Their release from \nlong years of repression seems to have given way to an unfortunate lust for \nself-destruction. \nWe are particularly concerned at the utter lack of consideration for the \nvalue of human life and property that has become an everyday occurrence in \ncertain parts of Eastern Europe. It is very difficult for us to accept that \nethnic, religious, and nationalist feelings could be so strong as to render \nentire populations expendable, or that political leaders should encourage such \nmurderous and genocidal sprees when it ought to have been possible for them to \nthrash out their differences peacefully through civilized negotiations. The \nsadness of the matter is that, while the various political groups often \nmotivated by a misguided and exaggerated sense of territorial expansion, turn \nwhole areas into wargrounds of desolation and lay to ruin entire cities and \ntowns, it is the innocent civilian population that has to hold the thorny end \nof the stick. I do not need to retell the countless stories of atrocities \nbeing perpetrated daily in many parts of our world to convince anybody of the \n \nkind of manmade calamity that afflicts us. Every God-given day is turned into \na nightmare by the needless killings perpetrated in the name of supremacy. \nOn the one hand, we do everything in our power to rid ourselves \ncollectively of oppressive regimes and superficial ideologies; but on the \nother, once that goal is achieved we turn the guns on one another. Entire \nnations have crumbled over the past few months, principally in Europe and \nAfrica. Entire populations have been decimated. Bosnia and Herzegovina and \nSomalia are indeed sad and disgraceful examples of the kind of cruelty and \nbrutality of which man is capable. On both counts, the international \ncommunity has been shamefully slow in addressing the issues with a view to \nbringing an end to the senseless killings that have characterized the daily \nevolution of the situation in those countries, whose victims have been the \ninnocent and helpless populations. \nWhat a sad reflection this is on humanity. For months we have remained \nimpassive to the images of desolation and despair, of emaciated fellow beings \ntoo sick and too weak to move, of mutilated people degenerating into \napparitions of skin and bones - images brought to us in the comfort of our \nliving rooms on the small screen. The Somali human rights disaster for \nindeed that is what it is has been left to simmer for months unheeded. This \nbrings me to address another area of priority on the international agenda \nthe issue of human rights. \nIt has been known since time immemorial that man as an individual has a \ncapacity to go to extremes. As capable as he is of displaying a depthless \nsense of compassion and love, he is just as able to manifest a diametrically \nopposed and excruciating sense of cruelty and oppression towards his fellow \nbeing. But when such harassment and privation of man's basic rights become \n\ninstitutionalized, it is a matter of distress that should be the concern of \nthe international community. \nOne cannot talk of economic development and progress on the one hand \nwithout on the other hand ensuring that man who remains at the centre of \ndevelopment and therefore of progress is not prevented from enjoying his \ndignity, nor divested of his basic freedoms and rights. The promotion and \nupholding of human rights should remain high on the international community's \nlist of priorities. In fact, as the Secretary-General reminds us in his \nreport, the Charter of the United Nations makes the promotion of human rights \none of our priority objectives. Constant dialogue with a view to defusing any \nsituation in which human rights have been breached should be encouraged and \nwelcomed at all levels. \nHuman rights are indivisible. Political, social, civil and economic \nrights are fundamental to humanity in its quest for progress and its \nendeavours towards the economic and social improvement of its environment. \nThat is why we in Mauritius staunchly support those who believe that concern \nfor human rights and the promotion and defence thereof cannot be considered as \ninterference in the internal affairs of a State where that State displays an \narrogant disregard for the basic rights and freedoms of its people. We \nbelieve that violations and gross abuse of human rights should be decried \nforcefully. In the same manner that the international community has with one \nvoice condemned,apartheid as a human rights abuse, it should be free and \nhonest enough to point the finger at those who continue to thwart the efforts \nof man to assert his dignity. If we can without restraint declare ourselves \nagainst such scourges as apartheid, racism and xenophobia, we should equally \nbe at full liberty to denounce those who for archaic or obscure reasons but \n\noften out of self-interest deny their fellow beings the freedom to exercise \ntheir basic rights. \nWe therefore condemn without reserve those who, for political expediency \nand/or survival, find it necessary in the normal course of events to deprive \ntheir people of civil and political rights to the extent of imprisoning and \neven exterminating those who militate for such rights. We also view with \ngrave concern those cases in which human rights monitors, local or \ninternational, have been arrested, jailed, or even killed while trying to come \nto the assistance of populations that are victims of human rights deprivation. \nHowever, we should like to appeal to the donor community to ensure that, \nwhile withholding or cutting off aid and assistance to any country or region \nas a punitive measure against regimes guilty of gross violations and abuse of \nhuman rights, nothing be done to exacerbate the plight of innocent people \nwhose lives are already miserable as a result of their being deprived of their \nbasic rights. After all, human feelings and therefore humanitarian compassion \nshould transcend political considerations. A people afflicted by severe human \nrights abuse should not be made to endure further suffering by being deprived \nof much-needed assistance. \n\nWith a view to addressing serious human-rights-abuse situations in \ncertain territories in a positive and constructive manner, we are fully \nsupportive of the idea that the General Assembly or the Security Council \nshould be able to entrust the Secretary-General with mounting fact-finding \nmissions to those territories, either at the request of the Government thereof \nor at the behest of the appropriate organ of the United Nations itself \nsubject, of course, to prior arrangements having been made with the States \nconcerned. \nWe must here commend the work done by the United Nations Commission on \nHuman Rights and Human Rights Committee, the Centre for Human Rights in Geneva \nand the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as well as the \nvarious non-governmental organizations which have been playing a crucial role \nin the protection and enhancement of human rights. We must also place on \nrecord our appreciation for those States that have legislated appropriately to \ngive human rights the protection of the law and make their enjoyment a matter \nof course. \nIn the context of the international concern for human rights, we hope \nthat the opportunity provided by the second World Conference on Human Rights, \nto be held in Vienna in June 1993, will be seized by all concerned to pledge \nthemselves to the universal upholding and promotion of human rights. Respect \nfor human rights must become a cardinal characteristic of all Governments. A \npassionate debate is currently on regarding the relationship between \ndemocracy, development and human rights, as indeed on the issue of human \nrights and sovereignty. We believe that the 1993 Conference will be the \nperfect platform to debate these issues sufficiently for universal norms \nthereon to emerge. I should like to seize this opportunity to wish the \nPreparatory Committee in Geneva success in the work it has started. \n\nThe upsurge of racism and xenophobia in certain countries of the West is \nalso a matter of great concern to us, and we consider the discrimination in \nthe treatment of migrant workers and foreign students in those countries a \nhuman-rights violation. It is a matter of deep regret that some countries \nthat have come to the fore as champions of human rights should themselves be \nfound wanting on that level. Let them put their human-rights house in order \nfirst before decrying and acting on violations beyond their frontiers. \nSimilarly, some countries that are quick to denounce human-rights abuse \ndo not always abide by the consistency that is required in such matters. We \nfirmly believe that the same approach should be applied in all cases of \nalleged human-rights abuse, whenever they may occur. No political or economic \ninterest should interfere with that approach. Picking and choosing between \ncountries will only make a farce of the human-rights issue. \nI now wish to touch briefly on a few issues that are of specific \nimportance to us in Mauritius. The unfortunate turn of events in South \nAfrica, in particular the Boipatong massacre and the Bisho killings, has \ndampened the ardour with which we were anticipating the accession of the \nRepublic of South Africa to the fold of free and democratic countries of the \nworld. We call on all the parties concerned in the South African arena, and \nespecially those currently in power, to recast their bearings in as positive a \nway as possible to ensure that the objective we dream of for that country is \nachieved in the not-too-distant future, so that every citizen of the nation \nthat will emerge can start working towards its reconstruction based on \nfreedom, peace, equality and justice. We are hopeful that the wisdom of the \nleaders involved and the encouragement of the international community will \nmake it possible for the stalled negotiations to be resumed, for the benefit \nof all South African citizens. \n \nIn neighbouring Mozambigue, a breakthrough had appeared at hand as all \nparties concerned declared their readiness to work for the progress of that \ncountry in the wake of the recent negotiations aimed at ending years of civil \nstrife. We hope that last-minute snags will be overcome in a spirit of \ncompromise so that peace can at last prevail in the better interests of the \npopulation.* \nSimilarly, we are encouraged by the ongoing Middle East peace talks. We \nmust, however, constantly remind ourselves that the crux of the matter remains \nan equitable and just solution to the Palestinian issue. \nThe scourge of famine and drought that continues to take its toll of \nlives on the African continent, especially in its southern part and in the \nHorn of Africa, is a matter of deep concern. We would like to see the \ninternational community act more urgently to stop the dreadful loss of life \nthat has become a daily occurrence in many countries of that region. \nMauritius is ready to contribute within the possibility of its means to any \naction aimed at alleviating the plight of those unfortunate and often \nforgotten souls. \nAnother issue that is of great importance to us in Mauritius is the need \nto respect the territorial integrity of nations. I should here like to place \nonce more on record the appreciation of my country to all those countries that \nhave consistently expressed their support of our sovereignty over the Chagos \nArchipelago, including Diego Garcia. We should like to inform the Assembly \nthat we have resumed exchanges with the United Kingdom on this issue. \n\nIn my address to the Assembly last year, I expressed the hope that the \nleaders of Fiji would redress the situation that prevails there by amending \nits present Constitution to the satisfaction of all the citizens of that \nsister island nation. Mauritius draws comfort from recent assertions by the \nPrime Minister of that country that he is morally committed to reviewing the \nConstitution of the land. We are confident that the Fijian Government will \nnow act on the basis of those assertions and make it once more possible for \nthe Fijian citizens, irrespective of the community to which they belong, to \nwork hand in hand for the progress of their nation. \nSimilarly, we commend the authorities of that other neighbourly sister \nisland of Sri Lanka for the efforts being deployed to put an end to the \nunfortunate strife that has ravaged their country and taken such a heavy toll \nof human lives. We are confident that with a reasonable degree of compromise \non all sides, peace and harmony will prevail anew there. \nFinally, allow me to reiterate the continued faith of my country in the \ncollective wisdom of our Organization and pledge anew our unstinting support \nfor its laudable efforts, under the skilled and enlightened leadership of \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to address the political, social and economic \nobstacles that remain strewn on the path to harmonious coexistence and global \nprogress. \n"

        "file_text": "The\tdelegation\tof Niger is pleased to add its voice to all those who have preceded us and express to Mr. Ganev our heartfelt congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. This election is testimony to the high esteem and prestige enjoyed by his country, Bulgaria, on the international scene and its contribution to the achievement of the ideals of our Organization, and is an acknowledgment of his talents as a seasoned diplomat and man of experience.\nHe should like to include in these congratulations the other members of the Bureau and to assure them of the full and total cooperation of the delegation of Niger in accomplishing their task.\nI should like to express to Mr. Ganev's predecessor.\nAmbassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, our great satisfaction and compliments on his excellent guidance of the work of the forty-sixth session.\nWe hail and welcome the countries that have just joined the great family of the United Nations, whose admission is in keeping with the universality of our Organization.\nI should also like to express once again to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United Nations, the heartfelt congratulations of His Excellency Mr. Cheiffou Amadou, Prime Minister and Head of Government of the Republic of Niger, on his election, which is the crowning of a brilliant career. The Government of Niger also wishes to extend to him its encouragement and support for the dynamism he has already imparted to the Organization.\nNiger rejoices at the end of East-West rivalries and at the climate of confidence that has thus been created. It is a decisive turning-point in the history of mankind, marked by profound and rapid political and social changes brought about by powerful currents towards freedom, justice, democracy and human rights. This positive development in international relations, and particularly the hopes and expectations to which it has given rise, makes it imperative for us to engage in the search for a new world balance that takes into consideration the aspirations and needs all of the components of international society. In this connection, the sessions of the General Assembly are for the international community opportunities to achieve further progress in the search for peace, justice and harmony among peoples, in keeping with the ideals and principles of the Charter.\nThanks to the climate of international detente, prospects of general and complete disarmament and the hope that that will release additional resources for development seem increasingly achievable. Niger notes with satisfaction the positive results already on record in this field and wishes to congratulate the Secretary-General on his efforts towards general and complete disarmament.\nInternational peace and security require that all countries make greater efforts towards a reduction of all armed forces and all deadly weapons of destruction. In this regard, I should like to announce that Niger has just ratified the Treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.\nThe climate of international detente is felt also in the evolution of regional conflicts. The \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\", which is a compendium of extremely relevant recommendations and measures for the prevention of conflict, peace-keeping and peacemaking, is an invaluable contribution of the Secretary-General to current thinking on ways of safeguarding international peace.\nNiger hopes for a speedy and equitable solution to the conflict in\nWestern Sahara through the organization of a self-determination referendum. \nThe Government of Niger expresses the hope that the recommendations of the meetings of Lome, Bamako and Yamoussokro and the most recent summit in Dakar of the Economic Community of West African States be taken into account by all parties to the conflict in Liberia, with a view to the establishment of peace and national reconciliation. \nThe situation in Somalia is tragic and repugnant. He witness daily the appalling suffering of an entire people, victim of the most tragic drought exacerbated by a fratricidal war that makes the provision of humanitarian assistance difficult. Niger joins the rest of the international community in urging the rival factions to cease their hostilities and accept the presence of United Nations observers and a United Nations peace-keeping force to ensure respect for the cease-fire agreement and to ensure the distribution of food aid.\nRecent developments in South Africa give us hope. Niger believes that the international community must continue to encourage the South African regime to take further measures to accelerate the democratization process while at the same time maintaining the necessary pressure until a democratic, non-racial Government is formed. The Organization must make the Pretoria regime adopt urgent measures to put an end to the organized violence that is tearing apart the country's black community and that constitutes a serious obstacle to the resumption and proper conduct of negotiations in the framework of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa.\nWith respect to security, the Middle East remains the most sensitive region in the world. Niger believes that no just and lasting peace can be established in the Middle East unless Israel withdraws completely from occupied Palestinian and Arab territories, including Al-Quds Al-Sharif. We encourage all efforts to that end, and we welcome the dialog that has begun since the Madrid conference, as well as the current peace negotiations on a just and final settlement of the Middle East conflict.\u2003With respect to the Arabian-Persian Gulf/ Niger strongly condemned the aggression against and occupation of Kuwait. Kuwait has been liberated, but the threat of war persists. Respect for Security Council resolutions and the delimitation of the boundaries between Iraq and Kuwait are indispensable if a lasting peace is to return to the region.\nThe tragic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is inadmissible in the twentieth century. Niger vigorously condemns the acts of barbarism committed by forces of Serbia and of Montenegro against the populations of Bosnia and Herzegovina in violation of the sovereignty, independence and integrity of that country. Niger fully supports Security Council resolutions 770 (1992) and 771 (1992). as well as the resolutions of other international bodies condemning the aggression and calling for cooperation by all States in helping Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nThe guest for peace in the world is one of the Organization's loftiest objectives. But to be complete, world peace must be backed by action to eliminate poverty. At the 1990 Paris Conference of least developed countries, the world was not surprised to learn that the number of least developed countries had grown from 28 to 42, most of them African.\nThe ever-growing burden of debt and debt servicing continues to deprive developing countries of resources they need for their development. Reasons for the grave crisis in Africa include the constant drop in commodity prices, the rise in prices for manufactured goods, the lack of access to developed-country markets, and the decline in development assistance. The continuing deterioration in Africa's economic situation is condemning hundreds of millions of individuals to stagnation and permanent poverty.\nIn 1986/ the United Nations, which we invoke each year, adopted the United Nations program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. It was then the consensus view that the economic crisis in Africa was essentially structural. African countries had committed themselves to adopt structural-adjustment policies, and developed countries and financial institutions had committed themselves to provide assistance and financial flows.\nUnfortunately, despite the policies and reforms undertaken by African countries and the recommendations made at all international conferences, the situation continues to deteriorate. Despite the social cost of the reforms and sacrifices of African countries, the results have been disappointing, because of a lack of follow-up measures.\nBut there is growing awareness of the need to tackle this extremely serious situation more resolutely. Measures to lighten the debt burden of the poorest countries should be viewed in that context. The same is true of the proposal made by the former Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, on development financing, which was considered at the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\nWe welcome the decision of the Japanese Government to organize a 1993 international conference on development in Africa with the participation of African Heads of State.\nWe wish finally to mention the move to reinvigorate international cooperation stemming largely from the revitalization and restructuring of United Nations activities in the economic and social fields. Those activities should be strictly based on the recommendations adopted by the most recent international conferences. These include:\tthe\tDeclaration\tadopted at the\neighteenth special session of the General Assembly on international economic cooperation; the International Development Strategy for the fourth United Nations Development Decade; the program of Action adopted at the World Summit for Children; and the program of Action and other major decisions adopted at the Earth Summit the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro.\nThe right to development presupposes the right to a healthy environment. The Earth Summit at Rio defined the links between environment and development. It defined the responsibilities of the North and of the South for the deterioration of our ecosystem. It also made it possible to adopt legal instruments designed to reconcile man and nature. I speak here of the Earth Charter and of the conventions on biodiversity and on climatic change.\nAs a Sahelian country. Niger must deal with the effects of repeated drought and increasing desertification. It is of particular interest to us that at this session the Assembly should define the modalities for the negotiation and adoption of an international convention on drought and desertification.\nTurning to the social sphere, we encourage United Nations efforts to promote the struggle against acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (AIDS), illegal trafficking in narcotics, and drug abuse. Those scourges must remain at the center of our concerns. That is true too of efforts at the integration of women into the development process and of measures to protect the disabled, children and other vulnerable groups. \nThe international conference on human rights in 1993, the conference on population and development in 1994, the world summit on social development and the fourth world conference on women, both in 1995, will offer opportunities to review all these problems at the highest level.\nNatural disasters and other calamities are on the increase, and we must continue to focus on them. Each time, the devastating consequences of these phenomena remind us of the urgent need to enhance the ability of the United Nations to act more effectively. He are pleased at the Organization's examination of these subjects and at the appointment of distinguished individuals to deal with these issues.\nToday, developing countries are fully aware of their primary responsibility for development. The political renewal we have seen in many African countries, including my own, stems from that awareness. Indeed, as members know, Niger convened, from 29 July to 3 November 1991, a conference on national sovereignty at which we engaged in a stark assessment of 30 years of efforts and to identify courses of action, guidelines and decisions to be implemented over a transitional period of 15 months.\nSince then, the democratically elected transition organs have knuckled down to implementing the political, economic, social, and cultural measures adopted by the Conference. These mainly involve improving and re-balancing the economic and financial situation; undertaking institutional reforms in every field; establishing self-confidence; and consolidating national solidarity and unity. Such measures, the outcome of a national consensus, are based on the fundamental choice by the people of Niger of a democratic and republican course.\nFollowing its National Conference, Niger embarked resolutely on the road towards a pluralistic democracy with respect for human rights and guarantees of the effective exercise of public freedoms. The process initiated 11 months ago is following its charted course, gaining strength and further entrenching itself every day. There are difficulties inherent in the nature of the undertaking, but there are also results that encourage us to persevere.\nWhile perhaps modest, this experience of a young democracy has made it possible to assess the constraints imposed by such a social project, the risks of derailment it entails, the impatience that must be stifled, and the legitimate expectations that must be met in order to ensure that this lofty enterprise succeeds. The establishment of stable institutions designed to guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms, social justice and national unity through regular and transparent elections will be crowned, we are sure, with success by the establishment of a state of law and a true democracy.\nI am pleased to announce that Niger is making progress in the electoral consultations for the adoption of a constitution and the holding of municipal, legislative and presidential elections. Thus, on the threshold of the year 1993, Niger will become democratic on a firm footing.\nHe are aware, however, that no democratization policy can be considered as lasting if measures are not taken to foster conditions favorable to progress and the flourishing of humanity. That is why we turn with hope to the international community, and more specifically to the United Nations, to nurture a new spirit of solidarity and justice among nations. Niger cherishes the hope that the General Assembly at this session will contribute to the solution of the great challenges facing the international community.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I extend my warm congratulations to you, \nSir, and to Bulgaria on your election to the office of President of the \nGeneral Assembly. Ireland, as one of the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly, \nlooks forward to cooperating closely with you as you guide our work at this \nsession of the Assembly. \nIn the weeks ahead the Assembly will examine many aspects of current \ninternational life. But today I want to focus on two issues that I believe, \nmy country believes, my Government believes, require our urgent attention. \nFirst, we must act now to save the millions starving in Somalia; and \nsecondly, the United Nations must move the questions of justice and \ndevelopment to the top of its agenda. We have had too many Somalias. \n\nOur Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, is the first African to lead \nthe Organization, and I wish to begin my short address with that particular \ncontinent. \nLast month I spent three or four days in Somalia, and I will shortly \nreturn there with the President of Ireland, Mary Robinson. She has decided to \nvisit Somalia to show solidarity with the people of that starving land, and to \nunderline the compelling need for more effective international action. \nMy visit was a profoundly disturbing experience. Words fail before the \nscale of the catastrophe and the depth of the suffering. Yesterday at one \nfeeding station alone in Baidoa, which I visited during my visit, 532 people \ndied in one day. Today, many more will die. And tomorrow. Until we act. It \nis a scandal. It is a scandal for Somalia's leaders who continue to squabble \nand fight while their people continue to starve and die. It is a scandal for \noutsiders, for the developed world, for the membership of the United Nations, \nwho have failed to respond swiftly and effectively.* \nThroughout, international non-governmental organizations and \norganizations from my own country have taken the lead, and I believe it is now \ntime for Governments and the international community to follow. I pay a \ntribute to their humanitarian work and their determined efforts to confront us \nwith this appalling crisis. Their generosity and courage should inspire a more \ncomprehensive and committed response from the international community. \nWhat must be done? \nFirst, we must increase the volume of food and relief supplies reaching \nSomalia. Unless 60,000 tons of food can be distributed each month, children, \nwomen and old people will continue to die. There will be more Baidoas. \n\nSecondly, food and medicine must be distributed in conditions of civil \norder. Ambassador Sahnoun, the exceptional and very worthy Special \nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, is \nvigorously promoting improved security. He deserves our full support. The \ndeployment of United Nations troops will provide an essential measure of \nprotection for food distribution. We must all, particularly the regional \norganizations and Somalia's neighbours, impress on clan and faction leaders \nthe need to cooperate fully with the aid effort. \nThirdly, we must work for a process of national reconciliation and for \nthe formation of a Government with national authority. A political solution \nis essential for long-term recovery and to prevent a relapse into the horror \nthat we now witness daily. \nThe international community has the resources and the skills to save \nSomalia. What is needed is the political will and the organizational drive to \nharness those resources and deploy those skills. We have no more urgent task. \nFor all our honest endeavours, we live in a world beset by inequality, by \ngross disparities and imbalances of wealth and resources. So often do nature \nand society combine to perpetuate injustice that the sceptic might conclude \nthat humanity's best efforts are more often than not unequal to the challenge. \nOur \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" must embrace also an agenda for justice and \ncompassion. This imperative was obscured by the cold war. \nIt is perhaps understandable that throughout those dangerous years \ninternational attention and political energies were absorbed by questions of \nsecurity. But the era of ideological confrontation is, happily, over and at \nan end. \n\nWe must grasp this opportunity to build a more humane and just \ninternational system, a system that will focus on the welfare of the \nindividual the need for food and shelter, for human rights, for political \nfreedom and for equality. We cannot forget that the same Charter that assigns \nto the United Nations responsibility for preserving international peace and \nsecurity also gives the United Nations major responsibilities for promoting \nsocial and economic development. \n\nThe moral responsibility of the international donor community is clear. \nNone of us finds it easy to allocate extra resources for aid in the current \ndifficult economic climate, but we have an obligation to provide adequate \nhumanitarian relief for immediate crises, as well as financial and technical \nassistance for longer-term development. For reasons of size and economic \ncircumstances, the scope for Ireland to donate significant amounts of aid \nremains limited. However, I can say that private support in Ireland for \nnon-governmental organizations involved in development has grown steadily. \nToday Ireland has the highest rate of private development assistance, as a \nproportion of gross national product, of all countries in the world. The \nIrish people have themselves shown their generosity, and the Irish Government \naims to respond by increasing our official development assistance. \nBut the effort called for is wider than development assistance. \nNotwithstanding the end of the cold war and the disappearance of East-West \nconfrontation, the opportunities for international cooperation are not being \ngrasped. It is simply unacceptable that most Africans are poorer today than \nthey were 30 years ago, that in a world that spends a trillion dollars every \nyear on weapons of the most sophisticated kind we cannot find the resources to \nprovide bread and clean water for millions of our fellow citizens. What is \nmissing is a clear political focus and, by definition, a clear, directed \npolitical will. \nAlready the international community has made a connection between the \nenvironment and development. But there are other areas in which we must look \nfor new and broader approaches: in the international financial and economic \nsystem; in spending on armaments; and in the way in which our international \norganizations work. Economic activity cannot be divorced from political \nresponsibility. \n\nHow welcome it would be if the quality of analysis and the clarity of \ndirection contained in the Secretary-General's \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" could be \nbrought to bear on a new agenda an agenda for justice and development if, \nwhen we meet here again a year from now, we were to have a thorough report, \nbearing the authority of the Secretary-General, which would point the way \nforward on aid, trade, finance, commodities and debt, a report that would \ndevelop concrete proposals to remedy the organizational deficiencies that so \noften thwart our best intentions. I believe that in the years ahead the \nsuccess of our Organization will be measured not only by its response to \nindividual situations of conflict but also by the way in which it deals with \nthese urgent questions of development. \nThe end of East-West rivalry has not brought an end to conflict or \nthreats to peace. On the contrary, many disputes frozen by the cold war have \nre-emerged with vicious and deadly impact. We must intensify our cooperation \non international peace and security. The January summit of the Security \nCouncil was a timely initiative, which has led directly to the \nSecretary-General's ambitious and thought-provoking document \\\"An Agenda for \nPeace\\\". That document assembles a range of important ideas for consolidation \nof the peace-keeping activities of the United Nations, as well as for \nextension of the role of the United Nations into the new areas of preventive \ndiplomacy, peacemaking and peace-building. \nIreland has long supported the peace-keeping activities of the United \nNations. Today my country, small though it may be in population and in \nresources, participates in 10 of the 12 peace-keeping missions currently in \nthe field. But, like the Secretary-General, we have felt the need to develop \nfurther the capacity of the United Nations to make and keep the peace. We \ntherefore endorse the direction of the Secretary-General's thinking. \n\nI welcome in particular the attention given to preventive action. The \nearlier the United Nations can identify and act on a threat to the peace, the \nbetter are the chances of averting the outbreak or prospective outbreak of \nhostilities. The proposals for fact-finding missions, for improved early \nwarning and for the preventive deployment of United Nations forces can and \nshould be implemented now. \nWe also support the Secretary-General's proposals for the strengthening \nof peace-keeping. The activities of the United Nations in this area are \namongst the most innovative achievements of our age. We are prepared to work \nactively with the Secretariat and with other member States in coping with the \nnew demands and problems that have emerged in relation to logistics, \nequipment, personnel and finance. \nI want to say a brief word about the financing of the United Nations. \nHere, I am struck by the Secretary-General's clear and urgent warning about \nthe poor financial health of the Organization. At the very moment when the \nUnited Nations has begun to assume a more effective role in the interests of \npeace, when it is looked to by suffering people everywhere to provide \nprotection and aid, its work is hampered by financial uncertainty. \nLet me put it simply: the Organization cannot function effectively, \ncannot meet the demands that we the members make upon it, unless all Member \nStates pay their assessed contributions in full and on time. We call on all \nmembers to fulfil their financial obligations under the Charter, and we look \nto the General Assembly, at its current session, to adopt measures to put the \nOrganization on a secure financial footing. \nI know that reform of the United Nations - and, in particular, of the \nSecurity Council is a sensitive issue that touches the very essence of \npost-war international cooperation. But, after almost 50 years it is \n\nreasonable to ask if the structures and methods of work agreed upon then \ncorrespond fully with contemporary realities with the growing, and now \nalmost universal, membership of the United Nations; with the Organization's \nnew tasks; and with the great changes that have taken place in economic and \npolitical relations. \nThe time has come to take up these issues frankly here within the \nUnited Nations itself. We can only profit from such a discussion. Our aim \nshould be to ensure that the decisions of the Organization are truly \nauthoritative and representative of the will of the entire international \ncommunity. \nOne of the most significant achievements of this century has been the \ndevelopment of an ethic, a morality, of human rights. We have set our face \nuncompromisingly against violations of human rights - against torture, \nslavery, apartheid. It is simply not acceptable that an individual can be \nsacrificed to the interests of a State system rendered nameless, an \nafterthought as history marches on. \nOur modern ethic extends to the realization that human rights are \nessential in relations between States as well as in our national political \nsystems. None of us can turn our backs on systematic violations of human \nrights or retain full trust and confidence in those responsible for such \nviolations. To respect human rights is to respect conscience itself, whose \npower for good has been illustrated many times in the course of this century \nby a Mahatma Gandhi, by a Martin Luther King, or, in the past few years, by a \nVaclav Havel or a Nelson Mandela, who, from a prison cell - \\\"enduring the \nmost\\\" changed his country's history. \n\nBy upholding the rights of the individual we bring the welfare and \ndignity of men and women to the centre of our political preoccupations. This \nmust be the central message for next year's world conference on human rights, \nbut I am deeply concerned that it is in danger of being lost sight of in the \npreparatory work. In this of all fields, we must escape from an adversarial \napproach and hold firmly in view the meaning of our work for the suffering of \nthe many. \nI should like to make a few remarks in connection with disarmament. We \ncannot slacken in our determination to make progress on disarmament and arms \ncontrol. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the development \nof new and sophisticated conventional weapons pose a major threat to \ninternational peace and security and to regional stability. \nI welcome the recent agreement in the Conference on Disarmament on the \nchemical-weapons Convention. I welcome too the accession of France and China \nto the nuclear-non-proliferation Treaty. As we prepare for the 1995 Review \nConference, we appeal to those countries that remain outside the Treaty to \njoin us in making the non-proliferation regime truly universal. This is a \ngoal for which Ireland has long striven. The effort to reduce and eliminate \nnuclear weapons and to end nuclear testing once and for all must be \nredoubled. Nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction can have no \nplace in our future security relations. \nThe British Foreign Secretary has already spoken in the name of the \ntwelve member States of the European Community about the major regional \nchallenges confronting our world the Middle East, Cambodia, South Africa, \nYugoslavia and other conflicts and I fully endorse his statements in that \nregard. \n\nOver the past year, the Irish Government has worked tirelessly for the \nresumption of political dialogue which might lead to a lasting and \ncomprehensive settlement of the problem of Northern Ireland. I am happy to \nreport that our efforts bore fruit with the recommencement some months ago of \na process of dialogue and negotiation involving the Irish and the British \nGovernments and the constitutional political parties in Northern Ireland. The \nshared objective of this process is \n\\\"to achieve a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland, \nwithin the island of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands\\\". \nThe Irish Government will do everything in its power to reach a \nsettlement which will overcome present divisions and lay the foundations for \nlasting peace, stability and reconciliation among the Irish people. We \nbelieve such a settlement can be achieved only on the basis of the equal \nlegitimacy of the two traditions which exist on our island. The nationalist \nand unionist traditions are equally valid. Each must be accorded equal \nrespect and given meaningful political expression in new political \narrangements. \nA valuable acknowledgement of the rights of the two traditions exists \nalready in the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Over the past seven years, the \nAgreement has performed an extremely valuable role as an instrument of \ncooperation between the Irish and British Governments on a wide range of \nmatters relating to Northern Ireland. Issues which have received particular \nattention include relations between the security forces and the community in \nNorthern Ireland; public confidence in the administration of justice; respect \nfor human rights and the law; the prevention of discrimination wherever it \nexists and the development of greater North/South economic cooperation. \n\nThe Irish Government has made it clear that we would be prepared to \nconsider a new and more broadly based agreement or structure if such an \narrangement can be arrived at through direct discussion and negotiation \nbetween all of the parties concerned. The present talks are exploring that \npossibility. In our view, arrangements must build upon, rather than detract \nfrom, the crucial contribution made by the Anglo-Irish Agreement to political \nprogress. \nIt is our earnest hope that the process of dialogue which is under way at \npresent, and in which I am personally participating, will lead to agreed \narrangements which represent a fair and honourable accommodation between the \ntwo traditions on the island of Ireland. Nationalists and unionists must both \nfeel that their political, civil, economic and social rights are fully \nprotected and that structures are in place which respect and accommodate their \nrespective aspirations. \nAll of the participants in the present talks are committed to a \nforward-looking and constructive approach. For our part, we in the Irish \nGovernment are prepared to bring all the necessary reserves of good will and \npatience to bear in the search for an agreed outcome. The best hope of \nultimate success lies in the insistent desire for peace on the part of the \nvast majority of Irish people, in both North and South, and our determination \nthat the violence and turmoil which has been suffered over the past 23 years \nin Northern Ireland and on the island of Ireland shall not be visited upon \nfuture generations. \nThose who resort to violence in the pursuit of political aims are the \nenemies of the Irish people. They seek an Ireland built not on respect for \nthe aspirations of each tradition but on bloodshed, hatred and despair. All \n\nthe efforts of the Irish Government are directed towards the creation of \nconditions which will ensure that the scourge of violence is removed for \never. \nThe only true path to peace, justice and stability lies in the healing of \nwounds and in reconciliation between the two traditions on a basis of complete \nequality. There is much that divides the two traditions but there is even \nmore that unites us. The common ground between North and South, I have no \ndoubt, will be significantly expanded by our joint progress over the years \nahead along the road towards European union. By building on our shared values \nand objectives, we will bring closer the peaceful and stable future to which \nwe all aspire. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to \ncongratulate you. Sir, on your election as President of our General Assembly. \nYour outstanding abilities earned a unanimous vote, which is a tribute both to \nyour country and to the example it sets in its newly regained freedom. \nSpeaking from this rostrum last year, I welcomed the extraordinary winds \nof freedom which were sweeping oppressive regimes away everywhere in the \nworld. I recalled the support that my country had always given to peoples' \nright to self-determination. I rejoiced at the promises of independence which \narose on the ruins of empires. \nThe distance covered since then gives us grounds for hope. While in \nEurope the barriers around blocs tumbled, in Africa the chains of apartheid \nwere removed and in Asia Governments contested by their people fell, new \nsovereign entities were established. Let us therefore welcome the delegations \nof the new Member States that have joined us. \nThese successes are also successes for our Organization. More than ever, \nthe principles and rules of our Charter prove their immutable value; more than \never, let us show our commitment to them. \nI should like to turn to Mr. Boutros-Ghali and commend the example he \nsets us: the example of his energy, of his entire action focused on the aims \nof our Organization and the application of our Charter's principles. He \nsucceeds someone who has brought honour to our Organization. But rarely will \na Secretary-General have succeeded in overcoming so many crises and challenges \nin the first year of his mandate. Let us therefore thank him for his efforts, \nhis imagination and his determination. \n \nIn spite of freedom's victories, peace has not always been the child of \nliberation. Rivalries between neighbours, ethnic tensions and border disputes \nfan discord and foment insecurity to the point of provoking the return of war \nin all its cruelty and savagery. Yugoslavia, Liberia, Somalia: the names \nring sadly in our ears, and the examples are, unfortunately, legion. \nUniversal peace, our absolute principle, is still only an ambition. It must \nbecome our primary mission. \nTo ensure that the paths of freedom become paths to peace everywhere, \nFrance proposes three lines of action: peace through the organization of \nsecurity that is, peace-keeping operations and collective security and \ndisarmament measures; peace through the affirmation of justice - that is, \neconomic and social development to bring about greater fairness and equality \namong nations and peoples; peace through solidarity among States which know \nhow to use their independence to establish beneficial cooperation. \n \nLet us speak first of peace through the organization of security. \nThe immediate need is to halt the conflicts which are causing bloodshed \nin Europe, the border regions of Asia and Africa. They cast a sinister shadow \nover the successes of freedom and independence. The United Nations, \nstrengthened by its new influence, reacted by mounting in the space of a few \nmonths peace-keeping operations on an unprecedented scale. Never before have \nso many men from such a large number of countries assembled under our flag, \nthat of the international community. \nStopping the expansion of a neighbour or faction, protecting populations, \nhelping to deliver humanitarian aid, providing reassurance and at times \nrenewing dialogue between the parties involved such are the many sensitive \nmissions undertaken by the United Nations and our \\\"Blue Helmets\\\". \nThough peaceful, these operations are dangerous. It is not a question of \nmaking war; our mission is a mission of peace. The task, always the same yet \nalways different, must be given all possible support at the local level and \nall available means of suitable protection and defence. \nThere are cases in which we must intervene even though the cease-fire in \nquestion is neither complete nor lasting. There are cases in which, to impose \nrespect, we must have clear rules of engagement binding on everyone. We need \nto define, for specific situations, a right of emergency, comprising measures \nfor warning and protection. My country has several reasons for wanting this, \nas I am sure you will agree. Having become the leading participant in the \npeace-keeping forces, with what will soon be 6,000 men under the United \nNations flag in former Yugoslavia, Cambodia, Lebanon, Western Sahara and \nEl Salvador, France has paid a heavy price. Since the start of the year. \n\neight of its sons have lost their lives, the last ones murdered in cowardly \nfashion. And they have not been the only ones. From this rostrum, I should \nlike to pay a solemn tribute to all the soldiers of peace who have sacrificed \ntheir lives for the cause we all uphold. \nIn the face of the increasing number of crises and the human tragedies \nresulting from them, our world is searching for new stability. It is adapting \nits instruments for peace and solidarity and devising others for the new \ntimes. It is essential that everyone be mobilized, most particularly the \nregional organizations. The Western European Union (WEU) and the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are in the process of shaping their \nfuture. The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) is \nestablishing its jurisdiction. In the wake of the Helsinki summit, France is \nnow proposing to the CSCE member States the adoption of a code of conduct \nwhich would encompass and define the norms governing our collective security. \nThis idea, which was also set out by Germany, could lead to the adoption of a \ntreaty on security. France is also continuing and will continue to advocate \nestablishment of a court of arbitration and conciliation to prevent conflicts. \nIt is fortunate, moreover, that Chapter VIII of the Charter has at last, \nin the space of a few months, taken on its full meaning. I applaud the action \nof our Secretary-General, who has recommended precisely that the States \nmembers of regional organizations contribute to peace-keeping operations. His \nthinking concurred with that of the CSCE at the Helsinki summit and with that \nof France. \nIndeed, the United Nations remains the necessary recourse in all these \ninstances, as the case of former Yugoslavia has shown us only too well. Our \n\nOrganization confers universal legitimacy on peace-keeping operations. It is \nthe United Nations which shoulders, if need be, the overall responsibility. \nHence, what is at stake today is not to relieve the United Nations of its task \nbut to help it perform it in the most effective manner. \nYes, our peace mission is above all a matter of prevention: preventing \nconflicts, or preventing them from worsening and spreading. France therefore \nwelcomed with keen interest the Secretary-General's proposals in his \\\"Agenda \nfor Peace\\\". These set forth in outline form a charter for preventive \ndiplomacy which is urgently needed. \nOnce the Gulf War was over, the President of the French Republic \nunderlined the need for new thinking. I am glad to see that this new thinking \nis now well under way and that France's proposals are being considered. I am \nalso pleased that the European Community is offering specific assistance. \nI should like to confirm today, from this rostrum, France's commitment to \nmake available to the Secretary-General, at any time, a contingent of 1,000 \nmen for a peace-keeping operation. I hope that this example will be followed, \nfor our Organization must be sure that it can react quickly and forcefully as \nsoon as there is a threat of a conflict or a conflict flares up. \nReinforcement of preventive action should also encourage us to continue \nthinking about the reactivation of the United Nations Military Staff \nCommittee. It is important, in any case, to strengthen the links between the \nMember States and the Secretariat Department of Peace-Keeping Operations, \nevery aspect of whose work is deserving of praise. \nPreventive diplomacy, along with the development of peace-keeping \noperations, and the greater role for regional organizations: these are two \nindispensable pillars of the collective security system the world needs today. \n\nBut there is a third one: disarmament. \nAt their summit meeting on 31 January 1992, the members of the Security \nCouncil recalled that disarmament is one of our Organization's priorities and \nhow essential it is for all Member States to fulfil the obligations they have \nundertaken with respect to arms control and disarmament itself. The progress \nachieved in two years has been spectacular: a reduction in stockpiles in \nEurope thanks to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) and \nthe CFE 1-A; the commitment by the two super-Powers to genuine nuclear \ndisarmament, which will be spread over a period of many years; and the \nconvention banning chemical weapons, which for the first time will eliminate \nan entire category of weapons of mass destruction. This disarmament effort is \naccompanied for the first time by a move for transparency: all treaties are \ncoupled with stringent verification procedures, and in Europe we have signed \nan \\\"open sky\\\" treaty providing for free over-flight. Monitoring is the mother \nof all assurances. \nBut the illegal spread of these same weapons threatens to break the \nmomentum for peace. The war against proliferation must be stepped up and \nwaged relentlessly. In this area, as in others. United Nations decisions must \nbe fully respected. New measures will no doubt be necessary, particularly \ngiven the risk of the uncontrolled proliferation of ballistic missiles. To \navert the danger, let us therefore strengthen international cooperation \nwithout delay. \nMy country has in the past put forth proposals from this rostrum to stop \nthe development of an arms race in space. France will shortly propose a \nmeasure to enhance confidence by making it mandatory to give advance notice of \n\nfirings of ballistic missiles and rockets carrying satellites or other space \nobjects. This notification measure, if adopted, would be complemented by the \nestablishment of an international centre, under United Nations auspices, \nresponsible for collecting and using the data received. \n\nIn deciding to suspend its nuclear tests until the end of 1992, France \nhas shown that it is ready to help further the disarmament process. The \nsuspension is temporary and its extension will be subject to reappraisal. Let \nus act so as progressively to reduce the number and power of such experiments \nin a lasting way. France has also made a contribution to disarmament by \nratifying Additional Protocol No. 1 of the Treaty banning nuclear weapons in \nLatin America. In other parts of the world, it supports proposals to \nestablish denuclearized zones, especially in South Asia, the Middle East, and \nAfrica. My country is ready to provide guarantees for security, in \nconjunction with other nuclear Powers, to countries committed to establishing \nsuch zones. \nThis year, the General Assembly begins preparing for the conference on \nextending the non-proliferation Treaty, to be held in 1995. The indefinite \nextension of this Treaty without renegotiation is an important event for \ninternational security. France, which is now a signatory of the \nnon-proliferation Treaty, realizes that the nuclear Powers have a special \ncontribution to make to this goal. France is ready to do its part. \nCollective security is the guard-rail of peace. Its development on an \nequitable basis will be the guarantee for all peoples. \nI shall now touch upon the subject of peace through greater justice by \nmeans of economic and social development. France has consistently said that \nthere can be no lasting peace so long as some peoples are faced with extreme \npoverty and famine. There can be no peace so long as we seem to tolerate \nunacceptable discrepancies in standards of living. There can be no peace \nwithout hope for justice and for progress towards greater equality. \n \nResponsibility for real progress in this direction above all rests with our \nOrganization and its Members, who are continuing to focus their efforts in \nthis direction. \nThe United Nations family in the broadest sense the World Bank, the \nInternational Monetary Fund, and all the specialized agencies is ready to \nassume this responsibility. However, I would like to see the nucleus of the \nfamily, the Secretariat, resume its proper role as a prime mover. What agency \nbetter than the Secretariat can appreciate and evaluate the order of \npriorities, provide the impetus, and avoid duplications and waste? \nBut there can be no sustainable development in a deteriorating \nenvironment. The future of our planet requires ever closer solidarity between \nthe North and South. Such solidarity should enable us to succeed in bringing \nabout equitable development with due respect for the natural gifts of the \nEarth. The success of Rio is encouraging. But let us begin by respecting our \ncommitment to devote at least 0.7 per cent of our gross national product to \nofficial development assistance. France will do so. It has already doubled \nthe amount of its financing to the World Environment Fund and contributed to \nthe establishment of a 20-billion franc programme agreed upon by the European \nCommunity. \nThe General Assembly will shortly take up the Secretary-General's report \non the results of the Rio Conference. It will have to decide among other \nthings on the establishment of a commission for sustainable development that \nwill be the central mechanism for following up the Conference's decisions. \nFrance, which was one of the first States to back the establishment of such a \ncommission, hopes that it will convene at an early date, if possible in 1993, \n \nand that it will begin by examining how the pledges at Rio are to be \nimplemented. Development and the environment remain the two major issues of \nthe years ahead. \nFinally, the social dimension should not be absent from our concerns. \nThe President of the French Republic, on 31 January 1992, gave his full \nsupport to convening a world summit on social development. Let us not forget \nthat man must remain central to our concerns. It is for humanity, through the \nnecessary solidarity among humans, that lasting peace will drive away the \nhatred and wars which still cast a pall over its future. \nI now turn to the subject of peace through solidarity. An important step \nforward has been taken with the progress of humanitarian activities that has \nbeen encouraged and supported by the United Nations. My country, which can \ntake credit for having been a pioneer in this field, therefore welcomes the \nimpetus which has thus been given to humanitarian action. \nThe High Commissioner for Refugees, the Under-Secretary-General for \nHumanitarian Action, and United Nations forces are cooperating in providing \nassistance to populations exposed to violence, be they in Iraq, Yugoslavia, or \nAfrica. A new principle of humanitarian law is taking shape which meets the \naspiration of humanity, including the most unfortunate among its members. It \nwill be to the credit of our Organization, as the end of the century \napproaches, to have helped in this decisive and historic progress transcending \nthe barriers of national jurisdictions and regulations. It was precisely to \nmake such a point that the President of the French Republic went to Sarajevo \nto open the way for the arrival of relief to that martyred city. To lay down \nthe law in this matter is essential; to act is better still. \n\nFrance never tires of repeating that human rights are inalienable. So \nlong as they are not respected, no peace is legitimate. Today still, in too \nmany places, populations are terrorized and minorities maltreated. The World \nConference on Human Rights will be one of the important events and rendezvous \nin 1993. It will be the occasion for us to reaffirm the universality of human \nrights and to strengthen the effectiveness of mechanisms to ensure \ncompliance. Humanitarian action and peace-keeping are necessary functions, \nbut they are needed in specific circumstances. Sooner or later, peoples will \nhave to address the necessity of renewing the ties of their solidarity and \nrebuilding together a space for exchanges and cooperation. Lasting peace \ndepends on this. It is clearly inconceivable that the movement for \nself-determination, which was so earnestly desired, should be judged guilty \nafter the fact of the worst regressions. \nThe example of Yugoslavia is on everybody's mind. Can we tolerate a \nreturn to the most barbaric practices, the very names of which are an insult \nto the human race: the massacre of civilians, detention camps without \nhumanitarian monitoring, \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\"? A solution can only come about \nfrom two distinct measures: on one hand, the establishment of a higher \nframework for arbitration and conciliation; on the other, the protection of \nminorities. The latter, living within recognized borders, should have the \nbenefit of guarantees, equitable representation being one and not the least \nsuch guarantee. \n \nHopes have been raised in places where once everything still seemed to be \nimpossible. I would like here to pay a tribute to men of good will, including \nPrime Minister Panic of Yugoslavia. This is yet another reason to intensify \nour efforts and help the Yugoslav peoples out of their tragic impasse. Let us \nconceive, let us decide, and then let us impose. \nIn Cambodia, a long-suffering people has been making its return to the \ninternational community since the Paris Agreements reached under United \nNations auspices. This progress embodies a great deal of hope for the \nCambodian people and for Asia as a whole, and must not be jeopardized as a \nresult of the refusal of the Khmer Rouge to open up its zone and demobilize \nits forces. There is always room for discussion among partners of good will. \nNo one should use the pretext of his own complaints to try to block a peace \nplan which is binding on all the signatories of the Paris Agreements and, \nbeyond that, upon the entire international community. \nAfter so many years of war in the Middle East, the prospect of a \nsettlement based on justice and security for all is beginning to emerge thanks \nto the courage and clear-sightedness of all the parties. When the time comes, \nthe international community, through the Security Council, will have to give \nits guarantee to a settlement. There is still a long way to go. The European \nCommunity is contributing to this future construction. France is doing its \npart in this. \nIn South Africa, in spite of the terrible traces left by the hateful \nsystem of racial discrimination, the resolve to end apartheid and build a new \nopen city has at last won the day. I would like to express from this rostrum \ntoday France's concern at the rising violence in South Africa and tell the \nleaders of that country: do not destroy the enormous hope you so recently \ninspired. \n\nI shall mention only briefly our old Europe, since its trials and \ntribulations are widely known, as are its bursts of hope. I can say much, \nhowever, in only a few words. The peoples of Europe wish to speed up their \nmarch toward peace, unity and prosperity. Such is the ambition affirmed by \nthe signatories of the Maastricht Treaty - to create a genuine union of \ndemocratic States having the redoubled strength that comes from the \ncombination of cultures, economic means and political resolve, as \nMr. Douglas Hurd said so well when he spoke previously on our behalf. I am \npleased and proud that the French people voted in favour of ratifying the \nEuropean unity treaty. My fellow citizens chose the only future of any value, \na future which will build peace on solidarity political, economic, and human. \nThe European Union will not be inward looking, self-centred, and closed. \nOn the contrary, the citizens of the European Union will be patriots of the \nold continent become the new world. They will have a sense of solidarity \namong themselves, be responsive to their brothers on the rest of the \ncontinent, attached to their respective nations yet firm in the face of any \nheightened national sentiments which invoke nationalism only the better to \ndivide humanity and serve designs of domination and exclusion. \nThe collapse of the wall which separated our continent spurred the \nefforts toward union. Today the difficulties of this Europe, separated from \nus for too long, then liberated, but weakened and troubled, are yet further \nencouragement to us to create this pole of stability on which all Europe will \nbe able to build its peace and prosperity. That Europe will not be \nself-centred. When the time comes, it will welcome its neighbours from \nCentral and Eastern Europe as brothers. Setting the example and opening the \nway are the first steps of true solidarity, that same solidarity which it is \nincumbent on our Organization to implement. The Union will undertake to serve \n \nthe very ideals of our Charter: \\\"We, the peoples of the United Nations\\\" and \nnow, we, the peoples of the European Union. \nI shall now conclude. It is incumbent on Governments, as it is on \npeoples, to set the example. Let us not hide from the fact that peace, like \nlife, has no price but does have a cost. It is unacceptable for the United \nNations to be foundering in an increasingly severe financial crisis. \nCertainly, our Organization has the necessary ambition to express at the \nglobal level that general resolve which Jean-Jacques Rousseau said is more \nthan the simple addition of individual interests. But the sum total will be \nall the greater and all the more universal as the contribution of each and \nevery one is significant and generous. The United Nations will have value \nonly in so far as each State, in compliance with the Charter, fulfils its \nresponsibilities. \nThere can be no better service nor better example to humanity than to \nenable the duty of solidarity to prevail. Let us discharge this duty, first \nof all, by honouring our obligations. Peace is not a gift from heaven; it \ndepends, above all, on human resolve. Thus a new era is opening for nations \nas for peoples. Today, as I speak, it is still in a state of confusion. \nTomorrow, it will shine with the fires of justice, peace and solidarity. \n"

        "file_text": "This session of the General Assembly is \ntaking place at the dawn of a new era. The international structure \nconstructed since the Second World War on the balance of terror between the \nsuper-Powers has broken down. We perceive new opportunities to promote peace \nand to accelerate progress throughout the world. Yet we face new and \nunprecedented problems, both regional and global. \nThe international community must squarely face the challenges and seize \nthe opportunities that the momentous developments of the past few years have \npresented. We must build a peaceful, stable and progressive international \norder on the debris of the cold war, an international order where principles \nof equity and fair play govern the conduct of States, where the weak live \nwithout fear of domination by the strong, where prosperity flourishes and \nwhere human dignity is safeguarded. \nSuch a new international order can come about only through concrete steps \nagreed by the vast majority of the international community. The United \nNations is the only forum where we can concert our actions to construct new \narrangements for global peace and prosperity. The Assembly should take the \ninitiative by adopting an appropriate action plan in this emerging era of \ninternational relations. I should like to take this opportunity to outline \nPakistan's views and suggestions on the elements of such an action plan. \nTo build a new and effective framework for peace and progress, the world \ncommunity must achieve five major objectives. \nThe first objective is the promotion of a structure of global security \nthat ensures the security of both large and small States, of both weak and \npowerful nations. Historically, threats to international peace and stability \n\nhave emanated from the drive for power and hegemony sustained by the \naccumulation of massive military arsenals. An international order based on \nhegemony will always remain unstable, because it is unjust. The challenge \nbefore us is to build a new international structure that would check the \nhegemonic ambitions of the powerful nations and promote disarmament at global \nand regional levels. Only through such measures can we create a just and \nstable order ensuring global and regional peace and security. Such a \nstructure presupposes the revitalization of the United Nations on democratic \nlines to regulate inter-State conduct in conformity with recognized principles \nof inter-State behaviour, particularly the exercise of the right of peoples to \nself-determination, respect for the sovereign equality and territorial \nintegrity of States, non-interference in internal affairs, non-use of force in \ninternational relations and peaceful resolution of international disputes. \nA comprehensive programme of disarmament at global and regional levels \nconstitutes the second pillar of a stable structure of international security. \nSignificant reductions in weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear \nweapons, leading ultimately to their total elimination, and in conventional \narsenals are essential elements of the disarmament process. Pending the total \nelimination of weapons of mass destruction, their proliferation must be \narrested. We have welcomed the agreements between the United States and the \nRussian Federation which will reduce their strategic nuclear arsenals by \nhalf, in the present conditions of instability, further reduction of these \nnuclear warheads is a pressing priority. Pakistan hopes that their number \nwill be drastically cut, leading to their eventual elimination all over the \nglobe. This is no longer a Utopian goal. \n\nUntil complete nuclear disarmament has been achieved, the nuclear-weapon \nPowers are under the obligation to assure the non-nuclear-weapon States \nagainst the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. With the end of the cold \nwar, there is no reason why such assurances cannot be extended to the \nnon-nuclear-weapon States unconditionally and in a legally binding manner. \nAn essential element in the programme for nuclear disarmament is the \nacceptance by all States of a permanent ban on nuclear-weapon testing. The \nabsence of a comprehensive nuclear-test ban will, in the long run, compromise \nthe goal of nuclear non-proliferation. We further believe that the conclusion \nof nuclear-test-ban agreements among regional States in different parts of the \nworld not only would facilitate the conclusion of a comprehensive \nnuclear-test-ban treaty but would also act as an important confidence-buildinq \nmeasure at regional levels. \nDisarmament and non-proliferation are two sides of the same coin. \nPakistan fully agrees that the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other \nweapons of mass destruction would increase the danger to world peace and \nsecurity. Non-proliferation measures can gain universal credibility and \nacceptance if their scope and application are comprehensive and \nnon-discriminatory. This pre-condition applies as much to nuclear \nnon-proliferation as it does to the endeavour to control the spread of medium-\nand long-range missiles. \nWith the end of the cold war and tangible progress in arms reductions \nbetween the two pre-eminent nuclear Powers, the urgency of promoting regional \ndisarmament is greater than ever before. Today threats to peace arise largely \nfrom regional discords and divisions. The armaments race is increasingly \nacquiring a regional dimension. Global peace and security will remain in \n \njeopardy unless greater attention is paid to regional security concerns. In \nrecognition of this reality, the United Nations has begun to focus on the need \nto promote disarmament at the regional level. This is evidenced by the \nadoption at the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly of the resolution \non regional disarmament by an overwhelming majority. This approach also \nfeatured prominently in the deliberations of the Disarmament Commission at its \nlast session. This trend needs to be encouraged and strengthened. \nPakistan fully subscribes to the objectives of the draft Convention on \nthe prohibition of chemical weapons, which has been transmitted to the General \nAssembly by the Conference on Disarmament. We completely share the resolve of \nthe international community to banish forever this hideous instrument of \nwarfare. However, the draft Convention contains some provisions that cause us \nconcern. It remains our hope that these shortcomings will be redressed to \nensure universal adherence to this truly landmark document. \nThe second objective of an action plan for peace and progress should be \nto promote the fullest application of the principle of self-determination. \n \nThe principle of self-determination is the bedrock of the present system \nof international relations between sovereign, independent States. Over the \npast 45 years, the exercise of this right has led to the independence of the \nmajority of the States represented in this Hall. All peoples under colonial \nor alien domination or foreign occupation are entitled to self-determination. \nThis has been repeatedly recognized by the United Nations. \nThe process of self-determination remains incomplete. In its resolutions \nof 1948 and 1949 the Security Council decided that the future of Jammu and \nKashmir should be determined in accordance with the wishes of its people, to \nbe expressed in a free and fair plebiscite under United Nations auspices. \nPakistan and India both undertook to implement those resolutions. That was \nthe first time that the Council set out the actual process by which the right \nof self-determination was to be exercised. It is ironic and sad that the \nfirst resolutions of the Security Council providing for the exercise of the \nright of self-determination remain unimplemented. \nThe passage of a generation has not extinguished the desire for \nself-determination in Kashmir. It is the children of 1947 who are now \nsacrificing their lives in the struggle for Kashmir's freedom from Indian \nrule. Since 1990 more than 10,000 Kashmiri men, women and children have been \nkilled. According to Amnesty International, an estimated 15,000 citizens are \nin prisons and torture cells in Kashmir. The brutal repression unleashed by a \nsecurity force, of over 400,000 has failed to break the spirit of the Kashmiri \npeople. Pakistan cannot remain indifferent to their sufferings. We will \ncontinue to extend full moral, diplomatic and political support to the \nstruggle of the Kashmiri people for self-determination. \n\nPeace and tranquillity cannot return to South Asia unless this \noutstanding dispute is resolved. Pakistan has proposed to India the \ncommencement of a bilateral dialogue in accordance with the Simla Agreement to \nreach a final settlement of the Kashmir dispute on the basis of the United \nNations resolutions. We hope this dialogue can start without further delay. \nWe call upon the international community to persuade India to desist from \nits policy of suppression and to enter into a serious dialogue with us with a \nview to resolving this dispute in accordance with the resolutions of the \nSecurity Council and in the spirit of the Simla Agreement. \nMay I also urge the Secretary-General to use his high office to persuade \nIndia to desist from the path of violence and suppression against the Kashmiri \npeople and to allow them the exercise of their right to self-determination as \nenvisaged in the Security Council resolutions. Attempts by India to portray \nthe 45-year-old just struggle of the Kashmiri people in terms of external \ninterference are aimed at distorting the historical facts and should therefore \nbe rejected outright. \nI reiterate before the Assembly Pakistan's long-standing proposal to \nstation impartial observers along the line of control to investigate and \nverify accusations of interference. We made this proposal in all sincerity \nand are convinced that such a mechanism would help establish the correct \nposition beyond any shadow of doubt. That position is that the uprising in \nIndian-held Kashmir is entirely indigenous and spontaneous. Indeed, India's \npersistent rejection of our proposal exposes the hollowness of its allegations. \nThe people of Palestine too have been denied their right to \nself-determination. Pakistan shares the hope that the current Middle East \npeace process will lead to a just and comprehensive settlement in the Middle \n\nEast based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). \nPakistan also shares the view that the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all \nArab and Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, including Al-Quds \nAl-Sharif, and the exercise of the right to self-determination by the \nPalestinian people are essential to ensure a durable peace in the Middle East. \nIn South Africa, some progress has been made towards eliminating \napartheid. However, the recent violence threatens to disrupt the negotiating \nprocess. The South African Government must shoulder its responsibility for \nsalvaging the negotiations by taking immediate steps to stop the bloodshed and \nbring to book those responsible for the recent massacres. Meanwhile, \ninternational pressure against South Africa should be maintained until the \npositive changes introduced in the last two years become irreversible and the \nSouth African people's struggle for justice, equality and majority rule is \nfinally crowned with success. \nPakistan fully supports the efforts of the Secretary-General in \nimplementing the peace settlement in Cambodia. We call upon all Cambodian \nfactions to cooperate with the United Nations in creating conditions conducive \nto the establishment of a national Government in Cambodia. Pakistan's \ncommitment to the Cambodian peace settlement is evidenced by its substantial \ncontribution to the United Nations Transition Authority in Cambodia, to which \nwe have provided a full infantry battalion. \nThe valiant people of Afghanistan have finally regained control over \ntheir destiny. On 28 April 1992 an interim Afghan Government assumed power in \nKabul. Pakistan congratulates the people of Afghanistan on their triumph and \npledges to them its complete support and cooperation in the arduous task of \nnation-building and reconstruction. We are determined to develop close and \n\ncooperative relations with Afghanistan on the basis of sovereign equality and \nmutual respect. It is our sincere hope that the process of reconciliation in \nAfghanistan will be accelerated and that the people of that country will be \nable to live in peace and harmony. We urge the international community to \nmake its due contribution to the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the \nrehabilitation of the returning refugees, as well as to the maintenance of the \nremaining millions of refugees in Pakistan and Iran. For its part, Pakistan \nis ready to make its contribution to the gigantic task of rebuilding the \nwar-ravaged Afghan economy. \nPakistan welcomes the new Members of the United Nations: Armenia, \nAzerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, \nMoldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Their \npresence in this Hall is a source of strength for the United Nations. \nUnfortunately, one of these new Member States is being subjected to \nbrutal aggression. This world body must strongly oppose this aggression. We \ncall on the Security Council to take action, including the use of force under \nArticle 42 of the Charter, to reverse the Serbian aggression and restore the \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia \ndeserves assistance in accordance with the Charter's provisions on \nself-defence. The Security Council should lift sanctions to enable Bosnia to \nreceive such assistance. We further urge that an international tribunal be \nestablished immediately to prosecute and punish the reported war crimes by \nSerbian forces, including the genocidal practice of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\". The \nworld community must also make more determined efforts to ensure that \nhumanitarian assistance reaches the suffering people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \n\nPakistan holds the view that the former Socialist Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia has ceased to exist. Serbia and Montenegro, therefore, should not \nbe allowed to take the seat of the former Yugoslavia in the United Nations. \nThe third objective we must promote in an action plan is the \nestablishment of viable structures for regional peace and security as \nenvisaged in Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. With the end of the \ncold war, threats to peace and security are most likely to be regional rather \nthan global in origin and dimension. It is, therefore, in the regional \ncontext that the barricades against war must be constructed. \nPakistan desires good-neighbourly relations with India. We want to \ndevote our energies to the vital task of economic and social development. We \nwant our people to live in dignity. These goals cannot be attained unless a \nclimate of trust and cooperation prevails in South Asia. \nIn South Asia, as elsewhere, a balance in the military capabilities of \nthe regional States is essential to build and maintain a viable structure of \npeace and security. Pakistan has made proposals to India for a regional or \nbilateral agreement to ensure nuclear non-proliferation, the total prohibition \nof all weapons of mass destruction, and mutual and balanced reduction of the \nconventional forces of the two countries. \n\nPakistan and India have concluded agreements not to attack each other's \nnuclear facilities and on prior notification of military exercises and \nprevention of air violations. Recently, we also signed a declaration on the \ntotal prohibition of chemical weapons. \nRegrettably, India remains unresponsive to the proposals aimed at \nensuring nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia and bringing about a mutual \nand balanced reduction of conventional forces. It continues to vote against \nthe proposal for establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia, which \nhas been repeatedly endorsed by the Assembly. India has yet to accept the \nproposal for talks involving the United States, the Russian Federation and \nChina, as well as India and Pakistan, to ensure nuclear non-proliferation in \nSouth Asia. All the other proposed participants have responded positively to \nthe proposal. \nPakistan stands at the crossroads of South Asia, Central Asia, China, \nWest Asia and the Gulf. In the past, this region was the subject of the great \ngame between rival imperialist Powers. With the end of the cold war and the \nemergence of the independent republics of Central Asia, Pakistan hopes to \nserve as a link between interlocking structures for economic and commercial \ncooperation in these adjacent regions of Asia. The admission of the Central \nAsian States in the Economic Cooperation Organization, grouping Pakistan, Iran \nand Turkey, will help towards the emergence of the region as a vibrant \neconomic entity. Pakistan enjoys close fraternal relations with the member \nStates of the Gulf Cooperation Council and we hope to promote cooperation and \nmoderation in the Gulf region. Similarly, the South Asian Association for \nRegional Cooperation can make a positive contribution to the evolution of a \nnew era in the relations among the regional States. \n \nThreats to the security of the littoral and hinterland States of the \nIndian Ocean arise mainly due to large disparities in their military \ncapabilities. The Prime Minister of Pakistan has proposed a conference of the \nlittoral and hinterland States to agree upon measures for strengthening \nregional peace and security. The maintenance of an equitable balance in the \nland, air and naval forces of the regional States is an essential prerequisite \nfor achieving this objective. The Assembly should suggest appropriate \nguidelines to the United Nations Committee on the Indian Ocean to evolve a new \nframework for peace and security in that strategic region. \nA fourth and essential objective of the Action Plan for Peace and \nProgress must be to revive global economic growth and restructure \ninternational economic relations on a just and equitable basis. As the \nSecretary-General has pointed out in his report on the work of the \nOrganization: \n\\\"Political progress and economic development are inseparable: both \nare equally important and must be pursued simultaneously\\\". \n(A/47/1, para. 64) \nGrowth in the world economy has been imbalanced. The gap between the \ndeveloped and the developing countries has increased. The incidence of \nabsolute poverty is growing. Recurrent economic recessions have reinforced \ntrade protectionism and frozen the level of development assistance.- This, \ncombined with the crushing burden of the external debt-servicing of the \ndeveloping countries, has led to the invidious phenomenon of negative resource \nflows. \nWe cannot allow growing economic disparities in an increasingly \ninterdependent world in which destinies of nations are linked. Further \ndeprivation in the third world can endanger international peace and \n \nstability. On the other hand, the integration of the developing countries in \nthe world's financial and trading system can contribute immensely to global \noutput, as we have witnessed in East Asia. Indeed, there is a unique \nopportunity today to create a truly global economy, since the developing \ncountries, as well as the Central and Eastern European States, have adopted \nthe principles of free markets and open trade. \nPakistan recommends the following steps to revive world economic growth \nand improve the plight of the developing countries. First, the major \nindustrialized countries should take the policy actions required in the fiscal \nand monetary fields to revive global growth and break out of the current \nrecession. Second, they must overcome the special interests that are pressing \nfor protectionism, and conclude the Uruguay Round without further delay. \nThird, the debt burden of the developing countries should be effectively \nameliorated. Countries that have scrupulously serviced their debts, imposing \na great sacrifice on their peoples, could be offered relief through generous \nbalance-of-payments support. Fourth, the developing countries should be \nprovided preferential access in the regional trade areas in Europe and North \nAmerica. Fifth, financial resources must be generated to meet the development \nneeds of the poorest countries. Sixth, the developed countries should support \nmechanisms designed to stabilize commodity prices, including agricultural \ncommodities. Seventh, an extensive programme of technical assistance and \ntraining should be undertaken in the developing countries to enhance their \ncapacity to implement economic and social development projects. Eighth, \nadditional resources and technology should be made available to integrate \nenvironmental and socio-economic objectives for sustainable development in \naccordance with the commitments of the Rio Conference. \n\nAs the current Chairman of the Group of 77, Pakistan will work to evolve \ncommon positions for the developing countries on all the major economic \nissues, including the follow-up of the United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development and the reform and revitalization of the \nOrganization in economic and social fields. We also look forward to \nconstructive cooperation with our developed-country partners. \nThe present Government of Pakistan has introduced a free-market \nrevolution in the country. We are seeking economic growth by releasing the \ndynamism of our private sector. These reforms are based on deregulation and \nprivatization. We have offered generous incentives for investment, including \nforeign investment. We have encouraged export-led growth. The response to \nthese reforms has been most heartening. Private investment has accelerated; \nour exports have continued to increase despite the global economic slowdown. \nThe Pakistan economy has grown by over 6 per cent annually during the past few \nyears despite the constraints of a drastic structural adjustment programme. \nUnfortunately, heavy floods have dealt Pakistan a severe blow. Over \n2,000 people have perished. The damage to our public infrastructure, private \nproperty, and agriculture is estimated in the billions of dollars. We have \nfully mobilized our governmental machinery to recover from the effects of this \nnatural calamity. We greatly appreciate the international expressions of \nsympathy and support. We are grateful for the assistance offered to Pakistan \nby the world community for relief and rehabilitation in flood-affected areas. \nPakistanis are a resilient people and are facing this natural calamity with \ncourage. \nThe final and vital objective of our Action Plan should be to strengthen \nthe role and effectiveness of the United Nations itself in the areas of \n\ninternational security, economic and social development and human rights. \nPakistan welcomes the renewed confidence reposed in the United Nations \nsecurity role by the major Powers. This is, indeed, as the Secretary-General \nhas said, a second chance for the international community to build the system \nof collective security envisaged in the Charter. . The Security Council can act \nas a credible deterrent to aggression against smaller and weaker States. \nWhere aggression does occur, the Council can be the agent for the rapid \nrestoration of peace and the redress of injustice. \nWhile the revival of the Security Council has already been celebrated, we \nmust acknowledge that its determination in responding to aggression has not \nbeen uniform. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, for instance, Serbian aggression \ncould have been checked more effectively. The Council's decisions will \npossess credibility only if they are perceived to be fair and \nnon-discriminatory, in strict conformity with the purposes and principles of \nthe United Nations Charter. The actions of the Security Council will gain \nsupport if its procedures and processes are democratic and transparent. We \nshould resist efforts to create new centres of privilege. \nWe broadly endorse the Secretary-General's recommendations in his report \nentitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" regarding the United Nations role in preventive \ndiplomacy, peace-making and peace-keeping. We particularly agree with him \nthat conflict-prone situations should be identified at an early stage and that \nthe United Nations should play an active role for their peaceful settlement. \nPakistan strongly endorses greater resort by Member States to the procedures \nfor mediation, conciliation and arbitration provided in Chapter VI of the \nUnited Nations Charter. \n\nPakistan's participation in several United Nations peace-keeping \noperations reflects our unqualified support for United Nations peace-keeping \nactivities. As a gesture of solidarity with our brothers in Somalia, Pakistan \nhas provided the United Nations operation in Somalia with an infantry \nbattalion along with vehicles and equipment. Pakistan is prepared to \ndesignate specific units of its armed forces for rapid deployment in the \nservice of the United Nations. \nWe believe that the General Assembly must also be enabled to play a more \neffective role in the promotion both of international peace and security and \nof economic and social progress. Our agenda must be rationalized. The \ndecisions of the General Assembly must also gain in credibility and \nresponsibility. Member States should observe and implement all resolutions of \nthe General Assembly, especially those which are adopted by consensus. \nThe Charter envisaged that the United Nations would play a central role \nin promoting economic and social progress and development. The world \nOrganization now requires even greater support in order to be able to respond \nto the host of new global issues confronting mankind population, \nenvironment, drugs and international migration. The response of the United \nNations membership to these issues will shape the political, economic and \nsocial structures of the twenty-first century. \nThe United Nations will lose its second chance to realize its potential \nif it continues to be denied the financial resources required to discharge its \ngrowing responsibilities. At this Assembly, we should give serious \nconsideration to ways and means of ensuring adequate financing for all the \nactivities of the United Nations. \nIt is the hope of the Pakistan delegation that the forty-seventh session \nof the General Assembly will adopt an action plan for peace and prosperity. \n\nWe should endeavour to reach specific decisions to restructure international \nrelations by the fiftieth anniversary session of the General Assembly. This \nwould be an appropriate occasion to launch the world Organization on its \njourney towards the vision of peace, justice and progress reflected in the \nCharter of the United Nations. \nAt this critical session of our Assembly, we are very happy to have \nsomeone with your wide diplomatic experience and wisdom as its President. I \nam confident that you will make a vital contribution to the success of our \ndeliberations on the major issues of our time. Your predecessor. \nAmbassador Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, has established a superb record of \nachievements, for which I would like to congratulate him warmly. \nOur Organization is most fortunate to have a new Secretary-General who, \nwith his distinguished academic and diplomatic experience, can comprehend the \nstrong currents of history flowing in these times. He has already manifested \nhis political courage in defence of justice, equity and peace. The Pakistan \ndelegation reposes full confidence in the ability of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali \nto guide the membership of the United Nations towards the new era of peace and \nprosperity which we all wish to see emerge from the debris of the cold war. \n"

        "file_text": "The delegation of \nthe Republic of Mali, which I have the honour to lead, welcomes your \noutstanding election, Sir, to the presidency of the General Assembly at its \nforty-seventh session. We are convinced that your great skills as a diplomat \nwill enable you to guide the work of our Assembly wisely and effectively. I \ncan assure you that you will receive our full cooperation throughout this \nsession. \nWe also warmly congratulate your predecessor, Ambassador Shihabi, \nPermanent Representative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the United Nations, \nwho presided over the work of the forty-sixth session with remarkable \nefficiency. \nFinally, we are pleased to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved \ntribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who is working tirelessly for the strengthening of \nthe United Nations, the maintenance of peace, and the flourishing of our \nOrganization. \nMy delegation welcomes the new Member States, whose presence here \nconfirms the universality of our Organization and the inestimable value of the \nideals and principles contained in the Charter. \nMy country, Mali, has undergone profound political changes over the last \ntwo years. On 26 March 1991, at the cost of enormous sacrifice but with \nclarity of purpose, our people brought a monolithic dictatorial regime to an \nend. The united actions of democratic forces made it possible to organize a \ntransition, to ensure the normal functioning of elections, and to establish \nthe institutions of the Third Republic. Thus the National Conference held in \nBamako from 29 July to 12 August 1991 drew up the fundamental instruments for \n\nthe Third Republic of Mali. The democratic process has continued in \naccordance with a precise electoral timetable, drawn up with the contributions \nand assistance of all the country's political forces. The campaigning of some \n40 political parties confirmed the irreversible commitment of the country \ntowards a political opening which is unprecedented in the history of modern \nMali. \nThe election of the President of the Third Republic, His Excellency \nMr. Alpha Oumar Konare, and his official appointment on 8 June 1992 are the \nculmination of long years of struggle and sacrifice of an entire people. A \nnew Coalition Government is in place and a National Assembly made up of 11 \npolitical parties is working to strengthen the administration, the rule of law \nand respect for human rights in the Republic of Mali. \nTo conclude this chapter, I should like to express the profound gratitude \nof the people and the Government of Mali to friendly countries and to \ninternational organizations and agencies, in particular the United Nations \nsystem, for their valuable advice and their excellent contributions to the \nvarious electoral consultations which led to the establishment of a pluralist \ndemocracy. \nThe young Malian democracy was nevertheless born with a serious handicap, \nthat of the burdensome heritage of a past of several decades of dictatorship, \nbad management, a single-party system and quasi-indifference to the suffering \nof the population. This intolerable political situation, aggravated by the \nimpact of the drought and by continuing deterioration of living conditions in \narid zones, finally led to a rebellion among the nomadic population in the \nnorth in 1990. To resolve this painful problem the Government decided on a \nnegotiated solution. Algerian mediation, along with assistance from friendly \n\ncountries and from certain eminent foreign personalities, made it possible for \nus to create an atmosphere of mutual trust. Thus on 11 April 1992 in Bamako a \nNational Pact was signed, between the Government and all of these rebel \nmovements, before the nation and the whole of Africa and in the presence of \nrepresentatives from all continents. This agreement was accepted by all \nparties as an instrument of peace, solidarity and national unity. \nThe agreement is first an act of national will, a plan of action to \ncombat drought and desertification, and as such falls within the scope of \nAgenda 21. It is also a plan for agropastoral development requiring the use \nof technologies adapted to arid and semi-arid zones and calling for the \nre-establishment of populations in a damaged and vulnerable environment. It \nis an integrated programme for human development designed to unleash the \ninitiative and production potential of men and women living in these areas. \nFinally, it includes a strict respect for sovereignty and the territorial \nintegrity of our country, but also a recognition of the right to diversity. \nThe fresh hope it has stirred and its implementation require the \nmobilization of major resources that greatly exceed our own capacities. That \nis why my Government appeals to the international community, to governmental \nand non-governmental organizations involved in cooperation, and to the good \nwill of all to help us to implement the various programmes under the \nagreement. The National Pact remains for my country the ideal means for \nensuring peace and security, indispensable conditions for our development. \nThis development is imperative, and everything will be done by the Mali \nGovernment to ensure the full implementation of all aspects of the agreement. \nWe should like the same to hold for all signatories old and new alike. The \nMali of today which respects human rights stresses dialogue and rejects \n \nviolence as a means of expression. Our young democracy allows all its sons \nand daughters to express themselves freely and to defend their interests \nwithin the framework of political parties or associations. This context must, \nfirstly, permit the reconciliation of hearts and spirits; secondly, it must \nconsolidate the peace which has been restored and thus ensure resumption of \nthe development activities in the northern regions of our country which, for \nlack of security, had been abandoned over the last two years by most of our \ndevelopment partners. \nBut neither the problem of the north nor the economic difficulties of the \ncountry have hampered the will or the determination of our people to take \ncharge of and succeed in their development. These are signs of hope and \npledges of success that the new conditions of democracy will reinforce. \nThe deterioration in the political situation in certain parts of the \nworld is of concern to our delegation. At a time when the international \ncommunity thought it had seen the last of the great human tragedies which have \nlong darkened many regions of the world, now societies of old civilizations \nhave been drawn into the whirlwind of fratricidal conflicts. \nMali is concerned by the situation existing in the Horn of Africa, in \nparticular in Somalia. In addition to drought, the escalation of violence in \ntenacious rivalries of factions confronting one another desperately and, \napparently, without any real justification, has subjected the Somali \npopulation to terrible suffering. Food shortages, endemic famine and \nmalnutrition, and refugees flowing into neighbouring countries are all \nsituations requiring more intensive humanitarian intervention by the United \nNations to support the praiseworthy efforts of the Organization of African \nUnity and of many others of good will. \n \nIn South Africa, the delicate process of change towards the establishment \nof a State based on law and on fundamental principles of democracy and of \nrespect for human rights remains fragile in many respects. The negotiations \nin the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) offer an opening we \nheartily welcome. But the violence that has been provoked and encouraged by \nthe enemies of change threatens to delay the advent of a free, democratic and \nmultiracial South Africa. \nA lessening in diplomatic isolation and the progressive lifting of \neconomic and sports sanctions are gestures of goodwill by the international \ncommunity. It is thus time for the South African Government to explore the \nopportunities offered to it to assume its responsibilities all of its \nresponsibilities in order to halt the cycle of violence and to create \nconditions conducive to genuine negotiations.* \nIn addition, the serious crisis afflicting Liberia for several years \ncontinues despite the efforts of the Heads of State of the Economic Community \nof West African States (ECOWAS). Mali hopes that the relevant decisions taken \nat the ECOWAS Summit in Dakar will be honoured by all the parties to this \nfratricidal conflict so that the West African subregion can regain its balance \nand stability. \n\nMy delegation is pleased that in Angola the process of national \nreconciliation has made it possible to establish a true democratic process, \nthus finally bringing a long-lasting tragedy to an end. \nAs regards Mozambique, we hope that consultation and dialogue will \nprevail over the use of arms. \nThe sensitive question of Western Sahara remains pending as we await the \nimplementation of all the provisions of the United Nations peace plan. Mali \nurges all the parties concerned to let consensual approaches prevail in \ndealing with that thorny problem so as to enable the United Nations to \naccomplish its mission. \nThe breakup of Yugoslavia has taken the form of a cruel ethnic war, which \nhas led the United Nations to increase its initiatives in order to put an end \nto the tragedy of millions of elderly people, women and children. \nOne of the oldest conflicts, that of the Middle East, which our \nOrganization has dealt with for several decades, has seen encouraging \ndevelopments with the opening and continuation of Israeli-Arab negotiations. \nThe international community must encourage the process that is under way, so \nthat contacts will lead to a just and lasting peace. For our part, Mali \nreaffirms its support for any initiative leading to a comprehensive and \nlasting solution to that conflict, which must necessarily include, first, \nIsrael's full withdrawal from the occupied territories; secondly, the \nrecognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and \nindependence; and thirdly, the right of all States in the region to exist \nwithin secure and recognized borders. \nWe are pleased to note that the United Nations peace plan in Cambodia is \nnow operational. This is proof that perseverance, mutual trust and dialogue \nare effective weapons in preventive diplomacy. \n\nTurning to the Korean peninsula, Mali, which maintains good relations \nwith both Koreas, encourages the process of direct negotiations embarked upon \nby both parties with a view to the peaceful reunification of the Korean \nhomeland. \nIndeed, all round the world, Mali hopes for the restoration of peace \nthrough dialogue and agreement. Once rid of the spectre of violence and war, \nthe United Nations will be able to devote its human, technical and financial \npotential to the noble objectives of economic and social development, so much \nneeded by the world. \nWhile, politically, the beginning of the 1990s has ushered in an era of \ndemocracy for many developing countries, and most particularly for those in \nAfrica, the economic situation of our countries remains extremely critical. \nIndeed, unlike the industrialized countries, where we have seen a recovery in \neconomic activity under the triple impact of a decrease in interest rates, the \nreturn of oil prices to a level close to that existing before the crisis and \nthe effective coordination of economic policies, in developing countries the \nsituation has been marked, overall, by continuing serious economic and \nfinancial difficulties, deterioration of the terms of trade, a scarcity of \nfinancial resources for private investment, debt burden and grave doubts \nregarding the conclusions of multilateral trade negotiations and the threat of \nprotectionism. In order to prevent the profound imbalances augured by that \nsituation, our countries agreed to carry out structural adjustment reforms in \norder to open themselves up more to the world economy. However, we remain \nconvinced that in order to emerge from the crisis and at the same time save \nour democratic experience, international solidarity must be made manifest. It \nmust develop rapidly and be equal to the problems to be solved. \n \nThe international community must strive to free up, for the poorest \ncountries, sufficient resources to correct the imbalances in our economies, to \nmitigate the effects of adjustment on the most vulnerable sectors and to \npermit the financing of priority programmes for basic development. \nHopes for reforms in international economic relations to reduce \ninequalities between the developed and the developing countries are, \nunfortunately, still being frustrated by a lack of progress in the \nestablishment of an appropriate North-South dialogue. South-South cooperation \nand subregional economic cooperation, enabling developing countries to \novercome certain difficulties through a rational use of their \ncomplementarities can also help to reopen the irreplaceable North-South \ndialogue. \nSome progress has been achieved in subregional economic integration, but \nour Organization must support that process by formulating policies that will \ncreate common economic configurations at the subregional level. It is for all \nthese reasons that the Government of Mali strongly supports the spirit of \nstructural reform and supports the efforts of the Secretary-General in this \ncontext. \nAs a Sahelian country, Mali was pleased with the holding of the Earth \nSummit in Rio de Janeiro and is pleased with its pertinent recommendations. \nThis is an opportunity for us to recall that in the face of the serious \nthreats hanging over our planet, the international community as a whole must \nset up, for its own survival, collective management of the environment that is \nmore responsible than it has been in the past, that is fairer and truly \nuniversal. To that end it must undertake vigorous action to put an end to the \nuse of the countries in the South as dumps for toxic and nuclear waste from \n\nindustrialized countries. By the same token, we must help countries to combat \ndesertification, pollution and all other processes that are likely to threaten \nthe human habitat. \nOur Organization has contributed to the consolidation of security and \ncooperation among nations. It has never been so active and effective in the \nservice of peace. However, our most ardent desire is to see it evolve towards \ngreater democracy so as to respond to the major changes that have occurred \nrecently on the international scene. That democratization comes, necessarily, \nthrough taking into account all the interests of all the components of the \nUnited Nations in future reforms. \nHumanity finds itself at a stage in its history that requires the \ninternational community to display pragmatism, creativity and solidarity; in \nbrief, it must develop a fruitful system of partnership. Never in this \nrespect has mankind possessed so many human and technological assets. \nThus, we must build together a new international order based on equity \nand justice."

        "file_text": "Allow me at the \noutset. Sir, to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the \ncurrent session of the General Assembly. There is no doubt that your \ndiplomatic experience will lead our deliberations to a successful conclusion. \nAllow me also to take this opportunity to thank and congratulate \nHis Excellency Ambassador Samir Shihabi and the members of his Bureau for the \nexemplary manner in which they steered the work of the forty-sixth session. \nWe are quite fortunate to have at the head of the United Nations \nOrganization so highly qualified and skilful a statesman as \nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has assumed the responsibilities \nof this international Organization at a most sensitive and crucial time in \ninternational relations. \nSince his recent assumption of his office, his administrative skills and \nabilities and the structural reforms he has carried out have shown that he is \n\na worthy successor to his capable predecessor. We thank him for his devoted \nefforts, especially in areas of unrest and tension, and wish him continued \nsuccess. \nThe forty-seventh session of the General Assembly is convened in a \npromising climate that augurs well for international relations. The \ndiscernible features of the political scene have been drastically \ntransformed. Confrontation has disappeared, giving way to great expectations \nand aspirations regarding an unshakable belief in the basic rights of man, the \nupholding of justice and the social and economic development of peoples in the \ncontext of a new world order. \nThe prevalent international climate provides us with a rare opportunity \nto give priority to human solidarity and cooperation over any other \nconsideration in order for us to establish that new world order on the secure \nfoundations of peace, mutual security and respect, and the promotion of the \nrule of law in inter-State relations. \nThe hopes and aspirations focused on the new world order, require, more \nthan ever, that the Member States work together, analyse the current trends \nand channel them, as much as possible, towards the realization of the \nexpectations this new world order has given rise to, through a number of \neffective joint actions of solidarity and cooperation that would be more \neffective than mere protestations of good wishes and good intentions. \nIt is encouraging to note that the universality of the United Nations is \nbeing enhanced day after day. Since the last session of the General Assembly, \nthirteen more States have acceded to the membership of the Organization, \nnamely Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kazakhstan, \nKyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Georgia. \n\nWe welcome the admission of these 13 States to our Organization for, in \naddition to its significance for the principle of the universality of the \nOrganization, they will no doubt enrich our debates with valuable insights and \nviews. \nMy country welcomes these new Members to the United Nations and wishes \nthem and their peoples every progress and prosperity. \nThe Gulf, in view of its God-given strategic, economic and cultural \nimportance, has always been the focus of the attention of numerous States. \nOver the past decade and at the outset of the present one, the region has been \nexposed to grave security and environmental dangers, from the eruption of the \nIran-Iraq war to the tragedy of the Iraqi occupation of the sister State of \nKuwait. Thanks to God and to the solidarity of the international community, \nwe have been able to overcome these tribulations. \nHowever, the remnants of regional disputes and residues of traditional \nhatreds have the ability to contribute to the instability of the region. \nHence, we, in the Sultanate of Oman, proceeding from our keen interest in \nencouraging the factors of stability in the region, and seeking the security \nto which we all aspire, feel that it is high time efforts of all States in the \nregion, without exception, were devoted to prepare for a new phase of \nunderstanding and fraternity. This will be achieved only through a sincere \nexamination and analysis of what has happened and sincere efforts to overcome \nthe effects of the past and heal its many wounds. \nAt the beginning of this month, the United Arab Emirates announced that \nefforts they had exerted vis-a-vis the Islamic Republic of Iran this year have \nfailed. The aim was to achieve an amicable understanding regarding Oman's \n \nsovereign rights over three islands in the Gulf: Abu Moussa, Greater Tanb and \nSmaller Tanb. The Sultanate of Oman is gravely concerned over the prospects \nof negative developments in this situation. \nProceeding from our belief in the principles of the Charter of the United \nNations regarding the respect for sovereignty of States, non-interference in \nthe internal affairs of others and peaceful settlement of disputes, we have \nconfirmed the rights of the United Arab Emirates in this regard, as did the \nother Arab States and now call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran, with whom we \nhave friendly ties and mutual interests, to settle this dispute by peaceful \nmeans in a manner that would guarantee the rights and common interests of the \nStates in the Gulf Cooperation Council. \nThe problem of Palestine has been the major factor underlying the \ntragedies and wars witnessed by the peoples of the Middle East region. Peace \nand stability in this important and delicate region cannot be achieved without \nfinding a solution to this problem, which is the crux of the Arab-Israeli \nconflict. \nMy country supports the sincere efforts being made to find a lasting, \njust and peaceful solution, which would take into account the interests of all \nparties in the region on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) \nand 338 (1973) and the principle of land-for-peace. \nProceeding from this, my country has participated in the International \nPeace Conference on the Middle East sponsored by the United States of America \nand the Russian Federation. My country has also participated in the \nmultilateral negotiations of the Conference and the Working Groups thereof, \nout of its belief in the importance of supporting direct negotiations, which \nare the basis and essence of the Conference as a means of contributing to the \n\nachievement of regional security, cooperation and confidence-building among \nStates in the region and thereby contributing to the safeguarding of the \ninterests of all parties. \nThe recent developments witnessed by the region, in addition to what has \nbeen achieved in the sixth round of the Arab-Israeli talks and the \nmultilateral negotiations held recently in Washington and Moscow, have created \ncircumstances that are more favourable than ever for the achievement of a \npermanent and just solution that would bring peace to the area. Therefore, we \ncall upon all parties to exert more efforts and show more patience and \nflexibility in order to achieve the permanent and lasting peace to which the \npeoples of the region have long aspired. \nThe Middle East region has witnessed other developments that give rise to \nsatisfaction and optimism. The Government of Lebanon has taken new positive \nsteps to extend its sovereignty over the territory of Lebanon by way of \nimplementing the Taif agreement. In this regard, my country once again \nreiterates its call for the implementation of Security Council resolution \n425 (1978), which calls for the withdrawal of Israel from the Lebanese \nterritories that it occupies. \nMy country, through its membership in the Gulf Cooperation Council, \ntogether with its sisters on the Council, appreciates the outstanding role of \nthe European community in articulating the orientations of the new world order \nin the context of the significant role played by the Community in preserving \nstability and security and promoting development in the world. \nThe two groups, the GCC and the EEC have stressed the need to promote the \npeace process in the Middle East, have called upon the international community \nto help alleviate the suffering of the Arabs in the occupied territories and \n\nhave shown readiness to participate in the reconstruction of Lebanon and \nreactivate the Arab-European dialogue in recognition of the close links \nbetween the security of the Middle East and the security of Europe. \nAfter a protracted bitter struggle, the Afghan people, with God's help, \nhas managed to assume control over its country. The Sultanate of Oman did \nrecognize the Government of the Mujahideen, and has welcomed the assumption by \nthe Mujahideen Council to power in Afghanistan. My country is confident that \nthe new Government in Afghanistan will cope with the new challenges which face \nit judiciously and competently. We hope that the international community will \nhasten to assist the new Afghan Government to heal the wounds and to close the \nbook on the past in order to build a future of security, stability and \nprosperity for Afghanistan. \nThe hotbeds of conflict and the regional and domestic disputes based on \nrace and narrow political outlooks still plague some States and impose an \nadditional burden on the international Organization. Examples of this is what \nis happening in the sister State of Somalia and in the former Yugoslavia. \nThese racial conflicts and disputes have led to the emergence of a large \nnumber of displaced persons who are subjected to the worst kinds of starvation \nand displacement. While we commend the role of the United Nations in \nalleviating the suffering of these peoples, whether in Somalia or in the \nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, we note that that role has been limited to \ndealing with these problems from a purely humanitarian point of view. \n\nIf the United Nations role remains within those limits, such situations \nwill persist. \nDealing with such tragedies, in our view, requires a much wider role, \nmore efforts and a drive to force the warring political factions in Somalia to \nmove towards reconciliation. \nWe look forward to a more comprehensive and effective role that would put \nan end to the fratricidal hostilities that are the source of these tragedies. \nFailing this, the people's suffering will continue for a long time and could \nthreaten peace and security. \nPositive indicators in connection with the situation in South Africa bode \nwell for finding a solution that would be acceptable to all the parties \nconcerned and that would enable the black majority to participate in \ngovernment on a democratic basis. In this regard, we emphasize the importance \nof the United Nations role in bringing closer the views of the parties \nconcerned in South Africa and in helping them to sit at the negotiating table \nwith the aim of finding solutions that may be acceptable to all. \nThe international community witnessed, at the end of last year, the most \nimportant historical event in the international arena since the end of the \nSecond World War, namely the emergence of the republics of the former Soviet \nUnion as sovereign States, which immediately received the official recognition \nof all countries, including my own. As Oman's policy is to build bridges of \nfriendship with all States of the world, we have recognized those independent \nStates and proffered the hand of friendship and cooperation to them. Those \nrepublics have proved that the human spirit is invincible, and today, as they \n\ntake their first steps on a new road, it is incumbent upon the international \ncommunity to support and assist them in the interests of a new world order \nbased on international stability and security. \nLast June, the city of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil, hosted an unprecedented \ninternational gathering that sought to realize a common dream, a common cause \nthat knows no boundaries: that of preserving a sound and sustainable \nenvironment in the interests of all mankind. Although they fell short of \nexpectations, the results of the United Nations Conference on Environment and \nDevelopment (UNCED) have succeeded in endorsing an important principle: that \nof the commensurate and just participation of States in the protection of the \nenvironment and the preservation of the ecosystem. \nThe adoption by the Conference of a set of the 27 principles concerned \nwith environmentally sound development, in the Rio Declaration, and the \nsigning by more than 150 States of the Conventions on biological diversity and \nclimate change represent a step in the right direction towards the \nharmonization of development and the environment. My country urges the \ninternational community to support and implement the Conventions and decisions \nof the Conference, especially those which relate to helping the developing \ncountries overcome their environmental problems, by way of consolidating the \nspirit of world partnership with the purpose of saving the planet. \nIn the field of disarmament, we commend the agreement between the United \nStates of America and the Russian Federation to reduce their strategic weapons \nto one third of their present levels. We feel that this agreement should be \nan incentive to make more determined efforts to free the world of nuclear and \nother weapons of mass destruction and, thereby, achieve the goal of complete \nand general disarmament, which is indispensable for world peace and security. \n\nBy the same token, the adoption of the global Convention on chemical weapons \nis a significant step in the right direction. \nThe United Nations has clearly achieved impressive successes in dealing \nwith questions of peace and security. However, peace is not merely the \nabsence of war, or the simple relaxation of tension between East and West. \nPeace cannot be achieved in its more comprehensive sense without a \nmultilateral transformation of the world economy. The eradication of poverty, \nthe resolution of problems that stand in the way of progress, such as \nindebtedness and the deterioration of commodity prices, the reversing of the \nnet flow of resources from the South to the North, and the transfer of \ntechnology, should all become part and parcel of the policies aimed at the \nmaintenance of peace assigned to the United Nations. \nThe new realities of international relations should be the source of \ninspiration to us to reactivate international cooperation in the field of \ndevelopment. The end of ideological conflicts has increased the importance of \nthis joint responsibility and the need for joint action. Hence the \nopportunity for us all to work together in laying the foundations of the \ncooperation and interdependence which we still lack in the fields of \ndevelopment and international economic cooperation. \nThe polarizations and armed conflicts which used to be the hallmark of \npast decades had prevented the United Nations from achieving its designated \ngoal: a more secure and peaceful world. However, recent developments have \nshown how successful the United Nations can be in dealing with and finding \nsolutions to chronic and complex issues if its endeavours enjoy the support of \nMember States, as is the case, for example, with regard to the Organization's \npeace-keeping operations. The number of peace-keeping operations undertaken \n \nby the United Nations over the past four years equals that of all such \noperations, during the last four decades of the Organization's history. This \nclearly indicates that whenever genuine political will exists on the part of \nthe parties to any conflict, it becomes possible to find a solution or at \nleast to accelerate the process of finding a solution that may lead to \nreconciliation. \nWith renewed optimism, my country shares the hope of the international \ncommunity that the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly will be able \nto deal successfully with residual situations involving negative and \nanachronistic elements that are out of step with the thrust of the new world \norder, and thus usher in a new phase of cooperation and peaceful coexistence \nbetween all the States and peoples of the world. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to convey to you. Sir, my \ndelegation's sincere congratulations on your unanimous election to the high \npost of President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. \nWe are indebted to Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, whose \nskilful and indomitable leadership contributed a great deal to the success of \nthe last session of the General Assembly. \nI extend congratulations and best wishes to the representatives of the \nnew States Members of the United Nations: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of \nMoldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. \nMongolia commends Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his dynamic \nperformance. He has assumed the responsibilities of his post at a time when \nthe Organization is regaining its effectiveness, and the objective of its \ndemocratization and restructuring becomes increasingly topical. I wish you \nsuccess, Mr. Secretary-General, in your endeavours. \nI feel honoured and privilieged to address this Assembly of nations \ntoday, at a time of renewed hope in the world Organization and recommitment to \n\nthe underlying purposes and principles of its Charter. I have come to this \nsession of the General Assembly to tell the world community about Mongolia's \ndomestic and external policies and its approaches to current international \nissues and to express Mongolia's full support for the principles and \nactivities of the United Nations. \nAs the wheel of history turns, mankind finds itself on the threshold of \nthe third millennium. The century that started with a fierce struggle waged \nby the workers' movement and was two brutal world wars, a powerful movement \nfor independence and dramatic scientific and technological breakthroughs is \nculminating now with a new wave of human rights, freedom and democracy. \nOver the past several decades the world was divided into two antagonisitc \ncamps that grew into two powerful, confrontational alliances, but now it has \nwitnessed the end of the cold war. One could hardly find a country in the \nworld that had not been drawn into this truly global face-off. \nBy indulging in ideological hostilities and a reckless arms race, mankind \nbrought itself to the brink of self-destruction and wasted vast resources, \nmany opportunities and much time, thereby hampering world economic development \nand social progress and damaging the environment. On the other hand, the \ncolonial system collapsed and many Asian, African and Latin American countries \ngained independence and strengthened their positions in the international \narena. Mankind has reached into outer space and started taming nuclear \nenergy. The positive and negative effects of all this have been reflected in \nthe activities of the United Nations, the mirror of world tendencies and \ninternational relations. \nThe East-West cold war came to an end as a direct result of the increased \ninterpendence of nations, the interrelationship between the political. \n\neconomic and humanitarian spheres, the bankruptcy of confrontational policies \nand the arms race, the changes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe \nand the emergence of new thinking. Thus the 1980s and 1990s mark, in my view, \nthe beginning of a transitional period shaping a new world order. At this \nvery juncture, with the disintegration of the bipolar world and the creation \nof a multipolar one, we are called upon to determine the principles that will \ngovern our lives and our forms of cooperation in the next century. \nIt is vitally important to establish a new and just world order and to \nstrengthen the ethical and legal bases for guaranteeing the fundamental \nprinciples of inter-State relations. \nMongolia believes that the United Nations should be the focal point of \nthe develoment and coordination of these processes. We therefore fully share \nand support the conclusions reached to that effect at the recent Stockholm \nConference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. In this context, the year 1992 \ncould be described as a year that has strengthened these positive trends. \n\nThe first ever summit meeting of the Unted Nations Security Council was \nheld this year, demonstrating the growing prestige and increasing role of the \nUnited Nations. Mongolia fully supports the ideas and many specific proposals \nconcerning preventive diplomacy and ways and means of building confidence, \ncontained in the report of the Secretary General \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" \nprepared as a follow-up to the aforementioned Security Council summit \nmeeting. The report outlines some concrete proposals on the prevention of \ndisputes and conflicts, on increasing the role of the United Nations in \npeacemaking, peace-keeping and post-conflict peace-building, as well as on the \nmechanism of ensuring the security of medium-sized and small States by \npolitical means. The importance of these proposals was most vividly \ndemonstrated by the Persian Gulf crisis and its lessons. Today the strong \ncannot defy with impunity the will of the weak. Mongolia is of the view that \nthe main lesson of this conflict is that the world community proved its \ndetermination no longer to tolerate actions in violation of the provisions of \nthe Charter of the United Nations. \nPluralism and democracy, advancing in every part of the world, penetrate \nthe very fabric of international relations and open up broad prospects for \ndialogue and cooperation. Progress has been made towards settling some \nregional conflicts peacefully and freeing the world from weapons of mass \ndestruction. \nIn this connection, I would like to note with appreciation such important \nevents as the finalization, through consensus, of the draft Convention on the \nProhibition and Elimination of Chemical Weapons; the agreement between the \nPresidents of the United States and the Russian Federation on the reduction of \nthe two countries' strategic nuclear weapons by the year 2003, far over and \nbeyond the limits stipulated in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START); \n\nand the accession of the People's Republic of China and of France to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We also commend the \nnear-nuclear countries for commencing efforts to contribute to disarmament. \nWe would hope to see all other States in possession of nuclear weapons join \nthe nuclear disarmament talks. \nIn a nutshell, although it is too early today to give an exhaustive \ndefinition of the new world order, some of its principal features are already \nat the stage of maturing. \nHowever, these changes, which have brought about prospects of a new era \nin international relations, fail to prevent new outbreaks of tension that \njeopardize world peace and security. The new hotbeds of conflicts are being \ncaused by inequality, ethnic and religious strife and other complex issues of \nlong standing. As an example of this, I would refer to the crisis in the \nformer Yugoslavia, which is deeply troubling the world community these days. \nMongolia deeply regrets the bloodshed taking place between the nations that \nused to share one home, and supports the efforts undertaken by the United \nNations, as well as such a regional organization as the European Community, in \norder to resolve the crisis. We hope that the decisions reached at the London \nConference will yield positive results. \nMongolia holds the view that it is possible to solve the Yugoslav crisis \npeacefully in the manner in which the Cambodian issue is now being settled. \nIn this connection, we would like to compliment the permanent members of the \nUnited Nations Security Council, the Secretary-General and influential \ncountries of the region that are taking an active part in the settlement of \nthe Cambodian problem. \nA special feature of today's international relations is the need \n\nappropriately to combine the national interests of a country with those of the \nworld community. From this point of view, the United Nations activities \ndepend on the situation in and the policies of its Member States. Therefore, \nallow me briefly to describe the state of affairs in Mongolia, one of the \nMembers of the United Nations, its foreign policy and security interests. \nThe history book of Mongols consists of diverse and unique chapters: the \nrise and fall of the Great Empire; over 200 years under colonial rule; 70 \nyears of Communist experiment. Today, at the turn of the century, we, the \nMongols, have embarked on the road to join the mainstream of civilization. \nOver the two-odd years since Mongolia has irrevocably embraced democratic \nreforms, it has managed basically to dismantle the old social system. We \nsupport pluralism through the policies and practical activities of the State. \nAs a result, many political parties have emerged and the conditions for \ndemocracy's steady march onward are being created. \nOur State structure, which was formed following the first free elections \nof 1990, laid down the foundations for democratic movement, took the initial \nsteps towards a market economy and promulgated the new Constitution legally \nguaranteeing the continuity of democratic reforms. Last June the second \nelections were held, resulting in the formation of new State and government \ninstitutions and in the formulation of the next stage of the transitional \nperiod. This has become yet another guarantee of the irreversibility of our \nmovement towards democracy and a market economy. \nHowever, a general assessment of this past period speaks of a multitude \nof problems, both objective and subjective in nature, in resolving political/ \nsocial and economic issues of the current period. \n\nThe country lacks financial resources. And, as a result, such serious \nproblems as the inadequate supply of food and consumer goods to the \npopulation, and raw materials, equipment and spare parts for industry, beset \nus. The country suffers from acute shortages of housing, medicine and other \nvital needs. \nThe underdeveloped economic infrastructure and the lopsided pattern of \nforeign economic relations aggravate our problems. All this leads to the \nslump in production, to inflation and a decline in living standards. \nLike other developing countries, we are not in a position to cope with \nthese vicissitudes on our own. Donor countries and international \norganizations have shown appreciation of our commitment to democratic reforms \nand the enormity of our problems by rendering support and assistance essential \nto us. I take this opportunity to express, on behalf of the Mongolian people, \nour sincere gratitude to the Governments and people of the United States, \nJapan, the Republic of Korea, the Federal Republic of Germany, the \nNetherlands, Denmark, the People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation \nand others, as well as to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the \nAsian Development Bank and the United Nations Development Programme for their \nkind cooperation. \n\nMongolia, in its relations with other countries, has always upheld such \nuniversal principles of international relations as mutual respect for \nindependence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in each \nother's internal affairs, and will continue to do so in the future. \nOur foreign policy has undergone a radical change over the past two years \nsince we committed ourselves to the development of democracy and market \nrelations, to guaranteeing human rights and fundamental freedoms. Our foreign \npolicy has been freed from the ideological bias that had prevailed for decades. \nFor Mongolia, which is situated between two of the permanent members of \nthe United Nations Security Council, relations with its immediate neighbours \nhave always been and will remain a fundamental factor in its foreign policy. \nMongolia stands for the development of balanced relations with those two \ncountries. We are currently reshaping our relations with them to meet the \nrequirements of genuine equality and mutual benefit and the new realities of \ninternational politics. The withdrawal of Russian troops, in line with the \nagreement reached by the two Governments in the wake of the improving climate \nfor regional understanding and cooperation, is being completed. This is in \nfull accordance with our new concept of national security. \nIn order to contribute to disarmament and trust in the region and \nworld-wide, Mongolia declares its territory a nuclear-weapon-free zone. We \nshall work towards having this status internationally guaranteed. \nWith the disintegration of the former Soviet Union into new independent \nStates and the incorporation of these into the international community. \nCentral Asia is once again emerging as a separate geopolitical entity. We \nbelieve that this vast land area, strategically located as a bridge between \nEurope and Asia, should be reflected in the regional representational \n\nstructure of the United Nations and the land-locked position of its countries \nduly taken into account. \nI should like to take this opportunity to emphasize that we are against \nturning Central Asia into a nuclear testing ground. The Mongolian Government \nhas repeatedly emphasized the possibility of developing a dialogue on a \nregular basis among the States of North-East Asia, an area that is home to \nmore than one-third of the world's population and has a host of military and \npolitical, trade and economic, ecological and other pressing problems to deal \nwith. The current climate in this subregion offers a favourable opportunity \nto realize such ideas and initiatives. At this point, I should like to note \nwith appreciation the recent establishment of diplomatic relations between the \nPeople's Republic of China and the Republic of Korea. \nOther important features of our time are the increasing political and \neconomic interdependence of nations and the intensification of regional \nintegration processes. It should be noted that in the Asia-Pacific region, in \nspite of the ethnic, religious and cultural diversity as well as the disparity \nin the levels of economic and social development, such institutions as the \nPacific Economic Cooperation Conference (PECC) and Asia-Pacific Economic \nCooperation (APEC) have come into being to facilitate the processes mentioned \nearlier. \nWe believe that these forums could be broadened in terms of their \nmembership with a view to securing the widest possible representation. \nMongolia's intention is to develop trade and economic relations with the \ncountries of the region on the basis of mutual benefit and to \nparticipate actively in the international division of labour that is taking \nshape here. \n \nLast year, Mongolia joined the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries as a \nfull-fledged member. We understand this Movement to be, inter alia, an \nimportant political factor in the protection of the independence and security \nof small States. \nThe contribution of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, embracing \nalmost two thirds of the United Nations membership, is highly important in \nenabling the United Nations to effectively address the tasks that face it. \nThe recent 10th Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned \nCountries, held in Jakarta, has reiterated its readiness to cooperate with the \nUnited Nations in building a new world order based on law, equality and \njustice. We are of the view that this Summit has been crucial in responding \nto certain assertions and allaying certain doubts concerning the Movement's \nalleged loss of relevance and viability in evolving its principles and \nobjectives in line with the new realities and in mapping out the Movement's \nstrategies. In our view, it has also given an impetus to the expansion of \nSouth-South cooperation. \nWith the cold-war era at an end, a propitious opportunity is now at hand \nfor the United Nations to work unhindered towards the attainment of its \nobjectives. The activities of the United Nations during the past two years \nprovide a convincing example. \nAlthough the political climate on our planet is rapidly changing for the \nbetter, the same cannot be said, unfortunately, of international economic \nrelations. We are concerned about the lack of noticeable progress in tackling \nthe pressing issues of the world economy, especially those related to the \ndevelopment of developing countries and their indebtedness. Mongolia, \ntherefore, believes that enhancing the United Nations role in developmental \n \nefforts should constitute a major component in the restructuring of the \nOrganization. \nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in Rio \nde Janeiro, eloquently testifies to the inextricable link between environment \nand sustainable development. What is now required is to launch multilateral \nconcerted action to implement the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21. \nAt that United Nations Conference my country proposed the establishment \nof an international network of ecological pattern countries and the inclusion \nof the territory of Mongolia in it as a special zone under international \nprotection. In doing so, we proceeded from our understanding that the \npreservation of Mongolia's largely unspoiled natural environment is part and \nparcel of global, and particularly Central Asian, ecological concerns. Our \ncountry is open to international cooperation in the implementation of \nresearch, protection and restoration programmes. We hope that the Member \nStates of the United Nations will support our proposal and promote its \nrealization. \n\nI should like to point out the imperative need to develop and strengthen \nthe legal basis of inter-State relations, accelerate the codification of \ninternational law and increase the competence of the International Court of \nJustice, for the sake of asserting a new international order the world over. \nIn conclusion, I should like to express my confidence that this session \nthe United Nations General Assembly will successfully complete its \ndeliberations. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to \ncongratulate you. Sir - the representative of Bulgaria, a State friendly to \nours, and of a people so close to the people of Belarus in its spiritual and \ncultural traditions - on your election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its forty-seventh session. By electing you, representatives have \npaid tribute to Bulgaria and have given expression to the respect that you \nenjoy in the international community. In the performance of your quite \ncomplex duties you may rely on all possible support from our delegation. \nWe should like to express our most sincere congratulations to the States \nthat have become new Members of the United Nations. We regard their entry \ninto the United Nations with great satisfaction since .the accession of new \nStates to membership in the Organization enriches the collective thinking of \nthe international community with the wisdom of each one of them. \nHappy indeed is a people that reaps the fruits of centuries of steady \ndevelopment development in the context of stable statehood and within a \nnational culture unclouded by oppression. But there is another fate as well \nthat of going through centuries before re-establishing one's own State, \nwithout allowing the light of one's culture to be extinguished, and finally \nachieving the long-awaited goal of sovereignty and independence. This too is \nhappiness - a particular kind of happiness, a difficult happiness. \nIt is precisely the words \\\"difficult happiness\\\" that I would use to \nexpress the essence of the present mood and feelings experienced by my \npeople. Yakub Kolas, one of the titans of the culture and national spirit of \nBelarus, in his poem \\\"New Land\\\", wrote with tremendous power concerning the \neverlasting dream of a poor peasant in Belarus about land that would belong \nonly to him, where he would be the master, independent of the caprice of an \nalien will. \nBelarus, one of the ancient centres of Slavdom, is a new land, a new \ncountry regained by its people. The goals of freedom, of the enjoyment of \nfull ownership rights in one's own country and of liberation from oppression \nin all of its manifestations have nourished the historic will of our people \nfor centuries and are now beginning to be fully realized. \nA year ago, at the last session of the General Assembly, the delegation \nof Belarus, in its statement, outlined the programme of its priorities in the \nsphere of foreign policy: a series of diplomatic recognitions, the \nestablishment of a commonwealth of sovereign States in place of the Union of \nSoviet Socialist Republics, non-nuclear status and neutrality for Belarus. \nToday, in a brief review of the year, I should like to note with \nsatisfaction that a great deal has been achieved. As we foresaw, the \nCommonwealth of Independent States born at Viskuli, on the soil of Belarus -\nhas been established in place of the USSR. More than 100 States of the world \nhave recognized the Republic of Belarus, and we have established diplomatic \nrelations with 60 of them. Our State has become a full and equal member of \nthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE); it has joined the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank, as well as other international \nfinancial institutions; and it is now the host country for an office of the \nUnited Nations and the United Nations Development Programme. \nTactical nuclear weapons have been completely withdrawn from Belarus. \nHaving become a party to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and its Lisbon \nProtocol, Belarus has also committed itself to the withdrawal of strategic \nweapons over a period of seven years. Possibly the process will be completed \neven sooner. We have distanced ourselves from participation in military and \nmilitary-political alliances and blocs. Everything achieved thus far has \nestablished for our State a primary foundation, a base from which we can \nadvance further. \nThere are certain invisible threads that link the present and the past \ninto a whole the spiritual potential of culture as an element of political \nchoice, of fateful decisions taken at stages of drastic transition in \nhistory. Having established the necessary basis for its statehood and foreign \npolicy, Belarus today may be said metaphorically to be standing at a \ncrossroads of history. The problem of choice, of orientation, is particularly \nconsonant with the present transitional stage of our life. Which way and how \nwill Belarus move? What values will feed the roots of its State tree? What \ndo the near and the distant future hold for our people, which has suffered so \nmuch? I think that hardly anyone would dare to give categorical and \nunambiguous answers today to these and many other complex questions. We can \nonly make certain long-term assumptions and, so far as the prognosis is \nconcerned, state a number of ideas and principles relating to several spheres \nof our activities. \nIn the economic sphere, our point of reference is the Commonwealth of \nIndependent States as a form of economic interaction.* \nEvents have put to shame those sceptics who foretold the imminent and \ninevitable disintegration of the Commonwealth. Today it may indeed still \nremind us of a weak child, but a child who, in our opinion, is destined to \nstand firmly on his own feet. The Commonwealth whatever its membership may \nbe will endure and stand because under present conditions it is a form of \nmutual economic survival. It is a form that has been forced on us but an \ninevitable one, without which it would be difficult to count on the formation \nof an East European economic market. It should be understood that the \nstructure which is now being established by its members cannot instantly \nbecome the model of a developed, contemporary market. For 10 to 15 years we \nshall continue to stumble along a bumpy road, but gradually we shall move \ntowards a state of market civilization which will ultimately enable us to \nraise seriously the question of integration into the European Community - the \nCommon Market. \nWe are convinced that for a relatively long time to come there will be \ntwo economic formations in Europe the European Community and what we might \nterm the emerging East European economic community which will develop \nparallel to each other and gradually move closer together. For Belarus it is \nnot so much a civilized form of economic divorce as an opportunity for \ncreating a new quality of life, for getting ready, together with the other \nStates of the Commonwealth, to become part of an all-European market. \nIn other words, for us and, we hope, for a number of other States, the \nCommonwealth represents not isolation and economic autarky but rather a form \nof development, an inner transformation, whose fundamental essence and final \ngoal is a new Europe. The idea of a common home for Europeans will become a \nreality only when the levels of economic development are equalized. \nAt present we are still struggling to prevent our economic potential from \ndeclining too far. The specific characteristic of Belarus' approach to the \nreforms is that the dynamics of the establishment of the new market structures \nshould and does fully match the fading away of the old economic structures. \nSuch a harmonious approach enables us to avoid extremes: on the one hand, \nrushing forward without good reason and, on the other, rigidly clinging to \nwhat is outmoded. We are convinced that, having overcome its difficulties, \nthe people of Belarus will realize its age-old dream, in the words of \nYanka Kupala, \\\"to become the equal of other peoples in glory and power\\\". \nIn the political sphere we shall continue to act in strict conformity \nwith the constitutional principles of a neutral and non-nuclear State. We \nperceive each of these not as a \\\"given\\\", not as a \\\"moment of truth\\\", but as a \ngoal born in the depths of our national consciousness as we lived our tragic \nhistory. \nWe view the movement towards neutrality and non-nuclear status as a \nprocess of consolidating the independence and sovereignty of Belarus, \nacquiring our own political identity and breaking free of the traps that could \nin the future prevent our free and conscious integration into the structures \nobjectively necessitated by world development. \nWe realize clearly that the notion of classical neutrality is undergoing \na radical change of content. Perpetual neutrality does not and cannot exist \nin a Europe and a world which are interdependent, just as no perpetual-motion \nmachine exists or can exist in nature. The steps recently taken by European \ncountries that had been neutral on the basis of tradition or treaties are \nevidence of this. \nWe, the people of Belarus, on the basis of our tragic past, have been and \ncontinue to have a romantic concept of neutrality. This has become simply a \nmatter of national instinct. There have been so many attempts to annihilate \nus, so many attacks upon us, that we still have the feeling that if we become \nneutral, our security will be guaranteed. \nBut Belarus can become truly neutral only when the new Europe is free of \nblocs, when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ceases to exist just \nas the Warsaw Pact did in the recent past, when the freedom of movement of \nideas, people, capital, goods and services becomes an everyday reality. \nThe third trend is democratic institutionalization. There is no doubt \nthat our main hopes in this area are associated with the adoption of a new \nConstitution which will make the process of democratization irreversible. I \nbelieve that this may happen in the coming months in the course of the second \nreading of our draft Constitution, which is scheduled for October of this \nyear. The draft Constitution includes the following fundamental values and \nprinciples: deideologization and political pluralism; primacy of the norms of \ninternational law; the separation of legislative, executive and judicial \npower, with reciprocal checks and balances between the three branches of State \norganization; the introduction of norms for direct action with respect to \nhuman rights, any potential violation of which would automatically cause the \njudicial bodies to intervene; the undertaking of a thorough and complex \njudicial reform aimed at reforming the civil code and the code of civil \nprocedure, the code of labour law, the criminal code and the code of criminal \nprocedure, and the establishment of trial by jury; the creation of a \nconstitutional court; and strict observance of the rights of national \nminorities on the basis of the recommendations of the 1990 Copenhagen meeting \nof CSCE on the human dimension and the 1991 Charter of Paris. \nIn this area, in keeping with our traditional principles of tolerance in \nall spheres, including the religious sphere, we intend to continue to maintain \na high standard even under the conditions of a turbulent Europe. We take \npride in the fact that all through the many centuries of our history, despite \nthe Pale of Settlement, we have never had such extreme chauvinistic phenomena \nas anti-Jewish pogroms or any other similar actions on our national soil. Our \nfirm principles - a genuine love of peace, respect for others, tolerance, \nhonouring the right of each ethnic group, regardless of its size, to have its \nown national identity and equal civil rights - will be preserved and augmented \nby us in contemporary Europe. \nThis is demonstrated by the present-day situation in a \nmulti-denominational Belarus, where a religious minority, the Catholics of \nBelarus, has been granted the right to celebrate its main religious holidays \nas officially established non-working days. If I am not mistaken, this is one \nof a very few such examples in Europe. \nIt is our hope that the unique interfaith balance that has historically \ndeveloped in Belarus will be valued and respected by all and will not become \nthe subject of external manipulations. We in Belarus do not equate the \nreligious denomination of the citizens of Belarus with the ethnic groups to \nwhich they belong. \nTo say that we are living in an extraordinary time is nowadays often \nmerely to mouth a cliche. The time has come, however, to go both beyond mere \ndeclarations that changes have taken place and beyond simple-minded \nsentimentality at the sudden disappearance of earlier global tensions. It is \ntrue that the disintegration of the totalitarian system, both as a social and \npolitical system and as a system of States, has led to the actual disappearance \nof the central line of tension between the two opposing global military and \nideological groups. One pattern of international relations, which \ncharacterized most of the twentieth century, is being or has been replaced by \nanother. But this still does not automatically mean the absence of \nconflicts. Paradoxically, the new pattern is reminiscent of the one that was \nlaid down by the Vienna Congress and characterized the Europe of the \nnineteenth century, especially its latter half, with its multitude of centres \nof power and the abundance of inter-State and intra-State conflicts, often \nethnic in content. No doubt the analogy is not exact, but its points of \nresemblance give cause for concern, a concern actively reinforced by the \nbloody conflicts in Yugoslavia, Nagorny Karabakh, Georgia and Moldova, all of \nwhich seemed inconceivable to Europe just a few years ago. And after all, we \nall recall the catastrophic convulsions with which that international \nstructure ended at the beginning of the twentieth century. \nThe political structure adopted thereafter was that of post-Versailles \nEurope, which also proved counterproductive. The creation of subregional \ngroupings, such as the Little Entente, and an amorphous system of \npseudo-collective security eventually demonstrated the complete inability of \nthe League of Nations to function and failed to save the world from the \nconflagration of the Second World War. \nThe situation today is similar in many respects. It is thought that \nunless urgent measures are taken, Europe will totally fail to approach \ncomplete prosperity and tranquillity. Internal tensions on the continent are \nincreasing. A broader interpretation of CSCE is drawing it into new crises in \nthe European-Asian area and making it more difficult to achieve any concrete \nresults at the initial stage of emerging conflicts. Is it possible that we \nhave not learned anything from the sad experiences of the past? It is true \nthat the nuclear threat is receding, but the number of victims of \nconventional-arms conflicts is nevertheless terrifying. \nI am far from being a prophet of doom. Moreover, achieving our common \nstrategic goal - the creation of a unified European home is a thoroughly \nrealistic and attainable one. But we must not forget that the complications \nwe face on the path I have just outlined are also real. We must see them \nclearly and overcome them in order to move forward through joint efforts \ntowards our chosen goal. \nThe main advantages of the new world order over that of the last century, \nin our view, lie in mankind's accumulated bitter experience, which we must \nprevent from recurring, and in the existence of a functioning and universally \nrespected Organization of States whose task it is to ensure international \npeace and security. \nIt is important, however, to enable the United Nations, through our joint \nefforts, to play an active, practical role in preventing conflicts and \n\\\"extinguishing\\\" those that nevertheless arise. \nAt the present time it is both necessary and possible to strengthen the \nrole of the United Nations in monitoring the compliance of States with their \ncommitments under existing international covenants and conventions in the \nsphere of human rights. The issue of radically strengthening the role of the \nUnited Nations in this respect may become one of the items on the agenda of \nthe World Conference on Human Rights, to be held at Vienna next year. \nIt is essential to prevent the world from being split into groups on the \nbasis of different degrees of well-being. Closed \\\"oases of prosperity\\\" cannot \nexist forever; they make the world unstable. Today, as never before, it is \nnecessary to mount a multifaceted attack on world-wide economic problems. \nThe removal of the threat of nuclear war and the growing burdens \ntechnology imposes on the global environment, which have reached and even \nexceeded the limit, have made clear the gravity of the problems that beset the \nenvironment. In this sphere too, the international community must choose not \nconfrontation but cooperation in order to preserve the Earth's ecosystem. \nWithout idealizing the results of the Rio de Janeiro Conference, Belarus \nshares the view that this is only the beginning of a long and difficult road. \nHere, in addition to everything else, it should be borne in mind that on the \nmoral scale of values, the modest offerings of the poor are often much more \nprecious than the donations of the rich. \nBelarus supports the idea of convening in 1995 the year marking the \nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations - a special session of the General \nAssembly during which another summit meeting in the interests of the Earth \nwould be held, for the first comprehensive review of the implementation of \n\\\"Agenda 21\\\", the agenda for the twenty-first century, and at which the \nEarth-95 Charter, which may be developed on the basis of the 1992 Rio \nDeclaration, would be discussed. \nWe regard the unique summit meeting of the United Nations Security \nCouncil, held on 31 January of this year, as a milestone in preparing the \nUnited Nations for its role, which is totally new in its effectiveness. We \nhighly commend the Secretary-General's report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", and we \nare prepared to take part actively and as constructively as possible in \ndiscussing the recommendations put forward in that report. \nI can, however, declare even today our favourable attitude towards \nenhancing the activities of the United Nations in carrying out peace-keeping \noperations and, in general, in settling conflicts, many of which stem from \ninter-ethnic disputes. In particular, we are prepared to participate actively \nin the search for peaceful ways to resolve the Nagorny Karabakh conflict. We \nhave agreed to hold an international conference at Minsk on this issue, and \ndespite all our economic difficulties, we have done everything possible to \nenable it to begin its work. \nOn the whole, Belarus' reserves of stability, both internally and on our \nborders, its traditions of cultural and national tolerance, its aspirations to \nthe strict observance of human rights and its geopolitical position give it, \nin our opinion, the potential to play an active role as a peace-keeping \nmediator or coordinator in a number of situations, particularly in regions of \nthe former USSR but also in a broader context. We are ready to make use of \nthat potential in the interests of peace, cooperation and genuine respect for \nhuman rights. As we see it, the realization of this potential will be helped \nby another dimension in Belarus' foreign policy: our aspiration to balanced \nconsistency, constructiveness and predictability of action. \nSpeaking from this rostrum as the representative of a country that was \nstricken by the worst nuclear accident in human history and of a State going \nthrough an extremely difficult stage in its transition from one type of \neconomy to another, I must express today our anxiety concerning two aspects of \nthe General Assembly's activities. \nThe Republic of Belarus is troubled by the delay in the implementation of \nthe General Assembly resolution on strengthening international cooperation and \ncoordinating efforts to study, mitigate and minimize the consequences of the \nChernobyl disaster - or, to be more precise, by the Assembly's almost total \ninactivity with regard to implementing that resolution. The ineffectiveness \nof the United Nations, about which much has already been said from this \nrostrum, can be vividly illustrated inter alia by this example, which is \nparticularly close and painful to us. We have learned from our own experience \nthat resolutions in this particular case resolution 45/190, which was \nadopted by consensus and, I should point out, sponsored by 129 States - may be \nadopted, but the results of such seemingly active measures are minimal. The \nyears that have elapsed since the disaster convince us that today we are \nessentially at the mercy of a capricious fate and must rely first of all on \nour own capabilities, on people of goodwill and on various international \ncharitable and religious organizations, to which we are immeasurably grateful \nfor their moral support and their assistance. \nEven the small secretariat that was established to oversee the \nimplementation of that resolution is silently watching events from far-away \nVienna, clearly not intending to relocate to one of the three capitals of the \naffected countries, closer to the scene. Apparently this is a much simpler \nand calmer way of proceeding. And what good would it do to try to take the \nChernobyl issue outside of the United Nations, the United Nations General \nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council? \nIt is evident that policy relating to Chernobyl is becoming hostage to \nthe current weaknesses and the inherent characteristics of the United \nNations. Need we explain why, in the light of this situation, the prestige of \nsuch a universal Organization as the United Nations may be waning in the minds \nof many people in Belarus? \nA number of United Nations administrative and budgetary policies also \nneed to be seriously revised. First and foremost, the scale of assessments of \nthe States Members of the United Nations deserves criticism. \nRegrettably, in the course of its recent work the Committee on \nContributions recommended to the General Assembly that the share contributed \nby the Republic of Belarus to the United Nations budget should be sharply and \nsubstantially increased. The state of our economy, especially during the \ntransitional period, gives no grounds for such an increase. We wish to \ndeclare our profound disagreement with such an unjustified approach, and we \ninsist that the amount of our Republic's contribution to the Organization's \nbudget should be reconsidered. Furthermore, we are prepared to assume \nfinancial obligations, but, first and foremost, we are prepared to do so only \nin respect of financial obligations as from the time of the juridical \ndisappearance of the USSR, that is to say, from December 1991. \nThe poetic metaphor of a crossroads, which is so dominant for Belarus \ntoday, involves another important symbolic feature, that of departing and \nleaving something behind. As it passes through the present difficult \ncrossroads, Belarus leaves behind forever the obsolete ballast of implausible \nstereotypes that were imposed upon us, bound us hand and foot and prevented us \nfrom being free and happy. We look forward with confidence to the new \nhorizons now opening, we are ready to work indefatigably for our homeland, to \nmake the life of the people of Belarus prosperous and secure, and we shall \ncontinue to make our contribution to the world community's constructive \nefforts. \nWe are making our choice. We have made it already. "

        "file_text": "Allow me first of \nall to congratulate you warmly. Sir, on your election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly. Through your person, an entire region of the world affirms \nin this forum its political renewal. \nThe body of Members of our Organization is growing continually. Over the \nlast year, 21 new States have come to join our ranks and have subscribed to \nthe commitments of the Charter. We bid them welcome. Belgium has always held \nthe view that our Organization should be open to all States. Equally strong, \nhowever, is our conviction that expansion should not come to mean shattering \nand dispersal. National aspirations must remain subordinate to the essential \nprerequisites of multilateral cooperation, which is becoming more necessary \nevery day. \nIn this respect, the confidence Belgium placed in the new \nSecretary-General even before his election has turned out to be fully \njustified. As proof of this, I would refer to his actions in the former \nYugoslavia and in Somalia. I have also in mind his analyses at the Rio \nConference, his report on preventive diplomacy and his report to the General \nAssembly. \nMy colleague, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom, has \nalready spoken on behalf of the member States of the European Community. This \nallows me to concentrate my statement on a few issues of particular concern to \nus. \nThe end of the cold war made strengthened international cooperation both \npossible and necessary. For combined reasons of history, size and \ngeographical location, Belgium has always been predisposed to cooperation. \nWithout a credible international order, we will all sooner or later be faced \nwith an upsurge of unilateral demands containing the seeds of inevitable \nthreats to peace. Our membership of the Security Council has enabled us to \nwitness this first hand. A United Nations which functions effectively \nconstitutes the best guarantee against such dangers. \nThe end of the cold war has produced a variety of results. A wall has \nfallen but new trenches have been dug. The elimination of global ideological \nconfrontation has led to the easing of regional conflicts that were fuelled by \nthat confrontation. But it has also released frustrations, which have often \ndegenerated into parodies of the right to self-determination and into new \nconflicts. We must react to this. \nFortunately, the United Nations is no longer paralysed by the automatic \nideological antagonisms of the past. The Security Council in particular has \nregained its means of action and its authority, which is now broadly \nrecognized. Failure to comply with its decisions now equals isolation from \nthe international community. \nBut precisely because our Organization is experiencing something of a \nrevival, we have to ensure that it does not fall victim to its own success. \nThe summit meeting of the Security Council members, held last January, \nrecognized the extent of this challenge. The Heads of State or Government \nrequested the Secretary-General to develop concrete proposals to respond to \nit. \nThe Secretary General's report, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", has given us ample \nfood for thought on the future role of the Organization. The report confirms \nthat our central objective should be peace first and foremost, for without \npeace, neither normal society nor faith in the future of individuals is \npossible. \nThe General Assembly will debate preventive diplomacy in depth. We hold \nthis concept to be based on the following elements: full use of the powers \nvested in the Secretary-General; a United Nations presence in the initial \nstages of a potential conflict; the specific role of regional organizations; \ncommissions of inquiry and temporary observer missions; an enlarged role for \nUnited Nations staff already present in potential conflict zones; and \ndisarmament and non-proliferation. \nDisarmament and non-proliferation continue to merit special attention in \ntheir own right. The end of the cold war has made the control and monitoring \nof conventional weapons more difficult. The nightmare of global nuclear \nconfrontation has given way to the threat of the unchecked proliferation and \ndissemination of nuclear arms and technology. During the forty-sixth session \nof the General Assembly, the 12 countries of the European Community, together \nwith Japan, took an initiative which has led to the creation of a register for \nmultilateral control of the transfer of conventional weapons. That, however, \nis but a first step. \nThe case of Iraq has demonstrated the extent of the problems caused by a \nlack of transparency in commercial transactions involving both conventional \nand nuclear weaponry. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should \ntherefore continue to improve its system of safeguards, preventive detection \nand monitoring of the transfer of dual-use items. \nI would like to pay a tribute here to the steadfast efforts of the \nConference on Disarmament. Belgium currently chairs that Conference and will \npresent to the General Assembly the draft Convention on a ban on \nchemical-weapons. On behalf of a country victimized by these weapons during \nthe First World War, I want to launch a solemn appeal in favour of the \nuniversal acceptance of the draft Convention, resulting in the final \nelimination of these particularly barbaric weapons from all arsenals.* \nA more systematic use of preventive diplomacy would, no doubt, enable us \nto limit at least the human cost of conflicts. However, it is clear that when \nprevention reaches its limits, the Organization must be able to resort to \nother peace-keeping measures. \nIn response to the appeals of the Secretary-General, Belgium, for its \npart, has dispatched a battalion to Croatia and units to Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, and is preparing a battalion for deployment in Somalia. \nThe financial difficulties of our Organization have led us recently to \nseek alternative financing systems. However, I must take this opportunity to \nrecall the obligation of solidarity that applies to all Member States. All \nMembers must fulfil their budgetary obligations. The system for financing \npeace-keeping operations should be uniform and predictable, and should resolve \nthe problems of financing the initial phases of urgent operations. The United \nNations would obviously lose both operational capacity and credibility if the \nOrganization were denied the budgetary resources corresponding to its \nresponsibilities. \nHowever, all the combined tools of preventive diplomacy, disarmament, \nnon-proliferation and peace-keeping operations are not sufficient to ensure \nreal peace. Most conflicts are more deeply rooted. I wholeheartedly agree \nwith the Secretary-General's broad interpretation of the elements which \ncontribute to ensuring peace. Like him, I believe that the role of the \nOrganization extends to the prevention of tensions of any kind, be they \neconomic disparities, infringements of human rights, the absence of democracy \nor environmental degradation. \nFor the first generations of the post-colonial era, the term \\\"North-South \ndialogue\\\" kept alive the hope of attaining a more equitable distribution of \nwealth and opportunities. The situation today is far from meeting those \nexpectations. This is the combined result of the cold war and military \nexpenditure, of a degree of selfishness in the North, of corruption and bad \ngovernance, and of a wrong choice of priorities both in the South and the \nNorth. \nFor these reasons, major bilateral and multilateral aid efforts have \nsometimes failed and have also maintained a culture of dependency which now \ndemands a process of emancipation. The contrasts between North and South \ndemand our attention more than ever. We are witnessing, on the one hand, a \nrace to satisfy material cravings, and on the other, abject poverty. This is \nthe greatest challenge facing us. We not only have to maintain important \nresource and technology transfers, but we also need to make a frank analysis \nof past errors and to identify the real priorities. \nIn this context two factors have, in my view, become of key importance: \nfirst, the concept of global interdependence and, secondly, the growing \nemphasis on the close links between population, environment and development. \nUseful lessons may be drawn from past disappointments concerning \ndonor-recipient relationships. The Assembly will also discuss the triennial \npolicy review of the operational activities of the United Nations system. We \nhope that this will be a thorough debate leading to a genuine reassessment of \nmultilateral aid mechanisms. \nFor our part, we have launched a number of innovations in our bilateral \naid during recent years. These include, in particular, the creation of joint \nmanagement systems for our development projects, designed to reinforce the \ndecision-making capacity of our partners. \nNevertheless, a real economic take-off will be possible only if \ninvestments follow government efforts. We note with satisfaction that a \nnumber of developing countries have taken steps to offer greater legal \nsecurity to foreign investors with respect to freedom of enterprise, fiscal \nmatters and mobility of capital and profits. Such measures contribute to the \ncreation of a better investment climate. \nWe have to concern ourselves now more than ever with the social aspects \nof development. Profit is not a goal in itself. Income redistribution must \nallow for the full personal development of every individual within a society \nbased on solidarity. This solidarity must extend to future generations. The \nrights of workers, as well as their families, their cultural heritage and \ntheir environment, must therefore be protected. The World Conference on \nSocial Development, to be held in 1995, will provide us an opportunity to give \nthese goals and principles the high priority they deserve. \nInternational economic cooperation can flourish only on the basis of \npolitical will and effective mechanisms. This explains the vital importance \nof several international negotiating processes, either in progress or already \nbeing finalized, being brought to a successful conclusion. \nI should like to stress Belgium's attachment to the liberalization of \nworld trade as a driving force for economic growth and development. The \nsuccess of the Uruguay Round is the essential precondition for this. \nFinally, the Rio de Janeiro Conference was a milestone in the process of \nincreasing collective awareness of the future of our planet, and Belgium will \nattach the greatest importance to its follow-up. One of the crucial aspects \nhere concerns the financial mechanisms. We earnestly wish for a strengthening \nof the structure of the global environment facility to adapt it better to the \nvarious needs. This should also contribute to a greater convergence between \nthe international financial institutions of the Bretton Woods system and the \noperational mechanisms of the United Nations family. \nI could not possibly close this part of my statement without mentioning \nthe economic problems of a region to which we feel particularly close, namely \nAfrica. Current events are continually giving us cause for concern. Belgium, \nhowever, refuses to give in to visions of catastrophe or what a fashionable \nphrase defines as \\\"Afro-pessimism\\\". \nIn recent years Belgium has redefined its attitude and its commitments \ntowards Africa, first in areas where we could have to assume special \nresponsibilities. We warmly welcome the fact that the link between democracy, \nhuman rights and development is now widely recognized and applied. We hope \nthat democratization will be understood at its true value, namely, for the \nbenefit of the people. The spirit which inspires us is not that of a new \npaternalism: we wish to enter into cooperation as equal partners. In order \nto support political renewal in Africa, my Government has just created a fund \nto assist in the financing of democratic elections, the main beneficiary of \nwhich will be the African continent. Furthermore, Belgium is actively using \nits influence with its partners and in relevant international institutions to \nensure that the dawning of democracy is accompanied by an upturn in economic \nactivity. In the meantime, we have intensified our emergency aid in several \nareas affected by conflict or natural disasters. My Government also welcomes \nthe fact that, as regards aid to Africa, it has established a fruitful working \nrelationship with Belgian and international non-governmental organizations. \nFailure to respect the rights of the individual is another source of \ntension and violence, as well as an impediment to economic and social progress. \nWe must clearly reaffirm the principle of the universality of basic \nrights and freedoms which are inherent in human dignity. These rights cannot \nbe subject to various interpretations. \nRespect for and the protection of human rights require stronger \nmonitoring mechanisms. An extraordinary session of the Human Rights \nCommission took place last month in Geneva. The Commission strongly condemned \nthe serious and intolerable human rights abuses taking places in the former \nYugoslavia. Belgium warmly welcomes this rapid reaction and \nwould like to see it serve as an example in the future. \nBelgium would also like to see the coming World Conference on Human \nRights lead to a reaffirmation of the international commitments by States and \na strengthening of cooperation in the world community. We appeal to all \ncountries to strive in a constructive spirit for the success of this \nConference. \nWe are already in favour of a role for the Security Council in certain \ncases of particularly flagrant or large-scale violations of human rights. \nThis is why Belgium insisted on having the Council hear Mr. van der Stoel on \nthe human rights situation in Iraq. \nThis is a delicate subject, as we are well aware. But international law \nis evolving, and since information has virtually lost its borders, frontiers \nare fading for injustice as well. Ultimately, States simply have to respect \nthe international commitments they have undertaken as sovereign Powers. \nThe unbreakable link between democracy and respect for human rights is \nalso put in concrete terms in the United Nations system through the question \nof electoral assistance. Numerous requests for such assistance are currently \nbeing addressed to the Secretariat. In order to give an adequate response, \nprecise standards must be established. The existing mechanisms which allow \nfor some forms of electoral assistance must be fully used. This session of \nthe General Assembly should enable us to clarify matters where necessary. \nThe growing number of ethnic conflicts poses a special problem, half-way \nbetween the traditional questions of human rights and the exercise of the \nright to self-determination. Consequently, the protection of ethnic \nminorities deserves special attention at this time. \nIn Europe, we continue to believe, in spite of recent disappointments, \nthat the rules developed by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \nEurope (CSCE) remain valid. The right to self-determination must in no case \nbe put forward to justify excesses and cruelties committed in its name. \nBesides, the protection of minorities should not necessarily or indeed \nexclusively be placed under the banner of self-determination. I wish to \nrepeat what I said in the early part of my statement - for this seems to me to \nbe a fundamental truth: excessive invocation of the principle of \nself-determination leads straight to a caricature of national sovereignty. \nIt is necessary therefore to explore viable alternatives: real \nadministrative decentralization, cultural autonomy, federal or confederate \nsystems. The claims of minorities are above all the collective expression of \na specific dignity and of human rights which cannot be trodden underfoot or \nignored. Once this truth has been admitted, approaches more conciliatory than \nblind nationalism become possible. This is my hope for the future of the \nminorities issue. \nThe current world situation has prompted me to concentrate my reflections \naround the role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and \nsecurity, in the fight against underdevelopment and in the protection of human \nrights. In none of these fields can we hope to achieve lasting improvements \nwithout strengthened regional cooperation. \nAs we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the United \nNations Charter, in a world very different from the one its authors knew, the \nneed for complementarity between the regional and global spheres has become \nobvious. We must work to define its modalities. At a time when Belgium is \nclose to the end of its term of membership in the Security Council, I am \npleased to note that this debate is taking place above all as regards the \nestablishment and maintenance of peace."

        "file_text": "It is a great pleasure and privilege for me to \ncongratulate you. Sir, in the name of the Ghana delegation, on the honour that \nthe Assembly has conferred on you by electing you to preside over the affairs \nof its forty-seventh regular session. The cordial relations that exist \nbetween our two countries give us added pleasure in your presidency. We \npledge you our support and cooperation during your tenure as President of the \nmost representative organ of our United Nations. \nPermit me to express our gratitude to your predecessor, \nMr. Samir Shihabi, for the excellence that marked his stewardship. He tackled \nhis assignment with a steadfast sense of commitment, fully charged with a deep \nawareness of the historic role that the General Assembly must continue to play \nin the expanding importance of our Organization. \nWe salute the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his \nenergetic leadership. Within the short period since his assumption of office \nhe has demonstrated his remarkable skills as an administrator and as an \n\naccomplished diplomat. We renew our pledge to support him in his difficult \nand delicate task. \nMy delegation would also like to take this opportunity to extend a warm \nwelcome to the new Member States, whose presence among us further enhances the \nuniversality of our Organization. \nIt was with deep regret and sorrow that we learned of the crash of a \nNigerian military aircraft and of a Pakistan International Airlines aircraft, \nwith such loss of life. Preliminary information indicates that among the \n163 officers reported dead in the crash of the Nigerian military aircraft were \nofficers from other West African States, including Ghana. We share in the \ngrief at such a tragic loss. Our condolences go to the bereaved families of \nthese gallant men, who died in the course of service to our subregion. We \nalso wish to convey through you. Sir, to the people and Government of Pakistan \nour heartfelt condolences on their tragic bereavement. \nOnce again we, the representatives of the Governments and peoples of the \nUnited Nations, have assembled here to combine our efforts for the promotion \nof peace and prosperity for all our peoples. The search for peace is part of \nthe eternal guest of humanity for a relationship in society that, though \nrecognizing differences and conflicts of interests, strives for their \nresolution without resort to means that could destroy humanity itself. Twice \nin recent world history this search has engulfed us in wars. Regrettably, the \nperiod after the Second World War turned the quest into confrontation and \ncompetition marked by unrestrained and costly acquisition of deadly arsenals \n \nof war on the untenable assumption that peace could be guaranteed only by the \nhighest level of preparedness for war. \nThis untenable policy of deterrence overshadowed the real causes of \ntension in society factors that, in the words of the Charter, have twice \n\\\"brought untold sorrow to mankind\\\" and are at the root of conflicts that have \nsent our Blue Helmets to the continents of Africa, America, Asia and Europe. \nThe world now stands on the ashes of the cold war, celebrating the end of \nthat war. Yet the harsh reality of our world, divided as it is between the \nrich and the poor, the strong and the weak, has not been obliterated by the \nending of the cold war nor by the emerging new world order, the contours of \nwhich are far from clear. In this uncertain new world order, we are told that \nhistory must resume. Which history? Is it the history at whose hands vast \nareas of our globe suffered so much, and from whose predatory effects we have \nyet to fully recover as nations? Or is it the history that launched many of \nus into freedom and independence? \nJuxtaposed with the challenge of the reality of our world is a historic \nand unparalleled opportunity to construct peace, not as an alternative to war, \nbut as the prerequisite for social progress and better standards of life in \nlarger freedom, anchored in faith, in true human rights, and in human dignity \nand equality. \nIn the grim reality of our world, which has not been wiped away by the \nend of the cold war, we would hear the anguished cries of the more than 30,000 \nchildren who will die today, largely from preventable intestinal disorders; of \nthe 2 million children who will die this year from vaccine-preventable \nillnesses; and of the 5 million to 6 million people who will die this year \nfrom diseases that the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) says could \n\nalmost certainly be prevented by the development of new vaccines. Four \nmillion people will die by the end of this year, their pleas and those of \ntheir nations for help to cure them of diarrhea ailments ignored. We would \nalso see the plight of the 1.3 billion human beings with no access to safe \ndrinking water and the 2.3 billion people world-wide who have no access to \nsanitation services. We would see the 135 million human beings who live in \nareas afflicted with desert conditions, particularly in Africa, where almost \nnothing grows. We would also see that in that part of the world one out of \nevery five children dies at birth. For those who survive life expectancy \nranges from 42 to 63. During their short span on Earth many of these \nrelatively lucky ones will be uprooted from their homes by poverty, drought \nand natural disasters, all compounded at times by rivalries that are ethnic in \ncharacter but emanate largely from quarrels over scarce resources. \n\nThese are but a few of the graphic and dehumanizing manifestations that \nonly partly reflect the world reality in which 70 per cent of the world's \nincome is produced and consumed by 15 per cent of the world's population \nlocated in the industrialized countries. The World Bank forecasts that there \nwill be no significant upturn in this lopsided relationship until 1995 or well \nbeyond. \nAnd the international community is not unaware of the factors that have \nconspired to frustrate the efforts of developing countries. Falling commodity \nprices, rising protectionism, huge agricultural subsidies, various price \nsupport mechanisms and suffocating debt-servicing may now sound like \nrepetitive platitudes in some ears. But they are the realities that have \nundermined the gallant efforts of the developing countries. \nIn Africa overall economic output continues to revolve around \n3 per cent still lagging behind the population growth. The impact on \ninvestment and growth of the structural reform programmes, which many African \ncountries continue to undertake, remains disappointing. Debt relief through \nrescheduling has proved to be of little real benefit to African countries, \nwhich continue to part with $10 billion a year on debt servicing alone an \nexpenditure that is several times higher than the expenditure on health and \neducation put together. \nProspects that such a dehydrating financial outflow would be contained by \nincreased aid infusion have proved illusory. In its annual report. \nDevelopment Cooperation 1991, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment (OECD) has confirmed, though indirectly, the fears of the \ninternational community that the preoccupation with developments in Eastern \nEurope and the former Soviet Union would aggravate the marginalization of \n\nAfrica. According to the OECD, not only did aid from the former Soviet Union \nand Eastern Europe to sub-Saharan Africa almost fall to zero, but also aid \ndisbursements to the same area from other countries remained stagnant. \nIn contrast, the OECD estimated that pledges from its members in November \n1991 to Eastern Europe amounted to $45 billion as compared with its annual \nofficial commitments to Africa of about $34 billion. Furthermore, at their \nmeeting in Munich in July this year, the Group of Seven industrialized \ncountries endorsed a package of financial assistance worth $24 billion to the \nRussian Federation alone. It is of little wonder, then, that the World Bank, \nin its report entitled African External Finance in the 1990s, foresees for \nsub-Saharan Africa a financial shortfall ranging from $1 billion to $7 billion \nby 1995. It is against this discouraging backdrop that my Government supports \nnot only the call for the write-off of debts by official creditors and \ncommercial banks, as well as by multilateral institutions, but also the \nconvening of the proposed international conference on the financing of \ndevelopment, which assumes a new urgency in the face of these facts. \nThe end of the cold war has not brought peace to the world either. It is \ntrue that the danger of nuclear holocaust has now receded into a very remote \npossibility. But the world has not become any safer. In its \\\"Jakarta \nMessage: A Call for Collective Action and the Democratization of \nInternational Relations\\\", the Non-Aligned Movement has aptly observed \n\\\"Simmering disputes, violent conflicts, aggression and foreign \noccupation,-interference in the internal affairs of States, policies of \nhegemony and domination, ethnic strife, religious intolerance, new forms \nof racism and narrowly conceived nationalism are major and dangerous \nobstacles to harmonious coexistence among States and peoples and have \neven led to the disintegration of States and societies\\\". \n \nThe disintegration and descent of Yugoslavia into a region of \ninstability, war, strife and misery is a source of concern to the people and \nthe Government of Ghana. Unrestrained nationalism that is projected as an \nexpression of the much-cherished principle of self-determination and the use \nof force for the homogenization of populations are as unacceptable and as \nwarped as they are incapable of promoting peace in an ever-increasingly \ninterdependent world. Underlying such policies is the obnoxious element of \nracial intolerance, which inexorably leads to racism and racial \ndiscrimination. Ethnic homogeneity cannot, and should not, be a prerequisite \nfor coexistence in a civic society. Fundamental human rights, human dignity \nand equality can be meaningful for man only in a society that respects the \nworth of the human person, irrespective of colour, race, ethnic origin, creed \nor sex. We condemn the notion of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" in the strongest terms \npossible, just as the world has rejected and condemned every thought and \nmanifestation of racial superiority. \nIn our search for a new world order that emphasizes cooperation rather \nthan confrontation as the means to international peace and security, we have \nto monitor developments carefully, if only to draw attention to threats to \npeace. We are, therefore, disturbed by the increasing dangers to peace caused \nby intolerance, xenophobia, racial and ethnic tensions elsewhere in Europe. \nThe raising of symbols reminiscent of an ignominious chapter of history, the \nbaiting of religious minorities, including the desecration of their tombs and \nsacred places, as well as racial attacks, constitute inherent threats to \npeace. While these manifestations may reflect the frustrations of those who \nstand on the fringes of their societies marginalized, unemployed and \nneglected the manifestations are none the less unacceptable. We therefore \n\ncall upon our Organization and individual Member States to redouble efforts in \npromoting peaceful coexistence through respect for each other's race, colour, \nethnicity, religion and sex. My Government is ready to play its full part in \nthis renewed endeavour. \nWhile my Government does recognize the complexity of the Middle East \ncrisis, we, nevertheless, regret that the hopes raised by the commendable \ninitiative launched last year by the United States for a lasting peace in the \nsubregion still remain only hopes. We urge all parties to be persistent and \ncooperative in the search for peace. We also urge the United Nations to be \nfully involved in the process so as to assure the speedy realization by the \nPalestinian people of the full restoration of their rights and the attainment \nof their self-determination in accordance with the relevant United Nations \nresolutions. \nThe full restoration of Kuwaiti sovereignty and territorial integrity was \na reaffirmation of basic principles of inter-State relations. The time has \nnow come to bury the hatchet and enter a new era of genuine peace and \nreconciliation. In that regard, it is our cherished hope that all States will \ndemonstrate respect for the principles of non-aggression, mutual respect and \nnon-interference in the internal affairs of others. Outstanding issues, such \nas the question of Kuwaiti prisoners of war, must now be promptly resolved to \nopen the way for Islamic brotherhood, fraternal cooperation and solidarity. \n\nOur Organization needs to remind itself that even though the conflict in \nLiberia has been stopped from exploding into a major subregional crisis, it is \nfar from over. Now that the United Nations, particularly the Security \nCouncil, has been able to define a role for itself in the Yugoslav situation, \nit is imperative that our Organization assume its responsibilities in Liberia. \nThe developing countries of the subregion which have so far borne the weight \nof the ECOWAS (Economic Commission of West African States) Cease-fire \nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) deserve the recognition, the encouragement, and the \nmaterial and financial support of our Organization. The active involvement of \nthe United Nations is now required to arrest the deteriorating situation, \nbrought about largely by the intransigence of one faction. \nIn our view, the involvement of the United Nations would, furthermore, \nnot only accelerate the peace process, but also facilitate the restoration of \npeace and security in the entire subregion, enabling its countries to focus \ntheir full attention on their economic and social development. \nThe pervasive breakdown of law and order in Somalia which is hampering \nthe peace process and relief efforts also deserves the attention of our \nOrganization. The people and Government of Ghana have heaved a sigh of deep \nrelief that at long last the Security Council has shown appreciation of the \nserious threat that the Somalia situation poses to the political and economic \nstability of the subregion and consequently to international peace and \nsecurity. The Security Council's handling of the Yugoslav situation should \nencourage it to continue, in a more steadfast manner, its efforts in the \nsearch for peace in Somalia. We also call upon the Somali factions currently \nengaged in senseless fratricide to desist from placing obstacles in the path \nof United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations in their efforts \nto provide humanitarian assistance to the millions of starving Somali people. \n\nWe all continue to look on as the Government of Sudan seeks a military \nsolution to an essentially political problem in the southern part of the \ncountry, thereby resulting in gross abuses of human rights, untold suffering \nof the people and an unbearable refugee problem for neighbouring States. The \nhumanitarian dimension of this problem now calls for United Nations action. \nDevelopments during the year have reminded all of us that determined \nefforts would be required to complete the total political emancipation of the \ncontinent of Africa. We regret the postponement of the referendum which was \nto have been held in Western Sahara under United Nations supervision to \ncomplete its decolonization. We urge the Secretary-General of the United \nNations, in cooperation with the Secretary-General of the Organization of \nAfrican Unity (OAU), to settle all questions of voter eligibility, delays in \nthe exchange of prisoners and the repatriation of bona fide Saharawis in order \nto facilitate the task of the United Nations Mission for the Organization of a \nReferendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). The inability of the parties to \nadhere to the implementation of agreements reached raises questions as to \ntheir commitment to the peace process. We take this opportunity to appeal to \nall parties concerned to cooperate fully with the United Nations and the OAU \nto bring this chapter of colonial struggle to a close. \nIn South Africa, the international community had hoped that the \nConvention for a Democratic South Africa would contribute to the introduction \nof \\\"profound and irreversible changes\\\". In anticipation of the establishment \nof an interim government and firm processes leading to a democratically \nelected constituent assembly to draw up a constitution for a united, \nnon-racial and democratic South Africa, the General Assembly at its \nforty-sixth session adopted a series of measures to encourage the racist \n \nregime in its efforts to dismantle apartheid. Recent developments would seem \nto confirm the view that De Klerk's Government is, on the contrary, pursuing a \ndouble agenda in order to perpetuate the obnoxious system of apartheid. \nWhilst posturing and stating its willingness to negotiate, it seeks ways and \nmeans to entrench white supremacy. The Boipatong and Ciskei massacres are \ndisingenuous provocations of the racist regime designed to derail the process \ntowards the establishment of an interim government which would work out a new \nconstitutional framework. The white minority regime and its cohorts stand \naccused of violence. They instigate and perpetuate violence against unarmed \npeaceful protesters in an attempt to hold on to a moribund and unjust system \nand to prevent the march towards a united, democratic, non-racial South Africa. \nIt is becoming clear that the international community relaxed its \npressure on the racist regime far too early and without due regard for the \nwarnings of the democratic forces of that country. It should, however, be \nmade clear to the South African Government that the programmed-management \napproach to the lifting of sanctions is intended as a reaction to measures it \nwould take for the total elimination of apartheid. It should be stressed, in \nthis regard, that even the people-to-people sanctions would be re-imposed if \nthe Government does not abandon its stalling of the peace process. \nHistory is littered with instances of situations in which desperation has \ndriven people to actions which have spilled over their narrow confines to pose \nchallenges and threats to others. Many peoples have waged heroic struggles to \noverthrow the forces of tyranny and exploitation. In spite of the belief that \nthe Second World War was fought to end the threat to international peace and \n\nsecurity that a particularly racist ideology posed, the greater threat to the \ncommon peace remains an international order that seems bent on denying many of \nus our fair share of the very fruits of our labour in a truly free and \nequitable market-place. \nThe world cannot be seen to be encouraging a policy founded on the \ndangerous notion that it is only through military might that a sovereign State \ncan gain respect and acceptability in the international economic system \nalready dominated by a few. \nPopular demands for changes in the world order that manifest themselves \nas conflicts the world over cannot be contained by the dispatch of United \nNations peace-keeping forces alone. The people and Government of Ghana salute \nthe Member States of the United Nations, our distinguished Secretary-General \nand his dedicated staff, and all who have been associated with the sterling \nsuccesses achieved so far. We share in their pride. But we need to be \nreminded often of the self-evident truth that the presence of United Nations \npeace-keepers does not by itself guarantee enduring peace. The harrowing \nevents in Bosnia attest to this. The peace-keeping presence does not even \ndirectly contribute to the solution of the underlying problems that give rise \nto the conflict or threat to peace. The United Nations peace-keeping role \nshould be seen for what it is: an invaluable contribution to containing a \nconflict and to the search for a lasting political solution. An international \norder that can be secured only through military presence or intervention is \nclearly inadequate. It is a rather sad reflection on our search for peace \nthat as of the end of April 1992, close to $3 billion had been assessed on \nMember States for peace-keeping purposes alone, while the United Nations \nrelatively neglected the economic and social underpinnings of most of these \nconflicts and those yet to rear their heads. \n\nThe inability of the United Nations since its creation to respond \neffectively to our Charter's injunction to combine our efforts to achieve \ninternational cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, \nsocial, cultural or humanitarian character deserves serious and careful review \nnow that the cold war has been pronounced over. \n \nThe relative inaction by the international community and within the \nUnited Nations itself on the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of \nAfrica in the 1990s speaks eloquently of our misplaced emphasis in our efforts \nregarding the establishment of a new world order. The opportunity presented \nby the consensus General Assembly resolution 46/151 on the final review and \nappraisal of the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for \nAfrican Recovery and Development 1986-1990, in which the international \ncommunity accepted the principle of shared responsibility and full partnership \nwith Africa, must be a spur to our good intentions, if the continent of Africa \nis not to be condemned to a fate worse than that which it has been enduring \nthis last decade and a half. The unseemly wrangling, which turned into \ndisappointment for many, at the summit of the United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro over the transfer of \nfinancial resources and technology to the majority poor, attest to an \ninsufficient appreciation on the part of many of the developed nations that in \nthe final analysis world peace depends on the economic and social well-being \nof all peoples. \nThe statement that the Security Council adopted at the end of its \nhistoric summit on 31 January 1992 represented as the Secretary-General has \nstated in his report entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace: Preventive diplomacy, \npeacemaking and peace-keeping\\\" an unprecedented recommitment at the highest \npolitical level to the purposes and principles of the Charter. In this \ndocument, however, the primacy of economic relations - nay, the necessity for \na redefinition of the new world order underpinned by economic, trade, \ntechnological and development issues to promote peace sadly received little \nattention. Preventive diplomacy cannot and should not be limited to efforts \n \nto prevent the outbreak of conflicts. No standing army, however well-equipped \nand well-garrisoned is a bulwark against underdevelopment, poverty and natural \ndisasters. Preventive diplomacy should also, and even more significantly, be \ndirected at eliminating the factors that contribute to conflicts. In the \ncontext of international peace and security it should focus on the \nestablishment of a just world order in which everyone has access to good \ndrinking water, food, shelter, health and education. \nThe first significant steps should be taken within our Organization, the \nUnited Nations. The pre-eminent position of the General Assembly in the work \nof the Organization should be asserted and reconfirmed. The Charter \nprovisions, notably Articles 15 and 24(3), must be given full meaning and \neffect. It should be emphasized that the Security Council was not conceived \nas an executive organ. It is to facilitate decision-making in urgent \nsituations of the eruption of conflicts that the Members of the Organization \nhave conferred on it, under Article 24, the primary responsibility for the \nmaintenance of international peace and security. \nAbove all, the present composition of the Security Council, with the \noutmoded and obviously undemocratic permanent-five arrangement that reflects \nthe post-Second-World-War situation and its 10 two-year rotative seats for the \nrest of the world, flies in the face of a global reality in which we are all \nexpected to play our part in maintaining the peace. The creeping tendency on \nthe part of certain nations to see themselves as policy-makers and executors \non behalf of the entire United Nations membership through their predominance \nin the Security Council does not send out welcome signals to the rest of us as \nequal partners in world affairs. The Security Council, we submit, should be \n\nenabled to perform its functions in a more democratic manner to enhance its \nlegitimacy in acting on behalf of the membership of the United Nations in \naccordance with Article 24 of the Charter. \nIn this regard we welcome the decision of the Non-Aligned Movement at its \ntenth summit in Jakarta to empanel a working group on the revitalization and \nrestructuring of the United Nations, and hope that the working group will make \na positive contribution towards the democratization of the Organization. \nThe people and Government of Ghana retain faith and we wish hereby to \nreaffirm it in the United Nations to lead the efforts of the international \ncommunity in the establishment of a truly new order. We believe that the \nUnited Nations remains the only hope of mankind for peace and prosperity. \nTogether we must resist the temptation to see some Member States as more equal \nthan others; to see some Member States as leaders, with all others as mere \nfollowers. For it is through the efforts of all Members, large and small, \nacting in concert through our United Nations that we can craft and ensure a \nnew world order that is just and equitable and reflects the diversity of \nmankind, an order in which all nations have a legitimate share and interest as \nequals. The people and Government of Ghana rededicate themselves to this \npursuit. \n"

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, on behalf of the Republic of Armenia and the Armenian people, I wish \nto express my gratitude for the support of the General Assembly for our \nrequest to be admitted to membership of the United Nations. \nI wish also to congratulate you. Ambassador Ganev, on your election to \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. \nToday is the first anniversary of Armenia's declaration of independence, \nso it is a signal honour for me to be addressing the General Assembly. The \npast year has been significant both for a newly independent Armenia as well as \nfor the international community at large. Our Government, which was formed as \na result of free elections, has continued its policy of democratization, \neconomic liberalization and the creation of a State of law. The Parliament of \nArmenia has voted in favour of freedom of conscience, freedom of religion and \nfreedom of the press. It has instituted a multiparty system and has acceded \nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and all \ninternational conventions on human rights. \n \n3 \nIn this relatively short time, Armenia has succeeded in carrying out \nagrarian reform by distributing to the people 80 per cent of its agricultural \nlands. Moreover, Parliament has already enacted the laws underlying \ndenationalization, and has begun the privatization of small and medium-sized \nenterprises and of certain service industries. In addition, bills relating to \nreform of the banking system, credit, finance, the budget and communications \nare already before Parliament with a view to creating the legal infrastructure \nnecessary for a market economy. \nThe entrenchment of democracy and economic reform are taking place \nagainst the backdrop of blockades, skyrocketing unemployment, free-falling \nstandards of living and an acute energy crisis. That energy crisis, which is \nthe main reason for the drop in national production, is the result not only of \nregional blockades but also of the closing of our nuclear power plant for \nsafety and ecological reasons. \nIn those conditions the Government must still devote a major portion of \nits resources to rebuilding the Spitak region, hit hard by the earthquake of \n7 December 1988. \nDemocratization and independence have had a no less fundamental impact on \nthe new direction of the foreign policy of the Republic of Armenia, which is \nbased on two principles: \nFirst, the security of the State and the people hinges on normalized \nrelations with all of our neighbours, on a negotiated solution to conflicts, \nand on strengthened regional economic cooperation. All of this should lead to \nthe establishment of a system of regional collective security. \n \n4-5 \nSecondly, Armenia is ready to participate in any constructive process \nthat would guarantee the development of international economic and political \ncooperation and the strengthening of regional stability. That is why Armenia \npursues an active policy in the Commonwealth of Independent States, in the \nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and in the Black Sea \neconomic cooperation process. Armenia wishes also to play a role in economic \ncooperation and a system of collective security in the Middle East. \nOn the basis of those two principles, Armenia has already signed \nbilateral agreements with two of its neighbours: Georgia and Iran. We have \nalso begun serious negotiations with Turkey on normalized relations with that \ncountry. In the light of the respective interests of our two countries and \nsharing a concern to restore regional stability, Armenia is convinced that it \nwill be able to achieve that goal on the basis of international law. \nWith equal persistence, Armenia has been pursuing that policy with \nrespect to its fourth neighbour, Azerbaijan. Armenia harbours no territorial \nclaims with respect to Azerbaijan, but we insist that the people of \nNagorno-Karabakh not be relegated to the status of ethnic minority, that they \nnot be denied their right of self-determination and that this population not \nbe sacrificed on the altar of the principle of territorial integrity. \n \n6 \nIt is indeed high time that the security of the people of \nNagorno-Karabakh should be ensured with sound international guarantees. \nArmenia is very pleased to note that the position which we have been \ndefending since the outset of the conflict is being increasingly taken into \naccount and even endorsed by other States involved. For us it is clear that \nthe cease-fire is the necessary initial stage in advancing towards a solution \nto this question. Negotiations must follow, first between Azerbaijan and \nNagorno-Karabakh on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, together with the \nnecessary international guarantees, and, secondly, between Azerbaijan and \nArmenia to resolve questions arising from the conflict. \nIn order to bring about the required cease-fire, Armenia has welcomed all \nproposals made to date and thus Armenia, like the parliament of \nNagorno-Karabakh, has just given an unconditional and favourable response to \nthe cease-fire appeal made by the President of the Minsk group of the \nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Unfortunately, \nAzerbaijan did not adopt the same position. \nAt all events, Armenia is prepared to make a positive contribution in \ntalks with Azerbaijan in the hope that the attention which we give to the \nwell-being of all the peoples in the region will lead us to peace and \nstability. It is not too early to declare that the United Nations is in a \nposition to assist in achieving these ends. \nAs the Armenian people acceded to democracy and independence by \nconstitutional and non-violent means, independent Armenia is moving towards \npeace and justice in the context of strict respect for international law. \nSimilarly, in accord with the two principles I referred to previously, \nArmenia has attempted to transform the burden of history into an historic \n \n7 \nopportunity to lay bare the historic roots that unite it with this region, to \nrestore the communality of culture which connects it with the peoples of this \nregion, and to transform ethnic and religious differences into a source of \nwealth conducive to resolving all the problems besetting our common house. \nThis year was equally significant for the United Nations. The Republic \nof Armenia would like to congratulate the Secretary-General of the United \nNations on his report entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277). The report \ncontains a number of constructive proposals to which I am sure the United \nNations will give the closest scrutiny. \nWhether it be as a Member of the United Nations or as a party involved in \na regional conflict, Armenia is very interested in proposals to create \nspecific machinery for the implementation of Article 43 of the United Nations \nCharter. The creation of peace-keeping and cease-fire forces, binding \narbitration for conflicts, and encouraging active recourse to the \nInternational Court of Justice under the aegis of the United Nations would be \na major success for the international community and the new world order. \nArmenia realizes that other proposals to change the structures of the United \nNations also contain constructive ideas which, if they were acted upon, would \nmake it possible more surely to achieve collective security and the concepts \nof the new world order in the United Nations today. \nArmenia has acquired some experience in the creation of ,new structures \nwhile the former ones are gradually disintegrating. Accordingly, we are fully \nprepared to participate in the creation and implementation of a new world \n \n8-10 \norder so as to avoid inertia, a lack of will or imagination, or simply a lack \nof vigilance and cause a return to the old system which attempted to impose \nsolutions on peoples by involving them in even more bloody conflicts. \nIn the new world order States should be able to shoulder the problems of \ntheir neighbours regardless of considerations of race, religion or ideology. \n"

        "file_text": "I should like, first of all, to extend my sincere \ncongratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of \nthe forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. At the same time, I wish \nto express to Mr. Samir Shihabi my appreciation for what was accomplished \nunder his presidency. His visit to Japan in April 1992 further strengthened \nmy country's close ties to the United Nations. \nLast year, seven nations were admitted to membership in the United \nNations, and this year, another thirteen became Members. On behalf of the \nGovernment and people of Japan, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the \nrepresentatives of the nations attending this General Assembly for the first \ntime. Now numbering 179 Members, the United Nations is indeed a global \nOrganization. At the same time, its role in maintaining world peace and \nsecurity is increasing dramatically, thus presenting the international \ncommunity with unparalleled opportunities for realizing the ideals of the \nUnited Nations Charter. \nMember States have extremely high expectations of the Secretary-General, \nMr. Boutros-Ghali, who bears the awesome burdens of his office at a \nparticularly crucial juncture. I take this opportunity to pledge Japan's full \nsupport for, and cooperation with, President Ganev and Secretary-General \nBoutros-Ghali as we pursue our common goals. \nNow, nearly half a century after the United Nations was founded, the \ninternational community has been freed from the constraints of East-West \nconfrontation based on ideology and force. Nevertheless, this post-cold-war \nworld faces problems arising from the changing power relationship between the \nnations that dominated the old international order, the resurgence of \nregionalism, and the destabilization of regions by ethnic, religious and other \nstrife. \nThe Gulf crisis showed the high political and economic costs of restoring \npeace once it has been destroyed. Every day, countless refugees in what used \nto be Yugoslavia are being forced to flee their homes. Every day brings \nnumerous reports of atrocities there. In Somalia, the civil war, compounded \nby severe drought, is resulting in untold human suffering. Urgent efforts \n\ncontinue to be required to overcome poverty in many developing nations, home \nto the majority of the world's population. The preservation of the global \nenvironment for our children and grandchildren is another issue that demands \nour serious attention. \nThese challenges only underscore the need to seek solutions to problems \nin a spirit of conciliation and cooperation among nations. This conciliatory \nand cooperative spirit should be a key element in advancing us towards the \ncreation of an international order for the new era while the United Nations \nassumes even greater importance as the centre of our endeavours. Thus the \ntime has come to review the roles and functions of the United Nations and \nseriously to consider how they may be strengthened, and to reflect upon how \neach of its Members might best contribute to that end. \n\nThe Security Council summit meeting held in January 1992 provided an \nunprecedented opportunity to examine, at the level of Head of State or \nGovernment, the problems confronting the international community. In the \nlight of the present world situation, the Secretary-General's report entitled \n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", which was drafted on the basis of the deliberations at \nthe summit, is indeed a timely contribution. I hold Secretary-General \nBoutros-Ghali's initiative, which was realized with the diligent assistance of \nthe Secretariat, in the highest regard. \nIn Japan's view, building a peaceful world will require the following \nfive-pronged approach. \nFirst, efforts must be made to ease international tensions. The \nagreement reached at the summit meeting between the United States and Russia \nthis past June to make substantial reductions in nuclear armaments is most \nwelcome. It is hoped that this will lead to progress in nuclear disarmament \nby all nuclear-weapon States. The problem of proliferation demands that the \nregime of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons be \nstrengthened and made more universal. The Treaty's signatories should \nharmonize their positions so that when they meet in 1995 the smooth extension \nof the Treaty will be ensured. \nAn important facet of non-proliferation is the provision of employment \nassistance to weapons scientists of the former Soviet Union. To this end, \nJapan is striving to make it possible for an international science and \ntechnology centre to begin operation promptly in cooperation with the United \nStates and countries of the European Community. \nThe conclusion of negotiations on the chemical weapons convention at the \nConference on Disarmament and the anticipated submission to the General \nAssembly at the current session of the draft convention on the prohibition of \n\nchemical weapons constitute an epochal step forward. Japan earnestly hopes \nthat as many nations as possible will be original signatories to this \nconvention. \nConventional weapons are another area in which the vigilance of concerned \nnations is called for to prevent regional destabilization, especially in the \nlight of the major arms transfers that have already taken place in some \nregions. To increase the transparency of arms transfers and thereby \nstrengthen trust among nations, it is important that the United Nations \nRegister of Conventional Arms, the establishment of which Japan proposed \njointly with the European Community and other countries last year, be \nimplemented effectively. Japan and its partners in this effort plan to submit \na draft resolution to the General Assembly at this session calling for the \nwide participation of Member States in the Register. \nSecondly, stepped-up efforts are needed to forestall the outbreak of \nconflicts. Thus far, Japan has played an active role in the adoption of such \nGeneral Assembly resolutions as the Declaration on conflict prevention (43/51) \nand the Declaration on United Nations fact-finding (46/59). To strengthen the \nconflict-prevention function of the United Nations, the Secretary-General must \nhave the capacity, inter alia, to conduct fact-finding missions, to issue \nearly warnings and to monitor constantly the situation in potential conflict \nzones. For this purpose, it is important that information about conflicts be \nmade immediately available to the Secretary-General. \nIn addition, I propose that there be set up within the United Nations \nSecretariat a conflict-information clearing-house. This office would collate \ninformation on conflicts collected through the fact-finding activities of the \nSecretariat or provided by Governments, and would present it in an objective \n\nmanner to the Security Council and to Member States so as to help them \nformulate their judgments on the situation. \nI should also note here that Japan is in basic agreement with the concept \nof preventive diplomacy described in the Secretary-General's report, but the \nidea of preventive deployment of United Nations peace-keeping operations, for \nexample, with the consent of only one party to a conflict involves problems \nwhich require further study. \nThirdly, stronger diplomatic efforts should be made by Members of the \nUnited Nations to resolve conflicts peacefully. Considering the recent spate \nof regional conflicts, efforts to resolve them by regional organizations and \nUnited Nations Member States are increasingly essential. The efforts led by \nthe European Community to restore peace in the former Yugoslavia and the \nefforts by the countries in the Asian region and the five permanent members of \nthe Security Council to restore peace in Cambodia are examples of the kind of \naction to which I refer. The steps now being taken by the countries concerned \ntowards peace in the Middle East also deserve to be hailed. Japan, for its \npart, also intends to play an active role in the multilateral consultations. \nI intend to see that Japan continues to step up its diplomatic efforts to \nbuild peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. As far as peace in \nCambodia is concerned, Japan has been playing an active role by, for example, \nhosting the Ministerial Meeting on the Reconstruction and Rehabilitation of \nCambodia in Tokyo this past June. In cooperation with other countries, Japan \nwill continue its intensive and unremitting efforts to urge the Khmer Rouge to \nwork with the other parties in Cambodia and with the United Nations \nTransitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) to advance the peace process \nquickly. Japan also intends to take an active part in the Security Council \ndeliberations on this issue. \n\nEasing tensions on the Korean peninsula is of vital importance for peace \nand stability in east Asia, and Japan intends to contribute in every way it \ncan to the creation of an environment conducive to dialogue between South and \nNorth Korea. In this connection, Japan welcomes the establishment of \ndiplomatic relations between China and the Republic of Korea and hopes that \nthis will lead to ever-broader exchanges between the two countries in the \nfuture. \nI welcome the idea mentioned by President Roh Tae Woo of the Republic of \nKorea in his address earlier today of enhancing opportunities for dialogue \namong interested countries in north-east Asia, an idea that is consistent with \nJapan's own thinking. I consider it vitally important for Japan's \nrelationship with its neighbour, the Russian Federation, to expand in all \naspects on a balanced basis. In this connection, I believe that the building \nof a relationship of trust between Japan and Russia through the conclusion of \na peace treaty will greatly contribute to peace and stability in the region. \n\nFourthly, peace-keeping operations, which are at the very centre of the \nprimary role of the United Nations, should be strengthened. Extending to new \nareas of responsibility, and with an ever-greater range of activity, United \nNations peace-keeping operations have evolved both qualitatively and \nquantitatively in recent years. As mentioned in the Secretary-General's \nreport, however, they are confronted with many problems, including increased \ndemands for funding and a shortage of logistical personnel. More active \ncooperation by Member States of the United Nations is therefore essential. \nLast June, the Japanese Diet passed the International Peace Cooperation \nLaw, which put in place domestic arrangements that finally enable Japan to \nparticipate in United Nations peace-keeping operations and international \nhumanitarian relief operations. In addition to the financial contributions it \nhas thus far extended, Japan intends to cooperate by sending personnel to the \nmaximum degree allowed within the framework of this new law. \nIn fact, a decision has already been made to send election monitors to \nthe United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II) in Angola to \noversee the elections there, and to send military observers, a construction \nunit and civilian police to the United Nations Transition Authority in \nCambodia (UNTAC). The first teams have already been dispatched. Japan also \nplans to send election monitors to Cambodia for the elections scheduled there \nnext year. \nJapan believes that the principles and practices of peace-keeping \noperations upheld by the United Nations for more than 40 years are still both \nappropriate and valid today and will continue to be so in the future. The \nidea of \\\"peace-enforcement units\\\", proposed in the Secretary-General's report, \noffers an interesting approach to future peace-making efforts of the United \n\nNations, but requires further study because it is rooted in a mode of thinking \ncompletely different from past peace-keeping forces. \nFifthly, in order to build peace throughout the world, dialogue and \ncooperation should be strengthened and developed as appropriate to the \nsituation in each region. Europe's regional cooperation mechanisms, typified \nby the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), have grown out \nof efforts for confidence-building against a backdrop of past conflicts. They \nhave evolved into frameworks for working together to achieve regional \nstability and prosperity, and have begun to work to prevent conflicts and \naugment their peace-keeping capability in specific ways. \nRegional cooperation for peace and prosperity in other parts of the world \nhas not yet matured to the same degree as in Europe. Ways should be explored \nto achieve forms of dialogue and cooperation that are well grounded in the \npolitical and geopolitical characteristics of each region and tailored to its \nneeds. \nWith respect to security in the Asia-Pacific region, Japan considers it \nimportant to maintain and strengthen the frameworks for dealing with issues \neither bilaterally or among several countries concerned, and, simultaneously, \nto seek to promote region-wide dialogue. I believe that, at the present time, \none of the forums that has the greatest potential for such region-wide \ndialogue is the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nPost-Ministerial Conference. Japan suggested last year that this forum be \nused for political dialogue of the type to which I am referring. In an effort \nto promote greater cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region which at the same \ntime is open to the outside world, Japan has been contributing actively to the \ndevelopment of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). \n\nI should now like to turn to the question of responding to new threats. \nThe threats facing humankind today are not all military. Problems relating to \nthe deterioration of the global environment, refugees, poverty, \noverpopulation, drugs, AIDS and other threats of a non-military nature are \nbecoming increasingly serious. It is not enough simply to treat the symptoms; \nthe United Nations and the international community must join hands to remove \nthe causes of these ills. It is no exaggeration to say that the solution to \nthese problems will demand the utmost of humanity's collective knowledge and \nthe application of its highest ethical and moral standards. \nIn this connection, I wish to re-emphasize the importance of respect for \nhuman rights. Fundamental human rights are not only a universally cherished \nvalue, but are also fundamental to ensuring a better life for each individual \nand the development of a democratic society. The lack of respect for \nhumanitarian law and for the rights of minorities in recent conflict areas is \ndeeply disturbing. \nWith the end of the cold war, it is incumbent upon the international \ncommunity to grapple more seriously with the problem of poverty in the \ndeveloping world, since the maintenance of world order hinges largely upon \nwhether and to what degree the North and South cooperate. The United Nations \nmust redouble its efforts to combat poverty and to eliminate the causes of \nsocial instability - which is rooted in poverty in the recognition that \neconomic development raises standards of living and thereby enhances political \nstability. \nIn addressing the issue of poverty, we must bear in mind that conditions \ndiffer from country to country. The economies of some countries are about to \ntake off, others are on the verge of solving their spiralling debt problems, \n\nand others such as the sub-Saharan countries are still experiencing \ncrushing economic difficulties. We must therefore search for an approach that \nis finely tuned to these differing circumstances. \nJapan intends to assist United Nations efforts to deal more effectively \nwith these problems that affect all of humanity. For example, cognizant of \nits role as a responsible member of the international community, Japan plans \nto host an African development conference in autumn next year in Tokyo with \nthe cooperation and participation of sub-Saharan nations, major aid donors, \nthe United Nations and other international agencies to discuss the theme of \neconomic development in Africa. Another timely event that addresses these \nproblems is the United Nations social development summit, scheduled for 1995. \nJapan intends to cooperate actively in both these meetings to ensure that they \nwill be genuinely fruitful. \n\nI turn now to the subject of the environment and development. It is very \nimportant that the follow-up to the United Nations Conference on Environment \nand Development, held recently in Rio de Janeiro, be maintained. Japan \nintends to make active contributions to the work of the sustainable \ndevelopment committee, the establishment of which is on the agenda of this \nGeneral Assembly session, and of such international environmental agencies as \nthe United Nations Environment Programme and the United Nations Development \nProgramme. The process of making the necessary domestic arrangements is now \nunder way. Japan will soon finalize the draft of its national action \nprogramme, and is prepared to assist developing countries in the formulation \nof theirs. In accordance with its stated goal that its environment-related \nofficial development assistance be increased to between 900 billion and \n1 trillion yen over the next five years, Japan will strive to identify, \nformulate and implement the best projects through policy dialogue with \ndeveloping countries. At this stage I wish to confirm Japan's proposal that a \nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to environmental issues, as a \nfollow-up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, be \nheld before 1997. \nWhereas refugees are returning to their homes in Cambodia and other parts \nof the world, the refugee problem in the former Yugoslavia and in Somalia \nremains extremely serious. The international community must unite to address \nsuch complex problems as shelter, emergency aid, and assistance in \nreintegrating refugees following their voluntary return home. Japan will \ncontinue to be active in extending humanitarian aid through the office of the \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other international agencies. \n\nPopulation is another problem facing all humankind - a problem that \ndemands the cooperation of both developed and developing countries. Japan \nwishes, in preparation for the 1994 world population and development \nconference, and with the cooperation of the United Nations Fund for Population \nActivities and the United Nations University, to hold in 1994 a meeting of \neminent world authorities on demographic issues, and in this regard we \nsincerely ask for the cooperation of Member States. \nI wish to refer now to steps towards revitalization of the United \nNations. The United Nations is currently faced with a number of structural \nproblems. These relate to its organization which has not adapted fully to \nthe changing times to the serious budget crisis, and to the insufficiency of \ncommunication between United Nations agencies. \nFirst, the most serious requirement of the United Nations as a global \nOrganization today is legitimacy, trustworthiness and efficacy. If the United \nNations is to realize the ideals and purposes of the Charter - based on \nlegitimacy, trustworthiness and efficacy including the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security, it must have the complete confidence of its \nMembers. In this respect, the United Nations must reshape itself in response \nto the epochal changes that we have recently witnessed changes that could \nnot have been foreseen when the Organization was founded. These include the \nrapid transformations in the international situation, the dramatic increase in \nUnited Nations membership and shifts in global power relations. \nHowever, the United Nations Charter itself still contains historical \nrelics, such as the former-enemies clauses. And the way in which the \nOrganization is structured makes one question whether it can effectively meet \nexpectations. With the aim, in part, of enhancing trust in, and the efficacy \n\nof, the Security Council, which has a particularly important role in the \nmaintenance of international peace and security, Japan believes that it is \nnecessary to consider seriously just how the United Nations as a whole should \nbe structured. This effort should include consideration of the functions, \ncomposition and other aspects of the Security Council. In my view, it is \nnecessary for the United Nations itself to begin to deal with this issue with \na view to strengthening its functions. The year 1995, which will be the \nfiftieth anniversary of the Organization, may prove to be an important \njuncture in the process of addressing this issue. The re-examination of the \nstructure of the United Nations should also be accompanied by reform of the \nEconomic and Social Council, which plays a role as important as that of the \nSecurity Council. The discussions on the Economic and Social Council that are \ncurrently being held in this direction are a welcome development. \nThe second crisis facing the United Nations is that of the budget \ndeficit. The United Nations is on the verge of bankruptcy. If it is to \nemerge from its chronic shortage of funds. Member States must honour their \nobligations and immediately pay their assessed contributions. It is \nimperative that those Member States that are in arrears pay what they owe. \nThe rapidly increasing demand for funds to finance peace-keeping operations \nmust, in the light of the importance of these operations, be met. In \nparticular, the availability of funding at the start-up stage of an operation \nis of crucial.importance and could determine the outcome of the operation as a \nwhole. Japan therefore plans to put before the General Assembly at the \ncurrent session a draft resolution to ensure that the financial requirements \nof major peace-keeping operations at the start-up stage will be met without \nimposing new financial burdens on Member States. I sincerely hope that this \ndraft resolution will receive wide support from Member States. \n\nThe third problem concerns insufficient communication among United \nNations agencies. Better communication among the component agencies of the \nUnited Nations is necessary to ensure that the limited resources of the United \nNations are used effectively and that the Organization's full potential is \nrealized. Specifically, it is important to improve liaison between the \nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council, and communication \nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly. The establishment, for \nexample, of a mechanism for periodic exchanges of view and close contact \nbetween and among the Presidents of the Security Council, the Economic and \nSocial Council, and the General Assembly either two or three at a time \nshould be considered. Furthermore, it is important for the Economic and \nSocial Council to have access to, and to provide the Security Council with, \ninformation as provided in Article 65 of the Charter. Finally, whenever a \nmajor peace-keeping operation is undertaken that will entail a major financial \ncommitment, it is essential that there be established a mechanism for \nconsultations among the permanent members of the Security Council, the major \nsources of financial support, the countries providing large contingents of \noperations personnel and the countries of the regions concerned. \nThe United Nations is entering an era of greater potential than it has \never experienced in its history of nearly half a century. This is also a \ntime, however, that will test whether the United Nations can evolve into a \nglobal organization with the capability to achieve peace and prosperity for \nall humankind. The very magnitude of the challenges and tasks that lie ahead \ndemand that now, more than ever before, each Member State be keenly aware of \nits responsibilities and carry its share of the burden. \n\nAttaching central importance to the United Nations, and committed to \nits own ideals as a peace-loving State, Japan is determined to contribute \nto the international community in a manner that is commensurate with its \nposition and responsibilities in terms not only of financial resources \nbut also of personnel and by enhancing its political role in the effort \nto build a new order of peace. And as a non-permanent member of the \nSecurity Council, Japan is striving to bring about a more peaceful world. \nI should like to conclude with the pledge that I shall do my utmost \nto see that Japan, in a spirit of conciliation and cooperation, continues \nto enhance its active contributions to the international community. \n"

        "file_text": "The \nforty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly provides the \ndemocratic transitional Rwandese Government the welcome opportunity to hail \nthe annual gathering for the conduct of international diplomacy, and thus to \nmake its contribution to the discussions on peace, security and development in \nthe world. \nHowever, allow me, at the outset Sir, to express to you my warm \ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits forty-seventh session. Your election is confirmation of the esteem and \nrespect you enjoy in the international community. You are a man of \nexperience, dialogue and conviction and these outstanding qualities guarantee \nsuccess for the work of this session of the Assembly. \n\nThe Rwandese delegation wishes to assure you. Sir, of our complete \nreadiness to make a positive contribution to the success of this session. \nConcern for effectiveness in the service of peace, justice and \ndevelopment was always the driving force behind your predecessor, \nMr. Samir Shihabi. I should like to express to him our profound gratitude for \nhis major contribution to the development of the United Nations. \nMay I also be permitted, on behalf of my delegation, to welcome very \nwarmly the courageous and innovative initiatives that have been undertaken by \nour Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for peace, justice and \nsecurity and for international cooperation and the mutually supportive \ndevelopment of all members of the international community. Such initiatives \nare certainly intended to open up a new world political, economic, social and \ncultural order. This will involve creating international solidarity between \nthe peoples and countries of the planet so that they can jointly achieve their \ncommon destiny in peace and justice. \nIn this regard, my country, Rwanda, is happy to note that between \nSeptember 1990 and September 1992 the United Nations carried out important \nactions to improve international political and economic relations. Some \nparticular achievements were: the Programme of Action for the Least \nDeveloping Countries for the 1990s, adopted at the United Nations Conference \non the Least Developed Countries, held in Paris from 3 to 14 September 1990; \nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, \nadopted by the General Assembly on 18 December 1991; a new partnership for \nsustainable development, advocated by the eighth session of the United Nations \nConference on Trade and Development, which took place in Cartagena, Colombia \nfrom 8 to 25 February 1092; and Agenda 2 1, adopted by the United Nations \n\nConference on Environment and Development, which was held in Rio de Janeiro, \nBrazil, from 3 to 14 June 1992. \nThis is a small sample of actions with the same goal: the progressive \nbuilding of a world that is more united and more mutually supportive. \nHowever, it can be achieved only after the definitive elimination of \ntotalitarian or autocratic regimes that hinder the flowering and development \nof peoples in many countries of the world. Therefore, the restoration of \ndemocracy and political pluralism are preconditions for the success of a new \nworld political order. \nThat is why, on 10 June 1991, Rwanda took the firm decision to move from \nautocracy and a single-party system to democracy and political pluralism. \nSince that time 16 political parties have been officially registered, and five \nof them are represented in the Government of democratic transition, which I \nhave had the honour to lead since 16 April 1992. \nThe current democratic process in Rwanda, although it has passed through \na number of important stages and has reached the point of no return, is \nencountering some difficulties because of the existence of forces that are \nresistant to change. We think that this is the result of the fact that in \npolitics, as in physics, as soon as forces of change are set in motion, the \nforces of inertia arise to counter them. \nThat is why the Government of transition has set as its major goal the \ntask of putting democracy in the country on a firm footing. \nTo do so, it has decided to undertake in-depth reforms to transform \nRwandese political life. Thus institutional reforms will be carried out to \nensure the separation and independence of the three branches of civil power: \nthe legislative, the executive and the judiciary. Furthermore, appropriate \n\nmachinery will be set up to allow the population to participate effectively in \nthe country's administration. Therefore, the political, social and moral \nforces in our country have been invited to contribute to the conduct of the \ndemocratic process under way in Rwanda. \nThe process of democratizing Rwandese political life is also viewed as a \nsolution to the war that has been going on in Rwanda since 1 October 1990. \nThis unjust, fratricidal and costly war has no objective raison d'\u221a\u2122tre. The \nRwandese Government feels that there can be no military solution to this \nconflict; that is why it has committed itself to seeking a negotiated solution. \nI should like to inform the international community of the efforts made \nby the multiparty Government of transition to end this conflict. These \nefforts have been directed on the one hand towards the Rwandese Patriotic \nFront, which began the war, and on the other to our neighbouring countries, \nwith a view to normalizing our relations and to coordinating our actions aimed \nat restoring peace in the subregion of the Great Lakes countries. Within this \nframework, an agreement on mutual security cooperation was signed with Uganda \non 8 August 1992. \nThe Government has resolutely committed itself to a frank and sincere \ndialogue with the Rwandese Patriotic Front. In this context, direct \nnegotiations have been taking place in Arusha, United Republic of Tanzania, \nsince 10 July 1992 with the participation of observers from Burundi, United \nRepublic of Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire, Senegal, France, Belgium, Germany, the \nUnited States of America and the Organization of African Unity. The parties \nconcerned would also like the United Nations to take part in the negotiations. \n\nThe first phase of these negotiations, which took place from 10 to \n12 July 1992, ended with the signing of a cease-fire agreement between the two \nparties. There is reason to welcome the fact that this cease-fire has been \nrespected by all sides in spite of some irregularities. \nThe second phase, which took place from 10 to 18 August 1992, brought \nabout the signing of a protocol agreement for a government of law, a protocol \ndefining the basic principles that are to govern political life in Rwanda: \nnational unity, democracy, political pluralism and respect for human rights. \nThe third phase of the negotiations, which took place from 7 to \n17 September 1992, has just been suspended and will resume on 5 October 1992. \nNone the less, the two parties have already taken another important step by \nagreeing to the existence and separation of the three powers: legislative, \nexecutive and judiciary. Let us recall that this third phase is devoted to \ndefinition of the machinery and procedures for power-sharing. \nThe Rwandese Government defends respect for the State institutions and \nagrees to the integration of the Rwandan Patriotic Front into those \ninstitutions as well as to the making of institutional arrangements to speed \nup the process of democratizing Rwandese political life and for favouring the \neffective participation of the political forces of the country in managing the \nState. \nThe work of this phase will resume on 5 October and we hope that at that \ntime the two parties will show sufficient political open-mindedness and \nrealism to find common ground quickly. Following that phase there is \nprovision for a fourth one which will study the modalities for integrating the \nfighters of the Rwandan Patriotic Front into the Rwandese Army. \n\nOver and above the efforts to end the war in Rwanda, which has been going \non since 1 October 1990, Rwanda reiterates its firm will to find a just and \nlasting solution to the problem of its refugees. \nTo this end, the Rwandese Government reaffirms solemnly that the return \nof Rwandese refugees to their country is an inalienable right that no one can \nchallenge. Actions to facilitate the welcoming of these refugees who opt for \nrepatriation have been undertaken. Mention may be made in particular of the \nidentification of reinstallation zones, the promulgation of a general amnesty \nlaw, and the sensitizing and educating of the population to welcome the \nreturnees in a spirit of reconciliation and peaceful coexistence. \nThe Government of Rwanda has also decided to ensure diplomatic protection \nfor Rwandese refugees who may have chosen to stay in host countries. These \nrefugees will enjoy all the civil rights that are recognized for other \nRwandese citizens. \nThe Government of Rwanda takes this opportunity to make another urgent \nappeal to the High Commissioner for Refugees and to the Organization of \nAfrican Unity to accelerate the completion of the plan of action for the \nrepatriation of Rwandese refugees and the holding of the donors' round table, \nwhich should take place before the end of this year. \nThe war in our country has entailed considerable economic, social and \ncultural losses. One of the unfortunate consequences of this war undoubtedly \nremains the tragic situation of displaced persons, who at present number more \nthan 350,000. They are located in 20 camps, where dozens of them are dying \nevery day from hunger, cold and poor hygiene. We take this opportunity to \nmake an urgent appeal to the international community to come to the assistance \n\nof these displaced persons. We expect this community to come to our \nassistance by providing food, tents, blankets and medicine. In monetary \nterms, what is needed to maintain these persons displaced as a result of war \namounts to $30 million a year. Moreover, we are asking friendly countries \nthat have always stood by us not to remain aloof but rather to give increased \nfinancial assistance for the rehabilitation of infrastructures and areas \ndestroyed by war and also for economic recovery. \nIn terms of international trade, Rwanda has suffered heavy losses because \nof the closing of the Kigali-Mombasa via Kampala road. Current talks among \nthe users of the north corridor are of great interest for Rwanda, which would \nlike to see this road reopened as quickly as possible. \nThe Rwandese economy, like that of other developing countries, continues \nto feel the effects of world economic imbalances and the burden of debt which \nis still suffocating the economies of the poorest countries in the world. \nThe drop in world prices for coffee, which is the principal export \nproduct of Rwanda, and which went from $2.50 in 1986 to less than 60 cents \nfrom 1982 on, has caused a considerable drop in earnings for the Rwandese \neconomy. As a result of this deplorable situation,the gross domestic product \nof Rwanda at first stagnated and then dropped while the balance-of-payments \nproblem remained largely one of indebtedness and some development projects had \nto be stopped because there were no means for investment in them. \nDespite these indicators which are not very encouraging, the Government \nhas taken courageous measures to limit the losses: drastic reduction in \npublic expenditures; credit restrictions; and the devaluation of the currency, \nwhich in two years lost more than half its value. \n\nThe Government of Rwanda expresses its gratitude to the friendly \ncountries and international organizations which have been broadly contributing \nto the execution of our structural adjustment programme. The Government of \nRwanda is also counting upon them to support the sectoral programmes for \neconomic recovery that are under way in our country. \nAfter this survey of the economic and political situation prevailing in \nour country, allow me now to take up some of the major international problems \nof the moment. \n\nBefore doing so, I should like, as other delegations have done here, to \nwarmly welcome the new Members to the great family of the United Nations. We \nwholeheartedly congratulate them and we encourage them to work for the triumph \nof the noble ideals of the United Nations. \nMankind remains torn by bloody conflicts and wars that result from \nanachronistic situations of colonialism, oppression, racism and ideological \nintolerance. The seeds of blind violence are multiplying wherever the \nsovereignty of peoples and the territorial integrity of States are being \nundermined and wherever the dignity and fundamental rights of man are being \ntrampled upon by totalitarian regimes. \nIn this context, the Rwandese delegation praises the untiring efforts of \nthe United Nations to extinguish the flames in various hotbeds of tension and \nto put an end to murderous, fratricidal conflicts that occur in the North as \nwell as in the South. In this respect, the Rwandese Government would like to \ncongratulate the Secretary-General of our Organization for his remarkable \ncontribution and for the ways and means he advocates in his \\\"Agenda for \nPeace\\\", which would favour preventive diplomacy and peacemaking, peace-keeping \nand peace-building actions. \nRwanda also welcomes the initiative taken by the twenty-eighth Summit of \nHeads of State or Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which \nallowed the Security Council to give serious consideration to ways and means \nof controlling the outbreak of massacres in South Africa. \nThe Rwandese delegation hopes that dismantling the legal pillars of \napartheid will quickly lead to the establishment of a multiracial and \ndemocratic South African society. It encourages the South African Government \nto conclude negotiations with the African National Congress and to set up a \ndemocratic Government that represents all the people of South Africa. \n\nRwanda is pleased at the resumption of peace negotiations in the Middle \nEast. We encourage all the parties involved to cooperate in good faith so \nthat that new diplomatic opportunity will be seized to the fullest in order to \nachieve a lasting peace. Against that background, the Rwandese Government \npays tribute to the new Israeli Government's gesture of halting the \nestablishment of Jewish settlements in the occupied Arab territories. \nThe Rwandese Government also supports all efforts to restore peace in the \nHorn of Africa, Liberia and other regions of the world, in particular Lebanon, \nAfghanistan, Cambodia, Cyprus and Bosnia and Herzegovina. \nThe success of the commitment of the United Nations to the process of \nnational reconciliation and democratization now under way in Central America \nreflects the renewed influence of our Organization in the management of crises \nand the seeking of negotiated solutions to local conflicts. \nIn addition, Rwanda notes with satisfaction the continuing dialogue \nbetween the parties directly involved in the conflict in Western Sahara. \nHence Africa still hopes to see the organization of a referendum, under the \nauspices of the United Nations, on the future status of that Territory. \nRwanda welcomes the current restructuring of the United Nations system \nand the end of the cold war. We hope that disarmament will lead to a positive \nnet transfer of resources to the South, where the struggle against poverty \nremains a constant challenge. \nIt is on this hopeful note that I should like once again to make an \nurgent appeal to the international community to give diplomatic support to the \nprocess of peace negotiations in Rwanda and to help, financially and \nmaterially, with the repatriation of Rwandese refugees. The active \nparticipation of the United Nations in the Arusha negotiations would be an \n\nadditional guarantee of the will of the international community to find a \njust, speedy and lasting solution to the Rwandese conflict. We also appeal to \nthe international community to come to the assistance of the 350,000 displaced \npersons and to help in the reinvigoration of our economy. \nFor its part, the Rwandese Government is committed to carrying out our \ncountry's current democratization process until the establishment of a State \nfounded on law where all Rwandese, whether they live in or out of the country, \nwill have the right to exercise their civil rights freely and without any \ndiscrimination whatsoever and to participate actively in the management of \npublic affairs. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to express to you my sincere \ncongratulations on your election as President of the forty-seventh session of \nthe General Assembly. At the same time, let me once again wish much success \nto the Secretary-General of our Organization. \nThe scale of the changes that have taken place lately on the \ninternational scene is amply demonstrated by the sheer number of new \ndelegations that have joined our ranks at the United Nations. In large areas \nof our globe, which were shown on the map hitherto only by single-coloured \n\nexpanses representing federations held together by totalitarian power, we see \ntoday a colourful collection of independent States that have regained or are \nabout to gain their sovereignty. There are few countries whose external \nrelations have been affected by these changes as directly and as deeply as \nours. The number of Hungary's neighbours has grown from five to seven, and \nfive of them will be shown as independent States only on maps that are to be \npublished in the coming months. \nTwo years ago, when I first had the opportunity to address this forum as \nthe representative of a Hungarian government formed following the first free \nelections in 45 years, I returned home convinced that the fresh breeze of \nhistory was having a reinvigorating effect on the activities of the United \nNations as well. The downfall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe not \nonly opened a new chapter in the lives of the peoples of the region, but set \non a new course the whole system of international relations. The ensuing \ntotal collapse of the bipolar world system and the fading away of the \nparalysing effect of great-Power confrontation raised particularly high \nexpectations. It appeared that the world Organization would be able to \nrespond effectively in all instances to the challenges to international peace \nand security. \nThese hopes and expectations, and the faith of some in a swift and \nradical renewal, are contrasted today by many with the present situation in \nthe world and at the United Nations. Certain sectors of the public view the \nevents of the last year as a dissipation of the hopes fostered by the historic \nturn of events in 1989 and 1990. They cite the tragedies of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, Croatia, Somalia, Karabakh, Abkhazia and other regions, the grave \nand massive violations of human rights, and the persistence of serious \n\neconomic and social tensions in the world, and reproach the world Organization \nfor not managing the crises effectively. However, we have to show that the \nUnited Nations has not retreated from the role it played and regarded as a \nhistoric milestone when the Coalition forces, on the basis of the Security \nCouncil's authorization, acted against the aggressor and liberated Kuwait. \nAn important stage in this field was the summit meeting of the Security \nCouncil in January, which renewed the commitment of the Member States to the \ncollective security system of the United Nations. As a result of this \nmeeting, it seems that preventive diplomacy has now entered the minds of \npolitical decision makers as a most promising method of crisis management. \nWe set high value on the substantive and action-oriented report entitled \n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277) that the Secretary-General has prepared on \nthe Security Council's initiative. In our view, it makes good use of the \npossibilities inherent in the Charter and may serve as a good point of \ndeparture for the efforts directed at enhancing the effectiveness of the \ncrisis-prevention, peacemaking, peace-building and peace-keeping role of the \nUnited Nations. \nNow that the relationship between the great Powers is determined not by \nopposition but agreement and a consistent search for consensus, the dust can \nbe blown off those chapters of the Charter that are related to the \ninternational collective security system and had almost become a historic \nrelic. We also concur with the Secretary-General's recommendations concerning \na stronger role for the International Court of Justice and the regional \norganizations. In this connection, I wish to announce that the Hungarian \nGovernment, empowered by a recent decision of the parliament, will deposit \nwith the Secretary-General the declaration recognizing as compulsory the \njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. \n\nIn view of the fact that the emergence of regional hotbeds of tension is \noften engendered by conflicts within individual States, one can rightly say in \nconnection with the Agenda for Peace that the viability of preventive \ndiplomacy depends to a decisive extent on how we deal with the relationship \nbetween the sovereignty of the State concerned and the preventive measures \ntaken by the international community. \nEven if an internal conflict can be localized and does not transcend the \nborders of the country, it has a direct effect on the situation and stability \nof neighbouring States and, thus, on international peace and security: the \nstrands of bilateral and multilateral political and economic cooperation are \nweakened, instability emerges, an atmosphere of mistrust prevails, there are \nmassive flows of refugees, environmental damage from the conflict spills over, \nand so on. It must be stated that in our world today, preventive diplomacy \ncan succeed so long as individual States, already at the early stages of the \ndevelopment of a problem, do make use in a responsible manner of the \ncrisis-prevention possibilities provided by the world Organization and do not \nregard them as an impairment of their sovereignty. On the other hand, if such \npossibilities remain unexploited and the problems start festering, the \nOrganization must be prepared to act resolutely, effectively and swiftly, \nmaking use of all means at its disposal against a State that threatens peace \nand security. \n \nIn the course of the crisis management of recent years the Security \nCouncil has set precedents the latest being the condemnation of \\\"ethnic \ncleansing\\\" and of breaches of international humanitarian law in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina which make it unambiguously clear that respect for human rights, \nincluding the rights of minority communities, is an integral aspect of \ninternational peace and security and can by no means be regarded as an \ninternal affair. \nIt is therefore of fundamental importance that the Security Council pay \nclose attention to grave human-rights violations in individual States. Action \nin this field by the international community is a legitimate manifestation of \nour common concern and responsibility. This constantly expanding dimension of \nthe Security Council's activity is in accord with the Charter and should be \nincorporated into preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and, in \nparticular, peace-building. \nWith regard to the practical tasks related to these activities at the \nUnited Nations, some progress can be made in the short run, beginning with the \ncurrent session of the General Assembly. For example, we can take steps with \nregard to the initiative concerning the establishment, within national \nframeworks, of standby forces for the peacemaking and peace-keeping activities \nof the United Nations. Those Governments that have already made specific \noffers to this end have demonstrated an exemplary attitude. Hungary is ready \nto do likewise. We are in favour of another initiative aimed at the \nestablishment of a temporary reserve fund to meet the initial cost of \npeace-keeping operations. \nHungary also supports the Secretary-General's proposal that, even on the \nrequest of only one of the parties to a conflict, international monitors could \n \nbe deployed on the territory, including its border areas, of the requesting \nparty. These measures could be similar to those planned for the near future, \nwith the support of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, in \nconnection with the Southern Slav crisis, in the form of monitoring missions \nto be sent to Hungary and other States. \nCentral and Eastern Europe are the scene of one of the major changes in \ninternational relations. Here the scenario of almost euphoric expectations \nand of ensuing disillusionment is played out in an especially dramatic way. \nFollowing the demise of communism, it seemed that the outlines of a new and \nunifying Europe were appearing on the horizon. The States in the region were \nfaced simultaneously with the tasks of returning to Europe, both symbolically \nand in reality, and of ending the conflicts that for centuries had plagued \nrelations between their peoples. We had every right to hope that, this time, \nthe past would not be repeated and that, with guidance through jointly \nproclaimed democratic ideals, the recognition of interdependence would prevail \nover confrontation. \nFor the peoples of multinational States welded together by coercion and \ntotalitarian methods, the spread of democracy has also become an experience of \nnational emancipation. It is a telling fact that, following more than seven \ndecades of existence, all three federal States bordering my country recently \ndisintegrated with tempestuous speed or are undergoing a process of \ndisintegration. _ In our view, it is wrong to regard such processes as an \nentirely retrograde phenomenon and contrasting them with modern \nintegrationist tendencies to deplore them. Internal turmoil, efforts at \nsecession and the breakup of existing State frameworks are most likely to \noccur where integration does not enjoy genuine popular endorsement and where \ndemocratic mechanisms for conflict management are lacking. \n\nToday the key issue of stability and security in Central and Eastern \nEurope is recognition and promotion of the endeavours of peoples for \nself-determination and of the endeavours of national minorities to secure \nadequate forms of self-government. This can be advanced only through the \ncombined efforts of the parties concerned and the international community, in \nconformity with the basic norms of international law. \nFor these peoples, endeavours towards self-determination constitute the \nfirst, and apparently unavoidable, step on the road back to Europe the road \nto participation in a new and voluntary integration. On the other hand and \nit is gratifying to be able to say this more and more people now recognize \nthe compelling need to deal positively with the problem of national \nminorities, including those people who, only recently, persisted in denying \nthe reality of such questions. \nHowever, it is a mistake for anyone to seek to achieve self-determination \nand self-government by resurrecting the nineteenth century concept of the \nnation State, and it is a crime to advance that concept by redrawing frontiers \nby force or \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\". We are all well aware that attempts to create \nso-called ethnically pure States have more than once in history degenerated \ninto massive tragedy, naked aggression and crimes against humanity and against \nminorities. \nThe enormous changes that are taking place in our region pose yet another \npressing problem: how are we to ensure success for this unprecedented and \nhistoric transformation, which is occurring in difficult conditions? We have \nto cope with a hard legacy, bequeathed by the past, a legacy that is a source \nof complex problems to solve and of lurking dangers to avoid. The transition \nfrom dictatorship and so-called planned economies to political pluralism and \n\nmarket economies is an uncharted path, lacking time-tested models or \nexamples. This process involves tension and sharp internal debate, both \neconomic and social, just as it produces unresolved external problems. \nIn this respect, I should like to mention the vitally important legal, \necological and navigational problems that arose along one of our fluvial \nfrontiers as a result of the construction of a hydroelectric dam on the River \nDanube. Much to our regret, the bilateral talks aimed at finding a solution \nto the problem have so far been unproductive. We want to do everything \npossible to ensure that Hungary and the neighbour in question, with welcome \ninternational assistance, can find a mutually acceptable solution rather than \nadd another source of conflict to our region, which is already ridden with \ntension. \nThe transformations sweeping through Central and Eastern Europe present \nanother question: how are the dark shadows accompanying the rebirth of \nfreedom and democracy to be confronted? These transformations must be \nprotected from all extremes: from the demons of totalitarianism, of whatever \ncolour; from the revival of various brown-shirt ideologies; and from attempts \nto paint over communism with national colours. All these things, with their \ndemagogic appeal and offer of temptingly simplistic solutions, can only \nundermine and ruin the unsparing and strenuous efforts to establish and \nstrengthen the rule of law. \nHungary is convinced that it will prove to be equal to the historic \nchallenge and will bring about the triumph of the universal and lasting values \nof our civilization. However, the peoples of our region are far from being \nthe only ones affected by this task and interested in mastering it. \nTherefore, their efforts to ensure that democratic values prevail require and \ndeserve international support. \n\nIn the immediate neighbourhood of my country in the former Yugoslavia \nthe gravest crimes and violations of human rights continue to occur. The \nSouthern Slav crisis has for more than a year gravely endangered international \npeace and security through aggressive nationalism, dictatorial government, the \nforcible acquisition of territory, \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", the intimidation of \nminorities and the daily suffering of the 2 million people who have been \nchased from their homes. \n\nGrave responsibility for the outbreak of the crisis and the spread of the \nconflict to successive new areas rests with Serbian nationalism and its \nregular and irregular armed forces. The value judgement of the international \ncommunity in that respect was expressed again as recently as last week in the \nrelevant General Assembly resolution. We believe that the Security Council \ntoo must take further concrete measures to promote a comprehensive, lasting \nand equitable settlement of the crisis. It is indispensable to expand the \ninternational presence in the territory of the former Yugoslavia and to \nincrease its effectiveness. The peace-keeping forces of the United Nations, \nwhich have earned all our recognition, should have their mandate extended, \nwith their preventive deployment in areas where such action is warranted and \nhas not been taken so far. \nThe brutality raging almost undisturbed in the territory of the former \nYugoslavia is a telling signal that the world has not yet done everything \npossible to enforce, with all the means at its disposal, the purposes and \nprinciples enshrined in the Charter. The aggressor must be made aware that \nthe international community, including the States of Europe, will under no \ncircumstances acquiesce in situations brought about as a result of violent \nconquests and inhumane actions, and is prepared to cast out from among its \nranks all those who would want to pull our continent back to the age of \nbarbarism. On the threshold of a new world full of great opportunities, the \nUnited Nations must take a firm stand against aggressions and breaches of \nlaw. It is no exaggeration to say that the peace and tranquillity of present \nand future generations will depend on that choice. \nIt is with deep concern that our public opinion is following the \ndevelopments of the situation of the Hungarian minority in Serbian Vojvodina \n\nand other areas under Serbian control, where a Hungarian community close to \nhalf a million lives in increasing danger and under threat. Serbian policy \nnot only has chased tens of thousands of Hungarians from their ancestral \nhomes, but is now intent on settling several thousand Serbian refugees in \nterritories of Vojvodina and Croatia inhabited by Hungarians and others, \nthereby forcibly changing the ethnic composition of whole areas. This is a \ngrave violation of resolutions of the Security Council and of the decisions of \nthe London Conference, which demands an adequate response. \nRecently, Hungary has given shelter to over 80,000 refugees from the \nformer Yugoslavia, in addition to the more than 50,000 who had arrived earlier \nfrom another neighbouring country. I know from personal experience that these \nrefugees are eager to return, but the conditions that would enable them to do \nso are, unfortunately, not yet ripe. In order to create such conditions as \nsoon as possible, we consider it necessary for the United Nations forces in \nthe former Yugoslavia to assume an active role in conformity with the Vance \nplan to assist the safe return of the refugees, to create conditions under \nwhich the right of the returnees can be guaranteed and the prosecution of \nthose responsible for violations of law can take place. The Hungarian side \noffers its full cooperation to this end. \nWe cannot speak of freedom, democracy, justice and, consequently, of \nthe rule of law when the rights of national, ethnic, linguistic or religious \nminorities are not respected. The legitimate aspirations of the minorities \nto preserve their identity, language, culture and religion, as well as to \nfoster relations with their mother nations, do not at all call into question \ntheir loyalty as citizens. These aspirations, therefore, cannot be regarded \nas a threat to the unity of the State. The various concepts of autonomy \n\narising out of a particular minority situation do not call into question the \nframework of the State concerned. Their purpose is to create the proper \nconditions for the self-government of minorities and for the exercise of their \nrights in a way that fits into the constitutional and legal order. Life \ndemonstrates that orderly minorities do not weaken, on the contrary, they \nunequivocally strengthen the stability of the State and its internal social \npeace. In this connection, we sincerely welcome the settlement by Austria and \nItaly of the issue of Alto Adige-Sud Tirol. This example may be worth \nfollowing as a democratic solution for minority problems and may serve as a \ncredible counterargument in the face of those forces that do not tire of \nsuggesting, by way of whispered propaganda or spectacular and noisy \ndemonstrations, that the raising of such questions is meant only to conceal \nterritorial demands. \nThe United Nations, as the most comprehensive multilateral organization, \nhas a major role to play in the promotion of the rights of minorities. We \nattach particularly great significance to the completion of the draft \nDeclaration on the Rights of Persons belonging to National, Ethnic, Religious \nand Linguistic Minorities. We see this as an important initial stage of a \nprocess. However, the effective protection of minorities also requires the \ndrawing up of binding international norms. Consequently, we consider it \ndesirable to start the relevant codification process as soon as possible. \nIn the field of minority protection, it is essential to introduce an \ninstitutional system of international guarantees and to create suitable \nfact-finding, monitoring, conciliation and counselling mechanisms, such as a \ncomplaints mechanism with the competent international forums. These forums \nwould be empowered to investigate infringements of minority rights, identify \n  \nthose responsible, eliminate the consequences of the infringement of rights \nand compensate the injured party. In this context, mention must be made of \nthe important step forward taken by the Conference on Security and Cooperation \nin Europe with the establishment of the Office of High Commissioner on \nNational Minorities. \nWe must all trust that the conflicts inevitably arising out of the \nradical transformations in our world will be solved through dialogue, \ncompromise and, when necessary, recourse to international forums. Even crises \nand difficulties cannot eclipse the fact that since the end of the cold war \nthe international community has become capable of taking incomparably more \nefficient measures than previously to deal with threats to international peace \nand security. Hungary is convinced that our rejuvenating world Organization \nwill overcome the \\\"too-little-too-late\\\" syndrome, will also have the necessary \nfinancial resources and as a result of the reforms already under way will \nbe in a better position to meet the requirements of our times. In this field, \nas in so many others, we must be ready to leave behind an old era that should \nnever return. "

I am glad to see \nthis important office occupied by a representative of one of Europe's new \ndemocracies. \nThis year 13 new Members are joining our Organization: nine former \nSoviet republics as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia and San \nMarino. Iceland sincerely welcomes them all and looks forward to working with \nthem in this forum in the future. \nThe present is in many ways a time of remarkable opportunities for the \nUnited Nations.' The continued improvement of the international situation has \nover the past year inspired our Organization with a bold new optimism. We now \nhave a realistic chance of breathing new life into the United Nations Charter \nand working in concert for the betterment of the world we live in. It is a \nchance none of us can afford to miss. \n\nSince the last session of the General Assembly important strides have \nbeen made towards the establishment of a safer and more predictable \ninternational environment. Progress has been substantial in the area of \narms control and disarmament. For over 40 years the peoples of the world \nhave been haunted by the spectre of nuclear holocaust. Owing largely to \nthe fundamental changes that have taken place in the former Soviet Union, \nthe role of nuclear weapons is quickly diminishing. The announcement by \nPresidents Bush and Yeltsin last June of dramatic cuts in the strategic \narsenals of their countries was an important milestone in this regard. \nThe draft Convention on chemical weapons, adopted by the Conference on \nDisarmament earlier this month, represents another major step towards the \neventual elimination of all types of weapons of mass destruction. \nThe deterrence of war, a guiding principle of the cold war, is giving \nway to a different demand: the preservation of peace. As the emphasis \nshifts from military to economic and political means of obtaining \nsecurity in effect from strategy to diplomacy the United Nations \nshould also be given increasing scope for action. \nDiplomacy is bringing gains in regional disputes that have long been \nmajor issues on the United Nations agenda. In the Middle East a historic \nbreakthrough has taken place with the initiation of the peace process \nstarted at Madrid. Forty-four years after the establishment of the State \nof Israel, Israelis and Palestinians are finally sitting at the same table \nand negotiating their differences. Setbacks notwithstanding, important \nsteps have been taken by the Government of South Africa to abolish the \nnotorious system of apartheid. \n\nNot least among the positive aspects of recent events is the growing \nrecognition of the legitimate role of the United Nations in upholding \ncollective security. In only four years the total of new United Nations \npeace-keeping operations has equalled the number of such operations over a \nperiod of 40 years previously. Clearly, however. United Nations \npeace-keeping will be viable only as long as the political will to deploy \npeace-keeping forces is matched by the resources to sustain them. \nA great deal has been achieved, raising hopes for the future of our \nOrganization. But this is not the time for complacency. There are still \nserious stumbling blocks on the road to genuine peace and security. \nOvercoming them requires redoubled efforts by the world community and \nindividual States. \nReductions in nuclear arsenals, already agreed, will take years to \naccomplish. In the meantime, proliferation of dangerous weapons will \ncontinue apace, unless measures are taken to combat this menace \neffectively. Should our combined efforts fail, we may face a paradoxical \nsituation in which the world becomes less dependent on nuclear weapons but \nat the same time more unstable and more militarized. \nFurthermore, violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms are \nstill taking place on a large scale. The United Nations has been \nsuccessful in the progressive development and codification of human \nrights. But setting standards is not enough. We must also ensure that \nthey are respected. It is in that spirit that Iceland looks forward to \nnext year's World Conference on Human Rights. We sincerely hope that the \nfinal outcome of the Conference will be a stepping stone towards a more \neffective implementation of human-rights standards all round the world. \n\nWhile the ice cap of the cold war has melted, national and ethnic \nrivalries have been rekindled, creating new dangers of regional \ninstability. Ominous seeds of future intolerance and violence may have \nbeen sown through the appalling human-rights abuses and outright \natrocities committed in some of the States of the former Yugoslavia. In a \nbrutal conflict like the one we are witnessing in Bosnia and Herzegovina \nthere are always shades of grey between black and white. No single party \ncan be assigned sole responsibility. However, the territorial gains made \nby one of the parties, its overwhelming military superiority and the \nethnic origin and number of refugees are uncontested facts which \neloquently speak for themselves. \nAll efforts unilaterally to change internationally recognized \nboundaries must be unreservedly condemned, as must the barbarous practice \nof \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\"- At the same time, all parties to the conflict must \nbe brought to realize that a solution can be found only through peaceful \nmeans and not on the battlefield. The relevant measures of the Security \nCouncil, including sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia, must be scrupulously adhered to. In this context, Iceland \nwelcomes the results of the recent London Conference and looks forward to \nits follow-up in Geneva. \nTragic circumstances in the former Yugoslavia must not, however, be \nallowed to divert our attention from the deplorable situation which \ncurrently prevails in war-torn and famine-stricken Somalia. A quarter of \nSomali children have already died from malnutrition and disease this year, \nand a million more are similarly at risk in the coming months. Effective \ninternational coordination of relief efforts, including improved \ncoordination between all relevant United Nations bodies, is the key to any \n\nimprovement of the situation. Moreover, we must draw proper lessons from \nthis unfortunate and disastrous experience and spare no effort to ensure \nthat our Organization can respond in a timely and more effective manner to \ncatastrophes like the one in Somalia. \nReturning to Europe, we find that parts of the legacy of the last 40 \nyears have not yet been successfully eradicated. Last year we welcomed \nthe three Baltic States, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as sovereign \nMembers of the United Nations. The continued stationing of foreign troops \non the soil of those countries without their consent and in the absence \nof a firm timetable for withdrawal remains, however, a source of serious \nconcern. At their meeting in Bornholm last month the Prime Ministers of \nthe five Nordic countries emphasized that the earliest possible withdrawal \nof foreign military forces from the three Baltic States would contribute \nto the stability of the region as a whole. Iceland welcomes the recent \naccord on a troop pull-out from Lithuania by August next year, and hopes \nthat the agreement will herald an orderly, complete and unconditional \nwithdrawal of foreign troops from all three Baltic States. \nSuch anachronisms notwithstanding, the passing of the cold war has, \non the whole, created new openings in the areas of economic, social and \nenvironmental cooperation. This applies not least in the area of trade. \nAt a time when the virtues of free trade are extolled by East and West \nalike and the importance of having a clear and predictable framework for \nworld trade is greater than ever, it is paradoxical that the Uruguay \nRound, launched more than six years ago, should be running two years \nbehind schedule and even be in danger of imminent collapse. At stake are \nbillions of dollars worth of world trade, as well as countless new job \n\nopportunities. We cannot afford to give up. Surrender would stall growth \nin the industrialized countries and slow down the integration of the \ndeveloping countries and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe into \nthe world trade system. We have to introduce the principles of free trade \nthat have served us so well in industry into hitherto protected sectors, \nsuch as agriculture and fisheries. \nIt would, of course, hardly be realistic to expect all 108 \nparticipants in the Uruguay Round to be equally satisfied with the \nresults. The essential point, however, is that a general agreement that \nall can live with is now within reach. As the Director-General of the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Mr. Dunkel, recently \npointed out, \n\\\"the Uruguay Round is a single undertaking. The results are to be \nseen in an overall, integrated package. There is no pick and \nchoose\\\"-\nA reasonably satisfactory groundwork has been laid for the years ahead. \n\nThe future stability of world trade now hinges on two of the main \nplayers, the European Community and the United States. If they can reach \nagreement, the Uruguay Round will soon be concluded. If they do not, there \nare turbulent, even chaotic times ahead. Both players must shoulder their \nresponsibilities towards the rest of the world. The issues that remain \nunresolved are not of a nature to justify yet another postponement, which \nwould in fact mean the end of the Uruguay Round. \nWe cannot afford to let the Uruguay Round founder on the unjustified \nclaims of a rural minority for protection and subsidies. The contribution of \nagriculture to gross domestic product has dropped drastically in the developed \nworld, but support for and protection of agriculture has increased. \nFree-trade forces in manufacturing and services are more advanced than they \nare in agriculture, and it is noteworthy that in recent years subsidies to \nmanufacturing in the developed world have declined. \nAmong the most important commitments embodied in the United Nations \nCharter is the determination of our countries to promote social progress and \nbetter standards of living in conditions of greater freedom. But over the \nlast 10 years social conditions in a number of countries have actually \ndeclined. More than 1 billion people live in absolute poverty. What is \nneeded is for all nations represented in the Assembly to rise above their \ndisagreements and act together to relieve the plight of those living under \nconditions of abject misery. Iceland supports, therefore, the proposal to \nconvene a world summit for social development in 1995. \nThis year marks the end of the United Nations Decade of Disabled \nPersons. The implementation of the objectives of the World Programme of \nAction has, when all is said and done, been disappointing. We must respect \n\nour pledges to the world's half billion persons with disabilities and recommit \nourselves to the objective of creating equal opportunities for all people. \nIn the past few years we have become increasingly aware of the \ninterrelationship between the state of the environment and advances in human \nrights and social development. As was already noted by that distinguished \nrepresentative of the best tradition of European humanism, Willy Brandt, \n12 years ago: \n\\\"It can no longer be argued that protection of the environment is an \nobstacle to development. On the contrary, the care of the natural \nenvironment is an essential aspect of development\\\". \nThe success of efforts to deal with global environmental problems and a \nlong-term strategy to achieve sustainable development will depend in large \npart on how we manage population growth. At the present growth rate the human \nrace is likely to double in less than half a century. Obviously, all nations, \nrich and poor alike, owe it to succeeding generations to cooperate in \nachieving a major revision of social policies in the field of population \ncontrol. \nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de \nJaneiro was a landmark event, as was evidenced by the wide participation in \nthe Conference. Its achievements provide a sound basis for further work. In \norder to safeguard our planet from otherwise-inevitable ecological disaster, \nwe must agree on targets and measures that will lead us towards sustainable \ndevelopment. \nDuring the past year there have been no indications that the state of the \nglobal environment is improving or that we have managed to turn the tide. On \nthe contrary, findings earlier this year which show a further depletion of \nozone in the stratosphere are of great concern. Recent disclosures of massive \n\ndischarges of radioactive waste and other hazardous materials into the Barents \nand Kara Seas from the former Soviet Union could also be an indication of an \necological time bomb. These and many similar dangers have made the Earth \nappear smaller than ever before and demonstrate the need for enhanced \ninternational cooperation and stronger national commitment to environmental \nprotection. \nTurning to the follow-up to the Rio Conference, Iceland considers the \nprevention of marine pollution, as well as efforts to ensure sustainable \nutilization of all marine living resources, to be of fundamental importance. \nThe oceans are not only a crucial part of the respiratory system of our planet \nbut also an indispensable source of food for mankind. The requirements of \nbasic human subsistence make it imperative that the living resources of the \nsea remain available for human consumption. Moreover, marine resources could \nbecome one of the most important assets of developing countries as they strive \nfor sustainable development. Iceland therefore particularly welcomes the \nunanimous decision taken at the Rio Conference to convene an international \nconference to address the prevention of marine pollution from land-based \nsources. \nAs pollution endangers our natural environment, so there are other \nnoxious influences which threaten to corrupt our societies from within. Drug \nabuse is a global problem which threatens the security and stability of many \ncountries and is a serious social problem in most countries of the world. The \ndrug problem is'a multi-faceted one. We must continue to fight, with real \nsolutions which touch on all its facets, including ways to diminish demand, \nproduction and trafficking. Drug-trafficking is increasingly an organized \ncrime, victimizing mainly our youth. More effective leadership, based on a \n\nmore definite mandate from the United Nations International Drug Control \nProgramme, is clearly called for. \nIn my opening words, I referred to a time of remarkable opportunities for \nthe United Nations. Before concluding, I feel it is appropriate to return to \nthose unique circumstances in the context of the tasks and challenges ahead. \nNow more than ever, the United Nations has the potential to become a more \ncredible and effective world Organization for the benefit of all humankind. \nBut the moment must be seized. There is a need to revamp the United Nations \nfrom within, to consolidate the Organization politically and concentrate on \nmore effective management. This is necessary, not least in order for the \nOrganization to regain and maintain the trust of its Member States. \nFurthermore, we must adapt the United Nations to the new demands posed by the \ngrowing number of Member States, the radical changes on the international scene \nand the growing interdependence of States since the Second World War. \nThe Secretary General's recent report entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" \npoints the way. Let us be mindful of his observation that States Members of \nthe United Nations are fortunate in having been given a second chance to \ncreate the world envisioned in the Charter, a chance denied with painful \nconsequences the members of the League of Nations.

        "file_text": "Anyone who \nhas spoken from this rostrum will probably understand what my feelings are at \nthis moment: there is both a feeling of pride in my people and my country, \nwhich have now set out along the road of independent development a right \nthat does not come so easily and a sense of enormous responsibility for \nevery word I say, for my words will be addressed to the whole world. And I \nhope they will be heard! \nAll of us who have gathered here in this highly respected international \nforum, whatever our natural objective differences may be, have in common a \nsingle goal, that of achieving peace and security, and a single desire, to \nsolve existing problems and prevent new ones from arising. Through our \nunderstanding that the world is interdependent in all its aspects, we have \ncome to realize our necessary interest in overcoming difficulties, and that \ncommon interest has become the foundation of this transitional stage on the \nroad towards the establishment of a new world order. \nAll of us, I think, have already got over the euphoria of expecting rapid \nchanges that were about to take possession of a world liberated from the \nchains of the cold war, and we have come to understand the depth of the \nproblems confronting a human race which has gone to the limit in its search \nfor new paths to development. Nobody is expecting easy victories. \nThe situation in the world is undergoing fundamental and sometimes \ndrastic changes. The military, political and economic confrontation between \nthe two systems which had for a long time determined the balance of power in \nthe world has come to an end with the collapse of one of them. What this has \nactually done is to destroy the foundation of international security, which \nhad until then been intimidation and deterrence through parity of forces. \nA new system of world security must be created, one oriented on the new \npoles of power, the new roles of the super-Powers, new threats, new ways of \nwaging war and new types of forces. The probability of a nuclear war has been \nreduced almost to zero, but the element of chance has increased; there are no \nsafeguards against the occurrence of regional wars or against the unforeseen \nactions of State leaders or the consequences of those actions. These are all \nmatters of serious concern to the Azerbaijani Republic, for no State can be \nsecure on its own. \nAzerbaijan has no nuclear weapons on its soil and is not participating \ndirectly in the process of nuclear disarmament. Nevertheless, the Azerbaijani \nRepublic is making its contribution by acceding to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We are optimistic as a result of the \nimplementation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, to which \nAzerbaijan, along with other European States, has become a party. However, \ndespite the achievements and successes of the disarmament process, military \nexpenditures are, as before, absorbing a significant portion of State budgets \nat a time when such funds could be directed towards economic development. \nArms stockpiling is, as before, a threat to security. \n\nOne of the most important elements in military security is the openness \nor transparency of military programmes and activities. As a member of the \nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), my country is \nparticipating in the development of this process. \nThe move towards direct cooperation in the form of wide-ranging and \nintensive multilateral exchanges of information on military budgets and \nnumbers, production levels, research, development and modernization programmes \nand weapons deployment and delivery plans seems to be a desirable one. Such \nopenness will create an atmosphere of trust, make it easier to predict \ndevelopments in the overall security situation, bolster stability and reduce \nthe risk of war. \nDuring the long years of the East-West conflict it was usual for one side \nto arm the other's enemies. Today, when the threat of confrontation along \nEast-West lines has gone, this so-called foreign-policy wisdom is likely to \nprove a significant danger to us all. Weapons proliferation is a serious \nchallenge to international security and requires the world community to take \nactive steps in order to ensure that it is limited and effectively controlled. \nArms shipments, which are fraught with a fundamental potential for \ndanger, are becoming a real factor capable of producing destructive effects on \nthe situation in so-called hot spots. I hardly need explain how much trouble \nAzerbaijan has been caused by the weapons, including foreign-made weapons, \nbeing supplied, within Azerbaijani territory, by Armenian forces. We must \nencourage restraint on the part of arms suppliers; this will, of course, \nentail political difficulties. Limits could be placed on exports of arms to a \nparticular country or region. \nIt should be normal practice to declare arms transfers and to observe \nestablished limits, and the political complexion of the recipient must also be \ntaken into account. The United Nations Register of conventional arms \ntransfers will undoubtedly also play an important role in this regard. \nGiven the attempts by certain countries to obtain weapons covertly, I \nwould like to emphasize the extreme importance of having access to \nintelligence data on weapons proliferation and of observing suspicious regions \nand carrying out unannounced inspections there. In addition to the direct \neffects, these would increase States' confidence in the weapons \nnon-proliferation regime. I believe that it would be appropriate to make \nefforts to establish subregional restraint regimes; this is particularly \nurgent for the multiplicity of hot spots which are appearing against the \nbackground of a minimal military threat on a Europe-wide scale. Subregional \nrestraint could include reducing military force levels in limited \ngeographically remote areas. Thereafter such regimes could lay the groundwork \nfor the demilitarization of whole regions. Azerbaijan has already proposed \nthis concept for the Transcaucasian region. \nThe vacuum left by the disappearance of the Soviet Union from the \nmilitary and political map of the world threatened to bring global disaster. \nHowever, we have survived that difficult period. In its death throes, the \nSoviet Union fortunately disintegrated; new sovereign States arose from its \nruins and declared for all to hear that they were determined to join the \ncommunity of democratic States based on law and with market economies. The \nUnited States of America and Russia, the two super-Powers, as they are still \nbeing called, have started to cooperate in the name of their common interests. \n \nWorld developments of the last few years do indeed show that the \ndemocratic sphere is expanding. More and more countries want to be \ndemocratic, and regimes of other kinds are facing more and more difficulties. \nOf course, the development of democracy is a very difficult process whose \nultimate goal, the establishment of an ideal system, is difficult to achieve; \nhowever, we can and must move forward towards that goal, by consolidating \ndemocratic values and institutions. And the core of the issue here is not \nmerely adherence to ideals but the political and socio-economic rightness of \nthe democratic system, whose effectiveness will very soon, I hope, become \napparent in my country as well. \nThere is in science a principle called dynamic evolutionary stability, \naccording to which the elements of a system obey the same laws and move in the \nsame direction. Any member of the system which tries to move in a direction \ndifferent from the general trend is thrown out. And so it is in life. One \ncannot enter the world system and then follow a different programme and not \nobserve the same rules as everybody else. Of course, the euphoria of national \nindependence may prompt its own \\\"special\\\" path, but we know from history how \nsuch experiments end. \nWhat is the substance of the Azerbaijani Republic's national \nindependence? Today new people have taken the helm, people free of the dogmas \nof the communist past, prepared to see the world as it is, without ideological \nmasks, and striving for cooperation on the basis of common human values. \nThese people have inherited the burdensome legacy of a repressive State which \ngoverned an obedient society, but that has only made their resolve to overcome \nit that much stronger. Our need for capable authorities which would see as \ntheir principal purpose the creation of the conditions for stimulating \n\ninitiative and independence, which would act in the interests of the \nindividual and would be rooted in the institution of citizenship, was forged \nin suffering. Our State policy is based on the interrelationship between the \nfreedom and well-being of the individual and the security and prosperity of \nthe State. Today the Government of the Azerbaijani Republic is facing the \ncomplex task of establishing legislative, political and socio-economic \nsafeguards for the irreversibility of the democratic process. \nNewly independent States encounter a multitude of political, economic and \nsocial problems on their way to establishing themselves. They must face the \ndifficult task of overcoming those problems within a cruelly short time-limit \nset by life itself. However, even that punishing pace at which the democratic \nauthorities chosen by the people must act is intensified by threats and \nchallenges of a different order which undermine States that are not yet \nstanding on their own feet. I have in mind here what are called inter-ethnic \nconflicts, which are more political than ethnic in nature. \nThere are no limits to the energy of a nation, which has become one of \nthe driving forces of the development of mankind in the twentieth century. \nThe explosive power of the energy of a national ego released from the fetters \nof many years of repression destroys the apparently unshakeable citadels of \ntotalitarian regimes and opens up new prospects for people. \n\nHowever if that same power is placed at the service of an ugly, overblown \nnationalistic idea, it turns a people onto the path of war and drives it to \naggression and expansion against another people chosen as its victim. \nAn example of the first kind of national idea is the disintegration of \nthat conglomeration of nations known as the USSR. An example of the \nsecond and a most accurate one - is the aggression of Armenia against \nAzerbaijan. \nTo any action there is an opposite reaction. An aggressor dooms himself \nfrom the outset to failure, for he arouses against himself a people's natural \nreaction of self-defence, a force many times greater than the irrational force \nof aggression. Prosperity gained at another's expense cannot be long-lasting, \neven if it sometimes seems so. \nWhat is the result? Death and destruction, masses of destitute people on \nboth sides, relations between States made difficult or broken off these are \nreflected many times in all spheres of human activity and threaten to escalate \nto new and more dangerous levels, involving other States and altering the \nregional or even the world balance. There is only one alternative: to end \nthe aggression, if not voluntarily, then under the pressure of counter-force. \nAggression must not go unpunished. Aggressors must be stopped. \nThe importance of the international community's position on this issue \ncannot be overestimated. A timely, principled reaction by the international \norganizations, first and foremost by the United Nations and CSCE, is one of \nthe guarantees that the required result will be achieved - that the aggression \nwill be eliminated and therefore thousands of lives saved and that the \nconditions for States to develop peacefully will be established. The key idea \nthat breaches of the peace are inadmissible is based on the fact that each \n\nState bears a high responsibility to the world community, and it presupposes a \nharmonization of national interests with the interests of all mankind. \nNo one can dispute the right of a nation to the free choice of its path \nof development, but there are no rights without duties, and this is also true \nof nations, whose freedom of choice is controlled by their interrelationships \nwith the world, as parts of the whole. Freedom does not mean irresponsibility. \nViolence of any kind, whatever its motivation or justification, is \ninadmissible. In our time the kind of nationalism that has nothing in common \nwith national self-awareness has come close to being the greatest wellspring \nof violence. Sooner or later, that kind of nationalism finds the framework \nimposed on it by history constricting, and it starts to break out, violating \nother peoples' borders and infringing upon other peoples' interests. \nToday, having emerged from an ideologically divided world, we are facing \nthe danger of dismemberment based on nationalistic grounds which feed the \npolitics of separatism. The fact that the legal norms governing the right of \npeoples to self-determination, and even the meaning of the term, have not been \nfully worked out, either in domestic or in international law, has opened the \ndoor to widespread speculation on the subject on pseudo-democratic grounds, \nwhich are essentially a cover for forces harbouring plans to seize territory. \nWe must make it clear, first of all, that the right of peoples to \nself-determination can be exercised solely by peaceful means; secondly, that \nthe possessor of that right can be only a nation, not a national minority or \nan ethnic group; thirdly, that a people exercising its right to \nself-determination must not violate another people's right, its sovereignty or \nthe integrity of its State. \n\nMaking the discussion of the foregoing more concrete by projecting these \nconclusions onto the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, I am compelled to say the \nfollowing. \nThe Republic of Armenia, having set the dismemberment of the Azerbaijani \nState and the seizure of its territories as the goal of its State policy, \ninitiated the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, an inseparable part of Azerbaijan, \nunder cover of a demand for the right to self-determination for the Armenian \npopulation of that Azerbaijani region, whose borders, incidentally, have not \nbeen defined. There are no internal borders in the unitary Azerbaijani \nState. The region was split off administratively during the Stalin era, and \nit is the Armenian side that is so fervently demanding the elimination of the \nlegacy of that time. \nI think there is no need to comment on the ill-intentioned substitution \nof the concept of \\\"people\\\" for that of \\\"national minority\\\". The Armenian \npeople has already exercised its historic right to self-determination within \nthe borders of the Republic of Armenia. With regard to the Armenian national \nminority which lives in Azerbaijan and has autonomy, the Azerbaijani Republic \nhas repeatedly stated its readiness to guarantee that minority's rights in \naccordance with international norms, while justifiably expecting the Republic \nof Armenia to take suitable steps in respect of the Azerbaijani community \nwhich has lived for centuries in the territory of the present-day Republic of \nArmenia but has had no rights whatsoever and which, alas, has now been forced \nout of Armenia into Azerbaijan. \nThe conflict, which is now a matter of concern to the world community, \nbegan with a blatant violation of the Azerbaijani Republic's sovereignty by \nArmenian separatists who, without holding any discussions with the Government \nof Azerbaijan, proclaimed their secession from the Azerbaijani Republic. \n\nThey were supported by the Republic of Armenia, whose Parliament, in 1989, \nissued decrees on the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia, on \nincluding the budget of Nagorno-Karabakh in the Armenian budget and on the \nelection of deputies from Nagorno-Karabakh to the Parliament of Armenia. \nThose decrees have not been annulled to this day and are in violation of the \nnorms of international law. Such political infringements by the Republic of \nArmenia on Azerbaijan's sovereignty have since been backed up with practical \nmeasures aimed at implementing Armenia's declared plans to annex Azerbaijani \nterritory. \nThe use of force is, of course, unacceptable in settling disputes. Yet \nthe actions of the Republic of Armenia, which initially took the form of \ncovert aggression through the infiltration of separatists and terrorist gangs \nand delivering arms into Azerbaijan and which later turned into open \naggression in the form of a direct armed incursion into Azerbaijan, the \nseizure of the city of Shusha and the Lachin district and the establishment of \na land corridor joining occupied Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia, have naturally \nprompted a response from the armed forces of the Azerbaijani Government, which \nhas the right and the duty to defend the interests of its citizens and its \nState, over 10 per cent of whose territory is now under Armenian occupation. \nRenouncing the use of force under these conditions could not prevent \nbloodshed. Inaction on the part of the Government would have provoked a \nmovement from below, with the formation of self-defence forces whose actions \nwould be spontaneous and therefore might have become uncontrollable. The \nAzerbaijani Republic, which has used military force only within its own \nfrontiers and at a controlled level, the minimum level necessary to protect \nits sovereignty, has, from the very beginning of the conflict, called on the \n\nopposing side to cease hostilities and to settle existing problems at the \nnegotiating table. It is continuing today to confirm its readiness for \npeaceful dialogue by taking specific measures aimed at reaching a compromise. \nHowever, Azerbaijan's efforts were met each time with silence on the part of \nthe Republic of Armenia, which continues to make demands that are contrary to \ninternational law. One can hardly expect political leaders who rose to power \non a wave of ideas of nationalism and the establishment of a Greater Armenia \nto abandon those positions, because it would mean their political death. But \nholding that line will lead to a catastrophe incomparably greater than the \ndisappearance of the politicians from the arena. \nThe present leadership of the Republic of Armenia should realize that the \npath they have chosen is a deadly one; Armenia will never be a democratic \nState while it carries the burden of this conflict. Democracy cannot be built \non a foundation of nationalism, on flouting laws, on bloodshed and suffering. \nThis whole train of events gives us solid grounds for viewing Armenia's \nposition with regard to peaceful settlement and international mediation merely \nas an attempt to gain time for consolidation in the Azerbaijani territories \nArmenia has forcibly seized, so that it can subsequently obtain agreement on a \npolitical solution from a position of fait accompli. \nBut there is no alternative to a peaceful settlement. Decisive steps \nmust be taken to clear the obstacles from the road to peace. A necessary \ncondition for this is the withdrawal of Armenian armed formations from \nAzerbaijan, since that would establish a real foundation for a stable \ncease-fire under international supervision, for the return of refugees to \ntheir homes and the normalization of life in the war-torn areas, including \nsafeguards for the rights of the Armenian national minority living in \nAzerbaijan. \nDespite all the complications and obstacles, the peaceful settlement \nprocess initiated by CSCE and followed up by CSCE's Minsk Group under the \nchairmanship of Mr. Rafaelli, for whose efforts I am sincerely grateful, both \nto him personally and to the Government of Italy, must achieve the desired \nresult: an end to the aggression and the senseless bloodshed, the liberation \nof occupied Azerbaijani areas, the development of a peaceful dialogue between \nthe two States and the solution of existing internal problems on a reciprocal \nbasis. The national minorities in Armenia and Azerbaijan must become not \npawns in a dispute but guarantees of each other's security and of respect for \neach other's interests, and, in the future, a bridge for cooperation. \nI hold this optimistic view because I have faith in the reasonableness of \ntwo peoples and two States that have lived side by side for centuries and \nwhose history has earned them the right to peace, prosperity and \ngood-neighbourly relations. I hope that the Republic of Armenia will come to \nrealize the importance of such concepts as good neighbours, friendship and \nmutual assistance, which have deep roots in our region. \nThe concrete example of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict enables us to \ndraw certain conclusions that are related and applicable to other regional \nconflicts similar in nature to the one I have mentioned. The world we live in \nis very fragile; thus our approach to the principles governing global \ncoexistence, hammered out by the experience of human civilization, should be \nvery cautious. Those principles include, first of all, the sovereignty of \nStates, their territorial integrity and the inviolability of their borders; \nthey also include the inadmissibility of securing one's interests at the \nexpense of those of others. Such a course cannot bring independence, \ndemocracy or prosperity to any State. Everything in the world is interrelated. \nThe words spoken and the actions taken by some politicians in defence of \nhuman rights, national minorities, and nationhood can sometimes threaten the \nmost fundamental right - the right to life. When blood is being shed, it is \npointless to talk about the rights of national minorities. I have said it \nbefore and now say it again: The sovereignty of the State begins with the \nsovereignty of the individual. Respect for human rights is not part of a \nState's internal affairs but its obligation. The safeguarding of rights and \nfundamental freedoms is the main guarantee of a State's prosperous \ndevelopment. Returning to the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, I must point out \nthat our approach is based precisely on this understanding and that Armenians \nliving in Azerbaijan are just as much citizens of this State as Azerbaijanis, \nRussians, Jews, Kurds, Lezghians, Talishes or Poles. But there are no rights \nwithout obligations. The State is the guarantor of individual freedom; the \nindividual is the guarantor of the State's security. \nThe defence of human rights - and of the rights of national minorities as \npart of those rights cannot be implemented to the detriment of State \nsovereignty. External influence and interference are sometimes hard to \ndistinguish, and crossing the fine line that separates them can lead to \ndisaster. Sometimes the non-use of external force can have great benefits. \nProblems of this kind have various political, social, and economic causes, and \nsometimes a State trying to solve the problem cannot instantly unravel the \ntangle of causes and effects. It is a lengthy process requiring a delicate \napproach in which the underlying principle must be: \\\"Do no harm\\\". In such \ncircumstances a State has the right to count on the assistance and experience \nof the world community. Working to improve the State from within will have \nmore effect than pressure from without. \nEvery State has its share of responsibility to the outside world, \nexpressed as its duty to observe accepted norms and obligations. A question \nof practical interest today is that of the further elaboration in \ninternational law of the principle of sovereignty, with due regard for the \nincreased international responsibility of States. Bringing national \nlegislation into conformity with international law, a process which creates \nthe necessary regimes of rights and freedoms of the individual, is of the \ngreatest importance in this context. Such a process has already been \ninitiated in Azerbaijan. The priority of international legal norms over \nnational ones is enshrined in the constitutional act of State independence of \n18 October 1991. To conclude this subject, I should like to point out that \nour common progress in that direction must emphasize the harmonization of the \ninterests of mankind and national interests. \nOne of the main factors for stability in society, particularly during a \ntransitional period, serving in a sense as a guarantee of the irreversibility \nof democratic reforms, is a healthy and developed economy. Unfortunately, I \nmust state that today the economy of Azerbaijan has fallen on hard times. The \nlegacy of the Soviet past and the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict are taking \ntheir toll. \nThe failure of the centralized planning system further strengthened our \nconfidence in the viability of the market economy. The Parliament and \nGovernment of the Republic, committed to rapid reform, are working hard for \nthe legislative and programmed introduction of economic changes that should \naccelerate the process of market formation and integrating Azerbaijan into the \nworld economy on an equitable and mutually beneficial footing. \nThe world economy has not yet succeeded in surmounting a number of \nobstacles, foremost among which, to my mind, is the disproportion in economic \ndevelopment. It is believed that, in spite of all the problems of the world \neconomy, whose number increased sharply with the collapse of the Soviet \nsystem, the end of the ideological confrontation between the two poles of \npower has given a positive impetus to the formulation of new approaches in the \ndeveloped world towards the problems of developing countries. \nParticipation in international economic organizations and United Nations \neconomic agencies, with the concomitant opening of a wide range of \npossibilities for multilateral economic cooperation, is a matter of high \npriority for Azerbaijan. Definite hopes for instituting economic reforms in \nAzerbaijan are being placed in financial assistance and consultative technical \nassistance that could be provided under special programmes. The United \nNations, an office of which is to be opened at Baku in the near future, should \nplay an active role in this. \nHowever, I should like to express my regret concerning the position of \ncertain States in whose policy the provision of assistance to young democratic \nStates is linked to particular political objectives that are, in our view, of \na subjective nature. Refusal to provide assistance may not only fail to \npromote the development of the reform process but also create new problems for \nthe establishment of democracy in young States. The consequences of such \nill-considered steps could be far more serious than the reasons that motivated \nthe refusal. \nThe warfare initiated by the Republic of Armenia against Azerbaijan has \ncreated a social tragedy in my country. About 500,000 Azerbaijanis have been \ndeprived of the basic necessities of life; 230,000 of them were expelled from \nthe areas of Armenia in which they had historically resided, and the rest have \nbecome refugees as a result of Armenia's direct aggression against \nAzerbaijan. Our Government has encountered enormous difficulties in meeting \ntheir needs. I should like to express my hope that the United Nations will \nnot leave Azerbaijan to deal with this disaster alone and that it will provide \nall possible assistance. \nThe ecological situation, which has been gradually deteriorating \nthroughout the world, is becoming the greatest threat of all. Nature is \ncalling attention to its problems with increasing urgency through new \nenvironmental disasters and tragedies. The problem of structural reform of \nthe global economy on a basis that is environmentally sound still remains \nunsolved. The contribution of the United Nations in this field - demonstrated \ninter alia in the convening of the Conference on Environment and Development \ndeserves particular mention here. That Conference was a valuable example of \ncollective efforts to solve humanity's problems. \nMy country cannot boast of a favourable ecological situation. The \ncondition of the Caspian Sea is tragic, showing the effect of all the ills of \na planned economy and of its consumption-oriented attitude towards nature. We \nfirmly intend to make every effort to save this unique natural ecosystem, and \nwe hope that our efforts will be supported by assistance from the world \ncommunity. \nThe primary mechanism of world development at present is international \ncooperation. I believe that we can solve our problems only in that context. \nI am also convinced that the process of strengthening cooperation will \ncontinue to evolve. Naturally, such evolution is directly related to the \ngrowing importance and prestige of the United Nations. Our Organization has a \nspecial role in international relations, which are undergoing radical \nchanges. The United Nations has been, is and always will be the world forum \nin matters of justice and law, the stronghold of the civilized norms of life \nand the highest authority in the settlement of international disputes. The \ngrowing effectiveness of the Organization as a factor for security, stability \nand cooperation illustrates that fact. \nNew conditions and changes in the world situation require readjustments, \nincluding structural ones. Special attention should be given to the \ndevelopment of structures and means for preventive diplomacy, early warning of \ncrisis situations and the improvement of means for averting acts of \naggression. The United Nations should have the capacity to protect its Member \nStates more decisively and effectively from violations of their sovereignty, \ntaking action up to and including enforcement measures against the aggressor. \nCooperation with regional organizations on the basis of mutual support will, I \nbelieve, promote greater effectiveness of United Nations peace-keeping and \npeacemaking activities. United Nations structures should be brought as close \nas possible to the problems which the Organization intends to resolve. \nEverything should serve to increase the efficiency of United Nations \nactivities as a mechanism for security and cooperation. \nI am firmly convinced that the ship of the United Nations, guided by the \nstrong hand of its captain, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, a man of wisdom and \ndecisiveness as befits a true captain, will keep to the necessary course, the \nonly true course, and, as the flagship of the world community, carry it to the \nshores of peace and prosperity. \nThe forty-sixth session of the General Assembly was significant for the \nAzerbaijani Republic, when it was admitted as a Member of the United Nations. \nI take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to the President of \nthe Assembly at its forty-sixth session, Mr. Samir Shihabi, for his \ncontribution to our common cause and especially for his sensitivity and warmth \ntowards the new Members of the Organization. \nI hope that the current, forty-seventh session, under the presidency of \nMr. Stoyan Ganev, will bring us closer to our common goals. I wish Mr. Ganev \nsuccess in that position of responsibility. May every day of this session be \na day of constructive solutions of our common problems. May new difficulties \nwhich, alas, life will always throw in our way not weaken our faith, nor \ndiscourage us on our long and thorny path. We conquer the road as we walk \nalong it. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, first of all, to extend to \nyou. Sir, the warmest congratulations of the Greek Government on your election \nto the presidency. Your personal qualities and diplomatic skill augur well \nfor progress on the work of this session. Moreover, we are especially pleased \nto salute in your person the representative of a neighbouring country with \nwhich Greece maintains long-standing relations of close friendship. I also \nwish to pay tribute to your predecessor. Ambassador Shihabi, for the effective \nmanner in which he discharged his functions as President of the Assembly last \nyear. \nAllow me also to point out how impressed the Greek Government is by the \nway the Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has \n\nbeen discharging his duties since he took office at the beginning of the \nyear. We are absolutely certain that he will continue his work with the same \ndynamism and diplomatic dexterity, for the benefit of both the international \ncommunity and this Organization, which has grown since the General Assembly \nlast met a year ago. \nLet me also join other representatives in welcoming the new Members that \nhave been admitted to the United Nations as independent States, namely \nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, \nKyrgyzstan, Moldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and \nUzbekistan. \nThe admission of these new Members is a renewed expression of the desire \nof our Organization to welcome in its midst all those States that undertake \nthe commitment to adhere to the purposes and principles set out in the United \nNations Charter. \nEarlier this week the Foreign Minister of the United Kingdom, in his \ncapacity as President of the Council of the European Community, delivered a \nstatement on behalf of its 12 Member States. My Government fully subscribes \nto the contents of that statement. \nGreece is firmly committed to, and fully supports, the process of \nEuropean integration. We believe that the economic and political union we \nagreed on when we adopted the Maastricht Treaty last year will strengthen \nprogress and enhance prosperity not only on the European continent, but also \nin all the countries the Community is trading with. Greece was among the \nfirst European countries to ratify the Maastricht Treaty, and we are happy \nthat the French people as well ratified the Treaty at the referendum of last \nSunday. Allow me to note that the \\\"yes\\\" vote in the Greek Parliament was \n\noverwhelming 286 positive votes out of a total of 300 deputies voting - and \nis indicative of the extraordinary degree of unanimity of the Greek people \nconcerning the position of our country for a united Europe. \n\nI have the honour to stand before this Assembly as the representative of \na nation that is now completing a year-long celebration marking 2,500 years \nsince our ancestors first invented a form of government called in Greek \ndemokratia. which in rough translation means \\\"rule by the people\\\": democracy, \nwhich was destined to become one of the most outstanding contributions of \nGreece to the collective heritage of mankind and a cornerstone of world \ncivilization. We Greeks felt happy and, allow me to say, proud a year ago, as \nwe saw democracy and its twin principle, freedom, gaining ground throughout \nthe world and consolidating its presence in countries where totalitarianism \nhad long held sway. In welcoming new members to the community of free \nnations, the Greek Government expressed the hope that the post-cold-war world \nwould be based on the principles of democracy and freedom, on respect for \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, and on the rule of law. \nThat hope was expressed a year ago. Can we now, a year later, ascertain \nthe extent to which it has been met? Admittedly, a year's time is too short \nto allow a conclusive judgement, but the events of the last 12 months offer \nsome evidence of the direction in which the world is moving. And, I must say, \nthe evidence available is not as encouraging as our expectations were. In \nfact, we have witnessed developments that threaten the fragile positive trends \nwe had begun to see. We have seen peoples that gained their freedom and \nindependence taking the path of nationalism. Signs abound that we are \nentering a dangerous and unpredictable world situation, where conflicts, \nextreme nationalism and tensions of a new nature are erupting, and where the \nclash of interests could take the place of the ideological confrontations of \nwhich we have had bitter experience in the past. \nIn spite of the comfort of being safe at last from the threat of nuclear \nannihilation since the recent enormous strides in disarmament, in some areas \n\nthe world seems to be moving into a state of uncontrolled proliferation of \nconventional arms and civil strife. In some cases, that civil strife seems to \nbe on the brink of spilling over and becoming a threat to regional and \ninternational peace and security. To make matters worse, the weak economies \nof many developing countries remain in the grip of a deepening crisis, while \ngrowing poverty, and in certain cases even hunger, is becoming a menace to \nrecent gains in democracy. And the environment continues to deteriorate at an \nalarming pace. \nFaced with such a situation, the world community has to react \ncollectively. And as it is the United Nations that embodies the collegiality \nof the world community, it is incumbent upon it to devise ways and means to \nhelp humanity deal with the situation. In this respect, the nations and the \npeoples of the world are fortunate in that, with the cold war behind us, the \nparalysis that had for a long time plagued our Organization has now \ndisappeared. The United Nations is now indeed showing signs that it is \nwilling to live up to the expectations placed in it. \nA series of actions is being undertaken to deal with the major problems \nconfronting humanity now. In this context, earlier this year, the United \nNations Conference on Environment and Development, the largest summit ever \nheld, met at Rio de Janeiro. Next year we will see the Second World \nConference on Human Rights. In 1994, population and development will be dealt \nwith. In 1995, the World Conference on Women will take place. Finally, a \nworld summit for social development has been proposed. \nBut the first in this series of actions was taken last January and \ndirectly concerned international peace and security. The Greek Government \nwelcomed the convening of the Security Council at the summit level to reaffirm \nthe world community's devotion to the principle of collective security and to \n \nthe settlement of disputes in accordance with the principles of the United \nNations Charter, and to consider anew the means by which collective security \ncan be upheld through the Organization. \nGreece has also welcomed the document entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", on \npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping, issued by the \nSecretary-General in response to a request made by the members of the Security \nCouncil at their January summit meeting. I take this opportunity to express \nour appreciation to the Secretary-General for a document of vision, lucidity \nand challenging ideas. We in the Greek Government have studied it with great \ninterest and are looking forward to participating in the fruitful debates that \nare bound to follow in the various bodies of our Organization. \nWe are pleased that the Secretary-General sees the concepts of preventive \ndiplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping in their proper perspective within \nthe larger concept of peace and security that goes beyond the military sphere \nand encompasses social and economic factors, primary among which is the \nenjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. \nWe are also encouraged that the Secretary-General has not failed to \nemphasize the importance of democracy not only within nations but also among \nthe family of nations. \nThe perception of selectivity in the application of the principles of the \nCharter must be avoided if the moral authority of the United Nations is to be \nmaintained. This is particularly urgent now that the enforcement capability \nof the Organization is being enhanced and put to use. Enforcement without \nmoral authority is coercion and tyranny. Smaller nations need to be reassured \nthat no Power will succeed in usurping the moral authority of the United \nNations and using it for the advancement of its own interests. \n \nIt is the fervent hope of the Greek Government that the current turbulent \nsituation will prove to be only a brief transition and will soon be replaced \nby a spirit of international cooperation and solidarity. The deployment of \ncommon efforts for the maintenance of international peace and security through \npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping are an indispensable \nmanifestation of such international solidarity. The other two foundations on \nwhich this solidarity must be based are respect for human rights and \nfundamental freedoms and a common concern for the protection of the \nenvironment. \nThe subject of human rights is, of course, not new. We rejoice that the \nEuropean Community has time and again emphasized that respect for, and \npromotion and safeguarding of human rights is an essential element in \ninternational relations and, therefore, one of the cornerstones of cooperation \nand of relations between the Community and its member States and other \ncountries. \nThe expression of concern about human rights violations can no longer be \nconsidered mere interference in a State's internal affairs. Established \nprinciples governing relations among States - such as non-interference in the \ninternal affairs of other States and respect for the national sovereignty of \nStates must accommodate efforts by the United Nations and by regional \norganizations to protect the human rights of individuals and social groups \nthat are threatened in particular States. \n\nA few words about Greece's relations with its neighbours and the state of \naffairs in our region. \nWe have repeatedly and officially stated that Greece has no territorial \nclaims whatsoever against any of the countries neighbouring ours. We offer \nour friendship to all of them and we hope, indeed we are certain, they will \nreciprocate. We maintain the best possible relations with our Balkan as well \nas our Mediterranean neighbours. \nRegarding our relations with Turkey, we consider that it is of primary \nimportance for Greece and our neighbour Turkey that our two countries display \nthe necessary will and imagination to create a climate of mutual confidence, \nsecurity and stability which will redound to the benefit of the Eastern \nMediterranean in general and our two peoples in particular. \nGreece believes that it is high time for our two neighbouring States to \nfind the way, on the basis of international law and international conventions \nand treaties, to establish closer relations, compatible with the requirements \nof the Charter of the United Nations, the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter \nof Paris, as well as with the expectations of our peoples, dictated by \ngeographical proximity and by common interests. This intention, our political \nwill and our sincere desire have been repeatedly stressed by our Prime \nMinister, Mr. Mitsotakis, who has already met with the Prime Minister of \nTurkey, Mr. Demirel, four times this year, while I have had the opportunity to \nspeak in the same spirit to my Turkish counterpart, Mr. Hikmet Cetin, with \nwhom I have already met three or four times. We, for our part, laid emphasis \non the fact that the problem of Cyprus, which exercises a negative influence \non our bilateral relations, should at last find a proper solution on the basis \nof all relevant United Nations resolutions. \n \nI should like to remind the Assembly that despite coordinated efforts the \nproblem remains unresolved. Cyprus continues to be divided and a large part \nof its territory is still under Turkish occupation. The other consequences of \nthe 1974 invasion, such as those of the refugees, the missing persons, and the \ncontinuing efforts to change the demographic structure of the island and to \nplunder of Cyprus' cultural heritage, still exist and constitute the main \nelements of the tragic reality of this Mediterranean island, an integral part \nof the European family and a State Member of this Organization. In this \nrespect, the report of the European Commission of Human Rights published on \n2 April 1992 sets out the violations of human rights in Cyprus, concerning \nmissing and displaced persons, separation of families, deprivation of \npossessions and so on. \nDespite the present status quo in Cyprus which the most recent Security \nCouncil resolution explicitly characterizes as not acceptable we, together \nwith the international community, look forward to the systematic efforts of \nthe Secretary-General with the active support of the five permanent members \nof the Security Council to bring about a just, a viable and a functional \nsolution to the Cyprus problem. \nIn this respect, we note that the Secretary-General's set of ideas, \nincluding the map attached thereto, which was initially discussed last July \nand August, with special emphasis on the territorial, refugee and property \nissues, should form the basis of negotiations during the follow-on talks \nscheduled to be resumed in New York in late October. \nWe urge Turkey to use all its decisive influence on the Turkish-Cypriot \nside to ensure that it approaches the talks in a constructive manner which may \nwell contribute to the solution of the problem and the elimination of a real \nanachronism in today's Europe. \n\nIn conclusion on this subject, I wish to stress once again that the just \nsettlement of this problem would greatly benefit relations between our two \npeoples and our two countries. Moreover, it would also constitute an \nimportant element of Turkey's aspirations to its European orientation. We \nhave been trying, most emphatically, to make it clear that it is our will to \nestablish the most friendly relations with our neighbour Turkey. I do not \nthink that the international community would be proud if it were to leave this \nproblem, which has been dragging on for over 18 years, unresolved. \nThe situation in the Balkans remains a cause of major concern to all. \nThe Yugoslav crisis continues to constitute a potential danger for \ndestabilization of the whole Balkans and a danger for peace and security in \nthe wider area. Greece, as a Balkan country, naturally is directly concerned \nand, therefore, from the very beginning of the crisis has not spared any \neffort to achieve a speedy and negotiated solution. The convening of the \nLondon Conference under the co-chairmanship of the European Community and the \nUnited Nations represents our only hope for a lasting settlement. We wish to \nreiterate here our full support to the chairmanship of the Conference, to \nwhich we are ready to offer all our assistance. \nThe Assembly should send a clear message to all former Yugoslav parties \nthat there can be no alternative to a negotiated solution of the crisis and \nthat the international community is determined not to recognize any \nfait accompli created by force. We believe that no single party is to blame \nfor the current crisis and its horrors and that all share part of the blame. \nIn any event, we must act swiftly to stop the war before it is too late, for \nthe dangers of spill-over of the crisis are real. \n\nAny form of military intervention in the former Yugoslavia is highly \ninadvisable. We have cautioned against it because we consider the staging of \na war to stop another war absurd and self-defeating. Indeed, if a majority of \nother States were to decide on some form of military intervention in \nYugoslavia, Greece would in no way participate. All States - and mainly \nBalkan States - that neighbour the former Yugoslavia, and all States with a \nspecial interest in the area, should in any case be excluded from such \naction. Otherwise, the enmities, the mistrust and the rekindling of bitter \nmemories of the past will be a source of persistent bitterness and instability \nfor generations to come. \nWe want the Balkans to be an area of peace and we wish to avoid a return \nto the time when they were known as the powder-keg of Europe. We want good \nrelations with all our Balkan neighbours. We are ready to support them \neconomically and also to facilitate the development of their relations with \nthe European Community. We have no claims against anybody and we expect them \nto have similar motivations toward us. It is for this reason that, as regards \nthe former \\\"Yugoslav Federal Socialist Republic of Macedonia\\\", we have \nactively and consistently advocated full compliance with the Lisbon \nDeclaration of the European Community, according to which that Republic should \nbe recognized under a name which does not include the term \\\"Macedonia\\\". \n\nOtherwise, we will surely have sown the seeds of future tensions and \nconflicts in the area and we will have jeopardized the ability of the peoples \nof the Balkans to live and coexist peacefully together. Our insistence on \nthis point is not only an emotional or sentimental matter, now is it only a \nmatter of historical accuracy. It is, more than anything, a matter of \npolitical realism. The usurping of a Greek name and of ancient Greek emblems, \ncombined with constitutional provisions insinuating territorial expansion, is \nnothing if not a clear indication of territorial claims. If we allow this \npolicy to be pursued we shall condemn future generations for we shall be \nforming the nucleus of friction for some time to come. \nHaving said that, I wish to make it quite clear that we have never \nharboured any enmity towards this nascent republic. Even when, recently, we \nreluctantly had to discontinue fuel exports there, in order to counter \nunjustified, unfounded accusations that Greece was circumventing Security \nCouncil resolutions 713 (1991) and 757 (1992), we never interfered with the \nsupply of food and humanitarian aid. As a matter of fact, exports of fuel \nsupplies have already been resumed now that the European Community has adopted \nnew regulations to ensure the movement of goods towards the former Yugoslavia \nthat safeguard the effectiveness of the United Nations embargo. \nThe arms embargo should also be reinforced with respect to all sides and \nan effective mechanism for its control should be put in place. \nConcerning Kosovo, which is a particularly sensitive, potentially \ndangerous area, we should encourage the Serbian Government and the ethnic \nAlbanians to pursue a serious and open dialogue within the framework of the \nLondon Conference with a view to reaching an early solution to the problems of \nthis area. We maintain that a status of autonomy, without any change of \nfrontiers, would satisfy all concerned. \n\nThe international community must also be alerted to the various reports \nfrom many parts of the former Yugoslavia concerning atrocities. It should be \nmade clear to all those who are responsible for such acts that they will be \nheld personally responsible. This is a point about which my Government feels \nparticularly strongly. \nThe easing of international tensions with the end of the cold war \nprovides new possibilities and resources for development. Our immediate \nobjective should be to restore growth that would not irreparably destroy the \nair, the rivers, the forests, the oceans or any other part of nature. The \nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development held at Rio de \nJaneiro last June has raised high hopes that the consensus which has emerged \nand which strikes a balance between environment and development will be \nsustained. At the same time, we note with great satisfaction that a political \nconsensus is growing concerning the fundamental relationship between \npluralistic democracy, respect for human rights, and development as an \nequitable and sustainable process. \nNow that the end of the cold war has raised the hopes of millions, a \nsystem of collective security is envisaged to preserve world peace and \nstability and to provide a new vision of development very much along the lines \nof the Charter of the United Nations. Economic and social development is not \npossible without peace and stability, which are prerequisites and not \nsubstitutes for development. The last 18 months have witnessed profound \nhistoric changes in the world economy. A large part of the world remains in a \nstate of transition and uncertainty while it is being transformed \nfundamentally. The Secretary-General has offered us a new concept of \nintegrated development no longer based on the traditional strict \ndifferentiation among political, economic and social issues. In his \n\nintroductory remarks to the high-level segment of the Economic and Social \nCouncil, he argued in favour of an integrated approach to global issues under \nwhich the United Nations system, through preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and \npeace-keeping will bring its political influence to bear on the solution of \neconomic and social issues. This approach is best suited to the Organization \nbecause it will secure \\\"a unit thrust\\\" in all the activities of the United \nnations system through enhanced coordination of agencies. \nThe recently concluded Conference on Environment and Development held at \nRio de Janeiro is a first example of this approach. A conceptual bridge was \ncrossed there. We hope that fundamental principles agreed on at Rio de \nJaneiro will be translated into concrete action. \nThe world economic situation presents an uneven and variegated picture. \nIn countries where there is a movement towards a market system, economic \ndifficulties are increasing, exacerbated by new assertions of nationalism, as \nwell as by ethnic and religious challenges, which threaten social peace and \nthe cohesion of States. \nIn the developing countries growth remains on the whole sluggish, while \nthere has been great diversity in performance among them. Moreover, the \nproblems which plagued the developing world in the 1980s still persist. As \npointed out in the World Economic Survey. 1992. world production fell in 1991 \nfor the first time since the Second World War, and the recovery that was \nbeginning to take shape appeared to be exceptionally weak. The Uruguay Round \nof trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) \nremains stalled. Financial assistance for development purposes is still hard \nto come by, while developing and other countries must complete painful \nadjustment programmes. High inflation, large-scale deficits, debt burdens and \n\nlack of adequate investments have not yet shown signs of improvement. \nFurthermore, economic hardship has given rise to fanaticism, unchecked \nmigratory movements, civil strife and criminal acts. Development continues to \nbe the most serious challenge of all countries. \nThe world economic situation provides an opportunity for a strengthening \nof the role of the United Nations system as regards enhancing international \ncooperation for development. The important political changes of the last two \nyears and the integrated nature of political, economic and social issues call \nfor the United Nations to play a major role in shaping the directions of \nsocial and economic development. \nProgress in the regional conflicts that have been on the agenda of our \nOrganization has again been uneven. Peace in the Middle East remains \nelusive. The most important element of the Middle East problem is the \nArab-Israeli conflict. Two of the most ancient peoples in the world, each of \nwhich has made outstanding contributions to the common heritage of mankind, \nhave for decades confronted each other, seemingly unwilling to accept for the \nother what each demands for itself, that is, the right to exist within safe \nand recognized borders, the right to a homeland, and the right to take charge \nof its own destiny. However, the events of the last 12 months seem to \nindicate that each side may now be prepared to accept for the other at least \npart of what it demands for itself. And this development, although in itself \nnot sufficient for the solution to the conflict, does seem to justify the \njudgement that the chances for peace are better now than they were a year ago. \n\nI wish in this connection to pay tribute to the commitment and \nperseverance of the sponsors of the peace process launched in Madrid in \nOctober 1991, as well as to the wisdom and courage displayed by the parties \ndirectly involved. It is the fervent hope of the Greek Government that the \nnew Israeli Government, as well as the Arab parties involved, will seize the \nopportunity to work together towards a comprehensive peace. \nNo one can dispute today that apartheid is an unacceptable political \nsystem that has to be eradicated in all its forms and practical consequences. \nFurthermore, the international community and the main political leaders in \nSouth Africa are committed to the creation of a united, non-racial and \ndemocratic South African society through peaceful means and through \nnegotiations involving all parties concerned. \nHowever, the recent wave of violence in South Africa, which claimed many \ninnocent lives, seemed to pose a serious threat to the negotiating process, \nand to undermine the results achieved so far. Greece firmly believes that no \neffort should be spared to help South African society keep the momentum and to \ncontinue building upon what has been achieved. Let us bear in mind that, now \nmore than ever, the new reality of intensified subregional, regional and \ninternational cooperation in the political and economic fields points to an \nimportant role for a new, democratic, united and non-racial South Africa. \nIn the Horn of Africa, in Somalia, a human tragedy of almost \nunprecedented scale is unfolding. War, drought and the collapse of civil \nauthority threaten the very existence of the country: the physical \nexistence the lives of its people. Starvation has already claimed \nthousands of lives. \nWe know, however, that the difficulties of the two regions I have just \nreferred to are only part of a more complicated, multifaceted structural p \n\nproblem faced by the whole continent of Africa in all fields of human \nactivity. We have to give all possible help to the countries of Africa to \nsolve their present problems and to undertake new efforts of cooperation and \nintegration which will foster development, peace and stability. \nThe Greek Government welcomes the positive results of the Helsinki summit \nof 1992 in the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \nEurope (CSCE) and attaches particular importance to the comprehensive nature \nof the CSCE process, which brings together the Governments and the peoples of \nEurope and those of the United States and Canada. The Helsinki follow-up \nmeeting provided an important opportunity for discussions on the future role \nof the CSCE. In particular, the strengthening of its institutions is expected \nto increase the effectiveness of the CSCE in the prevention, management and \npeaceful settlement of disputes. The Concluding Document adopted at the \nsummit characterizes the CSCE as a regional arrangement in the sense of the \nprovisions of Chapter VIII of the United Nation Charter. In that way, the \nCSCE process contributes substantially to the collegiality of the world \ncommunity and is therefore supported wholeheartedly by the Greek Government. \nAlthough the international community has increased its cooperation in \ncombating drug abuse and the illicit production of and trafficking in \nnarcotics, this scourge continues to plague and undermine our societies. \nConsequently, further intensified and more effective international cooperation \nis required within the existing international and regional mechanisms provided \nfor by the United Nations and regional organizations. \nMy country, which lies at the crossroads of the world, continues to be \nactively engaged in the fight against drugs. It is in the process of adopting \nnew legislation and policies to enhance its effectiveness in combating the \nproblem. Furthermore, we have increased our cooperation with all States of \n\nour region with a view to adopting and implementing effective practical \nmeasures against drug trafficking. \nIn conclusion, I should like to reaffirm my country's commitment to the \nUnited Nations and to the spirit of international cooperation and solidarity \nit embodies. We join forces with the other nations of the world and pledge to \nmake every possible effort for world peace and stability and for a humane \ninternational community, on an enduringly beautiful planet. \n"

        "file_text": "On \nbehalf of Venezuela, I congratulate our President and the Government and \npeople of Bulgaria on his election to preside over this session of the General \nAssembly. \nI welcome the new Member States, whose presence among us makes this \nOrganization more universal. \nI also wish to place on record our gratitude to the Permanent \nRepresentative of Saudi Arabia, Ambassador Samir Shihabi, who presided over \nthe work of the forty-sixth session with such distinction. \nWe are meeting at a time of particular instability and uncertainty. The \ninternational system is trying to find a new order and basic principles and \nguidelines to enable us to build a more just and egalitarian world. We are \nliving at a time of rapid historical change. The most dramatic events and the \n\nmost unexpected changes are taking place before a seemingly helpless world \nleadership. \nThe end of communism is already a thing of the past; the collapse of the \nSoviet empire is ancient history. The absolute triumph of the West is \nbeginning to be questioned, given the financial and exchange rate problems \nwhich the industrialized countries are experiencing, together with their \nprofound social crisis. We might be talking about a post-capitalist era in \nwhich the quest for supposedly free competition has turned into a total \ndehumanization of the economic model, producing a yawning gap between rich and \npoor in world society. \nWe are facing not the end of history, but rather a great lack of \nleadership, of confidence and of enthusiasm for the future. The \nindustrialized countries, bogged down in their economic rivalries, cannot \ncoordinate their actions in favour of peace, stability and justice. Deprived \nof the enemy which used to make them act together, they are now experiencing a \nsubstantial weakening of the bonds which used to unite them. \nThe times in which we live require strong, democratic international \norganizations if the preventive diplomacy the Secretary-General has described \nin his \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" which we are studying very carefully is to take \nroot. We support the more active role he envisages for the Organization, in \nthe area not of intervention, but rather of prevention. To achieve this, the \nUnited Nations and the specialized agencies must cooperate \n\\\"to address the deepest causes of conflict: economic despair, social \ninjustice and political oppression.\\\" (A/47/277, para. 15) \nThe Security Council, which should have been the most efficient United \nNations body, is an anachronism. It still reflects the interrelationship of \nforces that existed when it was created. When the United Nations came into \n\nbeing, its keystone was the Council, controlled by its five permanent members, \nwhich was given predominance to try to eliminate the limitations which had \nmade the former League of Nations ineffectual. The founders of the \nOrganization thought that this time the big Powers would be able to exercise \neffective leadership, in keeping with their power; that is, they would have \nthe ability to act as world monitors and arbitrators and bring order to the \nworld. \nTo the frustration of humanity, the two super-Powers proved that they \nalone were enough to lay the foundations of international order. The Security \nCouncil, from the day the Organization was established until the end of the \ncold war, was to play second fiddle in the management of world affairs. \n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet system, the Security Council began to \nregain its original functions. But it is doing so under the aegis of the \ntriumphant values. Thus the major countries can outline an international \nscenario in accordance with their interests. This situation should be \nreconsidered so that, as the Secretary-General has said: \n\\\"Democracy within the family of nations means the application of its \nprinciples within the world Organization itself.\\\" (A/47/277, para. 82) \nBefore the General Assembly, the President of Venezuela, \nCarlos Andres Perez, clearly conveyed his concern over the need to make the \nSecurity Council more representative. He said: \n\\\"Our own people's aspiration to democracy can also become a \npermanent aspiration of the United Nations. The Organization will not be \nstrengthened unless an agreement is reached to eliminate the right of \nveto exercised by the permanent members of the Security Council, a right \nthat responded to circumstances and realities that have ceased to exist. \nThis mechanism runs counter to the spirit of the Charter of the United \nNations and limits its effective contributions to collective security. \n\\\"The right to veto Security Council resolutions is a mechanism that \nlimits the achievement of consensus among the Member States of the United \nNations. The Security Council must be a representative body, and in no \nway should any of its members negate the majority view of the United \nNations. If we want collective and democratic security, we must aspire \nto universal egalitarian law.\\\" (A/46/PV.8. p. 13) \nIn our changing times, concepts of State sovereignty and integrity are \nalso being re-examined. Paradoxically, the \\\"champions of freedom\\\", once \nvictorious, are trying to impose a homogeneous and intolerant world order in \nwhich an independent protagonist would be seen as a destabilizing and \n\nthreatening factor. This is a matter of serious concern to the States of the \nsouthern hemisphere. In the past, we were important to the North in two \nways: as the natural scenario for the East-West confrontation and as \nessential suppliers of raw materials. \nThe confrontation between East and West is gone and with it the political \nand strategic usefulness of the third world. Raw materials have become \nmarginal in the present world economy. The slump in the demand for \ncommodities becomes more acute with every passing year. The phrase \n\\\"mobilizing effect\\\" used to mean that any surge in the rich economies would \ncarry the developing economies along with it. When the North was growing, so \nwere exports of raw materials. The situation has completely changed \ntraditional export commodities no longer have the same value. International \nmarkets can almost do without us. \nThe only way to preserve peace is to find balanced links between the \nhemispheres, put an end to relations of confrontation and strengthen \ncooperation between peoples. I have not come here to point out the mistakes \nmade by the North. The countries in the South also bear heavy \nresponsibilities. We must meet our challenge. The era of demagogic populism, \ninefficiency and corruption is over. If we wish to compete in a world of open \nmarkets we must devote ourselves to productive work and reward creativity. \nVenezuela has realized this and is in a position from which it can look to the \nfuture with optimism, provided there is compliance with the rules of open \nmarkets and competitiveness between nations. \nHowever, we must emphasize that while large regions in the South, \nespecially in Latin America, are striving to internationalize their economies \nby opening them up to competition, the North is increasingly locking itself \ninto inward-turning blocs. Ultimately, the free market one of the triumphant \n\nvalues to which I have already referred would seem to work in a single \ndirection. \nIf the rigid attitude of some international financial institutions \npersists, together with the dangerous protectionism that is again emerging \namong the industrialized countries, then the 1990s, which in Latin America \nbegan with severe economic measures and hopeful signs of growth, may also turn \nout to be another lost decade. \nThe North is not making a contribution to the establishment of the \nnecessary economic links between the two hemispheres. The new world order \nimplies a dual concept: on the one hand, the failure of the South and, on the \nother, the defeat of the communist East. The power logic being applied is \nsimple and direct. There is no longer any question of the loss of any given \nstrategic resource or strategic position falling into the hands of communism. \nThere being no enemies, there is no longer any danger of losing friends; worse \nyet, there is no longer any need for friends. What is important now is that \nthere be no disorder and no anarchy. What matters now is the willingness of \nthe South to submit to certain global rules of the game as defined by the \nNorth in terms of its own interests. \nYet they fail to understand that these rules of the game become \ninoperative in situations ->f anarchy and civil strife, which can dismember a \nState and have spill-over effects on those surrounding it. Somalia is a \ntragic example of what the southern hemisphere could become, on a larger \nscale, in the twenty-first century. Some wealthy States may feel that they \ncan live unaffected by such realities. They are mistaken. We must not forget \nthat the South has its own ability to make an instinctive response: the \nmigratory flows of its impoverished masses to the North. This flow, which is \n\nalways difficult for any Government to control, could come to undermine the \nbases for the democratic and social stability in many developed countries. \nThe best proof of this is the resurgence of extreme rightist movements and the \noutbreak of racial violence and xenophobia in many countries. \nThese problems and the persistent imbalance between the North and the \nSouth highlight a series of essential issues that the Assembly should \nconsider. The first is the democratization of the decision-making processes \nin the Security Council. This implies a new debate on the veto procedure and \nan increase in the number of permanent members so as to allow for the \nrepresentation of the new world realities. \n\nThe new circumstances in the world have been conducive to solving various \nregional problems, such as those in Angola, Namibia, Central America, \nMozambique and Cambodia; to a large extent, in other areas, such as \nAfghanistan, Western Sahara, South Africa and the Middle East, there are \nsigns, because of the new circumstances, that warrant hope for negotiated \nsolutions to conflicts. Venezuela supports measures designed to achieve \npeaceful solutions to these problems and hopes that the favourable \ninternational climate will help maintain peace. \nWe also supported the Rio summit on the environment and hope that the \ndecisions adopted there, particularly those related to the problem of \nfinancing Agenda 21, will be implemented as soon as circumstances permit. ' \nSimilarly, we give our full support to the Second World Conference on Human \nRights, to be held next year, as well as to the forthcoming conferences on \npopulation and on the status of women and to the summit on social development. \nDespite the endeavours of the United Nations, the outlook is not \nencouraging. None the less, when all the countries gathered here in the \nAssembly commit themselves to working for change, for a world where hunger and \nwar have vanished, where the environment is protected, and where realistic \nmeasures are adopted to prevent conflicts, then we shall be building the just \nsociety of which we have always dreamed. \n"

        "file_text": "Permit me to extend to you, Mr. \nPresident, our heartfelt congratulations on your election, which demonstrates \nMember States' conviction that you have the ability to conduct the work of \nthis session of the General Assembly with diplomatic skill and efficiency. I \nassure you of the support of the delegation of Liechtenstein. \nI should like to also express to your predecessor. \nAmbassador Samir Shihabi, our recognition of his outstanding conduct of the \nbusiness of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. \nFurthermore, I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to you, Mr. \nSecretary-General, for your efforts better to equip the United Nations to meet \nthe new challenges it faces as a result of the far-reaching changes taking \nplace in the world. We hope that the Organization, under your leadership and \nin close cooperation and agreement with Member States and other United Nations \norgans and bodies, will be able to continue to perform its important duties \neffectively. It is my hope that close cooperation will develop between you \nand my country. \n\nTwo years ago Liechtenstein was accepted as the one hundred and \nfifty-ninth member of the United Nations. This occasion was for my country \nthe culmination of its efforts to become an equal partner in the international \ncommunity of States and to share responsibility for overcoming the global and \nregional problems we face today. \nThe two years of our membership have been marked by far-reaching \npolitical changes. As one of the consequences of these changes, 20 new \nMembers have been admitted to the United Nations since 1990. Accordingly, \nLiechtenstein would like particularly to welcome those countries that have \nbecome Members of the United Nations this year: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia \nand Herzegovina, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Croatia, the Republic of \nMoldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. \nSince its entry Liechtenstein has sought to be an active member of the \nUnited Nations, although as a small country our possibilities are very \nlimited. We are thankful for the understanding Member States have shown for \nour special situation. \nAll States, whether small or large, whether powerful or powerless, need \nthe United Nations. Small States, however, have special grounds for belonging \nto the world Organization. One of these is the fact that the United Nations \nis based on a requirement of universal respect for the law of nations; \nsovereignty, especially that of a small State, can be secured, ensured and \nguaranteed only when all States, especially the large and powerful, respect \ninternational law. We have confidence in the United Nations, but at the same \ntime we are aware that the Organization cannot resolve all conflicts. It can, \nhowever, establish standards of conduct for the civilized behaviour of nations \ntowards one another. \n\nFor a short time after the end of the cold war we believed that we were \ngoing through a phase of almost exclusively positive changes and upheavals. \nDemocratic Governments were replacing authoritarian regimes, and millions of \npeople were attaining the freedom they had long been denied. But that time \nwas short-lived. Today the international community of States finds itself \nfacing no fewer problems than before. Instead of a diminution, there has been \na deepening of the North-South conflict; regional conflicts driven by ethnic, \nreligious, social and cultural differences are coming to a head; and \nenvironmental damage is threatening us and future generations. \nSimultaneously, however, expectations have risen and prospects improved \nof the United Nations being able to play more fully the role that was \nenvisaged for it when it was established. Liberation from the burden of the \nbig-Power confrontation has indeed made our peoples and nations clearly aware \nof the world's mutual interdependence, but we are still not of one mind \nregarding the order in which to list the problems to which the United Nations \nshould devote its priority attention. Quite obviously, the structures of an \norganization founded 47 years ago need to be adapted to the realities and new \ndemands of these greatly changed times. \nWe therefore welcome the Secretary-General's report, \\\"An Agenda for \nPeace\\\" (A/47/277), and see it as providing a useful basis for the efforts to \nimprove the capacity of the United Nations to establish and maintain peace in \nthe world. We believe that the proposals regarding preventive diplomacy in \nparticular, contained in section III of the report, need to be looked at very \nclosely with a view to creating means of preventing disputes or limiting their \nescalation. \n\nInternal conflicts have become a special challenge to the community of \nStates. Ethnic, social or religious disagreements often give rise to regional \ninstability. We are aware of the fact that a number of the new States Members \nof the United Nations, in particular, are in an extremely difficult economic \nand political situation. \nLiechtenstein would like in this connection to express particularly its \nsympathy with the victims of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The war \nunleashed by the aggression of Serbia and Montenegro is causing great human \nsuffering in that country. We are following with deep concern the continuing \nreports of massive and systematic violations of human rights and international \nhumanitarian law, for which all parties to the conflict are responsible. The \nkilling of innocent human beings and the destruction of an irreplaceable \ncultural heritage must stop, and all parties must immediately make efforts to \nbring about a peaceful solution to their difficult problems. We support the \ndeclaration of principles issued on the occasion of the London Conference, \nheld on 26 and 27 August 1992, and the framework established by the Conference \nparticipants within which a comprehensive political solution to the crisis is \nto be sought. We express our hope that the political will demonstrated in \nLondon will be transformed into specific actions and that the follow-up \nnegotiations taking place in Geneva will soon yield positive results. \nIt is within that framework that I should like to refer to the initiative \nthat the Head of State of the Principality of Liechtenstein, \nHis Serene Highness Prince Hans-Adam II, introduced in his address to the \nforty-sixth session of the General Assembly. \n\nOn that occasion His Serene Highness referred to the need to find ways \nof promoting peaceful solutions to the many conflicts which have their roots \nin the tensions which exist between communities within States. His Serene \nHighness considered that such solutions should be sought within the framework \nof the principle of self-determination. \nLiechtenstein is aware of the consideration already given within the \nUnited Nations and indeed within other bodies - to the principle of self-\ndetermination. We acknowledge the great international effort devoted to this \nquestion in the past. \nThe right to self-determination as a principle is now universally \naccepted. I would recall not only that self-determination is one of the \nfoundations of the Charter but also that most States represented in the \nAssembly are already under certain specific legal obligations in this area by \nvirtue of Article 1 of each of the great human rights Covenants of 1966. \nThere it is formally and with legally binding effect acknowledged that: \n\\\"All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of \nthat right they freely determine their political status and freely \npursue their economic, social and cultural development.\\\" \nDespite all this, and with some notable exceptions, the practical and \npeaceful application of that principle has often been lacking. Tensions \nbetween distinctive communities within States, or between such communities and \nthe State itself, persist in many parts of the world. Regrettably, they have \nin a number of instances led to outbreaks of serious violence. Apart from the \nhuman suffering which results, such tensions and violence often affect \nneighbouring States, and may have a more widespread impact on the maintenance \nof international peace generally. Much can be done to try to limit the \n\nsuffering once the violence has started; but how much better it would be to go \nto the root of the problem which is often to be found in the frustrations of \ndistinctive communities when they are denied the legitimate expression of their \ncommunal identities and aspirations. \nI am glad to say that His Serene Highness's statement last year \nattracted the interest of a number of delegations. During the past year we \nhave undertaken extensive consultations, and we have benefitted greatly from \nconstructive suggestions which delegations have been kind enough to make. We \nare most grateful to all those Governments for the interest they have shown. \nWe have also sought, and taken into account, some independent expert views. \nIt is against this background that Liechtenstein believes that the \ninternational community, through this Assembly, should take steps to make the \nright of self-determination more effective, and by doing so contribute to the \navoidance of some future conflicts. It is our conviction that the time has \nnow come for the international community, through the United Nations, to offer \na realistic way forward, by establishing a practical framework through which \ncommunities can give expression to their distinctive qualities. \nSuch a practical framework would need to satisfy four main requirements: \nFirst, there should be flexible and graduated forms of \nself-determination involving different levels of autonomy, taking account of \nthe differing needs of differing communities and the States of which they form \npart; a subdivided community which allows its various parts to pursue the \ncommon goal in their own way can on occasion be a very good expression of the \nprinciple of self-determination; \n \nSecondly, communities invoking the principle of self-determination \nshould renounce resort to violence and commit themselves to pursuing their \naims through peaceful means only; \nThirdly, assistance in the effective realization of the principle of \nself-determination should be available through independent procedures; and \nFourthly, a proper balance must be maintained between self-determination \nand the territorial integrity of States. \nSubject always to those requirements being met, we believe that the \ninternational community should recognize that self-determination is an \ninherent attribute of all communities which possess a distinctive social and \nterritorial identity. This involves the free choice by each community of its \npolitical, social, economic and cultural destiny in accordance with the best \ninterests of its members. \nSelf-determination, it must be stressed, is not necessarily or even \nprimarily a matter of moving towards independent statehood. Indiscriminate \nindependence would lead to the fragmentation of the international community \nand would insufficiently respect the territorial integrity of States. In \nreality, however, full independence is, if only for purely practical reasons, \nthe least likely outcome in most cases. \nRespect for diversity can be adequately reflected in other ways. \nSelf-determination can take various forms, as may be best suited to each \ncommunity's and each State's particular circumstances. \nIt is important to retain the essential flexibility of the concept. But \nin all cases where there exists a community with a sufficient degree of \ndistinctive identity, it seems right that a certain basic level of autonomy \nshould be acknowledged. I am referring to such very elementary matters as \n\nnon-discrimination against the community or its members, their freedom to \npractice and enjoy their distinctive community characteristics, and their \nparticipation in appropriate ways in public affairs, particularly in matters \ndirectly affecting the community's interests. A commitment to acknowledge \nsuch a modest degree of autonomy for all communities that merit it should not, \nwe believe, cause serious problems for any Member of the United Nations. \nMore advanced levels of autonomy will be appropriate for communities \nwhose particular circumstances demonstrate their fitness to enjoy them. But \nwe do not think it would be realistic for the United Nations to seek to lay \ndown detailed mandatory requirements for the self-determination of communities \nwith a vast range of distinctive characteristics, settled within States whose \nown histories are so diverse. Anything beyond the sort of basic level of \nautonomy to which I have referred is probably best left to be developed on an \noptional basis and case by case the circumstances being so diverse that each \nis best left to be treated on its own merits. \nNevertheless, there would, in our view, be some advantage in the United \nNations indicating the kinds of further elements which might find a place in \nthe more advanced levels of autonomy. These further elements of autonomy \nwould progressively add to the degree to which the community conducts its own \naffairs but would only be available to a community with satisfactory \nexperience and even then, only if the State concerned is ready to accept the \ncommunity's more advanced level of autonomy. \n \nIn this complex area we cannot assume that any general principle or \nprocedures which might be agreed internationally will be applied without \ndifficulty in particular cases. We should therefore also envisage that some \nprocedures be available to assist if any difficulties arise in the application \nof the principle of self-determination and to assist with the peaceful \nresolution of any differences there might be. \n\nA number of delegations with which we have discussed our ideas in general \nterms suggested that it would be advantageous for the matter which, as well \nas being of great political importance, is also of considerable technical \ncomplexity - to be the subject of some further examination by a group of \nexperts so as to facilitate the progress which may eventually be made in this \nAssembly. \nWe have accordingly concluded that the most appropriate course will be \nfor the Government of Liechtenstein to invite each Government represented in \nthe Assembly and that includes those here as observers to nominate an \nindependent expert to attend an informal meeting of experts in Liechtenstein \nnext March. We hope that the experts attending that meeting will be able to \nassist us in further developing the ideas advanced initially by \nHis Serene Highness at the forty-sixth session of the Assembly. We envisage \nthat the experts nominated to attend will do so in their personal capacities, \nsince we believe that by adopting procedures which avoid committing \nGovernments we are more likely to have a constructive and expert discussion. \nInvitations to nominate experts to attend the meeting will be issued during \nthe course of the present session. In the light of the views expressed at the \nmeeting of experts, the Government of Liechtenstein will consider how best to \nreturn to the Assembly, perhaps at its next session in 1993, with proposals \nfor carrying further the initiative introduced last year by His Serene \nHighness. \nAs the international community makes progress, however haltingly, towards \npreventing the outbreak of violent conflicts between States, it becomes all \nthe more important that together we seek ways of avoiding the no less inhuman \nconsequences of civil wars between communities within a State. In informing \n\nthe Assembly of the lines along which our thinking on this important and \nsensitive matter is developing, I hope that I may have demonstrated the depth \nof our concern that some way should be found of controlling one major source \nof much violence and human suffering in today's world. \nMay I express my hope that the new spirit of cooperation in the United \nNations will help enable us to discharge the responsibility entrusted to us \nand to find, in consensus, solutions to the manifold problems that we face. \nMy delegation is ready to make its contribution in order to achieve, in \nefficient cooperation with other delegations, the objectives of the United \nNations. \n"

        "file_text": "Let me \nmost cordially join in congratulating the President of the General Assembly at \nits forty-seventh session. \nFor the first time, the delegation of the Republic of Uzbekistan is \ntaking part in the work of the United Nations General Assembly as an \nindependent State. It is an honour for us to express our sincere gratitude to \nall State Members of the United Nations for the support and cooperation they \nhave given the young independent Republic of Uzbekistan. \n\nWe are very grateful to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his \nconstant attention to our region. The decision to open at Tashkent an office \nrepresenting the United Nations and a number of its specialized organizations \nis clear evidence of that attention. This approach arises from the main \norientation of United Nations activities at the present time, which were \nformulated in concentrated form by the Secretary-General in his report \\\"An \nAgenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277). \nRecently the people of Uzbekistan solemnly marked the first anniversary \nof its independence. The fact that now we have begun building an independent \nState is the logical result of the constant and selfless struggle for \nindependence waged over the centuries by our people and its best sons. \nAchieving independence has never been easy anywhere in the world. For \nthat reason our year of independence is only the beginning of a long process. \nWe are laying the groundwork for an independent Uzbek State. \nWe have saved our language, religion, traditions, customs and moral \nprinciples from the danger of complete disappearance; we are fully \nreincarnating our national values. Our natural resources, together with the \neconomic, scientific, technical and moral potential built up by the labour of \nprevious generations, can serve as a guarantee for the social and economic \ndevelopment of independent Uzbekistan. \nTo turn this potential into a real force, our Republic, under the \nleadership of President Islam Karimov, is working out an appropriate system; \nis looking for the best structure of governmental administration and for \n \nways to develop the economy and to construct its foreign and domestic \npolicies. Measures are being taken for the social protection of the \npopulation against the shocks that are inevitable in the transition to a \nmarket economy, to a society which is new to us. \n\nIn the process of building an independent State, we are utilizing the \npositive experience accumulated by other developed nations and based on \nopenness and market relations. Of course, in so doing we are taking into \nconsideration, first and foremost, the specific features and concrete \ncircumstances of our country and the national and cultural traditions of the \npeople who live there. \nWe seek to create a social and political structure under which the \nprinciples of human rights and freedom will be strictly observed. Our State \npolicy is designed to protect the interests and rights of all peoples, \nirrespective of their nationalities, religion or beliefs, to preserve and \ndevelop their cultures, languages, national traditions and customs and to \ninvolve them actively in State and public life. \nWe have firmly rejected the domination of any one ideology or any one \nworld view; in fact, we are establishing a multiparty system as an essential \nand logical element of genuine democracy. \n \nAt the same time, we are outlawing those forces and movements that \nattempt through blackmail, threats and violence to change the structure of the \nState, that endanger the territorial integrity and security of our Republic, \nthat sow ethnic and religious dissension, that encroach on the constitutional \nsystem and the moral foundations of our people's life. We require the \nactivities of all forces and movements to remain within the limits of the law. \nIn our economic policy, we reject the structure based on the command \nadministration system, which is highly centralized and distributive. We \ncompletely reject ideology. Equal rights apply to all types of property. \nOf course, there are difficulties being encountered in carrying out our \npolitical and economic programmes. This is something we all recognize. \nToday our people is going through a difficult period of transition. This \nis due to the fact that for many years our republic was the victim of a policy \nof repression and diktat, resulting in a dependent economy and making our \nregion a raw-materials appendage. \nIt is not easy to rescue our people from the consequences of the \ntotalitarian hegemony of communist ideas. Certainly, a new and just society \ncannot be created in a day, or even in a year. We understand all this clearly. \nThe most important thing is that, on the basis of inter-ethnic accord and \nunity among our citizens, we have established a stable social and political \nsituation in our country. \nThe peoples of our region. Central Asia - Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Turkmans, \nKyrgyzes and Tajiks - are the children of common forefathers. We share the \nsame land and water, the same religion, the same history and the same fate; we \nshare the same cares, joys and anxieties. Historically, we have always been \n\nnaturally connected and interdependent. We created our common history through \ncooperation. Many of our internal problems are evolving; they could easily \nbecome inter-ethnic or international problems, affecting the interests of the \npeoples of our region. This is what is special about the general situation \nand the international position of Uzbekistan and of Central Asia as a whole. \nAt present the Government and the people of Uzbekistan are deeply \nconcerned about the course of events in Tajikistan, which is on the brink of \ncivil war. The serious international danger is that armed clashes between the \nopposing forces, which have claimed thousands of lives among the peaceful \npopulation, could easily spread to neighbouring Central Asian States. \nIn the Central Asian region, with its dense population of over \n50 million, such an armed conflict could have unpredictable consequences. \nShould the conflict spread, the peoples of Central Asia could be involved in \nan endless fratricidal war, which could ultimately destroy the freedom and \nindependence they have recently won. That is why the current situation is \ndangerous for us. We have every reason to be concerned. \nIn practice, the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, where there \nare hundreds of thousands of men under arms, remains open. The actions of \nextremists and fanatical armed groups incited by those who are playing on \npeople's national and religious feelings could have unpredictable consequences. \nUzbekistan strongly opposes interference in the internal affairs of \nindependent Tajikistan and is against stirring up the fire of war. Uzbekistan \nadvocates preventing the spread of the armed conflict and finding a solution \nas quickly as possible by peaceful and civilized means. \n\nUzbekistan supports the appeal of the Government of Tajikistan to the \nUnited Nations to provide assistance in finding a solution to the grave \ncrisis, which could become international in scope. Uzbekistan regards as \ndecisive in the present circumstances the role of the United Nations and the \nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Fully aware of the danger \nof the situation, and in a spirit of humanity, and, at the same time, of \nresponsibility for the fate of our peoples, Uzbekistan has requested \nSecretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to examine the situation and inform \nthe Security Council, and various United Nations committees and commissions, \nof our concern. \nThe President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, in his letter \naddressed to Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali, stressed that only timely and \neffective assistance by the international community can be decisive in \nsupporting the process of democratization and the political and economic \nreforms under way in the new independent States of the region. \nIn proposing this initiative, Uzbekistan proceeds from the concept that \nthe predominant idea of the new international order should be the prevention \nof aggression and conflicts and the establishment of democratic machinery for \nmaking such an order a reality. That concept was convincingly expounded as \npreventive diplomacy by Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. In our view \nthe guarantee for such preventive action can be found in cooperation in the \nbroad sense of the term. \n\nI think that what I have said is sufficient for an understanding of the \nneed to create a United Nations Eastern Centre in our region with the aim of \nextending the principles of the world community and international norms to the \ncentral part of the Eurasian continent. I believe that Tashkent, as a \nhistoric centre of that region, with its rich past and its modern experience \nin peacemaking activities, would be fully worthy of the honour of serving as \nthe seat of the Eastern Centre. That would provide the world community with \nreliable information on the processes of social development in the region, \nexpedite the solution of its problems and make it a zone free of conflicts. \nIn our view, that is the main goal of the United Nations and the new \nworld order. \n"

        "file_text": "In \naddressing this Assembly for the first time, I should like, first, on behalf \nof my delegation and on my own behalf, to carry out the pleasant duty of \nconveying to Mr. Ganev of Bulgaria our most earnest and warmest \ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits forty-seventh session, and to assure him of our cooperation with a view to \nachieving a successful outcome. \nWe should like also to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved \ntribute to Mr. Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia for the deft and skilful manner \nin which he led the work of the last session. \nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, we reiterate our \nmost earnest congratulations on the outstanding manner in which he has been \ndischarging his difficult responsibilities since he was elected head of our \nOrganization. \nWe also take this opportunity to welcome the positive and beneficial \ninfluence of the activities of our former Secretary-General, \nMr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who was able to give our Organization a new \ndynamism and brought it closer to the goals assigned to it by its founding \nfathers. \nOn behalf of Zaire, I welcome the new Member States that have joined the \nOrganization, thereby bringing us closer to its much-desired goal of \nuniversality. \nBut we are bound to note that the purposes of our Organization laid down \nin its Charter are far from being achieved, because in many places throughout \nthe world the universal peace that we so earnestly seek is still just an \nambition. Indeed, hotbeds of tension have been rekindled, thereby \njeopardizing international peace and security, which our Organization has a \nduty to guarantee. We earnestly appeal to all parties in conflict, wherever \nthey may be, to lay down their arms and exclude the word \\\"force\\\" from their \nvocabulary. \nIn this vein, we find a great deal of merit in the Secretary-General's \nreport, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277), to the international community, in \nwhich we find valuable recommendations on preventive diplomacy, peacemaking \nand peace-keeping. \nWe believe that the Assembly should give the greatest attention to this \nanalysis. Zaire pledges its help in studying these ideas, so useful to our \nOrganization. \nThe Secretary-General's recommendations lead us to focus on a few of the \nmany areas of tension. \nThe Security Council meeting on violence in South Africa made it possible \nto avoid a break in the dialogue established within the Convention for a \nDemocratic South Africa (CODESA). We reiterate our appeal to all political \nforces to put an end to their antagonism so that negotiations for the \nestablishment of a representative government may resume. To this end, we \nstrongly urge the South African Government to use all necessary ways and means \nto put an end to extremist acts of all kinds that lead to violence. \nIn the Middle East, since the establishment of the Government resulting \nfrom the latest elections in Israel and the resumption of negotiations between \nthe parties concerned, we have reason for some hope. We Therefore urge all \nparties committed to the quest for an overall political solution that would \nlead to lasting peace in that region to continue along the path of dialogue. \nFor some years now we have witnessed considerable efforts by the United \nStates of America and the Russian Federation the Powers with the most \nsophisticated and most destructive weapons, whether nuclear, conventional, \nbiological or chemical drastically to reduce the number of such weapons, \nthereby helping to establish a new era in international politics and in peace \nand security for States and peoples. Zaire welcomes this most sincerely, and \nwe hope that other military Powers will follow their example. If they do, the \nsecond millennium, for which we are preparing so busily, will open up new \nprospects for humankind as a whole. \nToday, in a surge of world-wide solidarity, the developed countries \nliving in prosperity should help, in a spirit of true partnership, the \ncountries of the South to solve the problems related to underdevelopment, \nwhich have many complex causes. It is true that underdevelopment will not go \naway overnight simply because the prosperous countries of the North decide to \nmake available to third world countries financial resources resulting from \ncutbacks they may make in their military budgets; rather it will be ended by \nstrategies to do away with the dire poverty of the nations of Africa and other \nunderdeveloped countries. \nThat is why Zaire is convinced that a harmonious future for our planet \ndepends on peace, security and prosperity shared by all nations, both of the \nNorth and of the South. And that is why Zaire also believes that the Final \nDocument of the International Conference on the Relationship between \nDisarmament and Development should now be implemented in order to find the \nnecessary resources to solve the daunting problems our peoples face. \nIt is clear that the collective security aspects likely to create tension \nand conflict in the world are not only military, but also spring from the \nextreme impoverishment of our peoples, linked to high population growth rates \nand the debt burden. \nLooking at our ravaged economies, we believe that debt servicing must in \nno way hamstring our development efforts. Our countries' total external debt \nis constantly increasing, and has now reached more than $1.5 billion. Without \nany real readiness to cooperate on the part of the industrialized countries, \nand without considerable efforts devoted to the planning and establishment of \nappropriate ad hoc structures, there will be no hope of recovery for our \neconomies. \nWe strongly hope that those devising strategic development policies for \nthe fourth decade will take into account the recommendations of the Economic \nCommission for Africa (ECA) resulting from the Conference of Ministers \nresponsible for economic development and planning, held in Addis Ababa from \n20 to 24 April of this year, which drew up guidelines for the years ahead. \nWe also hope that, in accordance with the New International Development \nStrategy for the 1990s, the United Nations and the international community \nwill support efforts aimed at the economic recovery of Africa, for the common \ngood of all humankind. \nZaire hails the effective measures to protect and improve the environment \nenvisaged in the Rio Conventions. Indeed, as we have vast areas of protected \nforests, we would appreciate acceptance by the international community of the \nidea of recompensing countries that set aside major forested areas with a view \nto protecting them from the ravages of humankind. \nZaire, whose vast expanses of tropical rainforest have given it the \nstatus of the planet's \\\"second lung\\\", after Amazonia, has for long been in the \nvanguard of environmental conservation. Our country has a major network of \nlinked national parks and reserves covering 8 per cent of our national \nterritory. Some of these nature reserves the oldest of which were \nestablished more than 75 years ago - protect the rarest of species, including \nthe okapi, the white rhinoceros and the gorilla. In the context of the \nConventions adopted in Rio de Janeiro, Zaire offers all these natural \nresources to the international community as a contribution to the common \nheritage of humankind. \nTherefore, my country calls upon the international community, \nparticularly the developed countries, to ensure that additional resources are \nmade available for the effective implementation of Agenda 21 and the new \nConventions dealing with biodiversity and climate change. My delegation \nappeals to all countries to give massive support to Agenda 21 and its \naccompanying Conventions; it asks that they sign them and take all the \nnecessary steps to ratify them. We invite countries of the North that might \nstill be hesitant about adapting their future behaviour to the requirements of \nenvironmental conservation and protection to respond positively. \nIt is no secret to anyone that Zaire is today experiencing a deep \nmultisectoral crisis essentially attributable to the disastrous management of \nits human, financial and material resources. The readiness for change \nexpressed by our people as a whole triumphed on 24 April 1990 with the \nstatement delivered by the President of the Republic, which finally recognized \nthe need for democratic political reform. \nFollowing the example of other African countries, Zairians claimed and \nobtained the holding of a national sovereign conference. Opened in \nAugust 1991, that conference is taking place in an atmosphere whose tone was \nset, on the one hand, by the troubles of September 1991, which ruined the \ncountry's already reeling economy, and, on the other, by a succession of \npolitical crises spawned in the climate of distrust that existed between the \nestablished powers and the opposition. Suspended a number of times, the work \nof the national sovereign conference none the less has managed to continue to \nthis day because our people has spared no sacrifice to lend its full support \nto this forum. Because of this, the date of 16 February will live in our \nmemory. Thus, as I speak, the meetings of the national sovereign conference \nare about to culminate, more than a year after its opening, in the adoption of \ncommittee reports following the election of a Prime Minister and the \nestablishment of a transition Government. \nThe transition period will be managed by three institutions: the \nPresidency of the Republic, the Supreme Council of the Republic, and the \ntransition Government. As regards the transition Government, the national \nsovereign conference elected Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi Wa Mulumba as Prime \nMinister in the vote held last August. The transition Government pledges \nbefore international opinion to guide this period of transition in the calmest \nand most peaceful manner possible. \nThe essential, indeed overriding, goal of the transition remains the \nestablishment of a state based upon the rule of law. Welcoming the role \nplayed by the free press in the evolution of democracy in our country, the \nGovernment is determined to encourage and support the media so that they can \nplay their full role in all freedom. Moreover, the transition Government and \nthe Supreme Council of the Republic will establish the High Council for \nAudio-Visual Media, which will manage the official press agencies in the same \nspirit. The Government is also committed to fighting censorship and to \npromoting freedom of the press in all its forms. \nThe establishment of a State based on the rule of law necessarily entails \nrespect for the rights of the individual. That is why the Government will \nwork in concert with the associations responsible for human rights issues. To \nthat end, they will be granted the civil status that has been hitherto denied \nthem, as well as being guaranteed access to the media and freedom of action \nthroughout our national territory. \nA top priority for the transition Government is laying the best possible \ngroundwork for the advent of a State based on the rule of law. To this end, \nZaire intends to hold free and democratic elections shortly. We therefore \nurgently appeal to the international community to help us organize these \nelections in the greatest possible transparency. \nIn conclusion, I should like to draw attention once again to the most \nalarming situation of our planet, a situation on which the entire \ninternational community is focused. My delegation is convinced that the \nUnited Nations is and will remain the ideal framework for the quest for \npeaceful solutions likely to defuse the hotbeds of tension that have developed \nin Africa, Asia and Europe. \nAs for Zaire, I have just recalled the great choices made by the national \nsovereign conference to provide the Zairian people with a new era of peace, \ndemocracy and economic development. In accordance with the United Nations \nCharter, Zaire announces its faith in the basic rights of the individual. To \nthat end, my country will spare no effort to ensure the victory of legality, \njustice, equity and equality. \nI wish the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly the fullest \nmeasure of success.

        "file_text": "The recent accession of the Republic of San Marino to \nmembership of the United Nations makes it possible for me to take part in this \ngeneral debate, prompted by the desire to contribute to fulfilment of the \ngreat tasks of the Organization. San Marino has always paid attention to the \ndifficult work undertaken by the United Nations. We have felt deep \nsatisfaction with its several achievements and have shared the anxiety and \ndisappointment caused by the numerous violations of peace and by the obstacles \nto progress that this Organization has had to face. \nWhat impressed us most was seeing the idea of universality, originally \nembodied in the Charter, become a reality in which everyone might \nparticipate. The United Nations has undertaken the difficult and essential \ntask of drawing the world's attention to the issues and problems that mankind \nmust face urgently. Thanks to the commitment of the United Nations, our hopes \nhave been strengthened by greater certainty by a deeper sense of confidence. \nToday the world and, in particular, the European continent are \nconcentrating their attention on the former Yugoslavia on its never-ending \nwar, on the useless destruction of goods and property, on the inexcusable \ndeath of too many civilians, on the indiscriminate use of heavy weapons, on \nthe extremely serious violations of fundamental human rights, on the \nunacceptable concentration camps a phenomenon that we believed Europe had \n\nrelegated to history on the obstacles brutally placed in the way of the \nrelief missions that have been so generously organized by the United Nations, \nand on the non-observance of the rights of minorities and of freedom of \nreligion. \nIf I am to speak frankly, as my position requires, I have to say that \ncrimes that we have always considered to be the most serious, nationally and \ninternationally, are being committed, and have been a reality for quite a long \ntime, in the former Yugoslavia. A premeditated and determined refusal to find \na peaceful solution must be considered an act of war, but counter-attack is \ndifficult when there has been no actual attack. Peace is not a condition that \ncan be imposed; it is a more complex reality, a permanent state that has to be \nfelt. \nIn my opinion, every man has to be resolved to want peace and want to \nlive in peace. This condition may exist only if men are in a state of peace, \nif their rights are respected, and if they are free to enjoy their liberty and \ntheir rights. It may exist only if men's legitimate aspirations are satisfied \nand if everyone is convinced that, in the exercise of his rights, nobody is \nriding roughshod over the rights of any other person, even if that person is \nof a different colour or a different faith. \nThe most praiseworthy and indispensable initiatives aimed at the \nrestoration of peace will be useless until men are educated to a deep-rooted \nsense of peace. I believe that this is the future role of the United \nNations a role that the Organization will have to play with determination \nand authority. We have a common duty to contribute to the removal of \nwar-clouds and bilateral tensions. It is essential that we commit ourselves \nto that end. In those circumstances, humanitarian support is increasingly \n \nnecessary. The entire world should be grateful to the United Nations for \ncarrying out its mission with courage and great generosity in risky \ncircumstances, which, owing to the irresponsibility of those who encourage and \nsupport war, can sometimes turn to tragedy. \nBut let me invite representatives to take on a more effective commitment \nto the idea and the sentiment of peace. We must all defend the right to \npeace, the main feature of which is freedom and respect for minorities. What \nforce must freedom have if peace is to be maintained? It is the force rooted \nin and safeguarded by democratic government. \nI am well aware that even the most advanced democracies are far from \nsatisfying the two requisites of freedom. The first requisite, which takes a \nnegative form, is the absence of any need to depend on the will of others; the \nsecond, which takes a positive form, is participation in the decision-making \nprocesses. \nIn any case, I am convinced that any other political system would do more \nto deprive people of freedom. Democracy, even in its most imperfect forms, is \norganized in such a way as to ensure that individuals may participate in the \nexercise of power. This occurs where there is positive freedom. However, \nthat freedom is limited if negative freedoms freedom of thought, freedom of \nassociation and of religion, and all the other freedoms granted by modern \nconstitutions - are not guaranteed and safeguarded. \nThis implies that everyone must account for all acts perpetrated against \nfreedom all acts that violate human rights, and all acts that imperil \npeace. San Marino believes that the concept of personal responsibility must \nbe stressed and must be made paramount internationally. \n\nIn democratic institutions, the exercise of power both political and \nmilitary is a service rendered to civil and democratic growth and the social \neconomic development of the entire community, in favour of the individual, \nnever against him. Those who use power against a part of the community, \nagainst a minority or against a group of individuals, or those who hinder or \nmake civil, cultural, social and economic development regress must account for \ntheir actions. \nIn these days the tragic scenes and information from Somalia fill us with \nsorrow. It is an offense to our civilization, intelligence and dignity that \non the threshold of the year 2000 people should be starving to death. \nUnfortunately, we still have to cope with this tragic reality, and we hope \nthat the United Nations will find timely and real solutions to this problem. \nOn the other hand, many other situations are awaiting solutions that are \nneither easy and immediate: the fight against drugs; the improper use of the \nnatural environment and the damage caused by air and nuclear pollution; the \nphenomenon of migrations and the obligations States have towards immigrants; \nrefugees' living conditions and the causes of the refugee phenomenon; issues \nconcerning the young and the incentive to a greater commitment by the young to \nmodern society; the struggle against racism and racial discrimination, against \nall forms of intolerance and against any attempt to restore that horrible \npractice called ethnic cleansing; terrorism; the ever-lasting imbalance in the \ndistribution of wealth and resources which impoverishes poor countries more \nand more. \nHaving mentioned the tragedy which has overwhelmed Somalia, I should \nlike, on behalf of my country, wish to renew to the people of Somalia the \nexpression of our most sincere solidarity. \n \nEnvironmental conditions, drought, famine, relentless desertification, \nthe simple tools used in impoverished agriculture and the unfair distribution \nof food supplies caused by the lack of solidarity determine the daily life of \nmillions of people suffering from hunger. However, one of the biggest \nscandals of our time is the fact that the food supplies made available do not \nreach those who have been waiting for them for so long that they no longer \nneed them. \nRepresentatives probably thought that the speech delivered by the \nrepresentative of the Republic of San Marino to the General Assembly would be \na systematic and comprehensive review of the United Nations activities. \nRather, I wished to make a number of remarks on how the world could change in \norder to become a better one. The Charter of the United Nations and the \nunanimous and determined commitment of the Security Council, the General \nAssembly and the various United Nations agencies, commissions and committees \nshow that today only the United Nations is capable of improving this world be \nmaking it more equitable. \nIn the long history of the small Republic of San Marino, an important \nstatement is recorded: at the end of the thirteenth century, a judge, who had \nbeen given the task of finding a solution to a real estate dispute between the \npeople of San Marino and some podestas in nearby Montefeltro, questioned a \ncitizen from the San Marino community in order to know why that community was \nfree from certain duties. The reason given by that citizen was that \nSan Marino was free and made up of free men. The judge, out of curiosity, \nasked the witness: \\\"quid est libertas?\\\" The man quickly and firmly replied: \n\\\"Nemini teneri\\\" - not to be subject to anybody. A modern interpretation of \nthose words is that a free man is one whose personality and dignity are \nrespected. \n\nSan Marino hopes to see this concept become a reality throughout the \nworld. We are sure that this goal can be achieved, with the free and \ndetermined contribution of all under the auspices of the United Nations. \n"

        "file_text": "At the outset I \nshould like to convey to the President of the General Assembly my heartiest \ncongratulations on his unanimous election. He is one of the principal \narchitects of the advent of democracy and profound change in Bulgaria. I am \ncertain he will guide with skill and efficacy the work of the General \nAssembly, which I hope will carry on resolutely in the reform of its programme \nand its working methods. \nTo our new Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, I should like to \nexpress the great pleasure of the Government and people of Luxembourg on his \nelection to head our Organization. The decisions he has taken and the \nproposals he has put forward since the beginning of the year make it fitting \nfor me to pay tribute to him for his lucidity, courage and resolve to make of \nthe United Nations an organization that is capable of answering the challenges \nof our time. \n\nI welcome the representatives of the 13 new countries that have joined \nthe United Nations since the beginning of this year, bringing the number of \nMembers to 179. \nLast Tuesday my colleague Douglas Hurd put forward the positions of the \ntwelve member States of the European Community concerning the major problems \nthat confront the international community at present. Clearly, I subscribe to \neverything that was said by the representative of the State which occupies the \npresidency of the Council of Ministers of the European Community, so I shall \nlimit myself to stressing several issues that are of particular concern to the \nGovernment and people of Luxembourg. \nTwo tragedies giving rise to the utmost concern are occurring at \npresent. I refer to the famine in certain parts of Africa and to the civil \nwar in Yugoslavia. Both of these show once again that the international \ncommunity's right to humanitarian interference in regional conflicts can no \nlonger be called into question. \nThe famine in Africa threatens the lives of an extraordinarily large \nnumber of human beings, and it must immediately be at the focus of our \nattention. We are confronted, on one hand, by an overwhelming drought, that \nhas afflicted all of eastern and southern Africa and, on the other hand, by \nthe lack of organization in the production and distribution of foodstuffs,that \nhas resulted from civil wars. \nIn the Sudan and in Somalia, the European Community has continued, over \nthe last few months, to intervene with the parties involved to ensure that \nthose parties will allow and guarantee the distribution of international food \naid. It is indeed outrageous that a government or armed factions should \ninterfere with this operation. I am glad that our Organization has sent \n\nmilitary forces to Somalia to guarantee food distribution. My country is \ncontributing to all these efforts by providing financial assistance which, per \ncapita, is among the greatest in the world. We believe that the United \nNations should consider what measures it might undertake to ensure that famine \nis no longer used as a weapon in the civil war raging in the Sudan. \nThe continuing tragedy in Yugoslavia is of the most profound concern to \nthe people of my country. Unfortunately we are witnessing a resurgence of \nmost of the criminal practices of nazism, including even the horrendous \n\\\"ethnic purification\\\" applied to persons from a different sociological group. \nThe problems raised by the presence of minority populations in the republics \nof the former Yugoslavia cannot be resolved by military intervention; they can \nbe resolved only through negotiated arrangements modelled on those proposed in \nNovember 1991 by the European Community. \nI make a solemn appeal to all the peoples of the former Yugoslavia to \nsupport energetically the efforts of those leaders who wish, fully, \nunreservedly and without any hidden agenda, to implement the measures defined \nat the London Conference on 26 and 27 August. Only in that way can peace and \nprosperity be re-established. Only on that basis can an equitable solution be \nfound to the problem of nationalities or minorities the problem that gave \nrise to this conflict, just as it was at the basis of the bloodshed which, \nunfortunately, continues in certain areas of the former Soviet Union. \nWith regard to this extremely complex problem, I should like to make some \nfurther observations. As the representative of a small country that owes its \nexistence to the principle of self-determination, I am clearly not in a good \nposition to deny this right to other peoples. However, I must make the point \nthat, where several types of population are closely linked, the application of \n \nthis principle is not sufficient to resolve the problem of nationalities As \nwe have seen, it can serve as a pretext for attempts at conquest and at the \nannexation of territory, as well as at the forcible expulsion of minority \npopulations, and even the extermination of such peoples. \nThe solution to the problem of minorities can be based only on the \nfollowing principles: rejection of the idea that frontiers can be changed by \nforce; the granting to national minorities of special status ensuring respect \nfor their ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identities; the adoption \nof arrangements for cross-border cooperation to enable these minorities to \nmaintain close contact with their compatriots in neighbouring countries. In \nthis respect, it seems to us that Italy's solution for the Haut Adige/South \nTyrol is exemplary. \nThe establishment, by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \nEurope, of the machinery of rapporteurs for human rights, as well as the post \nof commissioner for minorities, should make possible the early identification \nof potential nationality conflicts and the search for means of prevention. \nIt seems to me that the world conference on human rights to be held next \nyear in Vienna could provide the appropriate framework for an attempt to \ndefine certain fundamental rights of minorities and, if possible, to codify \nthem in a new legal instrument. If it were possible, in addition, to \nestablish machinery for an independent forum to verify, at the request of a \nwide group of people, respect for these minimum rights through the legislation \nof a given country, that would help to avoid armed conflicts in the future. \nIn the last analysis, the problem of minorities can be resolved only if \nall peoples living in a territory can be made to feel that they belong to one \n \nfamily so that they put emphasis on that which unites them rather than on that \nwhich divides them. It was united action rather than division that enabled \nthe European Community to secure a new instrument the Maastricht Treaty \nfor the purpose of pursuing their policy of integration, but with respect for \nnational identities. In this regard, I should like to welcome the decisive \nstep that the people of France took by saying \\\"Yes\\\" to the Maastricht Treaty, \nwhich my country ratified two months ago. \nLuxembourg has always been in the vanguard of European integration. From \nexperience it knows that the key to its wellbeing and its security lie in the \nCommunity and that only together with its partners can it exercise its \nsovereignty fully. \nWith regard to the problems of the Middle East, we are very gratified at \nthe more conciliatory spirit motivating the new Government of Israel, at the \ngestures that have already been made by that Government, and at the \nwillingness expressed by the Syrian authorities to conclude a peace \nagreement. It must be understood, of course, that negotiations for the \nestablishment of an interim regime in the occupied territories can in no case \ncome up with a result short of the Camp David Accords. \nWith regard to Iraq, we continue to demand that the existing regime \nimplement all Security Council resolutions as rapidly as possible. The Iraqi \nGovernment bears full responsibility for the deterioration of the humanitarian \nsituation in particular, because it has not yet implemented resolutions \n706 (1991) and 712 (1991). Iraq must cease all military action and all other \nrepressive measures against the civilian population. \n\nIn South Africa, the halt of the work of the Convention for a \nDemocratic South Africa (CODESA) has been most disappointing for my \nGovernment. Together with our European partners, we call on all the \nparties concerned to resume it as soon as possible in a constructive \nspirit. The problem of violence can be solved only if the police show \nrestraint and if all political movements give categorical instructions to \ntheir members definitively to renounce the use of force. I congratulate \nthe Security Council on its resolution 772 (1992) of 17 August, which \nallowed for the sending to South Africa of a number limited, it is \ntrue of United Nations observers to examine ways to strengthen the \nmachinery for the transition towards a non-racial democracy. \nI must obviously express our views concerning the work now going on \nwithin the United Nations. \nFirst, I should like to express to our Secretary-General my full \nappreciation of his excellent report entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" \n(A/47/277), which he presented at the beginning of the summer. It \ncontains important proposals on preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and \npeace-keeping. The new international political situation is favourable \nfor stronger United Nations action, which I hope to see, particularly in \nthe following three areas. \nThe first is preventive diplomacy, which would assist us in \nanticipating and avoiding the outbreak of new conflicts. Would it not \nhelp the proper management of international affairs to ensure more active \nand systematic use of the various means for such diplomacy? The \nSecretary-General has a crucial role to play in this respect. We could \nalso make better use of the potential of the International Court of \nJustice to resolve disputes between States. \n\nThe second area is that of the make-up and functioning of a genuine \nsystem of collective security. The United Nations must be in a position \nwhen necessary to act very quickly, especially in cases of aggression or \nthreats of aggression by one country towards another. To do this it must \nhave available at very short notice the necessary human and material \nresources. Certain countries I mention in passing, France and the \nUnited States - have already responded very positively to the invitation \nin this regard by our Secretary-General. \nThe third area is that of the means for establishing peace. \nUnfortunately, all too often the diplomatic action of our Organization, \nsometimes in cooperation with regional organizations, such as the European \nCommunity, is not followed up. Too many cease-fires have been broken \nrecently, too many embargoes on the delivery of weapons have been \nviolated, for us to remain indifferent to such flouting of international \nlaw. \nNever before has the United Nations made so many tangible \ncontributions to the cause of peace and reconciliation throughout the \nworld. Nothing emphasizes the new credibility and effectiveness of our \nOrganization more than the dramatic increase in its peace-keeping \noperations in recent years. Thirteen such operations were carried out \nbefore 1987. Thirteen have been launched since 1987. The United Nations \nis now ensuring the implementation of peace agreements in El Salvador, \nAngola and Cambodia. It is contributing to calming the serious conflicts \nin Somalia and Yugoslavia. At present in Cambodia and Yugoslavia the \nUnited Nations is carrying out two of the most important operations in its \nhistory, involving a total of more than 40,000 personnel, both military \nand civilian. \n\nThe growing diversity of the tasks entrusted to our Organization \nhighlights its ability to adapt to different situations. Today the United \nNations is disarming adversaries and gathering and destroying weapons; \nreforming governmental institutions which are not up to their tasks; \nrepatriating refugees; clearing mines; monitoring elections and respect \nfor peace agreements and human rights agreements; and providing \nhumanitarian assistance and aid to refugees. \nIt is an honour for my Government to be able to contribute to the \nUnited Nations Protection Force in Yugoslavia, admittedly modest in \nabsolute numbers, but nevertheless representing 10 per cent of my \ncountry's army. \nThe cost of peace-keeping operations has considerably increased, and \ntheir importance demands that there be not the slightest delay in \npayment. The United Nations must be in a position to prepare, launch and \ncarry out such operations on a sound financial basis. The establishment \nof a revolving reserve fund would substantially strengthen that basis. \nMeanwhile, all countries must agree to meet their financial obligations \nwithout delay. \nAt its last session our Assembly adopted a resolution (resolution \n46/36 L) concerning the establishment by the United Nations of a universal \nand non-discriminatory Register of Conventional Arms. Luxembourg hopes \nthat during this session the technical procedures required can be \ndetermined and that the Register will become operational by the beginning \nof next year. The United Nations will thus be making an important \ncontribution to the necessary global transparency in arms transfers and to \nthe vast disarmament movement, which must continue. \n\nI welcome the agreement reached last June between President Bush and \nPresident Yeltsin concerning a drastic new reduction in strategic nuclear \narsenals. The forthcoming conclusion of negotiations concerning a \nConvention on chemical weapons marks a fundamental step in the \ninternational effort to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction. I hope \nthat all members of our Assembly will approve the Convention without \nreservation and will immediately sign it. \nOur Assembly has recorded significant progress on the basis of \nanother initiative of the European Community. This relates to the \nmeasures decided on to strengthen United Nations coordination in the area \nof emergency humanitarian assistance. The creation of the post of \nEmergency Relief Coordinator, to which Mr. Jan Eliasson was appointed, and \nthe establishment of a central revolving fund of $50 million now enable \nthe United Nations to cope more effectively with humanitarian crises. \nLuxembourg welcomes the broad democratization movement developing \nthroughout the world. It involves political changes which are often \npainful, complex and difficult, but they are necessary in order to build a \nbetter future. A growing number of Governments involved in such processes \nare requesting electoral assistance from the United Nations. Given the \nparticular importance of free and honest elections, I believe the United \nNations should continue to strengthen its capacity for acting in this \narea. I also propose that the United Nations cooperate with other \ninternational organizations with experience in this field in particular, \nthe Council of Europe. \n\nMy Government believes that the United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development, held in Rio, was a historic event. It is \ntrue that not all our hopes were fulfilled and that many of the decisions \ntaken lack clarity and courage. But who could deny the importance of the \npreparatory work and the awareness which it brought about? A world-wide \nprocess was launched. Major political commitments were made at the \nhighest level. \n\nHowever, the real battle still lies ahead. The convention on climate \nchange and the convention on biological diversity still must be ratified and \nimplemented; above all, they must be finalized and finely honed. The \nnegotiation of a convention on desertification still remains to be dealt with, \nand international cooperation on the protection of all forests- which is \nessential is still undefined. \nAgenda 21 opens up a vast field of work in all areas of the environment \nand development. Progress needs to be made in this respect on the national, \nregional and international levels, with the participation of all players in \nsociety and in particular of non-governmental organizations. \nPoor countries must accept the fact that environmental protection is not \na luxury; and rich countries must ask themselves if and to what extent their \nmeans of production and consumption are compatible with the demands of \nsustainable development. \nThe future of the planet cannot be jeopardized by national egoism. \nMy Government has decided to increase substantially the amount of aid \nearmarked for humanitarian assistance and development cooperation. It is \nprepared to work together with all those who are interested in promoting human \ndevelopment; transparent and honest management of public affairs; the \nparticipation of all, and above all of women, in the development process; \nand,in a general sense, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. \nThe tasks.before our Organization are numerous and most significant. A \nmajor process of transformation and restructuring lies ahead. Three years \nfrom now, we shall be marking the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. \nLet us hope that by that time we shall have established a revitalized \nOrganization, one that can effectively shoulder the responsibilities that the \npeoples of the world are so eager to entrust to it.

        "file_text": "I should like to \nbegin by offering to Mr. Ganev my heartfelt congratulations on his assumption \nof the high office of President of the General Assembly. He takes up the \npresidency at a time when the world is looking with renewed confidence towards \nthe United Nations. As a politician from an area with a proud tradition of \nrepresentative democracy, he has played a commendable role in the vanguard of \nthe democratization process in his own country and in Eastern Europe. His \nunanimous election as President of the General Assembly for the current \nsession highlights the continuing efforts of his region in its transformation \nto market-driven, democratic societies and the global prerogatives of the \npost-cold-war era. I am sure that his experience, training and diplomatic \n\nskill will do much to ensure that the forty-seventh session of the General \nAssembly is fruitful and constructive. \nLet me also take this opportunity to extend to his predecessor, \nMr. Samir S. Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, our best wishes and our appreciation of \nthe highly competent manner in which he presided at the last session of the \nGeneral Assembly. \nI take this opportunity also to express to our esteemed \nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our profound understanding and \nappreciation of the efforts he has so far made to achieve for the world body \ngreater flexibility and enhanced ability to meet the new challenges posed by \nthe dramatic developments taking place in international relations and, at the \nsame, to fulfil long-standing mandates. \nOn behalf of the Government and the people of Saint Vincent and the \nGrenadines, I pay tribute to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, whose term of office \nexpired at the end of 1991. Under his guidance over a 10-year period, the \nUnited Nations shrugged off the negative image of a useless talking-shop and \nemerged as an institution whose growing reputation as an effective \npeace-keeper has resulted in calls upon it to take on numerous new \nresponsibilities. Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar did indeed ease the transition \nof the United Nations through the changing climate and brought it to the \ncentre of new-world-order politics. He brought the Organization, with its new \npeace-keeping and peacemaking roles, back to its founding mission. We join \nthe international community in saluting him for his service to the United \nNations and to world peace. \n\nThis year the General Assembly has so far admitted 13 States to \nmembership of the United Nations by acclamation. My delegation wishes to take \nthis opportunity to extend a warm welcome to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of \nMoldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The \nadmission of this significant number of new Members in the Organization is \nanother major step towards the goal of universality. \nMy delegation wishes to express its deepest sympathy to the Governments \nand the peoples of the United States of America, the Bahamas, the Philippines, \nNicaragua, India and Pakistan, which suffered tragic loss of life and \nextensive material damage as a result of the recent spate of natural \ndisasters. We pray that our own Caribbean region will be spared any more \ndestruction during this hurricane season. It is our hope that the \nrehabilitation process in the affected communities will be swift and will \nreceive the generous support of the international community. \nIn the last few years we have witnessed momentous changes in the \ninternational arena. The end of the cold war has raised hopes for a better \nand more secure future. The world now faces novel challenges in the quest for \njustice, equity and prosperity. In many regions of the world significant \nprogress has been made towards democracy, as well as towards achieving the \npurposes set out in the United Nations Charter. Completion of the process of \ndismantling apartheid would make a major contribution to these trends. \nHowever, while there has been positive movement towards the establishment of a \nunited, non-racial and democratic South Africa, we are perturbed by some \nserious differences that have emerged in recent negotiations. \n\nMy delegation wishes to express its full support for the call by the \nAfrican National Congress for an international investigation of the Boipatong \nmassacre. We urge all concerned to make every effort to maintain the momentum \nof the negotiating process of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa in \norder to finalize agreement on the outstanding issues. If negative trends in \nSouth Africa are not reversed my Government stands ready to join in \nremobilizing the international community, through all appropriate means, in \nthe struggle against apartheid. We wish to encourage President De Klerk to \ncontinue the courageous leadership that he has so far given his Government and \nurge him not to undermine the historic image that both he and Nelson Mandela \nhave established. \nMy delegation has been following the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, \nwhich has shocked the conscience of every human being, irrespective of \nnational origin, ethnic background, religion or political persuasion. We \ncondemn the existence of detention centres, especially in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, where civilians are being detained against their will and \nsubjected to ill-treatment. The odious practice of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" must be \nfirmly rejected and a strong signal sent that the international community will \nnot passively witness the attempt at the total annihilation of a Member State \nby a powerful neighbour. \nMy delegation welcomes the adoption of Security Council resolutions \n770 (1992) and 771 (1992), which are designed to ensure that humanitarian \nassistance reaches all parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina and that international \norganizations, in particular the International Committee of the Red Cross, \nhave unimpeded access to concentration camps and detention centres. \n\nMy delegation has been following with keen interest the negotiations on \nthe issue conducted under the auspices of the European Community. We believe \nthat this process must be accompanied by international efforts to put an \nimmediate end to the violence and that increased pressure should be brought to \nbear on all parties concerned to work wholeheartedly for a political \nsettlement. The cease-fire agreement which European and United Nations \nnegotiators reached with warring factions in Bosnia is a step in the right \ndirection. \nWe are heartened by increased efforts to aid the long-suffering people of \nSomalia in the Horn of Africa. We continue to be concerned about the famine \nand the condition of human life in sub-Saharan Africa. My delegation implores \nthe international community to pay the necessary attention to the plight of \nthese people. We wish to draw attention to, and emphasize, the urgent need \nfor policy reform that would make it possible to reduce drought through \nreforestation, and avoid famine created by wasteful military expenditure. \nMy delegation welcomes the current peace efforts and prays for a just, \ncomprehensive and lasting solution to the Middle East crisis, the core of \nwhich, in our opinion, is the question of Palestine. My delegation reiterates \nthe importance of this issue and calls for the same consistency on the part of \nthe United Nations that was so evident when the resolutions dealing with the \ninvasion of Kuwait were before us. It is our hope that the ongoing peace \nprocess will result in a resolution of the conflict based on United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). My country firmly \nbelieves that the only durable solution to the historical conflict lies in the \nfull recognition and establishment of the right of the Palestinians to \nself-determination and the corresponding right of the State of Israel to exist \n\nwithin secure and guaranteed borders. The definition and maintenance of \nsecure borders at this time in world history has the benefit of modern \ntechnology, as the Gulf war has decisively shown. \nAfter a decade of mediation by the United Nations in the war over \nCambodia, the historic signing of the Paris Peace Agreements by the warring \nfactions on 23 October 1991 offers real hope for ending hostilities in that \ntroubled country. We are, however, deeply concerned about the difficulties \nwhich are being encountered by the United Nations Transitional Authority in \nCambodia (UNTAC) in the implementation of the Agreements. My delegation joins \nthe call for all concerned parties to permit the deployment of all components \nof UNTAC in the areas under its control so that it can carry out its full \nfunction in implementing the provisions of the Paris Agreements. \nThe situation in Haiti remains one of extreme concern to my country. We \nhave already condemned, in no uncertain terms, the attempted illegal \nreplacement of the constitutional President, the widespread use of violence, \nthe coercion by the military, and the violation of human rights in that \ncountry. We feel that because of its critical involvement in the Haitian \nelections and its generic role as guarantor of international human rights, the \nUnited Nations has a special responsibility to the people of Haiti, who have \nnever had the good fortune to enjoy the basic human rights and freedoms that \nthe international community has agreed are fundamental to human dignity. The \npresent situation calls for serious attention by the world body, working in \ntandem with the Organization of American States. Expressions of concern \nshould be matched by concrete action. We share the anguish of \nPresident Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the forces of democracy, and join him in \nhis impassioned call for action now. \n\nWith regard to the political situation in Central America, my delegation \nwelcomes the Peace Agreement on El Salvador, signed in January 1992 at \nChapultepec. We wish to congratulate Colombia, Spain, Mexico and Venezuela on \nthe very important role they played in the negotiating process. A profound \ndebt of gratitude is also owed to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar for his efforts \nin the service of peace in Central America, which are being continued by the \nnew Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. \nMy delegation is particularly pleased by recent developments in relations \nbetween the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the countries of Central \nAmerica. The momentum generated by the convening and successful conclusion in \nJanuary 1992 of the First Ministerial Conference between CARICOM and the \ncountries of the Central American isthmus at San Pedro Sula in Honduras must \nbe maintained. \nGuatemala's recognition of the independence of Belize and the \nestablishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries are positive \nand welcomed developments, facilitating the deepening of relations between \nmember States of the Caribbean Community and the countries of Central America. \nThe Caribbean region, and especially the countries of the Windward \nIslands, of which Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is a part, have firmly \ncommitted themselves to structural adjustment and other economic reforms \ndesigned to increase their export earnings and competitiveness in the global \neconomy. In the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, we established free \ntrade in 1988. In the wider CARICOM grouping, the 1984 Nassau Agreement on \nStructural Adjustment and the 1989 Grand Anse Declaration expressed the \nurgency which the regional leadership attaches to the transformation process. \n\nEven as we welcome recent hemispheric trade and investment initiatives \naimed at enhancing the mobility of goods and services and creating greater \nopportunity for people, my country, as well as others in the Windward Islands \ngrouping, is concerned that the vital economic interests of small States like \nours are very marginal as the powerful developed countries of the world move \nto consolidate their markets in extensive trading blocs. \nIn this regard the Governments and people of the four Windward Islands \nwill redouble their efforts to ensure that powerful forces working in their \nown interest do not destroy our economies by prematurely reversing the \nmarketing regime under which we sell our bananas to the countries of the \nEuropean Economic Community. We expect the international community to \nunderstand that, with the best will and intention in the world, small, \nresource-impoverished islands like ours constitute a special case in economic \ndevelopment. Nothing has changed these circumstances. \n\nAs the international order moves in the direction of free trade, my \ndelegation expresses the strong conviction that special attention should be \npaid to traditional trading arrangements which have sustained economic growth \nand democracy in many parts of the world. In this regard we shall continue to \nwork towards the maintenance of our traditional relationship with the European \nCommunity even as we make the transition towards eventual free trade. \nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, which \nbrought together the largest gathering of world leaders ever in \nRio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 3 to 14 June is now history. We must now \ntranslate 12 days of debates into positive action, or posterity will remember \nus for wasting a great opportunity to set the agenda for the preservation of \nour environment. As Chairman of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean \nCountries during the month of July 1992, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \ninitiated action within the Group to coordinate the activities of member \ncountries in follow-up action at the multilateral organizations as well as in \nthe wider international community. \nMy Government regards the agreement reached at the Rio Summit as an \nimportant start of a process that could eventually change the way the world \napproaches the challenge of fostering economic growth. We are particularly \npleased that issues such as the sustainability of islands, the alleviation of \npoverty, the sustainable development of all types of forests, and the \nenvironmentally sound management of solid waste were addressed. \nMy delegation urges the early ratification of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological \nDiversity, which, it is felt, if honestly implemented could mitigate some \n\nof the hazards which small, island States like Saint Vincent and the \nGrenadines and other low-lying coastal developing States face. \nMy delegation takes note of the renewed commitment made by developed \ncountries to achieve the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of their gross \nnational product for development assistance to developing countries and, where \nthis target has not yet been achieved, to augment their aid programmes in \norder to reach that target as soon as possible or by the year 2000. \nIt is our hope that the recommended high-level commission on sustainable \ndevelopment will be established soon so that it can be convened as early as \npossible to ensure that follow-up action on the Rio Summit meets the hopes and \naspirations of us all. \nContinuing progress towards democracy in many regions of the world, the \nobsolescence of the bipolar politics of the cold war, the overall reduction in \nmilitary expenditure and the emergence of new States have elicited a positive \nresponse from the world community. The United Nations peacemaking and \npeace-keeping roles have increased and broadened considerably in the \npost-cold-war era. The world body is providing leadership in these and other \nvital areas. Unfortunately, demands for the same leadership in the field of \nsocial development have not been given the same degree of political \nimportance. The Organization must address this issue as a matter of \npriority. It is true that significant efforts are being made at the national \nand international levels to improve the standards of living of the world's \npeoples but, globally, statistics show that there are today more poor people, \nmore unemployed and greater social insecurity, especially among the \npopulations of developing countries. \n\nSocial development problems are global in scope and require global \nresponses. To this end my Government supports the convening of a world summit \nfor social development at the level of Heads of State or Government in early \n1995 on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. \nAs man's inhumanity to man continues to manifest itself daily throughout \nthe world, my Government remains mindful of its pledge to promote universal \nrespect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms in \nconformity with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. In \nfurtherance of these goals, my Government will support the establishment of an \neffective international system for the protection of the fundamental rights \nand freedoms of all peoples, irrespective of race, sex, language or religion. \nWe hope that this can be achieved at the World Conference on Human Rights \nscheduled for Vienna in June 1993. \nMy delegation is deeply concerned that our region has become a \ntransshipment point for illicit drugs targeted at the North American and \nEuropean markets. We recognize that drug trafficking is an international \nproblem which affects the institutions and populations of different \ncountries. My delegation wishes to reaffirm its commitment to increasing \ncooperation in fighting the global problem of drugs in all its aspects, be it \nillegal production, trafficking or consumption. This epidemic cannot be \nallowed to undermine our precious human resources. Accordingly, my Government \nwill sign the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic \nDrugs and Psychotropic Substances. \nThe world is poised on the threshold of a bold new experience in human \nhistory. The possibilities are tremendous but the challenges great. We in \n\nthe English-speaking Caribbean, where democracy and constitutional order have \nlong been institutionalized, are anxious to play our legitimate part, with \nfull recognition of our condition and the requirements for global \nintegration. We have been reliable allies in times of struggle and \nturbulence. We now look forward to sharing fairly in the dividends of a \ndurable peace to which we have contributed by our stability and resolute \ncommitment to liberty and democracy. \n"

        "file_text": "I should like, at the outset to \ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev, Deputy Prime Minister and \nForeign Minister of Bulgaria, on his unanimous election to the presidency of \nthe General Assembly of the United Nations at its the forty-seventh session. \nHis election is recognition of his diplomatic skills and the respect for \ninternational law in his country. We are confident that the international \ncommunity will benefit from his presidency. \nI also take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to his \npredecessor. His Excellency Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, who \ndiligently presided over the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session in an \nexemplary manner. We thank him for his efforts. \nThe Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, \nhas been at the helm of our Organization for nearly a year now. We have \nalready appreciated his style of work and the vigorous responses to the \nvarious crises that have beset the international community. We want to \nreiterate our confidence in his work and our continuing support for his \nleadership. \n\nI welcome into our midst, as others before me have done, the 12 new \nMembers of the United Nations. Their admission draws the United Nations \ncloser to the realization of the principle of universality of membership. \nThis development is particularly welcome at this time, when a rejuvenated and \nvigorous United Nations is closely involved in the resolution of many \nconflicts and crises around the world. It makes the pronouncements and \nactions of the world body that much more effective. \nIt has now become clear to all that the end of the cold war has not been \na panacea for the world's ills, especially the ills of third world countries. \nIn some areas, and in some respects, these problems have been compounded by \nthe upsurge in intense nationalism and new brands of religion. The end of the \ncold war has not yet brought tangible results and change for the Palestinian \npeople in the Middle East, the black majority in South Africa, or peace to the \npeoples of Afghanistan, Cambodia, the Western Sahara and many other areas of \nconflict in the world. However, new and determined efforts are being made to \nresolve some of these problems peacefully, and we hope that these efforts will \nsucceed. \nThe tenth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, held recently in Indonesia, \ndrew attention to the failure of all the multilateral talks aimed at narrowing \nthe gap between developed and third world countries. In many areas, this \neconomic gap has widened. The Summit confirmed the validity of the Movement \nin the current international situation, but it urged its members both to join \nhands in fighting the common economic and financial problems of the South and \nto promote economic cooperation among members of the South themselves. The \nfast-growing economies of South-East Asian countries have shown the capacity \nfor intra-regional cooperation among developing countries and what can be \n\nachieved. In the place of cold-war issues, the Movement has put economic and \nfinancial matters on its agenda, and we hope that these will be tackled very \nforcefully over the next three years. \nIn our region of southern Africa, our economic problems have been \ncompounded by the very severe drought we are all facing. In the past, we used \nto export large quantities of white maize, but this year we have had to import \n13 million tons of grain alone. Although the States in the region are fully \ncooperating in the areas of transport and energy supply, other areas of our \ncooperation would be greatly increased were the evil apartheid system in South \nAfrica brought to an end and a non-racial and democratic system established in \nthat country. \nThe regime of President F. W. de Klerk which has been commented upon by \na number of speakers has put the brakes on the transition process that was \nbeing discussed at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (COPESA). It \nhas also very effectively undermined the entire process by condoning and \nabetting the escalating violence against innocent black people and \ndemonstrators. \n\nMr. de Klerk has lost credibility in the eyes of the international \ncommunity. He must take steps now to release all political prisoners; we are \ntold there are 140 prisoners still languishing in jail. He must abandon or \nclose down the single men's hostels, which are being used by armed gangs as \ncamps. He must forbid the carrying of any weapon for any purpose in public \nplaces. He should disband all extraterritorial battalions, such as Koevoet \nand Battalions 31 and 32; in fact, he should ban all private armies and \nmilitia units. These are not drastic measures by any means. They are the \nminimum steps that must be taken to level the playing field so that all South \nAfrican political parties and teams can play on it. \nThe current problems of prisoners, hostels, weapons and private militias \nare a direct consequence of the evil system of apartheid itself, which the \ninternational community has described as a crime against humanity. We must \nstress that that system has not yet ended, although some bold steps have been \ntaken in the last two years towards removing it. But it is still there. \nWe commend the role the international community has played, and continues \nto play, in South Africa in line with Security Council resolution 765 (1992) \nof 16 July 1992. It is still our belief that to deal adequately with the \nsituation of violence in the country a substantial number of observers many \nmore than the current 50 or so - should be dispatched to the country so that \nthey cover all potential flash points. Only a credible and effective \ninternational presence can prevent the violence and restore the confidence \namong the parties in South Africa that is necessary for successful \nnegotiations. \n\nIt has become obvious that the international community has made the \ngreatest headway on the South African issue when it has acted in unison. We \nneed unity-in-action from the international community. The De Klerk \nGovernment must come out unequivocally on the side of majority rule as \nunderstood by all civilised nations, without any conditions or vetoes for \nminorities. The regime's primary responsibility is to provide security and \nsafety for all South Africans, and therefore it needs to take decisive action \nnot only for the protection of all citizens of the country, as I indicated \nearlier, but also to carry forward the current process of eliminating \napartheid through peaceful means. \nDevelopments elsewhere in our region give much greater cause for hope, \nbut the peace processes in question need to be carefully nurtured if success \nis to be guaranteed. In Angola adequate preparations appear to have been made \nfor the general elections that are to take place in the next few days. The \nVice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of Angola gave a detailed account of the \narrangements that have been made for the elections in that country. The \nAngolan people, he indicated, will be given an opportunity to elect a \ngovernment of their choice. \nThe greatest praise for this achievement must go to the Angolan people \nthemselves, who have shown great maturity and patriotism in the face of \ndifficulties and mutual suspicions nurtured by 16 years of war. Some praise \nmust, however, also go to the United Nations, which has steadfastly supported \nthe Angolan peace process, particularly through the deployment of the United \nNations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II), a peace-keeping operation in \nwhich my country, Zimbabwe, is also playing a modest part. \n\nWe are glad that the problems that had arisen with regard to the \nregistration of voters, particularly logistical problems of access by \nvoter-registration officials to various parts of the country, have now been \nresolved and that incidents of violence in the electioneering process have not \nbeen allowed to get out of hand. We also commend the pledge by the main \nparties in the Angolan elections that they will respect the poll result and \nthat if they win they will endeavour to establish a government of national \nunity and reconciliation. The concept of bringing all sections of society \ninto government is indeed an act of statesmanship that takes into account the \ntraditions of the African people. \nWith regard to Mozambique, we believe that a comprehensive cease-fire \nwill be signed on 1 October 1992. We hope that this solemn commitment will be \nupheld and respected by all the signatories and, in fact, by all the \nMozambican people. After so many years of fighting, Mozambicans want peace, \ntranquillity and progress, but to achieve peace a lot of work still remains to \nbe done. There is need for flexibility on both sides, and for active \nparticipation by all States in the region, including the Republic of South \nAfrica, in the peace process. \nZimbabwe has done, and will continue to do, all in its power to help \nmaintain the momentum and keep the peace process in Mozambique moving \nforward. As all delegates are aware, the Rome Declaration envisages an \neventual United Nations monitoring role in Mozambique's electoral process, and \nwe trust that all States will support such an undertaking by this world body. \n\nThe situation in Somalia, to which many speakers have referred, is a \ncause of deep concern in my country; 2 million people may die and 5 million \nneed food aid. The extent of the suffering, which is now labelled the world's \nworst human disaster, could have been greatly alleviated had the world body \nacted earlier and with speed. However, we commend the decisive steps that \nhave now been taken by the Security Council, especially the decision to \ndispatch 3,500 troops to protect food shipments and distribution. My country \nis proud to be participating in this operation, which is aimed at averting a \nfamine of genocidal dimensions in Somalia. \nWe urge the various clan militias in the country not to disrupt the \nUnited Nations effort, but to engage in negotiations aimed at reuniting and \nbringing peace to their tortured people. The leaders of the three political \nfactions in Somalia must be condemned for intensifying civil strife in a \nsociety that is already ravaged by so much famine and drought. They should \ninstead be unifying and reconciling their people, reconciling the nation, in \norder to enable it to withstand the drought more effectively. \nIn West Africa the continued elusiveness of a solution to the Liberian \nconflict is also a cause of grave concern. We commend the efforts of the \nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Governments to bring peace \nand democracy to Liberia. Fighting between rival factions in recent days may \nembroil forces of the ECOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) in more \nfighting and make the whole situation intractable. We urge our Liberian \nbrothers to put the safety and future of their people and country before \npersonal gain and aggrandizement, and we urge our ECOWAS brothers also to \ncontinue with their efforts in attempting to bring peace to Liberia. \n\nThe crisis in the Middle East has dragged on for a long time, dating from \nthe cold-war era. Our hopes were raised that a solution would be found in the \ncurrent round of peace talks that began with the Madrid Conference. We still \nplace our hopes in that process, and hope that the advent of a Labour \nGovernment in Israel will result in a more imaginative and flexible attitude \nthat can lead to a solution adequately addressing the legitimate aspirations \nof the Palestinian people. Clearly, the new Israeli Government must accept \nthe principle of the complete withdrawal of its troops of occupation from \nPalestine and the assumption of full control by the Palestinians over their \nown resources, including water resources, as fundamental to the resolution of \nthe Palestinian issue. Further, it is important for the United Nations to \nassume a central role in the peace process, particularly as its resolutions \nserved as terms of reference for the Madrid Conference. \n \nThere are many other areas of crisis and conflict that require, and are \ngetting, the attention of this world body, such as Cyprus, Cambodia, \nAfghanistan, Western Sahara and others. The United Nations must continue to \nensure that in Western Sahara, the referendum plan is carried out in a manner \nthat reflects the genuine aspirations of the Sahrawi people; that in Cambodia, \nfull and comprehensive implementation of the Paris Accords is achieved; that \nin Cyprus, a solution that preserves the unity of the country and its \nsovereignty and territorial integrity is found; and that in Afghanistan also, \nthe unity of the country is ensured and peace realized. \nThe most explosive areas in the whole world today, however, remain the \ncountries of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the former \nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which have been the subject of much \ncomment by earlier speakers. In these areas, once the communist parties that \nheld power collapsed, the remaining, separate ethnic entities were engulfed in \nintense local tribalism and in an upsurge of religious fundamentalism. Our \nexperiences in Africa reveal that social situations of tribalism and/or \nreligious fundamentalism cannot be resolved simply by calling an election, or \nby using military force alone; what is often required is a deliberate act of \nnational reconciliation that establishes a government of national unity and \ndistributes power and influence to every segment of the society. This is a \npolitical game in which there should be no losers: the purpose of an election \nbecomes that of establishing the relative strengths of the participating \nparties and therefore the weight or seats they should have in a government of \nnational unity. \n\nIn the case of Yugoslavia, from the very beginning my delegation felt \nthat when the upsurge of tribal feeling hit that unhappy land, a conference of \nnational reconciliation should have been convened. If some tribes insisted on \ngetting out of the federal arrangement, they should have been required to sign \na treaty guaranteeing the rights of the minority tribes to power-sharing and \nto enforcement of full human rights within their own territories, \nbecause let us face it - the main problem in Yugoslavia is the patchwork of \ntribal units that are spread throughout that land. \nWe ourselves have never believed that the European Economic Community's \npolicy of early recognition of Croatia and Slovenia on the one hand and the \nsevere punishment of Serbia and Montenegro on the other would solve the \nproblems of tribal and religious feelings in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the \nnumbers in the ethnic mix are almost equal. We strongly condemn the obnoxious \npolicy of so-called ethnic cleansing by the competing tribes in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. \nThe expulsion or killing of any one person in the process of so-called \ncleansing does not solve any problem; instead, it creates a psychological, \nvicious circle of communal violence. However, when we discuss the question of \nYugoslavia in this world body soon, we would urge a word of caution: to seek \nreconciliation and not to ridicule any of the warring tribes of former \nYugoslavia. The fact that persons drawn from different ethnic, racial, \nreligious, linguistic and cultural groups live together should be a point of \nstrength rather than weakness; in fact, former Yugoslavia used to pride itself \non that very fact. Here in the United States of America, the country draws \nmuch strength from the cultural diversity of its people, who live together \nhappily under one political system. That is broadly what we should aim at in \nthe context of the Balkans. \n\nThe subject of restructuring the United Nations system has been on our \nagenda for some time now. My delegation put some specific proposals before \nthe summit of world leaders held here last January. The thrust of our \ncontribution was the need to democratize the international system and the \nempowerment of the voice of third world countries within that system. \nWe are pleased that the Secretary-General has followed up the work of \nthat summit with a comprehensive statement entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" \n(A/47/277). We agree with most of the well-thought-out conclusions and \nsuggestions in the report; in particular, we agree with the emphasis he puts \non democratic practices and the commitment to full human and political rights \nwithin our societies. On the subject of tribalism and nationalism, which we \nhave been discussing, he says: \n\\\"if every ethnic, religious or linguistic group claimed statehood, there \nwould be no limit to fragmentation, and peace, security and economic \nwell-being for all would become ever more difficult to achieve\\\". \n(A/47/277, para. 17) \nWe also endorse the recommendation that more should be done to assist the \ncountries that become victims of economic sanctions applied by this world body \nagainst other States. A meaningful and fair programme and mode of \ncompensation for victim States would encourage them to apply United \nNations-sponsored sanctions more faithfully, which would result in greater \neffectiveness of those sanctions. \nIt is also our view that the United Nations should have its own dedicated \nand committed armed units on a permanent basis, so that in its enforcement \nactions the world body acts as the world body, not as only some of its parts \nor some of its Members. The Charter itself provides for the United Nations to \n\nfunction in that fashion, and we believe that it is time the relevant \nprovisions in this regard were reactivated. \nGiven the centrality of the Security Council to the question of the \nmaintenance of international peace and security, any discussion of security \nissues cannot be complete without a look at the procedures of that body \nitself. We are aware of the circumstances in which the power of veto was \ngiven to those who now possess it in the Council. The point at issue now is \nwhether arrangements that appeared fair or at least justifiable 47 years \nago are still viable today. We believe this is an issue which needs rational \ndiscussion in which all States would participate equally and all views would \nbe given a fair hearing. Only such a fair exchange of views can result in the \npeaceful new world order that we are all seeking. \nNeedless to say, conflicts are not only the result of injustice within \nand among nations but also the result of poverty, want and despair. The past \ndecade has seen a massive deterioration in the standards of living of peoples \nin the developing world. This poverty is traceable not only to the policies \nof individual third world Governments but also to the capricious and \npernicious international environment in which they operate: not only have the \nprices for raw materials - the mainstays of our economies - been seriously \ndepressed throughout the past decade, but we have also faced extremely high \ninterest rates and increased protectionism from the markets of developed \ncountries. Far from being recipients of capital, we have become net exporters \nof hard currency, and today we jointly labour under a foreign debt of some \n$1.3 trillion. Some of us have, in addition to all this, suffered natural \ndisasters such as the drought, to which I have referred, that is ravaging \nsouthern Africa at the present time. \n\nPoverty and want breed despair, and despair, of course, breeds conflict. \nIf the international community is to address peace and security issues \nadequately, it needs to attend seriously to the causes of despair in the world \ntoday. There can be no human right greater than the right to food, the right \nto shelter and the right to life itself and, during life, the right to \nliteracy. The world body and its specialized agencies must address these \nissues as a matter of urgency. \n\nIn this regard, we are pleased at the plethora of projects now under way \nto make the United Nations focus on issues of economic development and social \nand humanitarian issues, such as the Nordic project. We believe the time has \nalso come when a frank appraisal should be made of the global economy with a \nview to eliminating some of the built-in obstacles to growth for developing \ncountries. \nI must return again to the theme of the Movement of Non-Aligned \nCountries, namely, how to close the widening economic gap between rich and \npoor nations. My delegation supports the convening of an international \nconference on social development, planned for 1994 or 1995. Such a gathering \nwould assist in defining clearly the basic needs of human beings on this Earth \nin this nuclear age, needs which must be met in order for them to live a \ndecent, satisfying and enriched life - in answer to the question. What does \nan ordinary human being need? and it would also map out a genuine path of \ndevelopment for third world countries in the South. The conference could play \na very important part in showing the correct path to development. The paths \nthat have been chosen for development have led us in different directions, and \nsome of them have led us into culs-de-sac. We need to think deeper and to act \nmore decisively in order to chart the correct path. To that extent, we \nstrongly support the convening of the conference on social development. \nThat should be the essence of the new world order to which we should all \naspire. It should be an international order guided by the twin objectives of \nuniversal peace and security, on the one hand, and an improved quality of life \nfor all the Earth's inhabitants, on the other. It must also be an order \ncharacterized by justice and respect for international law. We third world \ncountries should join enthusiastically in the promotion of the current Decade \n\nof International Law, because that is our only shield against the arbitrary \nactions of some big Powers. Our sovereignty and our national \nself-determination are deeply rooted in our political philosophies, of various \nkinds, but they are also anchored in the practice of international law. We \nshould uphold that shield even more vigorously in the so-called new world \norder that is emerging. We should also uphold the Charter of the United \nNations, which gives us some of the basic principles on which the \ninternational system has operated for so many years, nearly half a century. \nToday we stand at a crossroads. The collapse of the old order gives us \nthe rare opportunity to build something new in its place. Shall we use this \nopportunity wisely, or not? History has taught us salutary lessons about the \nprice mankind has had to pay for opportunities that are missed. In our \ndeliberations in this forum and in others, we shall all help determine the \nshape of this new order that is coming. Zimbabwe intends to participate, with \nothers, actively in that debate to ensure that the much-heralded new world \norder will be a just, humane and enlightened one that will bring an \nimprovement to the quality of life of all of humanity and provide for the \nbasic needs of all human beings, and especially in our developing societies. \nThe global community has the means and the capacity to provide for those basic \nneeds. \n"

        "file_text": "I have the \nparticularly agreeable duty, on behalf of the people and Government of the \nFederal Islamic Republic of Comoros, of conveying to Mr. Ganev warm and \nsincere congratulations on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its forth-seventh session. We have every confidence in \nhis ability, as a distinguished diplomat, to ensure complete success for our \nwork. \nI should like to take this opportunity also to express to \nMr. Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia our total satisfaction with, \nand our profound admiration of, the effective way in which he conducted the \nwork of the General Assembly at its last session. \nMay I also take this agreeable opportunity to wish the Secretary-General, \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, every success in the discharge of the noble and \nlofty mission that we have entrusted to him. I assure my dear brother and \nfriend that in his efforts to ensure that the United Nations plays the part it \nis intended to play he will have the unflagging support of my country, the \nFederal Islamic Republic of Comoros. His election is a matter of pride for \nAfrica and for the Arab world. Likewise, it reflects the standing and the \ndynamic role of his great country, Egypt, on the international scene. His \ndetermination to breathe new life into our Organization, to strengthen its \nrole and its effectiveness, gives us grounds for great hope for its future. \nThe Secretary-General's \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" a document that was drawn up \nafter the summit meeting of the Security Council last January contains \nconcrete proposals that demand the attention of Member States. In this \ncontext, I should like to voice our complete satisfaction with the very \npertinent ideas that the Secretary-General was able to set forth in such a \nshort period. In our view, his proposals deserve the international \ncommunity's very careful scrutiny to ensure that the greatest possible benefit \nis derived from them. \nThe delegation of Comoros joins those Members that have already extended \na warm welcome to the States that have recently been admitted to membership of \nthe Organization. \nThe forty-seventh session of the General Assembly is being held at a time \nwhen the world is beginning a new chapter in its history. The profound and \nfar-reaching transformations that our planet has undergone during the past \nfour years are very encouraging. General ideological confrontation is rapidly \ndisappearing, and dictatorial and authoritarian Governments are falling one \nafter another. We are witnessing a renewal of freedom, equality and respect \nfor the dignity of man. \nThe cold war has ended, and the world has heaved a sigh of relief. Our \nOrganization has an unprecedented opportunity to discharge the mandate \nentrusted to it by the Charter. Unfortunately, just as we were rejoicing at \nthe end of the cold war, with its inherent threat of nuclear destruction - at \na time when we were entitled to hope for a more peaceful world, in which \npriority would be given to the eradication of starvation and sickness other \nscourges arose, and they have made the current trends in international affairs \nmore fragile. \nA plethora of conflicts, of which no one could previously have conceived, \nhave appeared on the scene; each of them has its special features and must be \nsettled in a very precise manner. \nIn the political area, old conflicts such as those of the Middle East, of \nPalestine and of apartheid are still going on and to these have been added new \ncrises such as those of Somalia and of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and if these \nare not resolved in time, they may well prove to be a threat to international \npeace and security. \nAs regards the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, my country believes \nthat this is by no means a civil war but rather an act of aggression \nperpetrated against a young State by the forces of Serbia and Montenegro. We \ntherefore join the international community in condemning unreservedly this \nignoble act, which constitutes a violation of the fundamental rights of the \npeople of Bosnia and Herzegovina and a violation of the principles underlying \nour Charter. \nFor that reason we support all the United Nations resolutions and the \ndecisions of the recent London Conference on this matter. We also subscribe \nto the decision of the General Assembly to deny the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia automatic succession to the seat of the former Yugoslavia, and we \nsupport the initiative to have the airspace of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared \na no-fly zone. \nIt is our hope that further steps will be taken to restore peace and \nstability to that part of the Balkans. We urge the Security Council, which is \nthe main body responsible for maintaining international peace and security, to \nreconsider this matter in full detail with a view to putting an end to this \naggression, as spelt out in Article 42 of the United Nations Charter. \nHowever, we are aware of the diffidence of the Security Council to use \nthe means spelt out in Article 42 of the Charter to put a stop to this \naggression. We therefore encourage the Council to lift the arms embargo \nimposed on Bosnia and Herzegovina so that the people, with the help of \nfriendly countries, can exercise their legitimate right to self-defence in \naccordance with Article 51 of the Charter. \nWe are equally concerned at the armed conflict among the various Somali \nfactions, which has led to flight and to famine. The persistence of this \narmed conflict, in addition to the natural disasters that have struck the \ncountry, has only increased the suffering of the Somali people, with extremely \nunfortunate consequences, particularly the loss of thousands of human lives. \nThe proposal made at Jakarta by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries \nlast September, namely that a conference for national reconciliation be \nconvened to forge the unity of Somalia, seems to us to be the only way to \nachieve a final resolution of this regrettable conflict. My Government makes \nan earnest appeal to the entire international community to channel more \nassistance to this people, which is facing such tremendous difficulties. \nIn southern Africa there have been encouraging signs. Thus, the \nGovernment of the Comoros welcomes the free and democratic elections that have \ntaken place in Angola. It is our hope that that country will finally achieve \nlasting peace after so many years of civil war. \nFurthermore, it is our hope that after the peace negotiations in Rome and \nthe recent agreement concluded in Botswana between RENAMO and the Maputo \ngovernment, common ground can promptly be found so that our friends and \nneighbours from Mozambique may also be able to regain their peace and \nstability. \nIn South Africa the changes that have occurred since the release of \nNelson Mandela had given us every reason to believe that the country was \nirrevocably committed to a democratization of its political, social and \neconomic life. Unfortunately, the events of Boipatong and the recent Ciskei \nmassacres have dashed our hopes that there would shortly come into being a \ntruly united, democratic and non-racial society in South Africa. \nOn the subject of this same country, I should like to voice the great \nhope that we place in the recent Mandela-De Klerk meeting. Our most earnest \nhope is that the negotiations for the establishment of a representative \ngovernment can be resumed as soon as possible and that democracy and law will \nfinally win the day. \nThe developments in Western Sahara give us reason to believe that a \nsolution to this problem can be found in the near future. We welcome the \nclimate that prevails at present and which proves the readiness of the parties \nto the conflict to contribute to finding a solution by peaceful means. We \nalso commend the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in \nthis matter and encourage him in his efforts to bring about a rapid solution \nto the problem. \nOne of the greatest threats to international peace and security has been \nthe Middle East crisis, at the heart of which is the problem of Palestine. \nThis problem is indeed a major challenge and one which our Organization must \nmeet in order to strengthen its credibility and enhance its standing on the \ninternational scene. \nIn the light of the principles set forth in the Charter and the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights it is indeed intolerable that the Palestinian \npeople, in their legitimate struggle to claim their inalienable right to a \nhomeland, should continue to be subjected to brutalities inflicted by the \nIsraeli authorities. \nWith the hope that there will be a settlement of the Palestinian crisis, \nthe international community places great hope in the international Conference \nfor peace in that region. That is, quite clearly, the only means that can \nproduce a viable solution to the problem by peaceful means. \nThus the new spirit characterizing international relations and the \nreadiness that has been evinced at present by the parties concerned permit us \nto hope that the peace process begun last October in Madrid will continue and \nwill lead to a happy outcome of this situation. The Government of the \nComoros, whose support for the struggle of the Palestinian people has been \nunflagging, continues to believe that the solution of the Palestinian problem \nnecessarily implies taking into account the just claim of that people, that \nis, their right to have a homeland. \nThe Gulf region will not be able to heal the wounds opened up by the \naggression against, and occupation of, Kuwait by Iraq as long as Iraq fails to \nrelinquish its unjustified claims against the State of Kuwait and as long as \nKuwaiti prisoners in Iraq are not returned to their country in safety and \nhonour. For the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros the necessary \nconditions for the restoration of peace in this region are entirely the \nresponsibility of Iraq. \nTurning to a different area, we note with pleasure the improvement in the \nsituation prevailing on the Korean peninsula as a result of the joint efforts \nbeing made by the north and south of that country to find a swift solution to \nthe problem. The Korean people have long suffered from the division of their \ncountry and it is high time for the international community to render its \nsupport with a view to bringing about its reunification. \nIn this connection, my Government welcomes the coming into force of the \nAgreement on Reconciliation, Non-Aggression, and Exchanges and Cooperation \nbetween the two parties as well as the Joint Declaration of the \nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. \nSimilarly, the situation in Cambodia today is looking more promising as \nregards a final solution to the problem. The United Nations and the entire \ninternational community are aware that restoring peace in this country \nnecessarily implies a comprehensive political solution resulting from genuine \nnegotiations and has always emphasized this way of proceeding. We welcome the \nefforts which have been made by our Organization and by the world community \nwhich resulted in the agreements signed between the Cambodian parties \nconcerned. The Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros finally hopes that \nfollowing free and democratic elections Cambodia will regain its peace and \nstability. \nIn view of the rate at which authoritarian regimes are disappearing, I \nthink we have every reason to believe that shortly there will no longer be any \nquestion of dictatorship in the world; freedom, dialogue and multiparty \nsystems will have finally won the day, where force and violence triumphed in \nthe past. \nHow then can we not be optimistic in view of the fact that, similarly, \nthe thousands of voices raised in favour of recognizing the most essential \nhuman rights will finally be heeded as a result of the World Conference on \nHuman Rights which is scheduled for 1993? \nTurning to the area of economic and social development, it is regrettable \nto note that the very positive changes which are occurring internationally in \nthe political field have not been accompanied by any economic progress. Thus, \nthe problems of external indebtedness, in addition to the deterioration of the \nterms of trade and the decrease in development aid, continue to widen the gap \nthat exists between the developed and the developing countries. The case of \nAfrica, which comprises more than 20 of the least-developed countries, \ndeserves careful attention. \nThe adoption of the United Nations Programme of Action for African \nEconomic Recovery and Development has aroused great hope in us. We therefore \nappeal to the international community to live up to the commitments it made \nwhen this Programme was adopted and to lend its assistance to African \ndevelopment efforts. Similarly, since we are desirous of a flourishing \neconomy for our countries, Comoros supports the decision of the Government of \nJapan to convene an international conference on the development of Africa in \n1993. \nFurther, the current trend in world economics is directed more and more \ntowards the creation of more open and more sound economic and trade blocs. It \nis for that reason that the process of regional integration has now been \nrecognized as being an indispensable factor in promoting economic development, \nparticularly the development of the developing countries. \nThus, the Comoros have become a member of the Indian Ocean Commission and \nhave pledged to ratify the Treaty creating the African Economic Community as \nsoon as the country has a national assembly. \nIn order to revamp its own economy and to initiate the process of \nharmonious development, the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros has just \nsigned, with the international financial institutions of Bretton Woods, a \nprogramme of structural adjustment. But as the Assembly is aware, the \nimplementation of the measures set forth in such a programme necessarily and \nalways entail consequences which are very difficult for the most disadvantaged \nstrata of the population to bear. \nWhat can we say at this stage about the Rio de Janeiro summit? Despite \nthe unhappy realities of the depletion of the ozone layer and the continued \ndegradation of the ecological environment, let us recognize one thing at \nleast: the meeting in Rio de Janeiro had the merit of taking account of our \nconcerns and projections with respect to environmental problems. Now that the \nrelationship between the environment and development is unquestionable, we are \nresolved no longer to divorce one from the other. In order to ensure the \nviability of the strategy and programmes adopted by our various development \nmeetings, it is essential to pay particular attention to the environment. \nThus, the cooperation of the countries of the North in financing Agenda 21 is \nabsolutely necessary. \nDemocratic transition is a phenomenon which differs according to the \nspecific features of each country. The Comoros itself is of course no \nexception to this rule. This is regarded as a period of transition which is \nneeded to harmonize the democratic process in all its aspects. \nConsequently, the Comorian Government, despite a very disturbing \nfinancial and economic situation which has produced considerable social \ntension, has during this transitional stage adopted a posture favourable to \ndialogue, convinced that confrontation should in all circumstances give way to \ndialogue. Because of this attitude we are completely in control of the \nsituation. Thus, stability has at no time been jeopardized, as is proved by \nthe fact that we foiled the attempted coup d'etat of 26 September last. \nThis attempt failed because the Comorian people, aware of its \nGovernment's efforts to set up the necessary democratic institutions and to \ncreate the circumstances which would promote its social development, did not \nrespond to an appeal, the purpose of which was to compromise the chances of \ncreating a real State of law. In order to realize these noble ambitions, the \nIslamic Federal Republic of the Comoros is once more turning to the \ninternational community, to the United Nations, and to its great family in \nparticular, to remind them that now, more than ever, it has need of their \nunflagging support to save this embryonic democracy and to place it on a solid \nbasis. \nI cannot conclude my remarks before the Assembly without referring to the \nquestion of the Comorian island of Mayotte, which has appeared on successive \nagendas of sessions of the General Assembly since we acceded to international \nsovereignty. This unfortunate problem has been going on for 17 years now and \nto our great regret pits us against France, a country with which we have very \nclose ties of friendship and cooperation. We will not go into the facts which \nunderlie this problem here since the question is to be the subject of a \nspecial debate in a few days. I should simply like to recall that the Islamic \nFederal Republic of the Comoros has always favoured dialogue and has always \nabided by the rule of law in its attempts to find a peaceful solution to the \nquestion. \nNevertheless, the Comorian Government notes with some bitterness that no \ndecision has as yet been taken on the French side which would show evidence on \nthe part of the French authorities of a desire to find a solution to the \nproblem. \nSince his accession to the High Court, President Said Mohamed Djohar, \nwith the support of his government, has reaffirmed his desire and resolve to \npersevere in seeking a solution to the problem of Mayotte, while respecting \nthe law. \nAs they are convinced of the correctness of their claims, the people and \nthe Government of Comoros continue to believe that Mayotte is part of Comorian \nterritory and nothing can undermine their will to work for the reintegration \nof this land into the Comoros. Hence the Islamic Federal Republic of the \nComoros hopes that it will always be able to rely on the valuable support of \nthe international community to find a prompt solution to this dispute. \nThis assistance is essential if the Federal Islamic Republic of the \nComoros is to regain its territorial integrity and its unity, which are based \non ethnogeographical, linguistic, religious, cultural and economic givens, \neven though ours is an island country. \nOver and above the policy of economic and financial recovery that has \nbeen implemented in the Comoros, my country has resolutely embarked on a \nprocess of democratization that has culminated in the adoption of a new \nConstitution on 7 June this year. In a month's time, the Comorian people is \nto elect the representatives to the national assembly and to the regional \ncouncils and the governors of the islands. Need I recall that the twofold \neffort of Said Mohamed Djohar and his Government to ensure, firstly, economic \nand financial recovery and, secondly, to establish democracy, is a major \nundertaking that requires the necessary conditions to be met for it to \nsucceed. I therefore appeal to the international community to lend its most \nvaluable support to our young democracy. \nWhen the San Francisco Charter was adopted, the principal goal of the \nprime movers of our Organization was to seek ways and means to build, for all \nnations, a future of peace, progress and justice. Today, this vision of the \nfounding fathers, given the new international relations scene, has the ideal \nframework for it to be made reality. \nWe therefore must give the United Nations our support, and give it the \nnecessary means, to enable it properly to carry out the mission that has been \nassigned to it. \nIn conclusion, I reiterate that the Comoros is confident that our \nOrganization can resolve all the problems, of whatever kind, that afflict our \nworld. What is needed here is that States should have the will to contribute \nto achieving this noble goal. "

        "file_text": "I \nconsider it a great honour to speak before the General Assembly of the United \nNations once again. On behalf of the people and the Government of the \nRepublic of Panama, I wish to extend heartfelt congratulations to General \nAssembly President Stoyan Ganev, whose election has been a tribute to his \nrecord and personal merits and a wise choice by the General Assembly. \nBefore continuing, I should also like to express my country's pleasure at \nthe election of the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and at the \nsplendid work he has done in the few months during which he has been at his \nsensitive position. We are certain that, under his leadership, the necessary \nconsensus will be achieved to implement concrete actions that will promote \npolitical and economic stability, human and social development, and the \nrestoration of belief in the principles that gave rise to this Organization. \nToday, because of the positive changes that have taken place in the world \nchanges that have been called the \\\"new order\\\" those principles are \nsingularly valid. We most definitely support his \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\". \n\nWithout any doubt, the end of the cold war offers the world new and great \nopportunities to devote efforts and additional resources to the social and \neconomic activities of our countries rather than to the waging of war. We \nnote with satisfaction the progress made in various parts of the world through \njoint efforts to promote peace, security, and cooperation. \nThe experience of the people of the Republic of El Salvador constitutes, \nfor the rest of mankind, an example of how to settle disputes by peaceful \nmeans. With the signing of the peace agreements in the nation, an end was put \nto 12 long, grim years of struggle, bloodshed, grief, and suffering for \nthousands of Salvadorian homes. That is why my country, like the rest of the \ninternational community, reiterates its commitment to help the Salvadorian \npeople consolidate peace, an indispensable element in the economic, political, \nand social recovery of that fraternal country. \nIn the same vein, the recent conclusion of the century-old border \nconflict between Honduras and El Salvador, after the accepted ruling of the \nInternational Court of Justice, puts an end to one stage and begins another \nmarked by understanding and friendship between those two countries. My \nGovernment welcomes this renewed willingness to resolve disputes by peaceful \nmeans. \nIn those areas where, sadly, wars are unfolding, action must be taken not \nonly to combat the scourge of war but also to fight its causes. Panama \nsupports the machinery aimed at preventive action by United Nations \npeace-keeping forces in regions of hostility, in particular the implementation \nof preventive diplomacy and the peace programme put forward by the \nSecretary-General. \n\nIn the area of regional disarmament, Panama, under the Treaty of \nTlatelolco and recent proposed amendments to it, and as a signatory to the \nAyacucho Declaration, has made a commitment to cooperate in efforts in this \ndirection, as well as in efforts to ban nuclear weapons and eliminate \nconventional arms in Latin America. Taking into account the concepts of peace \nand stability, our country has truly and effectively abolished the army and is \nin the process of introducing constitutional reforms that will make it \nimpossible to re-establish any kind of military organization in Panama. If \nthe Panamanian people supports this plan in the referendum next November, we \nwill be - together with Costa Rica two American countries whose constitution \nand laws ban the existence of an army. In this way we will have eliminated \nthe possibility of re-establishing military regimes, of sorry memory, that did \nsuch harm throughout the history of Panama. \nBoth domestically and internationally, we are in favour of diverting \nresources that have hitherto been assigned to military activities'towards \nefforts to promote the economic and social development of the people and the \nprotection of the environment. If the great and powerful of this world have \ncome to understand the necessity of reducing military spending, then there is \neven more reason for the smaller countries to understand that our wars must be \nwars against poverty and illiteracy. \nThere can be no doubt that the Rio Conference marked the beginning of a \nnew stage in a new form of development for the world and its inhabitants. We \nmust harmonize the economic, social, political, and ecological dimensions. \nThe concepts of sustainable development and integration are key elements in \nbuilding the future of our world above and beyond the boundaries and \nindividual interests of nations. But, at the same time, the equity that can \nbe produced by development must be an important topic on our agendas. \n \nPanama accepts the challenge to shift development patterns and attitudes \ntowards the natural environment. In this regard, we need the determined \ncooperation of the international community to preserve the biogenetic heritage \nthat has been bequeathed to us. I reiterate that we need to create a special \nfund to give the developing countries new and additional resources enabling \nthem to implement national strategies of sustainable development. At the same \ntime, it is necessary to make joint efforts to bring together Governments and \nthe private sector with international organizations in an effort to achieve \nthese ends. To that end, we should look to the results of the Rio Conference \nas a great opportunity to pledge efforts and resources at all levels and to \nformulate and implement national development strategies based upon Agenda 21. \n\nIn my first address in this forum, two years ago, I referred specifically \nto our support for the incorporation of the Republic of Korea into the United \nNations, which we saw as consistent with the atmosphere created by the end of \nthe cold war. We are delighted that this decision was made a year ago. \nToday, in that same spirit, we must give due consideration to the absence of \nthe Republic of China from this Organization, and we must also consider the \nimpact that absence has on the role our Organization plays in achieving global \ncooperation and coordination. We must acknowledge the impressive economic \ndevelopment of that country and the progress made in the democratization of \nthe Republic of China. These factors could help resolve many of the problems \nfacing this Organization. \nFor this reason, we invite Member States to initiate serious \nconsideration of this subject in the spirit of peace and cooperation that has \npredominated recently. \nIn the area of human rights, we have noted with satisfaction the decision \nto convene a world summit conference on social development, and preparations \nfor the World Conference on Human Rights. It is important that the United \nNations system assume leadership in these areas, facing, as a matter of \npriority, the social problems that stand in the way of improving living \nconditions for the most dispossessed in our societies. \nAs I said a year ago, Panama has set for itself a number of social \ndevelopment programmes over the next five years. I am happy indeed to say \ntoday that the United Nations Development Programme has contributed \neffectively in this national effort to attack the areas of extreme poverty in \nour country as a matter of priority. Thanks to this cooperation, we have made \nconsiderable progress, although I must admit that we still have a long way to \ngo. \n\nAs part of the Central American isthmus, our country is continuing to \nmake efforts to lay the foundation for commitments that will benefit our six \nmembers. To this end, the Central American Presidents, at the twelfth summit \nConference in Managua, Nicaragua, last June, developed a working agenda. The \npurpose of that agenda is to bequeath to future generations of our countries \nbetter conditions for improving democratic institutions, promoting integration \nand fostering economic and social development. We should like to take full \nadvantage of this new era in our region, for we see it as a historic \nopportunity to strengthen the idea of a united Central America facing the \nchallenges of the twenty-first century. \nFor these reasons, the Central American Presidents decided to place the \nemphasis at the thirteenth summit Conference which we will proudly be \nholding for the first time in Panama next December on the agricultural \nsector, which is the pillar of our economies and the primary source of \nemployment in our region. \nOur efforts to participate in the activities of all international \norganizations recognizing as we do that dialogue is the best way to promote \nrelations among nations - has led us to take steps to become a permanent \nmember of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and has led us to sign \nthe Montreal Protocol on the ozone layer. \nI now turn to actions within the European Community to protect the \nexporting of our product, bananas. As a result of the visits of several \nCentral American Presidents to different European countries, we now view with \noptimism the decision of some of these countries to oppose the resolution of \nthe Commission of the European Community on the subject. That resolution \nrecommends the imposition of quotas on the importing of bananas into the \n \nCommunity, which would adversely affect thousands of jobs in that sector of \nour economy. \nAt this point I should like to stress that the consolidation of democracy \nand stable social peace must be understood and promoted within a modern \napproach to economic relations. Imposing measures such as the ones mentioned \nin respect of bananas is certainly not in keeping with these new realities. \nAt a time when there is an opening of trade in goods, products and services, \nit is contradictory indeed to see efforts made to restrict our banana market \nby applying protectionist policies that seem now to be out of date. \nAlong these same lines, Panama views with optimism the negotiations of \nthe North American Free Trade Association, which concluded last month. These \nnegotiations were the result of the Americas Initiative put forward by the \nUnited States of America. That agreement will make possible accession by \nother countries in the region. Thus a climate of eguity has been created in \nrespect of investments, markets and the transfer of technology. \nI should like to stress that the free trade agreement could be the \nmechanism that, over the short term, will make it possible to promote a plan \nfor intra-regional free trade. This would redound to the benefit of our \neconomies and be part of a balanced, competitive plan. \nIn this forum, I should not fail to touch on our concern over the problem \nof drug trafficking. Because of our geographical position and our service \neconomy, we have unfortunately attracted much of this unlawful and damaging \ntrade. Consequently, my Government has promoted, and will continue to \npromote, serious, responsible action to put an end to drug trafficking and the \nlaundering of money relating to these activities. We have signed \ninternational agreements and we are negotiating other similar agreements, and \n\nwe are carrying out successful internal operations relating to supervision and \ndetection in order to help undermine any incentives that might exist for this \nvile trade in our country. \n\nHowever, whether we are producer countries, countries used for transit or \nconsumer countries, the problem affects us all. That is why it is necessary \nto reaffirm our determination to fight and curb these activities, for they not \nonly damage the health of our citizens, but also promote violence and \nterrorism, which also deserve our most vigorous condemnation. \nTherefore, I take this opportunity to tell the world that Panamanians \nleaders and the people are determined allies of all those fighting against \ndrug trafficking and the crimes resulting from it, which make it such a \nreprehensible activity. \nIn this world forum, I should like to report on actions that Panama is \nnow taking to take over the administration and operation of our inter-oceanic \ncanal, in keeping with the 1977 Treaty. Our country will assume full \nownership and autonomous management of the Canal on the last day of this \ncentury. In the meantime, some of the improvements made by the United States \nin the inter-oceanic region have been handed over to the Republic of Panama; \nother improvements will become Panamanian property when the canal itself is \nhanded over. My Government has carried out many internal consultations on the \nsubject and has drawn up the legal framework for the administration and \nutilization of these improvements. This is a commitment that Panamanians have \nunhesitatingly made to the rest of the world. \nMoreover, together with our partner in the Canal the United States - we \nare members of a number of national and bi-national commissions preparing for \nthe transfer of functions at the appointed hour. Finally, in another \ncommission, made up of Panama, the United States and Japan, alternatives to \nthe Panama Canal are being studied in order to determine the best way to \nensure the continued competitiveness of our inter-oceanic route in the next \ncentury. \n\nThe last decade of this century finds Panama building its future with \noptimism. We are strengthening our democratic system and the institutions \nthat are its foundation. Among other things, we are preparing for an \nexemplary electoral process in 1994, ensuring in turn renewal of authority in \nkeeping with the popular will, openly expressed. We are taking advantage of a \nsignificant recovery of our economy, which will benefit our social \ndevelopment. With a keen sense of responsibility, we are preparing ourselves \nto administer our Canal, from the last day of this century. We are living in \nfreedom and in peace with our neighbours. Panama today has a future, and it \nis promising. \nThese policies and principles guide our domestic actions and constitute \nthe guidelines for our international actions. That is why we support all \nUnited Nations actions and initiatives consistent with our principles and \ninterests. \nIn this world forum, I urge all countries to promote and consolidate \npeace, to foster their development and growth and to guarantee democracy and \njustice, for these will help us live together in a better world. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me \nto congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the General \nAssembly at this session. In your election can be seen an unequivocal \nindication of rejoicing at the establishment of democracy in your country. \nIt is also fitting today for us to welcome the States of Armenia, \nAzerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, \nKyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, San Marino, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and \n\nUzbekistan to our community of nations. Their participation as Member States \nguarantees observance of the principle of universality, an essential element \nof the very life and existence of the Organization. \nWe congratulate Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to whom my people and country \nhave had numerous occasions to express their esteem and their hopes, as he \nundertakes his difficult and very important mission as the new \nSecretary-General, continuing the brilliant work of \nMr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. \nLast year, taking note of the dizzying acceleration of world events, we \nput forward our views on the consequences of the collapse of what was called \nthe old order that was born during the cold war, and our view regarding the \nattitude that the international community should assume in the face of the new \nand emerging international situation. We said and today we have even more \nreason to reiterate that the spectacular changes in the former distribution \nof power would not necessarily lead us to the heralded new international \norder, although such changes opened up the possibility of our being able to \nachieve strict, rigorous observance of the fundamental principles of the \nCharter. That prospect gave us a sense of realistic optimism with regard to \nthe future, though we never lost sight of all the negative elements in \nexistence today that stand in the way of the full acknowledgement of the \nexistence of a true \\\"order\\\". \nThe success of the effective functioning of the mechanisms of collective \nsecurity that were put into operation during the Gulf crisis is not enough. \nThe important point is, essentially, that each and every one of the States of \nthe international community should, in accordance with its capability for \naction and hence with its responsibilities, adapt its conduct to the \n\nprinciples of the Charter, which are the basic principles of law and ethics; \nand those principles should be strictly complied with, making of that form of \nconduct a consistent practice. \nThis year we find ourselves facing a new and grave quaking of \ninternational security as a result of the outbreak in Europe of the most \nbrutal conflict to take place on the old continent since the Second World \nWar. In our view, it is the responsibility of the international community, in \nthe face of that situation, to ensure the finding of a solution that goes \nbeyond the national interests involved and beyond consideration of our \ngeographical distance from or proximity to the conflict. \n\nWe view with grave concern the atrocities that have been committed, the \nreports of the concentration of civilians in detention camps, as well as the \nhorrendous violations of human rights and the persistent disregard for \ninternational humanitarian law that are taking place in that region. \nWe see how cardinal principles of international law are being violated, \nsuch as territorial integrity and sovereignty, which leads to disregard for \nthe true and genuine meaning of self-determination. Furthermore, we view with \nalarm the extraordinary introduction of the racial factor into international \nrelations and the emergence of the invocation of doctrines such as that of \n\\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" to justify serious violations of international law and of \nhuman rights. \nWe therefore once again most forcefully reiterate our condemnation of \nthose practices and our exhortation to implement steps collectively worked \nout, in the context of international law, that enhance the effectiveness of \nUnited Nations mechanisms across the board. \nThe decision adopted by the General Assembly on 19 September as to the \nstatus of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) in the \nUnited Nations was supported by Uruguay. It was the only position that could \nindeed be taken in the light of the circumstances. This did not involve a \ncase of exclusion, nor a situation such as those envisaged under Articles 5 \nand 6 in the Charter, but rather involved the finding that it was impossible, \non the basis of incontrovertible facts, that that State could automatically \ntake over the seat of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. \nThis means that the new State will have to apply for admission as a Member of \nthe United Nations, pursuant to the provisions of Article 4 of the Charter. \n\nThe situation in that region, along with the tragedy being endured in \nSomalia and elsewhere, compels us to reaffirm the duty, based on the \nprinciples of solidarity and cooperation, to provide humanitarian aid. That \nduty, which implies an acknowledgement of the corresponding right, must be \nconceived of and implemented within the context of international law, without \ndoing violence to other essential principles. Humanitarian aid must be \ndecided upon by competent international bodies, by implementation of law, and \nmust not serve as a cover for disguised or veiled forms of unlawful \nintervention, whether on an individual or a collective basis. \nWe welcome the encouraging turn that in recent weeks has been taking \nplace in the talks aimed at bringing the peace process in the Middle East back \non track. The traditional and unswerving friendship of the Uruguayan people \nwith the Arab and Jewish peoples, along with the excellent diplomatic \nrelations our Government maintains with the Arab countries and with the State \nof Israel, are all factors that induce us to lend our vigorous support to the \ncommon guest for peace in that region, a peace that must be based on \nguaranteed security for all the States in the region, on respect for \nterritorial integrity, on the right to self-determination of all peoples and \non the full applicability of human rights. \nThe Government of Uruguay here reaffirms its determination to contribute \nto peaceful and harmonious fellowship between Arabs and Jews, both essential \nprotagonists of civilization, and reaffirms as well its commitment to \ndeepening its ties with the States of the Middle East. \nWe have before us an invaluable working document prepared by the \nSecretary-General. That document, with whose principles and approach we fully \nagree, gives rise to thoughts that we cannot fail to voice here. \n\nIn this day and age, faced as we are with the global dimensions of the \nproblems of peace and security, and confronted with situations that demand \nuniversal answers situations that it is impossible to cope with through \npartial or territorially limited approaches, such as issues relating to the \nenvironment, drug trafficking and terrorism we must rethink the question of \nsovereignty: not so as to weaken its essence, which continues to represent \nthe underpinning of our international Organization, but rather to adapt it to \ncurrent requirements, which are necessary for us to build a world based on \npeace and solidarity, and to act on the basis of the defence and protection of \nthe interests of the global community as a whole, a precept that, according to \nFrancisco de Vitoria, lies at the roots of the rights of peoples. This \nconcept of humanitarianist universalism precludes the recognition of any \nlegitimacy in the exercise of power by any individual Power outside the \nframework of international law. \nThe report entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/227) presents in an \norganic and intelligent fashion a set of proposals to implement, within the \nnew international context, a systematic process of preventive diplomacy. We \nfundamentally share its goals and the essential aspects of the global view \nupon which it draws. \nWe must give the Secretary-General the political backing he needs for him \nto act with the necessary flexibility and effectiveness, in line with the \nconcepts that he has set forth. \nWe agree with the need to seek a greater balance between the Security \nCouncil and the General Assembly. Moreover, we welcome the fact that this \nreport incorporates a proposal that Uruguay has always advocated, namely the \nwish that all our Member States unreservedly accept the competency of the \nInternational Court of Justice. \n\nWe do not doubt the need to strengthen peace-keeping operations. In that \nconnection, our country intends to preach by example. Uruguay has now \nincreased to unprecedented levels the number of members of its armed forces \nand police forces made available to the United Nations, as measured against \nthe size of our military forces and our population. By way of example, more \nthan 900 members of our armed forces are currently participating in the \npeace-keeping operations in Cambodia, and a general from our Republic is \ncommanding the United Nations contingent in Kashmir. \nTo consolidate and guarantee international security, there can be no \ndelay in moving ahead with the process of disarmament that is currently under \nway. It must be expanded integrally in breadth and in depth. \nWe must halt any new spiralling of the arms race, whether this be on the \nglobal, regional or local level. Along those lines, Latin America and the \nCaribbean have been marking this particular phase in the evolution of \ninternational relations with a noteworthy effort to complete what in and of \nitself already constitutes a vast zone of peace. \n\nI should like to highlight the notable effort undertaken by Latin \nAmerica, in which Uruguay has participated actively from the very outset, to \namend the Tlatelolco Treaty in such a way as to enable Cuba to sign it, \nArgentina to ratify it and Brazil and Chile to submit their reservations to \nit. These amendments, which have already been adopted and have also resulted \nin France's ratification of Additional Protocol I, have ensured that the first \nnuclear-weapon-free zone, covering all of Latin America and the Caribbean, has \ncome into real, total and full existence. \nUruguay firmly supports the adoption of the Convention on chemical \nweapons developed by the Disarmament Conference. \nThe mushrooming of regional armed conflicts compels us to give thought to \nnew or renewed forms of cooperation in and coordination of world-wide and \nregional efforts to resolve differences and to enable us to act in the face of \nthreats to and aggression against peace and security. Latin America, which \ntoday is a continent of peace and is resolving territorial or border disputes \nby legal and peaceful means, where there are no morbid outbreaks of xenophobia \nand racial hatred, and which is fighting, as never before in its history, to \nsolve the problems of its indigenous peoples and of human rights, has a \nparticular talent for setting up this necessary world-wide and regional \ncoordination. The recent judgment handed down by the International Court of \nJustice concerning a territorial dispute between Honduras and El Salvador, and \naccepted by both parties; the submission to an arbitration tribunal of a \nborder dispute between Argentina and Chile; and the new and positive spirit \nreigning in the dialogue between Ecuador and Peru aimed at solving the \nlong-standing conflict that has pitted these two fraternal countries against \neach other bear witness to the example Latin America is setting. \n\nThe duty all the States that make up the international community have to \nguarantee and protect human rights does not flow only from the international \nobligations that result from treaties in force; respect for human rights is \nborn of the United Nations Charter and of the Universal Declaration. \nFurthermore, it is a principle of jus cogens which, if violated, entails \ninternational answerability and renders null all legal instruments contrary to \nthis imperative law which originates in the will of the international \ncommunity as a whole. The protection of human rights at world and regional \nlevels has made signal progress in the law of nations of today, and the \nprocess of improvement must continue. \nIt is not, however, solely by developing international instruments for \nthe protection of human rights that we shall achieve generalized respect for \nhuman rights. We must work hard to universalize a culture of human rights \nthat would uproot from people's minds and behaviour intolerance, violence, \nhatred, and contempt for the dignity that each and every individual on the \nplanet naturally has. The affirmation and dissemination of that culture of \nhuman rights is the great challenge that mankind must meet in the decades \nahead. \nThe resurgence amongst us, in what for us is the cradle of Western \ncivilization, of racism, racial intolerance and animosity rooted in ethnic, \nreligious and cultural differences is cause for great alarm. These \nmanifestations are compounded by episodes, not that far distant \ngeographically, of forced population transfers, the appearance of detention \ncamps and the commission of atrocities and practices that once again amount to \na shameful blot on our contemporary civilization. The international community \ncannot close its eyes to these things, nor fail to act in the face of this \nterrible and unacceptable situation. \n\nUruguay hopes that the holding of the forthcoming World Conference on \nHuman Rights will be a historic landmark for the future in terms of respect \nfor fundamental human rights and freedoms. \nGlobal stability is generally and permanently threatened by the vast \namount and extent of grinding poverty. Apart from the fundamental, ethical \nreasons that inspire us all, there are security considerations that should \nmake us tackle this widespread situation as a whole. This is why the \ncountries of Latin America and the Caribbean have decided to support the \ninitiative put forward by our sister republic of Chile that a world summit on \nsocial development should be held in 1995. We welcome the fact that this \nconcern caused this initiative to be included in the \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" \n(A/47/277) put before us by the Secretary-General, and that it has been \napproved by the Economic and Social Council. \nBecause of its modi operandi that pay no attention to frontiers and \nbecause of the way it is organized, drug trafficking has become one of the \nmost serious types of international crime. Uruguay insists that this form of \nmodern-day aggression must be combated in all its various phases and \nmanifestations. The capacity of the United Nations to act must be \nstrengthened in such a way as to complement and assist the concerted action \nwhich our own countries must take by means of regional as much as global \nbilateral and multilateral instruments. \nThe need to achieve economic development on terms compatible with \nconserving the environment is a priority objective for our country. We are \nconcerned at the fact that the Rio Conference did not result in the adoption \nof more specific and effective commitments. What concerns us far more, \nhowever, is the risk that the principles enshrined in the Rio Declaration and \n\nin the programme of action agreed upon in Agenda 21 might remain a kind of \ncatalogue of good intentions without any practical and effective application. \nThe solemn adoption of those documents, and even the signing of the \nConventions on biodiversity and climatic change, which Uruguay will shortly \nratify, are not going to halt the progressive deterioration in the \nenvironment. Although those documents are major contributions, the polluting' \nactivities that threaten our present and jeopardize our future have not \nstopped with their signing and will not stop once their hopefully rapid entry \ninto force has occurred. \n\nWe are all aware that the success or the failure of the process of the \nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) hinges on the \ntotal and effective implementation of those commitments. \nThe road to Rio was difficult. However, more arduous still will be the \nroad to be travelled from Rio on. States will have to shoulder their legal \nresponsibilities and to implement the actual measures laid down in Agenda 21. \nGovernments will have to agree to transform into legally binding obligations \nthe principles of conduct, liability and compensation emanating from the \nStockholm Declaration and later endorsed and developed in the Rio Declaration, \nwhich are considerably more than moral obligations. While today they are \nobligations stemming from international ordinary law, they are, moreover, \nauthentic criteria embodied in jus cogens, and are valid eroa omnes. \nHowever, notwithstanding the foregoing, it is time to avoid ambiguous \ninterpretations as to the real juridical value of these obligations. The \nPresident of Uruguay, in his address delivered at the Rio Conference, stated \nthe determination of my country to propose the codification of those \nprinciples in a binding legal instrument. We will consider the most opportune \ntime and place for giving practical effect to our initiative, even \ncontributing a draft convention. \nAt the same time, this approach will have to be complemented by \nimplementation of the plan of action agreed upon in Agenda 21. We know this \nobjective implies collecting huge financial resources and adopting large-scale \nmeasures of technology transfers. We trust that the developed countries that \nhave accepted the principle of shared but differentiated responsibility will \nfind the political will needed for taking the lead in this effort. While \nappearing to be a great sacrifice, this action is an investment that brooks no \ndelay for preserving the present and ensuring the future. \n\nSpecific proof of Uruguay's priority interest in environmental problems \nis that we have agreed that the next meeting of the Contracting Parties to the \nBasel Convention on Toxic and Hazardous Wastes should be held in our country. \nThe changes that have been progressively noted in the political arena \nstand in dramatic contrast to the adverse trends that are ever more \nexacerbating international economic relations. We view with concern the fact \nthat the crucial issue of development would appear to have been relegated to \nthe back-burner amongst issues on the international economic agenda. \nJust as early in the 1980s the problem was the external debt situation in \nthe developing countries, at the beginning of the 1990s one can say that it is \nthe inconsistencies in the macroeconomic and trade policies that jeopardize \nworld economic growth and international monetary stability. \nWhile the developing countries are redoubling their efforts at achieving \nadjustment, liberalization, deregulation and adaptation to new world \nrealities, recessionary trends and low rates of growth in the industrialized \ncountries, their bloated budgetary deficits, their increasing levels of \nindebtedness, the resurgence of their protectionist policies and the lack of \ncoordination among their monetary and parity policies are factors creating \nmajor counterweights to any revitalization of the world economy, to any \nincrease in trade and change in trade policy and to world-wide capital flows. \nAll this highlights the need for a better analysis and greater \ncoordination of economic policies the world over. \nIn recent years we have witnessed a major process of reorganization in \nworld trade, owing to two major trends unfolding side by side. On the one \nhand, efforts have been made in the context of the Uruguay Round aimed at \nguaranteeing an open international marketplace through a process of \n\nliberalizing and expanding trade, while strengthening multilateral rules and \ndiscipline within the context of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \n(GATT). On the other hand, great economic blocs have emerged, in whose hands \nare concentrated most of the world's wealth, major trade flows, investment \nflows and flows of technological know-how. If these blocs wish to move \ntowards development and general progress, they will have to evolve as open \nmarkets. \nI am convinced this evolution will depend on what happens or fails to \nhappen in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations of GATT, which \ntoday have become all but paralysed and are seriously jeopardized. \nFailure in the Uruguay Round would be very serious and would trigger \nserious adverse repercussions for the world economy as a whole. It would send \nan extremely negative signal to economic operators, would open the doors to \nunilateralism and to relations based upon power, and would lead to an \nescalation of protectionism and an intensification of trade conflicts. \nThus, we must urgently call upon all participants in the Uruguay Round \nand, in particular, to those countries responsible for the main disagreements \npending, to join their efforts and to make their positions more flexible so as \nto conclude the negotiations quickly and satisfactorily, with equitable \nresults that would promote the liberalization of trade and avoid protectionist \ndiscrimination. \nWithin the United Nations, the current process of revitalization and \nrestructuring the Organization in the economic and social fields must be seen \nas constructive. In this regard, we welcome the results of the eighth session \nof the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and those \nof the first meeting of the revamped Economic and Social Council, held in \nNew York last July. \n\nThis process of revitalization must be pursued and intensified. The \nUnited Nations cannot stay on the sidelines of policy formulation with regard \nto the most important economic, financial and trade issues. What is urgently \nneeded is a determined effort aimed at institutional and operational \nrevitalization and the restoration of the indispensable credibility of the \nUnited Nations so that the Organization can fill the great institutional void \nthat currently exists in the field of international economic relations and can \nsuccessfully discharge its responsibilities. \nOnly thus will we manage to lay the groundwork for the more constructive \nand effective international cooperation that would make it possible to halt \nand reverse the adverse trends that prevail in the economic field. In this \nregard, my country gives particular importance to the role UNCTAD is called \nupon to play as the forum to further international economic relations that are \nconducive to development. \n\nI cannot fail to mention the major effort my country has been making, \ntogether with Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, to establish a common market of \nthe South in 1995. The various processes laid down in the Treaty of Asuncion \nand in the timetable adopted by the Presidents of the four States parties at \nthe meeting in Las LeSas, Argentina, are being fully implemented. Thus, the \nprocess of subregional integration has already become the axis round which \nrevolve our policies of development, renewal, openness and modernization, \nprompting us to look to the future with renewed optimism and conviction. \nUruguay, a State that cherishes peace, a founding Member of the United \nNations, respectful of a democratic and pluralist law based on solidarity, is \ntoday taking part in this Assembly in the same spirit as always determined \nto cooperate in building a world governed by the law of nations, just and \npeace-loving, with a universal international Organization capable of ensuring \ndevelopment and human rights while effectively and actively guaranteeing peace \nand security. \n"

        "file_text": "The delegation of the Republic of Suriname \ncongratulates you most warmly. Sir, upon your election to the presidency of \nthe forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. You bring to that high \npost a wealth of experience and dedication, qualities that augur well for a \nsuccessful accomplishment of the task before us. \nAllow us to thank your predecessor. His Excellency Mr. Samir Shihabi, for \nthe excellent manner in which he guided the forty-sixth session of the General \nAssembly. We wish him well in his future endeavours. \nWe should like to welcome and congratulate the Secretary-General of the \nUnited Nations on his assumption of that lofty and equally responsible \noffice. He has assumed the leadership of the Organization at a very difficult \nand crucial time marked by many political changes, a time at which greater \ninvolvement of the Organization in international affairs is demanded. We wish \nthe Secretary-General well and assure him of our fullest cooperation. \nI take this opportunity to welcome into the United Nations the newly \nindependent States of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Moldova, \nTajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Georgia. I should also like to \nwelcome San Marino, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Slovenia. \nAs reported to the General Assembly on previous occasions, for many years \nSuriname experienced a domestic armed struggle that brought sorrow and \nmourning to our people and restricted our possibilities for development. We \nnow wish to inform the Assembly that, through patient negotiations, our \n\nefforts have resulted in a recently signed agreement for national \nreconciliation and development. \nFrom the very beginning, my Government has attached the highest priority \nto achieving reconciliation in the country, for my Government wishes to \nrealize the full potential of the Surinamese people in harmony with their \naspirations for lasting democratic stability. Negotiations were started as \npart of our conviction that peace should gradually be forged, based on a \npolitical understanding of the various forces involved. Moreover, peace can \nonly be reached if negotiations are promoted and conducted in order to yield \nlasting results for the benefit of our people. \nWe called in the assistance of the Organization of American States, \nwhich, under the auspices of its Secretary-General, \nMr. Joao Clemente Baena Soares, provided support in the process of concluding \nthe agreement and in demobilization. Together with his worthy representative, \nwe have succeeded. Concrete results have been achieved, followed by the \nsigning of a substantial agreement based on the crucial need for \nreconstruction and development and which guarantees respect for human rights. \nToday, we rejoice that reconciliation in Suriname is concrete and \nfeasible. It has strengthened our determination to achieve national harmony \nand national development. We are confident that the Organization of American \nStates will render its valuable support in verifying compliance with the \nagreement, so as to ensure that the established peace-agreement will be \nobserved. \n \nAs this body has been informed, in 1991 democracy was restored in my \ncountry, true to the will of the people. Yet, we must not lose sight of the \nfact that newly restored democracies such as ours are fragile, and depend to a \nconsiderable extent on international understanding and support. \nMy Government has since then made progress in establishing a degree of \nmuch-needed political stability, and can now concentrate on finding solutions \nto the current grave economic crisis, and the potential social crisis, \nconfronting my country. Our socio-economic problems, which have resulted in a \nsharp decline in production, increased unemployment, sharp price increases and \na deteriorating standard of living for the majority of the population, have \nnow compelled us to take serious corrective measures to halt the economic \ndecline and boost economic growth. Experiences throughout the world show that \nno government can successfully carry out a programme for economic \nreconstruction and development without the fullest national and international \nsupport. \nMy Government has decided to implement a programme for adjustment, \nrecovery and growth. In this context, we have secured valuable support from \nthe European Community. Furthermore, we can report to this Assembly that \ndevelopment cooperation with the Netherlands has been re-established, and that \nthe signing of the framework treaty for friendship and closer cooperation has \nadded a new dimension to bilateral relations between the Kingdom of the \nNetherlands and the Republic of Suriname. Thus, we are encouraged because our \nnational development strategy has found a ready response from the \ninternational community in this crucial aspect of our democratic process. \n \nI can assure this Assembly, and with some emphasis, that in implementing \nthe adjustment programme our view is that a well-balanced and consistent \napproach to the social dimensions of the programme is indispensable to its \nfinal outcome. \nIn the past few years, forces of change have transformed the \ninternational political arena and profoundly changed the major balance of \npower that emerged from the Second World War. Antagonisms and hostility \nbetween the super-Powers have been replaced by unprecedented joint efforts and \npartnership. This has facilitated, through dialogue and by peaceful means, \nthe solution of a number of regional conflicts and the settlement of others. \nWe believe that the new political climate has had constructive effects in the \nworld, and has enabled us to define a broader and more fully integrated role \nin international security. \nThe international community is experiencing a rebirth of the United \nNations after 45 years of existence, for the fullest use is being made of its \npeacemaking and peace-keeping potential in order to bring about just and \nlasting peace in several parts of the world. As a result of the new mandate \nof this reinvigorated Organization, our hopes are being justified that it will \nnot be long before the unfolding dramas of human suffering, exploitation, \npoverty, fratricide, hunger and malnutrition, and aggressive nationalism will \nfinally be banished from the planet. \nOur Organization is facing the challenge and responsibility of bringing \nabout an overall and lasting settlement of various problems on the basis of \nrespect for the rights of all. It must encourage States to adhere to the \nCharter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant \ninstruments as the best means of protecting and promoting human rights. \n\nWe support a just and lasting settlement in Central and Eastern Europe: \nwe are concerned about the growing tensions and conflicts in that region, \nwhich endanger international peace and security. We are keeping close track \nof developments in former Yugoslavia, and take this opportunity to welcome the \nefforts of our Organization, the London Conference and the Non-Aligned \nMovement summit. \nA just and lasting settlement is necessary on the African continent, we \nare deeply concerned by the threat from the growing instability in the Horn of \nAfrica caused by the conflict in Somalia. We express regret that, despite the \nsigning of a cease-fire agreement, the parties involved have not abided by \ntheir commitments and have thus not permitted the unimpeded distribution of \n\nhumanitarian assistance to those in need. In this respect, my delegation has \nendorsed the proposal to convene a conference on the national reconciliation, \nreconstruction and unity of Somalia which should lead to a peaceful and \nlasting political settlement of the conflict. \nMy delegation strongly condemns the tragic escalation of violence in \nSouth Africa, which has halted the negotiating process within the framework of \nthe Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA). We strongly urge the \nSouth African regime to create a climate that is conducive to peaceful \nnegotiations aimed at an agreement on the text of a new constitution based on \na non-racial, democratic and united South Africa. \nAn overall and lasting settlement is needed for the Arab-Israeli conflict \nand the Palestine issue. My Government firmly supports the ongoing peace \nprocess, which is aimed at reaching a just, comprehensive and durable solution \nto the question of the Middle East. \n\nWe welcome the progress made in reaching overall settlements of the \nconflicts in Asia, particularly in Cambodia and Afghanistan. The \nestablishment of the transitional Government in Afghanistan is a positive \ndevelopment towards peace, national reconciliation and reconstruction in that \ncountry. \nWe support the efforts of the Secretary-General to reach an agreement on \na set of fundamental principles with a view to reaching an overall agreement \non the question of Cyprus. With regard to Latin America and the Caribbean, we \nare pleased to note that the processes of democratization, harmonization, \nreconciliation and economic integration are gradually bearing fruit. \nThe agreements between the Government of El Salvador and the Farabundo \nMarti National Liberation Front mark the closing of a decade of fratricidal \nwar. They will undoubtedly contribute to lasting peace and stability, which \nare imperative for the region's development. \nWe express full support for the struggle of the people of Haiti to \nrestore democracy and respect for human rights in their country, and for the \nefforts of the Organization of American States towards this end. \n\nAs we advance in the decade of the '90s, the economic and social problems \nof developing countries continue to be manifold. Difficult decisions will \ntherefore be needed to address the issue of international economic adjustment \nand development in order to eliminate the imbalances between the North and the \nSouth. \nThe worsening of the economic situation and social conditions in many \ndeveloping countries has led to a decline in the standard of living and to the \npersistence and increase of widespread poverty. The elimination of hunger and \nmalnutrition, the improvement of health standards and the eradication of \nilliteracy should be issues of paramount concern in the coming decades. My \ndelegation therefore holds the view that these aims can best be achieved by \nputting into motion a people-centered development process. \nIt is in this context that my delegation warmly supports the convening of \na Summit for Social Development in order to enable the international community \nto deal extensively with the complex but most important question of human \ndevelopment. \nThough no substantive commitment to new funds was made during the \nrecently held Rio Conference on Environment and Development, it should be \nnoted as an important achievement of the international community that a \nprogramme of action. Agenda 21, and the Rio Declaration have been adopted. \nThe Rio Conference has clearly established the close link between environment, \ngrowth and development, the primary issues for the international community. \nIt is as a consequence of the results of the Rio summit that during the \ncurrent General Assembly special attention must be paid to institutional \nfollow-up of the Rio Conference. In this regard, we attach great importance \nto the establishment of the Commission on Sustainable Development. This \n \nCommission must of necessity become the primary and most important forum for \nconsultation and must set the trend for measures to implement Agenda 21 at \nnational, regional and global levels. \nOnce again I should like to emphasize that in the new international \nenvironment the role and function of the United Nations has become universally \naccepted. We have witnessed an increased interest in multilateralism and a \nrenewal of the relevance of the United Nations and its main bodies. The \npeacemaking and peace-keeping activities of this world Organization in many \nregions have, more than at any time in the past, opened prospects for its \ngreatly enhanced role in the maintenance of world peace and security. These \nactivities have proved to be effective procedures, well-suited to present-day \nrealities. \nThe opportunities offered by the Charter in the fields of preventive \ndiplomacy, fact-finding and good-offices missions should be optimally \nexplored, so as to provide the Secretary-General with a suitable structure for \nthe prevention and timely management of crises and conflicts. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow \nme first to convey to you, Mr. President, the heartfelt congratulations of the \nRepublic of Moldova on your election and to wish you every success in \nperforming your important duties. \nI should also like to take this opportunity to express once again my \ngratitude and my country's gratitude to the participants in this forum. It \nwas thanks to their support that the Republic of Moldova, more than six months \nago, became a member of the great family of the United Nations and is now \nable, in that new capacity, to add its efforts to those of other States in \npromoting the noble values and ideals of the Charter of the United Nations. \nI believe that this lofty rostrum of the United Nations General Assembly \nis the best place to analyse, even if briefly, the processes and \ntransformations we are witnessing today and to discuss our common problems. \nBeyond doubt, our civilization is undergoing profound and dynamic \nchanges, and for that reason it is acquiring a new quality, a different \ncontent. The collapse of communism, the end of the cold war and the fall of \nthe Soviet empire, followed by the appearance of many new independent States, \nwhose peoples cherish freedom and democracy, are all changes of great \nimportance for the future of mankind. \nAt the same time, we are witnessing a constant deterioration of some \nglobal problems, such as the appearance of new regional conflicts which \nthreaten the internal stability of those States and which also affect \ninternational security. It is clear that those problems and the solutions to \n\nthem require the concerted efforts of the entire international community. \nAccordingly, the United Nations, the most representative international body, \nhas an essential role to play as a universal centre for our collective action. \nRegarding the revitalization of the United Nations and its restructuring \nto reflect recent events, I believe that as the guarantor of international \npeace and stability, the United Nations should expand its efforts for peace by \nimproving its peace-keeping machinery, by stepping up its activities in the \nfield of preventive diplomacy and by working out new, more effective machinery \nto coordinate actions aimed at enhancing respect for the norms of \ninternational law and ensuring the security and interests of small States such \nas my own country. \nI am convinced that today, more than ever before the United Nations is \ncapable of resolving the problems confronting the world community. It is \nthrough such action that the great principles of the Charter which during \nthe time of the cold war remained merely ideals can be effectively \nimplemented and respected. \nThe United Nations, which in earlier days was a forum for ideological \npolemics, is now becoming a body for international cooperation, a highly \nauthoritative body inspired by a profound constructive spirit. We are fully \nconvinced that the admission of new States to the United Nations family means \na mutual responsibility for them and for the United Nations. \n\nThe events that led to the incorporation of the Baltic countries \nEstonia, Latvia and Lithuania following the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact are well \nknown. Following that treaty, which had been imposed by force and has since \nbeen declared null and void by the parliament of the former USSR, the \nterritory of my country was annexed and subjected to forced assimilation aimed \nat making us forget our Latin origins and become part of \\\"the Soviet people\\\". \nThe proclamation of our Republic's independence and sovereignty and its \nadmission to membership in this world Organization opened the way to our \nfreedom with due regard, of course, for the strict observance of the norms \nand principles of law accepted in international practice. It is in that \ncontext that I wish to state that our goal is to advance towards a model of \nsocial organization in our Republic which will match the high standards \ndeveloped by mankind in the socio-economic, juridical, political, spiritual \nand other fields. \nThe year 1991 marked the beginning of the existence of independent States \nwith different socio-political and economic systems in the territory of the \nformer USSR. Each of them is seeking ways and means to build a State based on \nlaw and the institutions and machinery appropriate for a market economy. \nWe believe that the international community's support should be conceived \nand adapted to suit the actual conditions existing in each newly independent \ncountry. For that reason, with a view to supporting the specific reforms for \nthe transitional period, the efforts of the United Nations and of its \nspecialized agencies will achieve positive results only if they are \ncoordinated with the socio-economic programmes devised and promoted by those \ncountries. The recent admission of the Republic of Moldova to the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank guarantees the success of the \n\nreforms and also gives substantial support to our young State, which is firmly \ncommitted to a process of democratic development. \nHowever, the conflict unleashed in the eastern parts of Moldova is a major \nobstacle to the promotion of our economic reforms and to the democracy to \nwhich we are committed. \nThe pro-communist imperialistic forces constituted by the representatives \nof the old \\\"nomenklatura\\\" the military-industrial complex and the higher \nechelons of the former Soviet army have unleashed a full-fledged war against \nthe territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova in order to separate its \ndistricts situated on the left bank of the Dniester. \nAt the same time the creation of guards' units, which also include \nmercenaries from other States, and the involvement in the conflict of the \nFourteenth Army, which is under the jurisdiction of the Government of the \nRussian Federation, are flagrant violations of the Constitution of the \nRepublic of Moldova and of the norms of international law, constituting open \naggression against our young State. \nWe believe that this conflict can be resolved at the regional level, but \nthere must also be active participation by the United Nations. \nI should also like to take this opportunity to thank Secretary-General \nBoutros Boutros-Ghali for his efforts to end the conflict. Following his \ninitiative, a United Nations mission paid two visits to my country in the last \nthree months to investigate the situation. \nOn 21 July 1992, motivated by a sincere desire to put an end to the \nhostilities, the President of my country signed with the President of the \nRussian Federation the Agreement on principles for a peaceful settlement of \nthe armed conflict in those districts of the Republic of Moldova which were \n\ninvolved. The Agreement had some positive effects: there was a cease-fire, \nas well as a disengagement of the armed forces involved in the conflict. \nSimilarly, because of the presence of peace-keeping forces, human lives have \nbeen spared. Nevertheless, the situation is still tense. The imperialistic \nseparatist and pro-communist forces do not comply with their obligations to \nthe letter. They are continuing to consolidate their own positions so that \nthe dismemberment of the trans-Dniester territories of the Republic of Moldova \nhas now become a fait accompli. \nThe constitutionally established juridical and administrative organs of \nthe Republic of Moldova in that area have been forced to leave their \npremises. Parallel with this, organs of the so-called Moldavi Republic of the \nDniester have been set up. In that area, there are frequent violations of \nhuman rights. The Moldovan population, in particular the representatives of \nthe local authorities as well as veterans, has been the victim of an extensive \ncampaign of psychological and physical persecution. People who do not support \nthe separatist policy are dismissed and many displaced persons who have \nreturned to their homes have found them occupied by mercenaries. \nNotwithstanding the provisions of the Agreement, former guards are \nincluded in the peace-keeping forces, and this has led to acts of violence \nagainst civilians. People living in the eastern districts of the Republic \nstill possess a large quantity of weapons. \nFor the reasons I have described, I emphasize that there is a need for \nthe permanent presence of a group of United Nations observers and also of some \nhuman-rights experts in the Republic of Moldova to analyse the situation on \nthe scene. \nFrom an analysis of the causes and development of the conflict, we can \nconclude that one of the factors that have contributed and still contribute to \n \nthe destabilization of the situation is the presence of foreign military \nforces in our territory. We must state with regret that the Moldovan-Russian \nnegotiations concerning the withdrawal of the Fourteenth Army on the terms set \nfor that withdrawal have been hampered by the representatives of the Russian \nFederation, who are equivocating about the negotiations and consequently about \nthe withdrawal of that army of occupation. \n\nFurthermore, assertions to the effect that the Fourteenth Army can act as \na guarantor of peace are not justified. It is an army of occupation, which, \nas recent events have shown, is a permanent source of tension and conflict, \nand the deployment of so-called peace-keeping forces belies its supposed \nstatus of peace guarantor. The technical reasons that have been adduced are \nlikewise inexplicable. If the political will exists, the 4,000 or so military \npersonnel can easily be withdrawn. \nFor the resolution of this matter, we expect much from the democratic \nforces of Russia, which could demonstrate that country's devotion to \ndemocratic values. In the present extremely complex situation it would be \nvery useful to have the support of the United Nations with a view to securing \nguaranteed political cooperation and a demonstration of genuine political will \non the part of those involved, particularly Russia. \nWe are convinced that the universal prestige of the United Nations and \nyour support would make possible the unconditional and immediate withdrawal of \nthe Fourteenth Army and an easing of the conflict before it degenerates into a \nconflagration with unforeseeable consequences. Accordingly, I welcome the \nfact that one item of the agenda of the current session of the General \nAssembly is an amendment, submitted by the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and \nLithuania, on the complete withdrawal of foreign military forces from the \nterritory of the Baltic States. However, I hope that that problem which, as \nI have already pointed out, is of great importance to my country will be \ndiscussed as part of a wider debate which also deals with the withdrawal of \nthe foreign armed forces now in my country's territory. \nThe Government and Parliament of the Republic of Moldova are aware of the \nfact that orienting domestic legislation towards international standards in \n\nthe field of human rights is the only effective means of consolidating the \ndemocratic process. The country I represent has acceded to the main \ninternational instruments on human rights. The supreme legislative forum of \nour Republic will soon complete its preparation of the new constitution, and \nthat will greatly enhance the process of building a State based on law and a \npluralistic democracy. \nPeace and cooperation are the two main pillars of the foreign policy of \nthe Republic of Moldova. Accordingly, security problems in my country are \nvery important. Geopolitically, Moldova is a meeting-point between eastern \nand western Europe. For that reason, we seek to establish friendly, \ncooperative relations with all States, without belonging to any military bloc. \nI should like to take this opportunity to convey cordial congratulations \nto Georgia, to Slovenia, to Croatia and to Bosnia and Herzegovina on becoming \nMembers of the United Nations. \nWe are convinced that only human solidarity can promote democracy \nthroughout the world, put an end to conflicts and stop the violations of \ninternationally accepted norms of behaviour. The Republic of Moldova is \ndeeply devoted to the ideals of freedom, democracy and human dignity, which \nare the main tenets of its policy. \n"

        "file_text": "I shall read out the following statement\non behalf of the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Afghanistan.\n\\\"Allow me to express my warmest congratulations on your election as President of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I am fully confident that the work of the Assembly will yield fruitful, indeed radiant, results under your wise guidance, and with the endeavors of the Secretary-General.\n\\\"It is a source of pleasure for the delegation of the Islamic State of Afghanistan to see the new Bulgaria, having renounced communism, taking its place in the international community with new principles and values in line with the true aspirations of the Bulgarian people.\n\u201cThe wise and effective stewardship of your predecessor.\nAmbassador Samir Shihabi, will always be remembered by those who participated in the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. He were glad to see a record of such high quality placed at the disposal of the General Assembly by a skillful diplomat who represented the brotherly country of Saudi Arabia.\n\\\"The universality of this Organization has been further strengthened this year by the admission of 13 new Members. He welcome them to this world family and assure them of our cooperation in the realization of the purposes of this Organization.\n\\\"It is the grace of Almighty Allah that gives me the great honor of conveying this message to the General Assembly for the first time since the establishment of an Islamic State in Afghanistan.\u2003\n\\\"The forty-seventh session of the General Assembly is convened in conditions where the remnants of the cold war and a polarized world are melting, where colonial structures are falling apart and where a new and just order is being forged on our planet.\n\\\"The 14-year resistance of the heroic Afghan mujahideen, of the liberation movements of nations under tyranny, and of reform movements in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, coupled with the unjust and unrealistic nature of communism and totalitarianism, contributed to the collapse of those systems and consequently to smashing the myth of world-power polarization. This weakened the concept of military pacts and to some extent changed the political map of the world. The years of cold war came to an end and the hope of a new and fair world order emerged. Such positive developments and their subsequent outcomes have given shape to new horizons for the world order, and also to the role of the United Nations in world affairs.\n\\\"For my delegation, the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly session has two significant features. First, the representatives of the Afghan nation are taking their seat once again in this Organization and, secondly, we are participating in this session with the expectation that the United Nations and other international organizations, as well as international financial institutions and Member States will continue to extend their assistance to the second phase of our struggle:\tthe\teconomic reconstruction and social rehabilitation of\nour country.\n\\\"I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to express, on behalf of the people and the Islamic State of Afghanistan, my profound appreciation to all those Member States that firmly stood by our side in condemning the aggression of the former Soviet Union and supported the righteous struggle of the Afghan people for the restoration of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of Afghanistan, and its non-aligned and Islamic character. Their dynamic political and generous humanitarian support has been a source of encouragement during the entire years of our struggle, in which we have never felt alone, believing that God Almighty and righteousness were on our side.\n\\\"In this respect, our special heartfelt thanks and gratitude is extended to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Arab Republic of Egypt. We will always remember the strong political and generous humanitarian assistance of the United States of America, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, Western European countries and Japan.\n\\\"We thank the Secretary-General of the United Nations, his Special Representative and the Office of the Coordinator for United Nations Humanitarian and Economic Assistance programs Relating to Afghanistan (UNOCA) for playing a conciliatory role for bringing peace to Afghanistan, as well as channeling assistance to our people.\n\\\"We would expect that this Organization may continue to assist Afghanistan in the realization of the noble aspirations of our people.\n\\\"Speaking for the first time after the establishment of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, I deem it necessary to make a brief reference to a matter that concerns the circumstances that culminated in the collapse of the previous regime and the establishment of an Islamic State in the country.\n\\\"The understanding reached between the leaders and commanders of Jihad with the regular and irregular forces of the previous Government in the country contributed to a smooth and peaceful transition of power from that Government to the newly established Islamic Government of Afghanistan on 28 April 1992, avoiding, perhaps, a blood-bath in the capital.\n\\\"Based upon the high objective of avoiding further loss of life and bloodshed, the newly established Islamic State has tried to solve existing political problems, which are the legacy of the 14 years of war and destruction in the country, through peaceful means of dialog, negotiations, tolerance and understanding, thus preparing the ground for holding free and fair elections as a viable procedure of guaranteeing democracy and social justice.\n\\\"It should be obvious that holding a general election in a country requires, first and foremost, an atmosphere of complete peace and security. Unfortunately, the recent irresponsible non-stop three-week rocket attacks on Kabul resulted in the tragic loss of some 2,400 innocent people, as well as 9,000 injuries. These senseless attacks have also seriously disturbed the speedy and final resolution of the present political problems. This situation, as well as the ongoing program of repatriation of refugees and that of the resettlement of displaced people, as well as the lack of adequate security and financial resources, and facilities that are essential requirements for holding a general election, brought the Government to the point of taking a preliminary step, which would prepare the ground for the holding of a free and fair election. This first step is the convening of a traditional Loya Kirgah\\\"\na Grand Council, a Council of Representatives:\tin\tother words, a\nShura-i-Ahli-Hal-wa-Aqd, a term used for the same gathering, in Arabic \\\"comprising the representatives of the people of Afghanistan. This assembly is to be held at the earliest convenience, probably within the next two months. \n\\\"During the past month, some assemblies have been convened in different parts of Afghanistan to deliberate on the present political situation in the country. On 8 September 1992, an assembly consisting of 2,500 Jihad commanders, heads of tribes, ulama\\\" religious scholars \\\"and influential Afghan personalities representing 16 of the 29 provinces of Afghanistan was held in the city of Ghazni, somewhere near Central Afghanistan. After discussing various issues pertaining to security conditions, the political situation and basic needs in the provinces, and especially in Kabul, the assembly made a request to the Government to call a Loya Jirgah, which would be the best and shortest path for resolving the present crisis. Their deliberations call for convening, by the end of October, a Shoura, that is, a Jirgah or a Council, of all segments of Afghan society, including Afghan refugees living abroad.\n\\\"On 12 September 1992, another assembly was convened, in the city of Kandahar. In this gathering. Jihad commanders and heads of several tribes of southern and southwestern Afghanistan called for the convening of a Loya Jirgah. It is noteworthy that the participants in this assembly, among other things, requested the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations jointly to supervise the convening of such a grand assembly.\n\\\"In addition to the above-mentioned assemblies, there have been a number of other gatherings throughout Afghanistan that have asked the Islamic State to convene a Loya Jirgah as the only authoritative platform to decide on the political future of the country.\n\\\"The position of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, which reflects the righteous demands and suggestions of the valiant people of Afghanistan, obligates it to ensure that all ways and means and are utilized in seeing that this wish of the nation, echoed through the convening of various assemblies, is heeded.\n\\\"The safeguarding of the unity, sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Afghanistan could only be ensured if the will of the nation, which is the source of sovereignty, is expressed. Such aspirations, under prevailing conditions, could be reflected through the convening of a Loya Jirgah, which in the absence of the possibilities of holding elections is the only authoritative and inclusive body to determine the political destiny of the country.\n\\\"The Islamic State of Afghanistan is exerting every effort to bring about appropriate safeguards and guarantees for facilitating the speedy transition of power to an elected government through Loya Jirgah.\nHowever, for the purpose of ensuring appropriate safeguards and guarantees, the Islamic State of Afghanistan, if necessary, may request the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to supervise the proceedings of such an assembly.\n\\\"Our struggle has been victorious because of the 14 years of continuous, valiant and dedicated sacrifices made by our Muslim nation against a super-Power and its supporters. This victory is a brilliant milestone and turning-point in our history. But the price of victory has been very high.\n\\\"To portray the extent of death and destruction in Afghanistan, it is perhaps sufficient to quote the first paragraph of the 'Consolidated Appeal by the Secretary-General of the United Nations for Emergency Humanitarian Assistance for Afghanistan', which says:\t'Few countries in\nhistory have suffered to the extent Afghanistan has over the past 14 years. Aside from the physical destruction, which was often nothing short of cataclysmic, the results of the war include over 1 million people killed, over 2 million disabled, nearly 6 million refugees in neighboring countries and 2 million internally displaced persons'.\n\\\"The total destruction of most of the villages and towns has been estimated at 200.000 hectares of forest. 8.000 water arteries. 6 million cattle.114 medical centers. 2.700 kilometers of main roads and more than 2,000 school buildings. Almost all our power stations and communications systems have been either totally destroyed or very badly damaged. The real estimate of losses is to be reckoned. There are about 10 million mines implanted by the Soviet occupying forces all over Afghanistan. Perhaps the coming Afghan generations may not be able to walk without fear on their own soil. And this is the saddest part of it.\n\\\"The completion of the repatriation program is directly related to de-mining. According to United Nations reports, in recent months there have been many returnees who were killed or injured by the mines. Medical clinics in the border town of Peshawar in Pakistan are overcrowded with the mine-affected returnees. In this respect, we call upon the international community to respond positively to the appeal of the Secretary-General in supporting financially the related projects of\nthe United Nations.\n\\\"While the international community is celebrating the end of the Decade of Disabled Persons, there are 2 million people who fall into the same category in my country, and their destitute and meager existence deserves special attention.\n\\\"Our problems are so great that we, with our limited capabilities, cannot address the critical needs of disabled persons. The Islamic State of Afghanistan, with its war-shattered economy as one element affecting its rehabilitation programs, has prioritized the construction of new hospitals and clinics which need to be financed by international assistance programs.\n\\\"The efforts of this Organization in adopting principles for the purpose of ensuring the implementation of measures and a monitoring system for the rights of disabled persons is commendable. However, the problem in my country is of a different nature. We have to create appropriate national machinery to support almost 2 million disabled persons, victims of armed conflict. Without appropriate international assistance, that objective cannot be achieved.\n\\\"As for the orphans of war, if we estimate that each Afghan killed in the 14 years of war had one child, there are 1.5 million orphans in Afghanistan. Because of that great number, the Islamic State of Afghanistan is in critical need of international assistance for the rehabilitation of orphans of war.\n\\\"In appreciation of the severity of the problems of orphans of war and armed conflicts and their deserving of particular international attention, my delegation proposes the establishment of a special fund in the framework of the United Rations Children's Fund (UNICEF) for the rehabilitation of orphans as a result of armed conflicts, wherever they are and to whatever country they belong. In this regard, it may also be appropriate to declare the year 1994 the international year of the orphan.\n\\\"There can be no political stability in any country without economic viability. The Islamic State of Afghanistan has inherited a country that is physically devastated, psychologically battered, economically depleted, and politically and socially tormented; the population is in dire need of moral and material support. The Islamic State was established as a result of immeasurable sacrifices and the great suffering that the Afghan nation has endured for the sake of its freedom and its conviction to its faith. Our people's struggle has had international significance in general and has had wide-ranging impact on the promotion of freedom and the emergence of new States. Without a sound economy, the peace that has been achieved at such a terrible cost cannot be guaranteed, and instability in Afghanistan is sure to affect the region.\n\\\"The war has destroyed the economic infrastructure of Afghanistan. Rebuilding the country's economic structure is crucial for the future existence of Afghanistan as a productive and self-supporting member of the world community. Comprehensive and methodical economic programs, with the assistance of friendly countries and the United Nations, will ensure the reconstruction process, a solid foundation upon which future economic progress can be built.\n\\\"At the. moment, however, the issue of emergency humanitarian relief efforts takes priority because of the obvious food shortages, lack of clean water and electricity and inadequate medical care, which are threatening the survival of the nation as a whole and the capital in particular. Unfortunately/ the Islamic State of Afghanistan has not received adequate support from the international community in this regard.\n\\\"The United Nations Special Representative on Afghanistan recently expressed dismay at the lack of enthusiasm on the part of the international community in responding urgently to meet the $180 million target of assistance proposed by Bis Excellency the Secretary-General of the United Nations in his appeal of 5 June 1992. So far, almost $40.5 million has been received in response to that appeal. The positive response of some countries is greatly appreciated by the Islamic State of Afghanistan.\n\u201cAside from the human calamities, in the first week of September of this year a natural disaster hit Gulbahar and other neighboring towns of Parwan Province of Afghanistan. That flood was of a severity unmatched for many decades. According to reliable reports, about 3,000 people were killed, and hundreds of houses were totally demolished. It is astonishing that international authorities have not addressed their attention to that large-scale calamity. He are requesting the international community to provide emergency humanitarian assistance for the flood victims and their families.\n\u201cThe Islamic State of Afghanistan wishes to solicit the support of United Nations Member States in ensuring due consideration of item 141 of the agenda of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly, entitled 'Emergency international assistance for the reconstruction of war-stricken Afghanistan'- It is our sincere and earnest hope that Member States will consider extending their full support to the two separate draft resolutions that are to be submitted by the delegation of the Islamic State of Afghanistan on agenda item 141.\u2003\n\\\"The Islamic State of Afghanistan is of the opinion that, in spite of many positive changes in international relations, some of the main objectives of the United Nations, such as total disarmament - especially with respect to nuclear arms settlement of conflicts through peaceful means, the observance of human rights and the establishment of a new and just international economic order, have not been fully realized. Perhaps it would be more in line with the aim of realizing the purposes of this Organization for the positive new climate of international understanding to be utilized for the purpose of strengthening the role of the United Nations in bolstering the socio-economic advancement of the developing countries, especially the least developed ones. The willingness of the developed countries to ensure greater cooperation with the needy countries could contribute positively to the realization of this objective.\n\\\"The Islamic State of Afghanistan holds the conviction that the multidimensional problem of the environment already threatens the future of our world. At the recent summit of Heads of State or Government in Rio de Janeiro, this global problem was discussed extensively, and a credible document entitled Agenda 21 was adopted, providing a sound basis for solving global environmental issues.\n\\\"It is promising to see that dependence on ideology in the settlement of regional conflicts is vanishing and a tendency is emerging in favor of strengthening international cooperation for the settlement of existing conflicts.\n\\\"The Islamic State of Afghanistan will work for international peace in full cooperation with the United Nations and stand by and respect the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and all accepted norms of this world body. In the arena of international relations, the Islamic State of Afghanistan, as one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement, will continue to pursue an active non-aligned policy, free judgment on international issues, sincerely supporting the objectives of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, strengthening friendly ties with all countries on the basis of parity and mutual respect for independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's affairs. The Islamic State of Afghanistan pledges sincere adherence to all international agreements, stands against every form of colonialism and all racial ideas, supports the elimination of nuclear weapons and will help in erasing international and regional tensions.\n\\\"The Islamic State of Afghanistan welcomes the current negotiations between the concerned parties in the Middle East and hopes that they will result in the realization of the legitimate right of the people of Palestine to establish their own independent State. Without an immediate halt to Israeli settlement in the occupied territories, there can be no firm assurance that those negotiations will lead to permanent peace and stability in that region. Afghanistan, in conformity with the principle of the right to self-determination and in compliance with the resolution of the Islamic Conference of Istanbul, supports the rights of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and asks for an immediate halt to the massacre of the innocent population of that Republic. We denounce the heinous policy of 'ethnic cleansing', which, in spite of world-wide condemnation, is still taking place. Afghanistan, as one of the sponsors of draft resolution A/46/L.76 of the resumed forty-sixth session of the\u2003United Nations General Assembly on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, advocates decisive action, under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, aimed at ensuring the rights of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to self-defense and to the protection of their territorial integrity and sovereignty. \n\\\"While supporting the right of all people to self-determination, the delegation from the Islamic State of Afghanistan believes that the question of Kashmir should be settled through negotiations and dialog on the basis of the resolutions adopted by the United Nations.\n\\\"The Islamic State of Afghanistan, while desiring friendly relations with all countries, attributes special importance to its relations with the neighboring countries Pakistan and Iran, as well as with the fraternal country of Saudi Arabia.\n\\\"We have a sincere desire to maintain and strengthen our traditional friendship with the United States of America. Afghanistan seeks friendly relations with Japan and with Western European and other Far East countries.\n\\\"The Islamic State of Afghanistan aspires to positive and friendly relations with the new Muslim Republics of Central Asia and wishes to strengthen its commercial, economic and cultural ties with those republics.\n\\\"The Islamic State of Afghanistan also wishes for friendly relations with non-aligned India and hopes that India will cooperate with the people of Afghanistan in the needed areas.\n\\\"Our country desires close and friendly relations with the People's Republic of China and hopes that technical cooperation and trade with that neighbor will be expanded.\n\\\"Afghanistan wishes for the improvement of friendly relations with the Russian Federation and expects that the Russian Federation will participate fully in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Afghanistan. The Russian Federation, as the inheritor of the former Soviet Union, has the responsibility to compensate for the destruction caused by armed aggression of the former Soviet Union against Afghanistan.\n\\\"It is also necessary to express our concern for the suffering families of more than 30,000 Afghans still missing after the years of the former Soviet Union's aggression in our country. This tragedy has seriously affected the sentiments of all Afghans, and they expect that the Commonwealth of Independent States will address this issue urgently and seriously. Believing that a sincere desire based upon goodwill and mutual trust between the parties concerned could positively contribute to resolving this important humanitarian issue, the Islamic State of Afghanistan will try to use bilateral channels as a first step towards resolving this issue, unless circumstances require otherwise.\n\\\"In closing, I deem it necessary to point out that the United Nations, which plays an increasingly important role in the settlement of regional conflicts and world problems, should increasingly focus its activities on overcoming global problems and difficulties. As a Member of the United Nations, the Islamic State of Afghanistan is prepared to extend its full cooperation to the Organization in overcoming the world's existing difficulties and will spare no effort in implementing the resolutions and decisions of the present session.\n\\\"May Allah Glory Be Unto Him bestow ever greater successes to all participants of this current session of the Assembly.\\\"\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I am privileged to speak this morning on \nbehalf of the European Community and its 12 member States. It is a pleasure \nto do so under your guidance, Mr. President under the guidance of a fellow \nEuropean Foreign Minister whose country has made such great progress in recent \nyears and whose foreign affairs, under your leadership, have also made a very \nsubstantial step forward. \nIt is also a pleasure to speak in the presence of the Secretary-General. \nI do not wish to heap compliments upon you at this stage, \nMr. Secretary-General, but I hope that the contents of what I have to say and \nwhat we offer you in terms of support for your practical policies you will \naccept as an adequate compliment. \nAs my colleagues from other regions of the world have no doubt noticed, \nwe in the European Community are conducting a lively discussion on how to \nachieve the ever closer union to which we are all committed. I am not going \nto speak about that subject today because I want to speak about Europe and the \nwider world, but I do want to emphasize on behalf of us all that so far from \nturning away from that wider world, we in Europe are increasingly active in \nit. And I want to make it clear that the European Community and its member \nStates are determined to build up the place and the role of the Community and \nits 12 member States in world affairs. We intend to work together for the \nbetter world order in which we all believe and we intend to carry that work \nforward with greater impetus and greater effectiveness. \n\nTwo years ago, when I first came to speak at the Assembly, the world was \ncelebrating the end of the cold war, the beginnings of freedom. Everyone was \noptimistic, because everything had changed - it appeared for the better \nsince I had first attended a session of the General Assembly, at the height of \nthe cold war back in the 1950s. \nAt the end of 1992 we see things differently. The world after the cold \nwar is a better place, but it is also less stable. We have seen both a \ndemocratic spring and a demagogic spring, an outpouring of hope but also, in \nplaces, an outpouring of hate. \nInternational order is threatened in the short term by the unleashing of \nextreme nationalism, of challenges to the rule of law. In the medium term we \nhave to reinforce the system of collective security based on the United \nNations. Respect for good government, respect for human rights must move to \nthe centre of our stage. In the long term we face the threat to international \npeace and security posed by poverty, posed by environmental degradation. We \ncannot afford to postpone action on the longer-term problems while we wrestle \nwith the short-term problems. I should to look, very briefly, at each of \nthese three challenges in turn. \nThe short term the immediate. Nationalism, of course, is not a fault \nin itself; it is a natural instinct of man in society. We see its benign \nmanifestations in many places in the former Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, \nthough even there, there are problems. Yugoslavia is the worst example of the \nbitterness of nationalism producing intolerable results. That is why both \nEurope and the United Nations have to work strenuously for peace with justice, \nfor the relief of suffering in those tortured lands of the former Yugoslavia. \n\nSince last autumn the European Community and the United Nations have \nindeed been working closely, the United Nations leading on peace-keeping and \nthe European Community on peace making through Lord Carrington's Peace \nConference. This cooperation has helped stop the killing in, for example, the \nSerb Krajina in Croatia, where the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) \nand the European Community monitoring mission have achieved a good result. \nAs conflict escalated, particularly in Bosnia, the United Nations and the \nEuropean Community decided with wide international support to harness their \nefforts more closely together through the process launched by the London \nConference last month. The International Conference on the former Yugoslavia \nis now working in Geneva under the co-chairmanship of Mr. Cyrus Vance for the \nUnited Nations and Lord Owen for the European Community. It is powered by the \ndetermination of the international community to bring an end to the violence \nin the former Yugoslavia. \nThe Conference has two main objectives: humanitarian and political; to \nalleviate the suffering of the victims of the conflict and to bring that \nconflict permanently to an end by negotiating a political settlement. This \nis, of course, difficult work, requiring a deep understanding of the problems, \nrequiring the respect and cooperation of the parties, requiring the unstinting \nsupport and, when necessary, the mobilizing of pressures from the \ninternational community. \nIn this context, I believe that Prime Minister Panic's new approach shows \ngreat courage and I salute that courage. It offers a different way forward \nwhich we believe should be supported. But while the killing and suffering \ncontinue, as they did yesterday and as they do today, we cannot relax our \nefforts. We have to measure progress by deeds and not promises. \n\nWe have to continue to deal with other problems left by the rolling back \nof the cold war. In Cambodia, we must not let the peace process drift. The \nKhmer Rouge have not joined phase II of the cease-fire arrangements. They are \ndelaying the implementation of the comprehensive political settlement. On the \npositive side, the military deployment of the United Nations Transitional \nAuthority in Cambodia (UNTAC) is now fully complete and the civilian component \nis beginning to take control of the key ministries. We have to make every \neffort to hold to the timetable for elections next April. \nSome States still show a willingness to challenge the rule of \ninternational law and, indeed, to resort to terrorism. The invasion of Kuwait \nby Iraq was the first test of the post-cold-war era, and the liberation of \nKuwait was one of this Organization's great successes. Unfortunately, we have \nto note that Saddam Hussein continues to defy the United Nations, that his \nGovernment is failing to meet Iraq's obligations under Security Council \nresolution 687 (1991), that he continues to repress his own population, \nparticularly in northern and in southern Iraq. That is why pressure must \nand will - continue until he implements the resolutions of the United Nations \nin full. The message has to be that all States must comply with Security \nCouncil resolutions. We still wait for Libya to implement Security Council \nresolution 731 (1992). \nThose are just some of the short-term challenges that we have to meet. \nThere are long-running problems which we must not forget, and one of \nparticular concern to the European Community is Cyprus. This year, \nMr. Secretary-General, you have made an energetic effort. It is not yet \ndecisively successful. You are renewing the effort next month. There is a \n\nneed for fresh impetus, it seems to us, on the key issues of territory and \ndisplaced persons. There must be a willingness to negotiate on all sides; \notherwise there will be no lasting settlement. \n\nYou have our full support, Mr. Secretary-General, as you renew your \neffort. Not only does it deserve to succeed, but it is in the crucial \ninterest of Europe and the international community that it should succeed. \nIn the medium term we have to build a stronger system of collective \nsecurity. And here, everybody looks, rightly, to the United Nations. But as \nthe Secretary-General has pointed out, we are in danger of loading the \nOrganization with too heavy a burden: a burden of intervention and a burden, \nin effect, of partial administration. \n\\\"Something must be done.\\\" That phrase is on many lips; it is the impulse \nwhich we all feel as we read about or as we watch on television screens some \nfresh evidence of man's inhumanity to man. But we have to realize where that \nimpulse, that phrase \\\"Something must be done\\\", leads us. We should not wander \ndown that road without serious thought because it would involve a \nrestructuring of armed forces so that they could take a full part in the \ngrowing number of peace-making and peace-keeping exercises of the United \nNations. It would mean a massive increase in the funds which the United \nNations and its humanitarian agencies would require from Member States from \nus: from all of us in regular contributions and in aid, in times when many \nMember States face severe budgetary problems. These are just two of the \nimplications of the course on which the world is beginning to propel the \nUnited Nations because \\\"something must be done\\\". \nHow do we prevent these demands from getting out of hand? The best way, \nof course, is to prevent those conflicts which give rise to the demands - in \nshort, diplomacy: preventive diplomacy. I know that diplomacy is \nunfashionable in the world of the knee-jerk reaction and the dogmatic \nsound-bite on television. Diplomacy lacks news value; it lacks glamour; it \n\ninvolves compromise; it takes time; it is easy to mock. It just happens to be \nindispensable. \nThat is true, to take one example of many one could take, of conflicts in \nthe Middle East. There the parties have from time to time tried to cut the \nknot; they have tried to resolve their disputes by force, but in vain. This \nis a critical moment in the Arab-Israel peace process, which we in Europe \nstrongly support. We in the Community know that all concerned must seize this \nopportunity; the tide must be caught. The negotiation of a final settlement \nbased on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) will take time \nyet, will take hard work yet. What is important in the immediate future is \nfor all parties to work towards visible progress, building step on agreed step. \nDiplomacy is partly a matter of institutions and strengthening them. \nSpeaking as a European on behalf of Europeans, I hope that one day the \nConference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) will be effective in \nthe prevention of conflict throughout Europe. With the adoption of the \nHelsinki document the CSCE has begun to give itself the tools to tackle \nproblems by conciliation before they slide into violence, and to manage crises \nonce they develop. That document shows that the CSCE is a regional \narrangement according to Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. That \nmakes a crucial link between European and global security. \nBut of course the United Nations is the centre of this thinking, and \nreform of the United Nations is crucial to its performance. Early this year \nthe Secretary-General made a determined start on administrative reform. I \nbelieve that will turn out to be a decisive step. This is being followed up \nboth in the Secretariat and in the vast superstructure of intergovernmental \nbodies which have grown up over the past 40 years in the economic, social and \nother fields. \n\nWe welcome the work of the General Assembly to which I know that you \npersonally, Mr. President, are devoted to rationalize its agenda. All this \nis welcome; all this has to be carried forward. \nA summit of the Security Council met last January at the initiative of my \nPrime Minister to consider next steps. We asked the Secretary-General to \nprepare a report on the ways in which the United Nations could help tackle the \nnew challenges of which I have spoken. On 17 June, you, \nMr. Secretary-General, published your ideas on preventive diplomacy, \npeace-keeping, peace-making and what you called peace-building. This \ncollection of ideas is going to turn out to be a turning-point in the history \nof our Organization. You tried to address a need which is not some distance \nahead, but which is here and now. I believe you are in the extraordinary \nposition of someone who is being asked to manufacture a vehicle while he is \ndriving that vehicle on the road. It is not easy, but it is necessary. \nThe general debate should be a genuine debate on the ideas advanced in \nthe report. All United Nations bodies, notably the Security Council and the \nGeneral Assembly, should follow up swiftly in the light of the debate. \nPreventive diplomacy I have already mentioned. Obviously, it is \nquicker. It is more helpful to peoples about to be embroiled in conflict than \neven the most successful peace-keeping operation which comes after the \noutbreak of violence. It is also less costly in terms of lives and in terms \nof cash. The Secretary-General should be ready to make full use of his powers \nunder Article 99 of the Charter to draw the attention of the Security Council \nto any matter which in his opinion may threaten international peace and \nsecurity. Greater use is already being made of fact-finding missions; we \nwould like to encourage this trend. \n\nPreventive deployment of troops might take place to deter aggression or \nconflict between States, possibly involving deployment to only one side of an \ninternational border. Of course there may be difficulties about timing the \ndispatch of such a force in a given crisis, but we believe this is essentially \na sound idea that could be applied case by case. \nI warmly welcome what President Bush said yesterday on his initiatives to \nstrengthen the peace-keeping work of the United Nations. \nIn the European Community we want to follow up the idea of preventive \ndeployment in the event of an internal crisis, where the Government concerned \nrequests help, with humanitarian assistance or conciliation. No two cases \nwould be the same. There would need to be careful discussions with \nGovernments and the parties concerned before the international community could \nusefully deploy monitors. \nRecognizing that, the European Community and its member States have \nalready decided in principle to send civilian monitoring missions to States \nwhich want them where this could avert a crisis and possible bloodshed. In \nSouth Africa, for example, with the agreement of all the parties, established \nduring a recent visit of the troika, the United Nations will be joined by the \nEuropean Community and by the Commonwealth in sending observers to reinforce \nthe national peace accords there. \nOf course, part of this prevention of conflict must involve prevention of \nthe proliferation of armaments, especially weapons of mass destruction. We \nwelcome the agreement on a global convention on chemical weapons. This is a \nstep towards a safer and more secure world. \n\nWe recognize that peace-making brings pain to some. Bringing pressure -\neven peaceful pressure, say, of sanctions on warring parties, means \nsacrifice for innocent third parties. We understand the economic difficulties \noften caused to third parties by the imposition of sanctions under \nChapter VII. Countries which need balance-of-payments help, countries which \nmay also at the same time be carrying out prudent adjustment programmes, can \nbe badly affected. The international financial organizations are in the best \nposition to assess and then take into account the effects of United Nations \nmandatory sanctions when the;_' design support packages for the countries \nconcerned. \n\nThe Secretary-General's report contains a number of proposals for Member \nStates to earmark forces for enforcement action and for peace-keeping. All 12 \nStates members of the European Community have responded to his questionnaire \non this and all Members of the United Nations should, we believe, keep it \nunder regular review. \nThen there is money, financial contributions. The Secretary-General \nrightly, continuously underlines the importance of financial as well as \nmilitary contributions to peace-keeping. The figures speak for themselves. \nThe 12 States members of the European Community are supposed, under the rules, \nto contribute one third of the cost of peace-keeping operations financed \nthrough assessed contributions. At the end of August we, the Twelve, had in \nfact given not 33 per cent but over 40 per cent of total contributions \nactually collected so far for the various new operations launched or expanded \nsince the end of the last session of the General Assembly. Those European \nCommunity member States, of which mine is one, joining in the new operation in \nBosnia, will bear all their own costs. We believe we are doing our bit so far \nas this is concerned in Europe, and look to others to do the same. The \nSecretary-General is quite right: the financial problems of the United \nNations must not be allowed to slide, must not be allowed to fester. We \nsupport the proposed peace-keeping reserve fund, subject to negotiation on the \ndetail, and we believe the General Assembly must follow this up. \nThe role of the United Nations does not stop once a conflict is over. \nThat is why the Secretary-General's study entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" \nrightly looks at how we can build peace after a conflict. Take El Salvador, \nan illustration that has already been used by His Excellency the President of \nthe Republic of Korea. The promotion of free elections and democratic \n\ninstitutions is a key part of such peace-building, and so, to take a very \ndifferent example, is de-mining. Is it not a sad commentary on the state of \nthe world that the removal of mines in the aftermath of conflict has to be \nhigh on our agenda, whether in Cambodia, northern Somalia or Angola? \nBut we of the European Community welcome the emphasis the \nSecretary-General gives to human rights, democracy and development. Perhaps \nduring the cold war some of us tended to concentrate exclusively, or almost \nexclusively, on abuses of human rights in the Soviet bloc. Elsewhere there \nwas lip-service when there should have been action. But all people are \nentitled to full human rights. We want the World Conference on Human Rights \nat Vienna in June 1993 to take real steps in that direction. \nWe warmly welcome as part of that effort what we see as the tide of \npolitical reform now flowing in the continent of Africa. We are helping to \npromote good government and sound human rights and electoral practices. Both \nat the national and the Community level, we have already shown that we are \nready to meet requests for help in election monitoring, notably in Ethiopia, \nthe Congo and, later this year, in Kenya and Ghana, and also in the \ninter-parliamentary work going on in Namibia. \nBut of course in the longer term collective security can be undermined by \ndeeper economic and social forces, such as poverty and environmental \ndegradation. Relief must be followed by recovery or else the countries \nafflicted will be overwhelmed by despair. Is that not what we see in \nSomalia? This appalling tragedy is a warning of what could happen elsewhere, \nof what could become widespread, because Somalia is just the most extreme form \nof a problem now affecting large parts of sub-Saharan Africa. \n\nI say this all the more strongly because at the beginning of this month I \nled a European Community Troika visit to Mogadishu. What we saw there is what \nmany colleagues have spoken of, and I echo their voices. We saw the \ndisintegration of a society. We marked the absence of all legitimate \nauthority. We witnessed the collapse of a State and of all services connected \nwith a State. Instead of order, instead of law, teenage gangsters roam the \nstreets, toting their Kalashnikovs and offering protection at a price. \nInstead of a distribution system, whether capitalist or socialist, there is \nblackmail and looting. \nAgainst that background we saw the new humanitarian relief arrangements \nbeing put into place by Mr. Eliasson and many other devoted people. We saw \nhow the United Nations has to work naturally, intimately and without rivalry \nwith non-governmental organizations. We saw how urgently the Somalis need a \nreconstruction of civil authority. We fully support Ambassador Sahnoun's \nefforts in Mogadishu, in Somalia. He is an outstanding civil servant on \nbehalf of us all. Last month the Security Council rightly voted to strengthen \nthe United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) so that its security units \nwill be better able to distribute aid. Among the States Members of the \nEuropean Community, Belgium, with the support of all of us, plans a \nsubstantial contribution to that security. \nOf course not all disasters are man-made, though it looks as if an \nincreasing proportion are. There is the drought in the Horn of Africa and \nsouthern Africa, which will require a major international effort over the \ncoming year. \nFor the first time, over the last two or three years, the environment has \nbecome a priority for all countries. I have to say that the road from Rio de \n \nJaneiro may be harder than to the road to it. The United Nations Conference \non Environment and Development in Rio attracted the world's leaders, the \nworld's media and the world's imagination. But sustainable development has to \nstay at the top of the international agenda. That is why, immediately after \nhis return from Rio de Janeiro, Prime Minister Major proposed an eight-point \nfollow-up plan picking up the key elements agreed upon at Rio de Janeiro. \nThat initiative was broadly endorsed at our European Council in Lisbon and at \nthe Economic Summit in Munich. \nThe Sustainable Development Commission, which is to be set up by the \nGeneral Assembly, will be crucial to the follow-up. The Assembly must create \nan effective instrument to ensure that the impetus built up at Rio is not \ndissipated and lost. \nTo conclude, for the medium and long term we need to turn hope into \nreality. In the short term, time after time, in place after place, we must \nbring hope to what is already a grim reality. The legacy of the cold war is a \nmixed one. In facing it, the international community must be realistic, \nbecause history cannot be denied, cannot be uprooted. The solving of problems \nwhich have their roots deep in the centuries is a slow, frustrating business. \nAfter the brief gleam of optimism in 1989 and 1990, when all seemed easy, \nwe are now more realistic. Progress towards a more decent, orderly world will \nnever be without effort. Our best hope is to take two steps forward for each \nstep back. Even that imperfect progress will require the rapid strengthening \nof our institutions and in particular of the family of institutions called the \nUnited Nations - not essentially by more conferences and more speeches, but by \nthe practical effort which the United Nations, under the guidance of the \n \nSecretary-General, mounts today in Somalia, Yugoslavia, Cambodia and countless \nother troubled places. \nThe trucks of our agencies, painted white, and the blue berets of our \nUnited Nations contingents do not bring magic or instant happiness, but they \nbring a glimmer of hope where till then there may have been despair. In the \neffort of bringing hope, in the short term and in the longer term, the \nEuropean Community and its member States will take a persistent, energetic and \nworthy part. \n"

        "file_text": "\nMr. President, at the outset I should like to express our deep thanks to all \ndelegations of Member States for the uananimous decision to confer the \npresidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly upon us. That \ncan be conceived as an application of the rules of procedure, which provide \nthat the presidency of the forty-seventh session will be given to a \nrepresentative of Eastern Europe. However, I should also like to see it as \nsupport knowingly given for all that our people have done to ensure that \nBulgaria would remain an example in the difficult transition from dictatorship \ntowards normalcy. \nI should also like to express my delegation's gratitude to \nAmbassador Samir Shihabi for his valuable contributions to achievements of the \nforty-sixth session. \nOn behalf of my country I am pleased to welcome the new States Members of \nthe United Nations. We hope that other peace-loving States prepared to \nimplement the principles of the Organization will make their contributions. \nThe Organization's work has now been going on without interruption, \nalbeit with ups and downs, for 47 years. Today, we are happy to be able to \nsay that it is entering a new stage. The aggressive communist system that had \nset itself the goal of spreading its colour over the entire planet no longer \nexists. The peoples under its domination paid dearly for that experiment. \nState, economic and social structures are in ruins, and the environment been \ndegraded. When we add the new investments needed to divert to satisfying the \nreal needs of society the vast military machinery and weapons stockpiles that \nwere accumulated we cannot help but exclaim to ourselves: What a waste of \nresources! \nThe common denominator of communism's deeds is the wasting of millions of \nhuman lives. People have been killed, tortured, mutilated and removed from \nactive life. Let us pay tribute to them, for through their suffering history \nhas once again demonstrated that although violence may well create empires, it \ncannot preserve them. \nIn assessing today the United Nations place in human civilization we \nrecall that our inheritance from the Roman Empire was not the frontiers \nestablished by its legions but Roman law, Roman architecture and Roman \nphilosophy all products of the thinking of the people of that era. The same \nholds true for the Eastern or colonial empires. Reason alone leaves lasting \n\nfruits. The failure of the badly brought up and poorly educated who have \ntried to govern the world has provided further proof of this. \nIt is unnecessary to come up with lengthy treatises to understand that \nthroughout the succession of different forms of social organization the \ninstitutions that last are those that ensure the best opportunities for \nthought to emerge, spread, endure and evolve. Thought knows no local or \ninternational boundaries. It creates links across space and time. It truly \nunites nations. The best way to give a new impetus to the United Nations is \nto work to transform it into an Organization of united minds. \nOnly the individual can create a thought. Even with the traditional \npredominance of the State in society, we must recognize that it is the human \nbeing who bears the responsibility for maintaining parliamentary democracy and \nthe effective production of goods. The protection of the human rights of each \nhuman being must be the fundamental condition for accepting any State into the \nUnited Nations family. Today, as we assess the 47 years that have gone by and \nseek new directions, we see that compromise in this area is very costly and \nthe price is not paid only by those in the Gulag Archipelago; it is paid by \neveryone. \nWe know that totalitarian regimes provoke domestic and international \ncrises and that their authoritarian decisions threaten nature and sometimes \neven mankind's survival. \nI should like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who submitted his report, \\\"An Agenda for Peace,\\\" at \na time when a new atmosphere prevails within the United Nations. The \nBulgarian delegation warmly welcomes his message, which is designed to guide \nthe Organization towards efficiency and concrete results. It goes \n\nwithout saying that the fundamental condition for the reform proposed by the \nSecretary-General is the bridging of the gap between the declarations of \nStates and their true policies. \nThe Bulgarian delegation supports the principal ideas in \\\"An Agenda for \nPeace\\\" and welcomes the fact that a \\\"constructive discussion on that basis has \nbeen initiated at the present session. We consider it would be useful to \ncreate a special working group to accelerate the evaluation of comments and \nproposals submitted by Member States. \nFor the Bulgarian delegation the link between international peace, \ndevelopment and respect for human rights is basic. That link exists in the \nCharter, and it was emphasized at the Security Council Summit Meeting on \n31 January 1992. We should have it constantly in our minds when discussing \nideas of preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and peacemaking. \nPreventive diplomacy is a necessity, and the Secretary-General must be \nsupported in his efforts to develop that concept and give it practical \ndimensions. In this connection there is a whole range of activities that \nmight be considered, such as: information-gathering on problems that may \nprovoke conflicts; the establishment of contacts with forces that may become \ninvolved in conflict; the dispatch of fact-finding or other missions, both \nlong-term and short-term; the sending of special representatives; the \ndeployment of civilian or military observers; and, lastly, the deployment of \nmilitary troops should the need arise. \nUnited Nations efforts in the realm of preventive diplomacy, \ncrisis-management and post-conflict peace-building must also include a greater \nand more effective cooperation with regional organizations. We support the \nSecretary-General's idea of making better use of the potential of regional \n\norganizations. In our view this entails creating a system to coordinate the \nefforts of agencies working at both the global and regional levels. As of \nnow, there could be such coordination with regard to the sending of \nfact-finding missions or special rapporteurs, or to similar measures. We \nbelieve that interesting ideas may emerge from a discussion of the \nopportunities available to the United Nations to delegate certain functions to \nregional organizations as provided in Chapter VIII of the Charter. At the \nsame time, we must not forget that the supreme responsibility for the \nmaintenance of peace has been entrusted to the United Nations. \nWe consider very useful the experience already acquired through the work \nof the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). As an \nexample, let us take the establishment of the post of High Commissioner on \nNational Minorities, whose tasks could well be considered to come within the \nfield of preventive diplomacy, or all the confidence-building measures drafted \nin the course of the Helsinki process, including the recently signed \\\"Open \nSkies\\\" Treaty. Here I might mention a measure proposed by the Bulgarian \ndelegation at the Vienna negotiations, and already successfully tried, which \nis to invite accredited military attaches to visit zones of tension in the \ncountry where they are posted. With necessary adjustments, when feasible, \nmany of these measures could acguire universal status. \nWe feel that the reverse process could also be employed. The notion of \ncreating a universal register of conventional arms could also be implemented \nat the regional level to prevent quantities of conventional weapons capable of \ndestabilizing a region from being stockpiled without any preventive control. \n\nRegional registers would not only ensure increased transparency, but would \nalso assist in the creation and functioning of a world register. Bulgaria \nreaffirms its commitment to the implementation of resolution 46/36 L, \n\\\"Transparency in armaments.\\\" \n\nThe reform of the United Nations cannot take place without strengthening \nconfidence among States. Continuation of the disarmament process is \nabsolutely necessary if the new climate in the world is to be maintained. We \npay a tribute to Presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin for having taken \ncourageous steps to reduce offensive nuclear weapons and to diminish the risk \nof a nuclear holocaust. We hope that they will continue their efforts and \ncarry this process to its completion. \nEncouraged by the success achieved in nuclear disarmament and knowing \nthat regional conflicts are still raging, we feel that it is time to take a \ndecisive step to resolve the problem of the non-proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction. As a State party to the non-proliferation Treaty, Bulgaria \nknows its value and supports the efforts to make it universal. We are in \nfavour of having it continue in force indefinitely after 1995. \nWe participated in the drafting of the Convention on chemical weapons \nwhich we expect to see adopted at this session. From this lofty rostrum I \nshould like to confirm Bulgaria's will to be among the first countries to sign \nthe Convention and to work for its entry into force as quickly as possible. \nIn putting forth efforts to prevent world war, we must not forget that \nregional wars are raging. Whether we speak about Iraq, Somalia, on Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, the malady is universal, even if solutions can only be individual. \nSince the beginning of the Yugoslav crisis, Bulgaria has adopted a \nposition aimed at preventing the conflict from spreading and at cooperating \nwith the international community in efforts to find a political solution to \nthe conflict. We participated in the London Conference, which stimulated \ninternational efforts by launching a process of negotiations under the \n \nauspices of the United Nations and the European Community. Bulgaria firmly \nsupports the principles drafted by the Conference because we feel that they \nare the basis for a lasting and comprehensive solution to the conflict. \nBulgaria has recognized all of the Republics which, in accordance with \nconstitutional procedures, have clearly expressed their desire to become \nsovereign States. That makes it possible to bring all the parties of the \nformer Federation together round a negotiating table but if one or two of \nthem were to be absent, it would be impossible to do so. We have therefore \nrecognized the existing international borders, showing clearly that we are not \ngetting ready to take advantage of our neighbour's difficulties for \nnationalist purposes. \nAt this time it is extremely important to contain the conflict and to \nprevent its spread. The Bulgarian Government has decided to continue to work \ntogether with the international community in carrying out the decisions of the \nLondon Conference and of the Security Council. \nAn additional but effective way is to deploy international observer \nmissions. Since the end of last year, the Bulgarian Government has declared \nseveral times that it was ready to accept such a mission on its territory. We \nsupport the decision taken by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \nEurope (CSCE) to send missions to the neighbouring countries of Serbia and \nMontenegro and we pay a tribute to the mission of the European Community which \nis in Bulgaria. \nI should like to recall that we invited another special mission of the \nEuropean Community and of the CSCE to lend assistance to our authorities in \n\nthe implementation of Security Council resolutions imposing economic sanctions \nand the embargo on imports of weapons into the former Yugoslavia. \nAnd while we are speaking of sanctions, I should like to draw the \nAssembly's attention to the fact that they also affect the countries which \napply them. Whether we talk about the case of Iraq, Libya or the former \nYugoslavia, a large number of Bulgarian enterprises have been seriously \naffected and our entire economy has suffered serious losses. If we wish to \npunish only the guilty party, it would be only fair to consider setting up a \ncompensation programme for the non-guilty party. \nBulgaria will continue its efforts to organize a conference to reaffirm \nthe applicability in the Balkans of the principles of the CSCE. The Bulgarian \ninitiative for a Balkan forum is a concrete example of the general principles \nof the Helsinki Final Act, as applied to the actual conditions in the \nBalkans. In this context the setting up and carrying out of a special \nprogramme for the economic recovery of the Balkan States, a kind of \\\"Marshall \nPlan\\\", is of prime importance. \nBulgaria is working to establish relations with neighbouring States on a \nstable legal basis. We have concluded treaties of friendship, cooperation and \ngood-neighbourliness with Greece, Turkey and Romania, and we are now in the \nprocess of signing such a treaty with Albania, Slovenia and Croatia. We wish \nto live in peace and a state of good-neighbourliness with all the peoples in \nour region, including the Serbian and Montenegrin peoples with whom we have \nlong historic ties. We hope that, as soon as possible, they will once again \nfind their place in this Hall. That would be the best sign that the problems \nhave already been resolved. \n\nThe death of thousands of people and the suffering of millions of \nothers, especially women, children and the elderly, the huge flows of \nrefugees, and the barbaric practice of ethnic cleansing must not be \nforgotten. These flagrant violations of humanitarian international law have \neloquently shown the overriding need to create an international penal court \nwhich would have the competence to judge individuals who commit crimes against \npeace and humanity. Perhaps it would be appropriate to analyse the \npossibilities of using for these purposes one of the permanent courts already \nin existence the International Court of Justice or the European Court of \nHuman Rights. In any case, this requires discussion and Bulgaria favours \ncontinuing the work of the International Law Commission on drawing up the \ndraft statute for such a court. \nWe think that after the cold war it is imperative to strengthen the role \nof international law in international relations. This is necessary, in our \nview, because the bipolar structure of international relations has disappeared \nand therefore it is necessary to replace it with clear, precise, legal rules \nwhich are also universally recognized. On that basis, we should, in our \nopinion, promote above all, the strict implementation of the provisions of the \nCharter and strengthen the role of the United Nations in international \naffairs. \nBulgaria energetically supports all actions and measures which have been \nlaid down in the biennial programme for the United Nations Decade of \nInternational Law. We are convinced that the most important part of the \nprogramme is the part dealing with ways and means to bring about the peaceful \nsettlement of international disputes. In this context, I should like to \ninform representatives that on 23 June 1992 the Bulgarian Government deposited \n\nwith the Secretary-General a Declaration of Acceptance of the binding \njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. Furthermore, on that same \nday we withdrew our reservations on the jurisdictional provisions of a number \nof international conventions, such as the International Convention on the \nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimation, the International Convention \nagainst the Taking of Hostages, and others. I should like to extend the \nBulgarian delegation's support for the recommendation of the Secretary-General \ncontained in paragraph 38 of his report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", namely that the \nGeneral Assembly could, pursuant to Article 96, paragraph 2, of the Charter, \nauthorize the Secretary-General to take advantage of the advisory competence \nof the International Court of Justice. Such a possibility would considerably \nstrengthen the effectiveness of the work of the Secretary- General. \nI began my statement with some thoughts about the role of man as the \nonly being capable of using reason and of original thought. Honour and \ndignity are inherent in each human being, and history shows us that all \nconflicts are more or less linked to violations of human rights. Our \nOrganization has created very good standards in this field and emphasis must \nnow be placed on improving the machinery for monitoring and implementing \nexisting standards. \n\nThe crises that have followed the disintegration of multinational \nfederations have demonstrated the importance of the problems of ethnic and \nreligious minorities within the overall framework of human rights protection. \nIn this context, my country is deeply concerned over the fate of the Bulgarian \nminority in Serbia. Although it is not directly affected by the war, this \npopulation has a justified feeling of insecurity with regard to its future and \nidentity, and should not be forgotten by the international community. \nDemocratic Bulgaria has succeeded in finding an original and effective \napproach to solving these problems. The Bulgarian Turks have their \nrepresentatives in the national parliament, and bear their share of the \nresponsibility for the future of our country. Ethnic tolerance is a \ncharacteristic trait of the Bulgarian people; one of the most telling example \nis the way the Jews in Bulgaria were rescued during the Second World War. \nThe words \\\"war\\\" and \\\"peace\\\" have been intermingled in my speech, as they \nare, moreover, in real life. But it is clear that peace will win out in the \nend, because it is in peace that man shows himself to be reasonable and \ncreative. Those who preach peace still remain among us; those who cry \nviolence are not. That is why, in Bulgaria, we have said a last farewell to \ncommunism and sided with the nations that are united in their way of thinking. "

        "file_text": "On behalf \nof my country and Government, I should like first of all to convey our \ncongratulations to Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency of the United \nNations General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. His competence and the \nwealth of experience he has acquired during his career as a diplomat in the \nservice of his country, Bulgaria which enjoys great prestige on the \ninternational scene constitute, for the members of the Assembly, a sure \nguarantee for the success of our work. \nMy delegation particularly welcomes this choice of President because our \ntwo countries have good relations, which are marked, among other things, by \nthe massive assistance which his country gave to the heroic liberation \nstruggle of our people and of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea \nand Cape Verde (PAIGC) against colonialism. Because of this, I should like \nhere and now to assure him of my delegation's cooperation in carrying out the \nlofty mission the Assembly has just entrusted to him. \nMy delegation offers its congratulations and expresses its gratitude to \nMr. Samir Shihabi, who, with great talent, wisdom and efficiency, guided the \nwork of the forty-sixth session. We wish him every success in his future \nendeavours. \nOur congratulations and our thanks also go to the Secretary-General of \nthe United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his tireless, constant, \nclear-sighted and successful efforts to safeguard peace and security the world \nover. We also pay tribute to the Secretary-General's dedication, to his \n\nvisionary ability and his capacity to act, and, particularly, to his concern \nfor preserving the prestige and the effectiveness of the United Nations in all \ncircumstances. \nTo his predecessor, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, who worked relentlessly for the \nrenewal of the United Nations system, the establishment of international peace \nand security and development, we extend all our congratulations and a ringing \ntribute for the work he accomplished in the service of the international \ncommunity. We wish him also every success in his future endeavours. \n\nThe admission of new Members is an important stage in attaining the \nuniversality of the Organization, thereby enabling it to undertake greater \naction and giving it greater dynamism to achieve its objectives. That is why \nthe Republic of Guinea-Bissau welcomes with joy the new Members that have \njoined our great family since the forty-sixth session. The delegation of the \nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau congratulates all those countries. \nThe forty-seventh session is being held at a time when international \nrelations have been given a new momentum for progress and dynamism; and this, \nthanks to far-reaching changes taking place in the world. \nThe Secretary-General, at the request of the Security Council, has \nsubmitted to us a report entitled, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277), in which \nhe refers quite rightly to the concept of preventive diplomacy and the idea of \nthe maintenance, strengthening and consolidation of peace throughout the \nworld. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau supports these initiatives. \nThis new dynamic which today characterizes international relations, \nhenceforth freed from the cold war, is a source of great hope for stability \nand opens up prospects for peace, understanding and cooperation which have \nenabled the United Nations to help in taking concrete initiatives for settling \nmany conflicts. \nYes, the world today has undergone extraordinary change. Everywhere the \nmovement in favour of better democratization and of respect for basic human \nrights is emerging. We know that such claims will go unheeded if they are not \naccompanied by the same vital movement for prosperity and well-being. \nFurthermore, a number of important and dramatic events have afflicted us in \n\nrecent times and have led us to be pessimistic. I am convinced that today, as \nin the past, the Assembly will be able to find its bearings again. \nThe situation in southern Africa is hardly improving in spite of the \nannouncement of reforms that will put an end to the system of apartheid. In \nview of recent developments in that country we are still concerned. However \nwe are following with great interest measures to abolish segregationist laws \nadopted by the South African Government and we urge it to continue \nnegotiations with the anti-apartheid movements for the final elimination of \nthe apartheid system in that country where the overwhelming majority of the \npopulation still does not have the right to vote, to decide its own future and \nfreely choose its leaders. \nInter-ethnic violence caused and maintained by certain backward-looking \nforces continues to bring the country bloodshed and affliction. My delegation \ninvites the international community to maintain pressure on the South African \nGovernment so that the process that has begun may lead to the total \nelimination of apartheid and to the establishment of a democratic and \nmultiracial society. \nThe Assembly is certainly aware of the fraternal links of friendship \nwhich bind the people of Guinea-Bissau to the brother people of Angola. That \nis why the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, its people and its Government were \noverjoyed at the peace process which has begun in that country and which has \nled to the establishment of a multiparty system and of democratic, free and \nuniversal elections. \n\nFor the Angolan people new prospects have opened up enabling it to \nundertake the reconstruction and development of its sorely-tried homeland. On \nthis occasion of celebrating peace and regained harmony the Government of \nGuinea-Bissau reiterates its fraternal feelings of solidarity and its wishes \nfor prosperity for Angola. \nWe earnestly hope that the peace process in Mozambique will have the same \noutcome and that the international community might soon be able to celebrate \nthe end of the painful fate into which the civil war has plunged that \ncountry. We encourage the Mozambican Government to continue along the path of \ndialogue and we exhort RENAMO to show good will in order to allow for the \nspeedy establishment of peace in that country so sorely tried by so many years \nof violence. \nIn Western Sahara we hope that the necessary conditions will quickly be \nmet so that a referendum on self-determination under the aegis of the United \nNations might be held as soon as possible in order to establish a lasting \nclimate of peace and security in that region. \nIn Liberia as well, the efforts of the Economic Community of West African \nStates (ECOWAS) to create an atmosphere that would lead to a normalization of \nthe political situation and to the holding of democratic elections, have, \nunfortunately, not yet borne fruit. We reiterate our appeal to the warring \nparties, especially the National Patriotic Forces of Liberia, to comply \nscrupulously with the Yamoussoukro agreements, especially the agreement \nreached on 30 October 1991. \nThe quest for a dynamic solution for a global settlement of the problems \nof that country are based on essential respect for the rights of all. It does \n\nnot depend only on the willingness of States and people in the region; it must \nalso commit all of us who, for various reasons, have an impact on the \nbehaviour of the various protagonists so that there might be a lasting and \njust peace. \nSomalia has become a field of carnage and of constant concern to the \ninternational community. For some time now we have been seeing a fratricidal \ncivil war with disastrous consequences for that country and its defenceless \ncivilian population. The Assembly, a forum for heightening awareness and a \ncourt of appeal, will not fail to ask the international community to give more \ncoherent and concrete assistance in the face of this new development in order \nto bring this bloody and outrageous conflict to an end. We appeal most \nurgently to the parties involved in the conflict to comply with the agreements \nsigned in Djibouti and to agree to mitigate the sufferings of that brave \npeople. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau, for its part, supports any proposal to \nfind a peaceful solution to this conflict as soon as possible. \nIn the Horn of Africa there is also Ethiopia, the authorities of which we \nwould like to encourage to continue the dialogue begun for lasting peace and \nsecurity in that country and in the region. \nIn the Middle East, we are convinced that peace is possible if the \nparties to the conflict are imbued with the necessary political will. \nGuinea-Bissau hopes that a rapid, negotiated solution might be found to the \nproblem of the Middle East so that the peoples of that region might be able to \nlive in peace. The Palestinian people are however entitled to a homeland, to \n\na sovereign State, within secure and internationally acknowledged borders. My \ncountry therefore supports and encourages all the initiatives undertaken to \nrestore peace between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples. \nWe welcome the prospects opened up for the restoration of peace and \nsecurity in Lebanon. The whole world admires the courage of the Lebanese and \nI am certain that the whole world will help them to bring about the triumph of \ntheir ideas. The Lebanese people will find a source of justified pride in \nthis. \n\nIn Cambodia, new prospects for a lasting peace were opened after the \nnegotiations. One of the most recent prospects is the organization of free \nelections, being prepared with the welcome assistance of the United Nations, \nwhich we should like to commend and encourage. We believe and hope that the \norganization of these free and democratic elections will put an end to the \nlong years of suffering endured by the heroic people of Cambodia. \nAs to the question of East Timor, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau is hoping \nfor an acceptable and speedy peaceful conclusion to this serious problem, \nwhich is a source of concern to us. The Maubere people must regain its \nlegitimate right to self-determination and independence, if it so wishes. I \nrepeat: if it so wishes. That is why we welcome the high-level meeting of \ndelegations of Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the United Nations \nwith a view to finding the necessary framework for a settlement suitable to \nall the parties to the conflict. We should like to assure all the parties \ninvolved in the process of seeking a favourable and speedy outcome of the \nconflict of our availability and support. \nIn spite of their admission to the United Nations, the two Koreas have \nyet to find common ground for the reunification of the great Korean nation. \nThe Republic of Guinea-Bissau is privileged to have good economic and \ndiplomatic relations with the two Koreas - north and south. That is why we \nappeal to them to continue negotiations for the speedy reunification of the \ngreat Korean homeland. \nSimilarly, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau urges the Cypriot communities to \ncontinue negotiations, with the assistance of the Secretary-General, for a \npeaceful settlement of the Cypriot conflict. \n\nThe Republic of Guinea-Bissau, again within the context of the quest for \npeace and harmony among nations, has undertaken diplomatic relations of \ncooperation and friendship with all countries throughout the world that \nfervently seek peace and justice. \nGuided by this thinking, we also maintain diplomatic relations of \ncooperation and friendship with the Republic of China (Taiwan). That is why \nwe support and endorse the reference made to that country by the President of \nNicaragua from this rostrum. \nIn this regard, we pay a well-deserved tribute to the valuable assistance \ngiven to my country's development efforts by another country from the \ndeveloping world the Republic of China whose economic performance, which \nnow puts it among the major economic Powers of the world, is in many regards \nexemplary. \nIn Latin America, we welcome and support the peace process begun under \nUnited Nations auspices for the restoration of security and stability in that \nregion. \nSince the developments of 30 September in Haiti, President Aristide, the \nconstitutionally elected President, and his Government are still waiting to \ntake up their legitimate places, to which they are entitled. The \ninternational community and the Organization of American States should help \nthem in that regard. Guinea-Bissau, which hopes for a peaceful and speedy \nsettlement of that conflict, urges all the parties involved to heed reason and \nto respect the basic rights of the Haitian people. \nThe growing tension and conflict in Central and Eastern Europe are \njeopardizing international peace and security. \n\nGuinea-Bissau is anxiously following the evolution of the situation in \nthe former Yugoslavia. Each day we deplore the violence and the hatred in the \nconfrontations that have cost so many human lives. That is why the Republic \nof Guinea-Bissau commends the initiatives and the efforts of the United \nNations, through its Secretary-General, and of the European Economic Community \nwith a view to achieving a peaceful solution to the inter-ethnic conflict. \nThe successful missions already conducted and the restored confidence in \nthe Organization give solid grounds for satisfaction and, above all, for \nhope. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau hopes that all those involved in conflict \nwill rediscover the virtues of dialogue and cooperation, which are the only \narms that lead to peace. \nThe Government of General Joao Bernardo Viera, President of the Council \nof State of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, has committed all of Guinea-Bissau \nto a process of pluralist democratization and to the establishment of a State \nof law, as well as to the improvement and recovery of the economy, with a view \nto greater social justice. \nThe process of democratization now under way in Guinea-Bissau is \nperceived everywhere as the clear sign of fundamental change, whose goal is \njustice, social stability and greater well-being. So that it can be effective \nand practical, this process is based on my country's historical social and \ncultural realities. \nIn our view, the recent adoption of our Electoral Law narrows the gap \nbetween the aspirations of our people and reality, and gives all citizens the \nmeans to express themselves freely and indeed to be free. The progressive \n \ndisengagement of the State from the industrial and commercial sector, the \nencouragement of private initiative, the promotion of private property and the \ncreation of conditions of social stability, unity and national cohesion are at \nthe heart of these transformations now taking place in our country. \nHowever, experience has shown that the attainment of democratic \nobjectives in African countries is necessarily accompanied by some degree of \nproblems and of questioning. The determination to democratize is \nunfortunately facing difficulties that stem from the implementation of \nstructural adjustment policies, which, it should be stressed, do not have the \nexpected donor support. This situation worsens the state of impoverishment \nand the feeling of frustration of our peoples. The dependence of \nGuinea-Bissau, in particular, and of African States, in general, on \ninternational agencies and bilateral partners is thereby strengthened. \nThere can be no doubt that we are at a uniquely decisive and historic \nstage in which all efforts must converge to strengthen the positive trends \nthat we have observed and to make them irreversible and give a new dimension \nto the relations between parties and States. This new trend which today \ncharacterizes international relations bears the hope of stability and has \nopened up prospects of peace and understanding. \nGuinea-Bissau has, in every instance, endeavoured to work in its foreign \nrelations towards a policy based on confidence, dialogue and harmony. \n\nThe process of democratic openness begun in Guinea-Bissau and the \nresulting economic liberalization require the constant support of the \ninternational community. This democratic process deserves to be supported, \nbecause there can be no real democracy without development. It is therefore \nclear that a democracy which is not founded on a solid economic base is but an \nillusion. \nIt is virtually impossible today to discuss international relations \nwithout recalling, with sadness, the seriousness of the economic crisis of the \ndeveloping countries in general and of the African countries in particular. \nThe decline in export earnings, foreign debt and the inadequacy of resources \nfor development, compounded by natural disasters, have served to further \ndeteriorate socio-economic conditions in many countries. \nThe United Nations has become aware of this situation and has adopted the \nProgramme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development for our \nbenefit. None the less, the objectives sought have not been attained. The \nresponse of the developed countries and of international economic and \nfinancial institutions has not been commensurate with their commitments, \nthough most of the African countries have agreed to carry out the reforms \nimposed upon them. \nAfrica remains ready, however, to reaffirm its commitment to apply the \nnecessary transformation policies, as evidenced, inter alia, by the adoption of \nthe African Charter for Popular Participation in Development and \nTransformation, and the proposals made as a result of the final assessment of \nthe Programme. The new framework for cooperation must ensure sufficient \nresources; debt reduction and cancellation; and the adoption of lasting \nsolutions to commodities problems, in the hope that the agreement thus reached \nwill receive the full support of Africa's partners. \n\nIn spite of the truly commendable efforts made by the African Governments \nin the framework of implementing programmes of structural adjustment, our \neconomic situation and living conditions are becoming increasingly difficult. \nThe Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, \n1986 to 1990, which had given rise to such hopes, unfortunately has not \nresponded to the legitimate concerns of the African peoples and leaders for \ngrowth and for viable economic and social development. \nThe approaches taken thus far to finding a solution to the serious \nproblem of debt, while encouraging in certain respects, are far from \nresponding to the real economic concerns of the developing countries. The \nsearch for a solution to the foreign-debt problem of the developing countries \nmust not only involve a further strengthening of solidarity in the \ninternational community and shared responsibility between creditors and \ndebtors, but must also take into account the growth objective of the \ndeveloping countries. \nAs we noted earlier, the world is experiencing extraordinary change. \nEverywhere, the trend towards greater democratization and towards respect for \nfundamental human rights is in evidence. But we know that these demands will \ngo unheeded if they are not accompanied by an equally vital drive towards \nwell-being and prosperity. \nFurthermore, the international community must give special attention to \nthe implementation of the Declaration and Programme of Action for the Least \nDeveloped Countries for the 1990s, adopted at the Paris Conference, which \nremains a charter for us all. \nWe make a pressing appeal to the international community that urgent and \nappropriate action be taken with a view to the adoption of a consistent \n\nprogramme of cooperation for the development of the developing countries, and \nabove all, of Africa, an almost forgotten continent. \nIn this respect, my delegation welcomes the initiative of the Japanese \nGovernment to convene once again in 1993 a summit conference on the \ndevelopment of Africa, as well as the French proposal, made by President \nFrancois Mitterrand, to convene a high-level meeting on social development. \nThe course charted by our countries towards greater freedom and democracy \nsupports the concept expressed in the \\\"Human Development Report\\\" recently \npublished by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which recommends \n\\\"a participative form of development in which the human being is placed at the \ncenter of the decision-making process\\\". \nIn this context, we are gratified by and we unreservedly support the \ndecision to convene a World Conference on Human Rights as planned for 1993 in \nVienna. \nAlong these same lines, women in Guinea-Bissau participated equally with \nmen in the liberation struggle in our country. At the same time, they fought \nto win their freedom and emancipation. \nIt is for all these reasons that my Government unreservedly supports the \nWorld Conference on Women, to be held in 1995. This long-awaited Conference \nwill provide an opportunity to review at a very high level the problems of \nwomen in the world. \nSustainable and lasting economic and social development can only be \nachieved in the context of a healthy environment. In our opinion, the Rio \nConference was a success, but the implementation of the decisions reached in \nthat important and high-level forum will be even more decisive. After the \nholding of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, we \n\nfocus our hopes today on the Commission on Sustainable Development, which is \nto meet at the ministerial level, and whose task it will be to follow up the \nimplementation of the programmes contained in Agenda 21 and to see to it that \nthey are implemented in an integrated manner. \nIn that connection, may I, on behalf of my delegation, extend our warmest \ncongratulations and sincerest thanks to Mr. Maurice Strong for the remarkable \nwork that he accomplished at the head of a team whose dynamism, expertise and \neffectiveness are today recognized by all delegations. Mr. Strong's tireless \nefforts throughout the preparatory process as well as his personal commitment \nto the noble task assigned to him by the international community were the best \nguarantee of the historic success of the Rio de Janeiro Conference. It is our \nhope and our belief that he is among the best-qualified people, if not the \nbest-qualified person, to guide the initial steps of the secretariat of that \nCommission. This is certainly vital to ensure the effective implementation \nand prompt follow-up of the commitments reached in Rio. \nIn this connection, the secretariat of the Commission on Sustainable \nDevelopment will necessarily require an identifiable structure. Its staff \nmust be highly qualified and conform to an equitable geographical \ndistribution, and it must base itself on the experience acquired in the United \nNations Conference on Environment and Development preparatory process.* \nThe President returned to the Chair. \n\nThe idea of rapidly establishing a structure and staff for the \nimplementation of the recommendations and decisions of the Rio Conference \nprompts us to consider that solutions to environmental problems must \nnecessarily take into account development in all its dimensions, particularly \nin its regional socio-economic dimensions. \nPart of Guinea-Bissau, a member of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on \nDrought Control in the Sahel (CILSS), is in a region afflicted by drought. We \ncall urgently for the rapid establishment of an intergovernmental committee \nthat will be entrusted with the development of an international convention to \nfight drought and desertification. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau reaffirms \nonce again its support of the Bamako Convention, which prohibits the importing \nof waste to Africa, and the Bamako Commitment of the African countries \nregarding their priorities in the field of the environment. \nThe World Summit for Children, held in 1990, broke new ground for the \nimprovement of living conditions of children the world over. We have adhered \nto and implemented the decisions and recommendations that came out of that \nSummit. As our immortal leader Amilcar Cabral said, \\\"Children are the flowers \nof our struggle and the reason for our fight.\\\" \nThe Organization of African Unity (OAU) Conference on the African Child, \nwhich will be held next November in Dakar, Senegal, will be an opportunity to \nshow our active solidarity with children, who, unfortunately, suffer from so \nmany problems and also to show that the international community is in \nsolidarity with all African youth. \nNow that tensions between East and West have been resolved and \nideological antagonism has ended, it remains for us to pay attention to the \n\ndevelopmental problems of the poor countries and thus to ensure international \npeace and security. \nIn this very Assembly, for years on end, high-ranking personages have \nfrom this rostrum drawn our attention to the decisive role of disarmament in \nthe evolution of the developing countries. This is a dimension that we must \nnever forget in our work. \nThat is why the Government of Guinea-Bissau supports the establishment of \na moral and political climate that encourages the total elimination of all \narms of destruction, because reductions in military budgets and expenditures \nwill benefit economic and social development in many parts of the world at \nlarge and in Africa in particular. \nLike the environment, other problems suffered by Africa AIDS, \ntuberculosis, yellow fever, drugs and more could be faced up to with the \nsupport and effective assistance provided by the colossal sums of money that \nwould be freed up through complete and total disarmament. \nBut at this point we should like to commend the United Nations system, \nthe funding bodies and the international organizations both governmental and \nnon-governmental such as the World Health Organization (WHO) for their \nefforts and support thus far in helping us face the scourges that ravage our \ncontinent. \nIn spite of the uncertainties hanging over the global economy and \ninternational relations in general and above all the risk of marginalization \nfor the African continent, it is unthinkable that the peoples, countries and \nGovernments affected by crisis might yield to disarray or discouragement. \n\n"

        "file_text": "May I begin \nby warmly congratulating you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the \ncurrent session of the United Nations General Assembly. I believe that, given \nyour talent and experience, you will guide this session to a successful \ncompletion of the noble mission entrusted to it by the Charter of the United \nNations. I would also like to express my appreciation and thanks to your \npredecessor, Mr. Shihabi, for the contribution he made to accomplishing the \ntasks of the last session. \nI would like to take this opportunity to extend my warm welcome and \ncongratulations to the 13 States that have been admitted to the United Nations \nthis year: the Republic of Armenia, the Azerbaijani Republic, the Republic of \nBosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia, the Republic of Georgia, the \nRepublic of Kazakhstan, the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, \nthe Republic of San Marino, the Republic of Slovenia, the Republic of \nTajikistan, Turkmenistan, and the Republic of Uzbekistan. \nSince the last session of the General Assembly, profound changes have \ntaken place in the world, with events of major consequences occurring one \nafter another, from East to West and North to South. The international \ncommunity has finally shaken off the old pattern whose main feature was the \nconfrontation between the two military blocs. The world has now entered a new \nhistorical phase of development towards multipolarity. \nWe in China have a saying: \\\"Past experience can serve as a guide for the \npresent\\\". The tortuous course that mankind has traversed in this century, \nparticularly since the end of the Second World War, has revealed a historical \ntruth: any Power, however strong it may be, is bound to decline if it goes \nagainst the people's will for peace and development. It has always been a \nshared aspiration and objective of the people of all countries to work for \nworld peace, national stability, social progress, economic growth and a better \nlife. This is a historical trend which no force can resist. \nThe genuine peace that the people of the world have longed for has not \ncome with the end of the cold war. On the contrary, the world remains uneasy, \nwith new problems added to the old ones and armed conflicts erupting one after \nanother as a result of disrupted equilibrium. Hegemonism and power politics \ncontinue to exist. The attempt of some big Powers to control developing \ncountries politically and economically has become more and more obvious. \nLong-hidden ethnic conflicts have surfaced with a vengeance and the \nNorth-South contradictions have further intensified. The road to peace and \ndevelopment before the people of the world is covered with thorns. \nAs we can all see, a dangerous \\\"seismic belt\\\" extending from the Balkans \nto the Caucasus and to Central Asia is taking shape. In some regions, people \nhave once again been plunged into war and turmoil, with millions of refugees \nfleeing in all directions. These conflicts have occurred in those areas where \ndifferent ethnic groups have traditionally lived together, with age-old \nantagonisms suddenly coming to the surface under the new situation. These \nconflicts are interwoven with historical feuds, territorial disputes, \npolitical rivalries, clashes of economic interests, and religious intolerance. \nThey have been further complicated by the involvement of outside forces. \nIn our view, force should not be used even as a last resort in the search \nof the settlement of a problem, however complicated it may be. The \nfundamental solution lies in a reconciliation of various ethnic groups through \ndialogues on an equal footing and peaceful negotiations. We sincerely hope \nthat the parties' to the conflicts will, proceeding from the overriding \ninterest of maintaining the peace and in the interests of the people, abandon \nthe threat or use of force and seek a political settlement of their conflicts \nthrough friendly consultations and negotiations on an equal footing in the \nspirit of mutual respect, good-neighbourliness and common progress. \nWe support the United Nations in its positive efforts to avoid an \nescalation of conflicts and seek peaceful settlements. Outside intervention \nand mediation can be resorted to when necessary, provided that they are based \non a strict observance of the principles and objectives of the United Nations \nCharter and the basic norms of international law. Only mediation or \nintervention in such a manner can contribute to a peaceful settlement of \nconflicts, the stability and unity of sovereign States, and the amicable \ncoexistence of different ethnic groups. \nThe Middle East peace process has taken a favourable turn thanks to the \njoint efforts of the Arab countries and Israel and the support of the rest of \nthe international community. We hope that the parties concerned will seize \nthe opportunity, take a flexible and practical approach, and conduct serious \nnegotiations in order to remove obstacles and seek a comprehensive and fair \nsolution to the Middle East issue, including the restoration of the national \nrights of the Palestinian people on the basis of the relevant United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions. \nThe Asia-Pacific region has enjoyed political stability and a sustained \neconomic growth. In Cambodia, the striving for peace and rehabilitation has \nbecome the order of the day. Political settlement of the Cambodian issue is \nirreversible, though difficulties and twists and turns are hardly avoidable. \nThe implementation of the Paris Agreements in their totality requires not only \ndetermination but also patience. In Afghanistan, the resistance forces have \ntaken control. We hope they will end the bloodshed so as to create suitable \nconditions for the election. On the Korean peninsula, the North and the South \nhave intensified their dialogue, resulting in a further relaxation of tension \nthere. The recent establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the \nRepublic of Korea will have a far-reaching impact on stability and peace in \nNorth-East Asia. \nThe turbulent and complicated international situation has further \nawakened countries and peoples of the world to the urgency and necessity of \nestablishing a new international order. The world of the future should not be \na place where only the interests and privileges of big Powers or power groups \nare protected, nor a place where international affairs are monopolized and \nmanipulated by the big, strong, and wealthy countries only. The old world \norder based on unequal relationships no longer works. \nA new international order should be based on the universal observance of \nthe five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal \naffairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. This is in \nconformity with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. \nAll countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, should have the \nright to choose a social system and a road to development suited to their \nactual conditions. Countries should respect each other, treat each other as \nequals, and resolve their disputes through peaceful negotiations. Only when \nall countries undertake to observe these principles can there be genuine \ndemocracy in international relations. We are convinced that as the world \nmoves towards multipolarity, an equitable and rational international order of \npeace and stability will come into being. \nThe United States and the former Soviet Union or Russia have reached some \nnew agreements on nuclear-arms reduction in recent years. These agreements \nhave been well-received by the international community, which hopes that they \nwill be earnestly implemented by the countries concerned. At the same time, \nit is clear to people that even after the aforementioned disarmament \nagreements are fully implemented, the major military Powers will still be in \npossession of the largest arsenals of the most sophisticated nuclear and other \nhigh-tech weapons, and the capabilities to develop space weapons. \nAfter years of negotiations, the chemical weapons convention has finally \nbeen concluded. It has laid an international legal basis for a world-wide \nelimination of such weapons of mass destruction. Though some of its \nprovisions are not fair and balanced, the purposes and objectives defined in \nthe convention have nonetheless won the unanimous endorsement and support of \nthe international community. We hope that these purposes and objectives will \nbe observed and carried out effectively in the interest of the security of all \ncountries. \nChina has all along stood for the complete prohibition and thorough \ndestruction of all weapons of mass destruction. Pending the realization of \nthis goal, it is necessary for the international community to take, as a \ntransitional step, appropriate measures to prevent the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction in the interest of regional and world security and \nstability. We maintain that international non-proliferation should be pursued \nin a fair, reasonable, comprehensive and balanced manner without prejudice to \nthe legitimate security interests of any country, to its socio-economic \ndevelopment, or to international cooperation in the application of science \nand technology for peaceful purposes. \nWe oppose the attempt of a country to interfere in and obstruct the \nnormal cooperation between sovereign States under the pretext of preventing \narms proliferation. We strongly condemn the blatant violation of one's own \ncommitment to an international agreement by selling large amounts of advanced \nweapons and equipment, in gross interference in another country's internal \naffairs. \nWe would like to make the following suggestions in the field of \ndisarmament and arms control. First, all nuclear-weapon States should \nundertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons or to resort to the \nthreat or use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon States in any \ncircumstances whatsoever. Secondly, all nuclear-weapon States should support \nproposals for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, respect the \nstatus of the existing nuclear-weapon-free zones, and undertake corresponding \nobligations. Those countries which have deployed nuclear weapons abroad \nshould withdraw all of them to their own territories. Thirdly, all countries \nwith space capabilities should follow the principle of the peaceful use of \nspace and immediately stop their research, testing, production, and deployment \nof space weapons and refrain from extending their weapons systems into space. \nIn today's world, the gulf between the rich and the poor is further \nwidening. The population of the richest countries and that of the poorest \ncountries each accounts for 20 per cent of the world's total, but their income \ngap has grown wider, from 30-fold in the 1960s to 90-fold in the 1990s. The \nquestion of North-South relations has become more acute. Development and \npeace are matters of equal urgency and importance. \nThe sluggish growth of the world economy, unequal and unfair trade, the \nplummeting prices of many primary products and crushing debt burdens are among \nthe unfavourable external conditions which have continued to place severe \nconstraints on the economic development of developing countries. Quite a few \nof them have suffered a constant drop in the growth rate of their per capita \ngross national product (GNP). Some have even registered negative economic \ngrowth rates. Their terms of trade continue to deteriorate, which hampers \ntheir export efforts. They have found it even more difficult to attract \nforeign investment and technology. \nPeace and development are mutually supportive. They can promote or \nhinder each other, but they cannot supersede each other. It is impossible to \npreserve world peace without development. There can hardly be durable \nstability and prosperity in the world in the absence of economic development \nand social progress in developing countries. A protracted economic stagnation \nor even decline in developing countries will also affect further economic \ngrowth in developed countries. \nDeveloping countries should mainly rely on themselves to achieve real \neconomic growth. While restructuring their economies to speed up their \neconomic development, many of them are reviewing their experience and \nearnestly exploring paths of development suited to their national conditions. \nNo one can deny that the old international economic order, being \nirrational and inequitable, is an important external cause of the poverty and \nbackwardness of developing countries. First and foremost, developed countries \nhave the responsibility and obligation to take effective measures, including \nthe following. \nFirst, developed countries should set aside 0.7 per cent of their GNP for \nassistance to developing countries in accordance with the relevant resolutions \nof the United Nations; increase official development assistance, and address \nthe debt question and work to rectify the anomaly of the flight of capital \nfrom developing to developed countries. \nSecondly, they should observe the basic principles of the generalized \nsystem of preferences devised by the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment; dismantle discriminatory trade barriers; further open their \nmarkets to developing countries; and endeavour to keep the prices of primary \nproducts at rational levels. \nThirdly, they should resume and increase official and non-governmental \ntechnical assistance and the concessional transfer of technology to developing \ncountries in order gradually to narrow the North-South gap in science and \ntechnology and to facilitate the economic restructuring and technological \nprogress of developing countries. \nIt must be stressed that political stability is an important prerequisite \nfor the economic growth of developing countries. Assistance for the purpose \nof applying pressure on the recipient countries will cause turbulence and \ninstability in these countries, which will be even more detrimental to their \neconomic development. \nIt is obviously one-sided and harmful to make irresponsible comments \nabout the human rights situation in developing countries in disregard of the \ndifferences in 'historical backgrounds and cultural traditions as well as the \nactual conditions in these countries. For the people of developing countries, \nthe right to subsistence and the right to development are undoubtedly the \nfundamental and the most important human rights of all. In those areas hit by \nsevere natural disasters year after year, people are starving; in war-ridden \nareas, millions are turned into refugees. How can people living in such \nconditions enjoy human rights? \nEstablishing an equitable and rational new international economic order \nbased on equality and mutual benefit will be a reliable guarantee of balanced, \nhealthy and sustained growth in the world economy, and an important \nprecondition for gradually narrowing the North-South gap as well. The \nachievement of this goal calls for serious dialogue between the North and the \nSouth and joint efforts by both. As long as the two sides adopt a positive \napproach, seek common ground on major issues while putting aside minor \ndifferences, seek mutual benefit and actively look for ways to cooperate \neffectively, the North-South dialogue will make headway. \nThe important documents adopted at the United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development and the Conventions on climate change and \nbiological diversity open for signature during the Conference reflect the \nconsensus and understanding that countries at different stages of development \nhave reached on environmental protection and economic development. We hope \nthat the obligations and rights in respect of environmental protection will be \nfulfilled or exercised fully, and that global cooperation in this field will \nprovide scope for improved North-South relations. \nThe Chinese Government actively supports the proposals for a World Summit \nfor Social Development, under United Nations auspices. It warmly welcomes the \nconvocation of the fourth World Conference on Women, to be held in Beijing in \nSeptember 1995. The Chinese organization committee was set up in August this \nyear, and China will begin preparing in earnest to ensure that arrangements \nfor the conference in Beijing run smoothly. \nThe historic changes in the international situation have also presented \nformidable challenges to the United Nations. The people of the world have \nhigh expectations of this world Organization. How the United Nations will \nadapt itself to the new international situation, address major international \nissues in a more positive, balanced, just and reasonable manner, promote world \npeace and development and play its role in the efforts to establish a new \nworld order has become a major concern of the international community. \nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has submitted a \ndetailed and extensive mid-year report (A/47/277) on the role of the United \nNations in maintaining international peace, which merits our careful study. \nWe appreciate his efforts. \nThe reform of the United Nations is now on the agenda, and its success \ndepends on sound principles and on choosing the right direction. We should \nlike to offer for consideration the following thoughts, which we think conform \nto the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. \nThe reform should contribute to maintaining the sovereignty of Member \nStates. Sovereign States are the subjects of international law and form the \nbasis of the United Nations. Safeguarding State sovereignty should be a \nfundamental principle of a new world order. \nThe reform should facilitate the peaceful settlement of international \nconflicts. The United Nations should be an international organization \ndedicated to preserving peace and promoting cooperation. Only when it abides \nby the basic norms governing international relations, persists in settling all \ninternational disputes through peaceful means and opposes the threat or use of \nforce will the United Nations be able to maintain international peace and \nsecurity. The arbitrary use of military intervention by the United Nations or \nthe indiscriminate and wilful imposition of mandatory measures on Member \nStates would not be helpful to the resolution of conflicts, and, worse still, \nwould impair the credibility and role of the United Nations. \nThe reform should contribute to the balanced, healthy and sustained \neconomic development of countries. Economic development is a major concern of \nthe vast majority of the 179 States Members of the United Nations. In today's \nworld, the North-South economic gap keeps widening, and the gulf between rich \nand poor is getting greater. The United Nations should attach great \nimportance to the question of development, as it does to the settlement of \ninternational conflicts and crises. Only by so doing can it win support from \nthe overwhelming majority of Member States. \nThe reform should embody the basic principles of democracy, justice, \nobjectivity, rationality, efficiency and balance of interests. It is not a \nmatter that concerns solely a few big Powers, nor only the strong and the \nrich. The balanced approach should not be discarded in disregard of the \nreality. The reform should serve the general objective of establishing an \nequitable and rational new world order of peace and stability. The reform \nefforts will not receive understanding and support from Member States unless \ntheir opinions on this matter are earnestly sought and discussed, and studied \nfully and thoroughly. \nFrom 1981 to 1990 China's GNP grew at an average annual rate of \n8.9 per cent. In the 1980s significant changes took place in China. We enjoy \npolitical stability, economic prosperity, national unity and harmony. The \nChinese people are enjoying their lives and work. \nSince the beginning of the 1990s people in China have been working hard \nto accelerate economic development and the reform and opening-up programme. \nSpurred by Deng Xiaoping's remarks at the beginning of the year, this \nprogramme and economic development have entered a new phase. The GNP growth \nrate this year is projected to reach and even exceed 9 per cent. China's \neconomy has great vitality and its prospects are bright. \nChina has expanded its open areas. As a result, a new pattern of general \nopening up has gradually taken shape, extending from coastal to border areas, \nfrom areas along the Yangtze river to the provincial capitals. China has \nfurther expanded the scale on which it can absorb foreign investment. In the \nfirst half of this year contracted foreign investment reached $14.6 billion, \n2.2 times what it was in the same period last year. During the same period \nChina's imports and exports reached $33.06 billion and $35.61 billion \nrespectively, up 23.4 per cent and 17.3 per cent over the same period last \nyear. The total volume of foreign trade for the year is expected to exceed \n$150 billion. \nChina's reform and opening-up programme is by no means a matter of \nexpediency; rather, it is a long-term strategy, for it conforms to the popular \nwill and benefits the people. Therefore, it enjoys their support and is bound \nto succeed. China is a force working steadfastly for world peace; its \npolitical stability and the success of its reform and opening up will \ncontribute significantly to peace and development in Asia and the world at \nlarge. China will, as always, support the United Nations in its constructive \nefforts to promote peace and development. It will, together with the \nGovernments and peoples of other countries, work for the establishment of a \nnew world order conducive to world peace and common development. "

        "file_text": "Costa Rica took great pleasure in supporting the election of Mr. Stoyan Ganev \nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. His \nelection bears witness to a new era in the history of Bulgaria, an era of \nfreedom and pluralistic democracy. \nMy delegation sincerely congratulates the Secretary-General on his \nmasterful guidance of the work of the United Nations. Under his leadership \nthe Organization is with ever greater vigour assuming the central role that it \nshould play in international affairs. \nCosta Rica warmly welcomes all the new Members of the United Nations. \nTheir presence in this Hall symbolizes the birth of a new era in international \nrelations based on the ideals of peace and freedom and cooperation between all \npeoples. \nMankind has seen the threat of nuclear holocaust lifted; it has seen the \nEast-West ideological and military confrontation fade. But super-Power \nconfrontation has been replaced, quickly and bloodily, by conflicts whose \nseemingly lesser magnitude does not make them any the less dangerous to world \npeace. \nThe outbreak for the most absurd reasons of a number of conventional \nwars confirms our belief that it is more important than ever to make progress \nin the field of disarmament. The end of the East-West conflict provides a \nunique opportunity to make decisive advances in that sphere and to impose \nstrict controls on the arms trade. The fading of the nuclear threat must not \ntake us back to the era of continuous war. \nOld sins cast long shadows. Today, as in 1914, we look with dismay \nat events in the Balkans. A State Member of the United Nations, Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, is fighting for survival in the midst of a bloody and \nunjustifiable war. Peace initiatives fail one after the other. A final \nsolution to this senseless holocaust is not yet in sight. \nCosta Rica is deeply concerned at the dimensions this regional European \nconflict is taking on, and at the number of innocent victims, which grows \ndaily. The international community reacts tepidly, and, incomprehensibly, is \nreluctant to take the firm and vigorous stand that returned sovereignty to \nKuwait. \nHow many thousands of deaths must there be for a conflict to be worthy of \ninternational interest? The case of Somalia reveals how far we still have to \ngo before we can truly speak of a family of united nations. The conflict in \nSomalia did not command our interest until 2 million people were about to die \nof hunger and our consciences were struck by the terrible images of Somali \nchildren begging for food. Regrettably the tragedy of Somalia is only the \nmost terrible aspect of the tragedy of sub-Saharan Africa, which is suffering \na slow death of despair, hunger, poverty and underdevelopment and is met with \nthe indifference of the community of nations. \nThe end of the cold war has not decreased the depth of the abyss between \nnorth and south; indeed, it increases daily with technological advances. \nThird world countries not only do not receive an adequate response to their \nneeds and expectations, but are witnessing a reduction in outlets for their \nproducts and in financial aid for development. The stagnation of the Uruguay \nRound, the increase in protective measures adopted by industrialized nations, \nand the reductions in development programmes are, oddly, occurring at a time \nwhen Latin America has become a continent of democracies and when many African \nand Asian countries have again taken the road to civil and political liberty. \nSome regrettable steps backwards have already been taken. Latin American \ndemocracy has suffered severe setbacks in Peru and Haiti. In Peru there seems \nto be movement towards a solution, despite the fact that the country is still \noverrun by the irrationality of terrorism and the worst economic situation in \nits history. In contrast, the problem in Haiti, the poorest and most \nunderdeveloped country in the Americas, grows worse every day. Because Costa \nRica belongs to the Caribbean, Haiti's tragedy is of special concern to us. \nMy country believes that both the United Nations and the regional \norganizations should pay more attention to this matter and strive harder for a \nprompt solution to the crisis. We are not talking about the legitimacy of a \npresident or a government, but about the right of a sister nation to live in \nfreedom and receive the cooperation it desperately needs for its development. \nI have mentioned only two examples, but I believe they are dramatically \nrepresentative. An overwhelming majority of third world democracies are still \non the road to consolidation. This consolidation will be difficult, however, \nwithout a substantial improvement in their economic and social conditions, \nwhich in turn requires that developed countries change their attitude in \nrespect to opening their markets and increasing their cooperation. It need \nhardly be said that the worse the conditions become in third world countries, \nthe greater will be the number of legal or illegal immigrants to developed \ncountries, despite the ethnocentric, racist movements which, shamefully in \nthis era, are again on the rise. \nNeedless to say, the third world countries must do their part too. \nInternational cooperation, regardless of its magnitude, will not change the \nsituation of the receiving country if it does not exert a disciplined and \ndetermined effort to make progress. \nIt is no secret that in many cases financial aid intended for development \nhas been misspent on unproductive and grandiose projects. It has been used to \npay salaries and has even been placed in personal bank accounts. Meanwhile, \nthe people continue to suffer hunger and poverty. Therefore if cooperation \nwith the underdeveloped countries is to increase, those countries must fight \nharder against bureaucracy and administrative corruption and must redouble \ntheir efforts to ensure that international aid truly fulfils its objectives. \nAt a time when the economic situation is difficult even for many \nindustrialized nations, and when the European Community is undergoing one of \nthe worst monetary crises of its history, priority should also be given to \nincreasing South-South cooperation. Each of us has something to give and \nsomething to receive. The common condition of third world countries does not \nprevent us from recognizing that there are many stages of development and many \npossibilities for cooperation. Moreover, the growing importance of \nintegration institutions offers a great opportunity to intensify the levels of \ninterregional cooperation by means of effective and coordinated actions which \nwill contribute to fortifying the democratic system through economic and \nsocial progress. \nCosta Rica wishes to stress the efforts to ensure coordination and \ncooperation being made by the countries of Latin America; they clearly show \nthe region's determination to resolve differences through the use of machinery \nfor peaceful settlement established in international law. In this connection, \nmy Government congratulates El Salvador and Honduras on completing their case \nbefore the International Court of Justice, making it possible to settle their \nborder conflict. At the same time, we express our satisfaction with the \nefforts being made by Ecuador and Peru to find a just and final solution to \nthe bilateral border dispute which for so many years has existed between these \ntwo fraternal countries. \nDemocracy can flourish only if electoral pluralism is combined with \nrespect for human rights. Costa Rica assigns primary importance to these \nrights, which for many years now we have made the foundation for both our \ninternal life and our external policies. Consequently, my country takes a \ngreat interest in the World Conference on Human Rights, scheduled to be held \nin Vienna next year, and we are very happy to serve as the site of the \npreparatory meeting for the Latin American and Caribbean region. We are also \npleased to know that during the Vienna Conference some countries will discuss \nthe possibility of creating the post of United Nations High Commissioner for \nHuman Rights. Costa Rica has submitted this idea to the General Assembly \nrepeatedly since the 1970s, and we firmly hope that it will finally take shape \nat the World Conference. \nMy delegation also wishes to express Costa Rica's firm support for the \nmechanism established by the Economic and Social Council in 1991 to allow the \nCommission on Human Rights to hold special sessions to take up serious \nviolations of fundamental rights. We deem it necessary to continue the search \nfor flexible machinery which will stop and prevent massive violations of human \nrights in a timely manner. We should like to recall here the Costa Rican \nproposal - approved by the Human Rights Committee at the beginning of this \nyear for a treaty on prevention of torture. \nThe negotiations on the complex problems of South Africa and the Middle \nEast are doubtless of great importance to the cause of human rights. \nIn this and other forums my country has rigorously condemned the \napartheid regime, an offensive and unjustifiable anachronism that deprives the \nmajority of the South African people of their fundamental rights. We have \nwelcomed, with optimism, the beginning of negotiations between the Pretoria \nregime and the African National Congress, and we firmly hope that, leaving \naside the reprehensible acts that have occurred in Ciskei and other parts of \nSouth Africa, the renewed peace talks will soon lead to the construction of a \nnew, democratic and peace-loving South Africa that will work towards the \ndevelopment of the entire continent. Costa Rica urges that resolute steps be \ntaken in that direction. \nThe need for long-lasting peace in the Middle East has been a matter of \nconstant concern to the United Nations almost ever since it was established. \nNow, for the first time in the eventful history of this region, effective \npeace talks are taking place with the participation of all interested \nparties. Nevertheless, it is my Government's opinion that this process should \nmove faster and should be accompanied by a substantial improvement in the \nhuman rights situation in the Middle East without distinction as to race, \nnationality or religious creed. It is important that in this case, as in many \nother cases, the international community should contribute, in a vigilant \nmanner, to promoting peace and assuring respect for the fundamental rights of \nindividuals and communities. \nPeace is possible regardless of the number of human lives lost in a \nconflict or of how much damage has been caused. Human beings are capable of \nforgetting extremism and of talking with their opponents when the future of \ntheir children is at stake. The recent history of Central America is vivid \nProof that a cruel and lengthy conflict can be stopped by means of negotiation. \nDuring the 1980s, Central America suffered an unprecedented political and \nsecurity crisis marked by intimations of totalitarism and by guerrilla \nactivity, flows of refugees, an arms buildup, the destruction of \ninfrastructure and an alarming extension of the East-West confrontation. \nFortunately, today most of these features belong to the past. Democracy and \npolitical freedom reign in all the Central American countries, several \nnational reconciliation processes are at present under way, arms limitation \ntalks are moving ahead and a vigorous effort for integration is in progress. \nNevertheless, the experience of Central America also shows the \ninternational community that it is very difficult to consolidate advances \nachieved in matters relating to peace and democracy if the underlying reality \nof underdevelopment and poverty continues to exist. The democratic and \npeaceful Central America of today has seen the world lose interest in its \nproblems. It has witnessed a decline in the cooperation that existed when it \nwas in turmoil. The Latin American peoples' effort to change their destiny \nhas collided with the increasing indifference of the developed nations. \nFinancial aid is being reduced. Coffee and bananas, our leading export \nproducts, are encountering more and more obstacles. We are being urged to \ndiversify our production, but international markets are not opening up to us. \nCentral America is being urged to advance towards democracy without our being \ngiven the tools that will lead us to development. Political democracy alone, \nregrettably, is not a panacea for the social problems of our countries. It is \ntrue that it is possible to live in democracy even with poverty, but in \ncountries that have just started to experience democracy, democracy will not \nsink its roots very deep if it is not accompanied by improvements in \nnutrition, housing and public health. \nIt is not possible to approach most of the subjects being discussed here, \nincluding international cooperation, from one point of view alone. The \npresent international situation is an especially promising opportunity for all \nnations, regardless of their resources, to work in a coordinated manner to \ncombat common enemies and to build a better world for our children. This \nplurality of vision is, for example, the only way to confront, with any \nprospect of success, the problem of drug trafficking and production, which is \nharmful to producing and consumer countries alike, and is aggravated by the \naccompanying terrorism and guerrilla warfare. \nUnquestionably, the most important problem we must face as a species is \nthat of saving the planet's ecological, economic and social integrity, for \nourselves and for future generations. Costa Rica, which has been a victim, \nlike many other countries, of the irrational destruction and exploitation of \nits national resources, has reconsidered and now emphasizes the need for a new \ninternational ecological order that will save mankind from its progressive \nenvironmental suicide and reorient the course of its development. \nI am very pleased to announce to this Assembly that, in accordance with \nCosta Rica's offer of 3 September to set up, in the capital city of my \ncountry, the organizing committee of the Earth Council, a non-governmental \norganization that will supplement and support governmental follow-up of the \nRio agreements. \nThe Rio Conference, regardless of all its limitations, is a magnificent \nlandmark in the fight against environmental degradation and unsustainable \ndevelopment patterns. But how much has really been done to put into effect \nwhat was agreed there? Will we limit ourselves to regarding the Rio \nConference as a kind of community of ecological nations packed with \nfine-sounding words and good intentions but lacking results? \nThe triumph of ecological degradation creates only losers. Safeguarding \nthe environment, sustainable development and the struggle against poverty are \njoint responsibilities of both the industrialized and the underdeveloped \nworld. Hence the United Nations is an ideal forum for making efforts in that \ndirection, for demanding compliance with the Rio resolutions and for imposing \nsanctions on those Members that disregard them. While there are mechanisms \nfor collective international action to combat threats to international peace \nand security, there should also be, within the United Nations, procedures for \nacting against those who endanger human survival, the planet's resources and \nsocial justice, and for imposing sanctions against them. \nAs the Secretary-General has stated, the question of world peace, \nstability and security should include subjects other than military matters. \nIt is logical, then, that the changes that have taken place in the world and \nthe new realities being encountered by mankind today make it imperative for \nthe United Nations, a pillar of the joint efforts of nations, to reorganize in \norder to fulfil its important mission more effectively. From this \nperspective, my country considers it indispensable that the United Nations \nshould comply fully with the principle of universality and open its doors to \nthose who, for various reasons, have been forced to remain outside it. \nOf special concern to us is the case of the Republic of China in Taiwan, \na democratic community of 21 million people with a brilliant economic \ndevelopment record whose reality cannot continue to be ignored by an \nOrganization that takes pride in having gone beyond the patterns of the cold \nwar. \nIn addition, it is imperative that the structures and procedures of the \nUnited Nations be revised to conform with the realities of our times. The \nSecretary-General, in his outstanding report, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", has \nwritten with commendable accuracy about the most important aspects which need \nto be modified in a relatively short period of time. Costa Rica wishes today \nto declare that it shares most of the concerns stated in that document and \nurges all Member States to begin a vigorous effort for institutional renewal. \nOne of the most important areas that should be revised is the Security \nCouncil, in terms of its make-up and objectives. We believe that the number \nof permanent members should be increased, in accordance with the new realities \nof the international scene, and based on better and greater geographical \nrepresentation. We also deem it necessary to reconsider the institution of \nthe veto and reflect upon the corresponding role of the Council in maintaining \nworld peace and security, as well as its relationship to the General \nAssembly. Some thought should also be given to strengthening, modernizing and \nreducing bureaucracy in the Economic and Social Council. \nThis is a good time also to mention the importance of coordination \nbetween the United Nations and other international forums. Regardless of the \ninevitable difficulties, the integration movement continues apace in Europe, \nAsia, South America and Central America. We the Central Americans, joined by \ndemocracy in all our countries, have reconsidered our outmoded system of \nintegration to adapt it to the new regional realities, and only a few months \nago the Treaty that establishes, on a new basis, the Central American \nIntegration System came into force. Costa Rica is confident that this new \norganization will become the arena for persistent efforts towards our shared \nfuture and in keeping with the Secretary-General's proposal, it will shortly \nbe in a position to request observer status in the United Nations. \nIn a few days the anniversary of the meeting of two hemispheres the \nmeeting of the whole world with itself - will be celebrated. Since the dawn \nof that day, a Friday in October, mankind was able to start thinking with a \nsense of family and of inevitable common destiny. Now, on the threshold of \nthe third millennium, that unavoidable mission of mankind is stronger than \never before, and the United Nations is its most important embodiment. \nHere at the United Nations, and in everyone's country and in everyone's \nhome, the wise words of sura XXVIII of the Holy Koran hold true: \n\\\"... [Do not] forget thy portion in this \nWorld: but do thou good. \nAs God has been good \nTo thee ... \n\\\"That Home of the Hereafter \nWe shall give to those \nWho intend not high-handedness \nOr mischief on earth: \nAnd the End is (best) \nFor the righteous.\\\" (The Holy Koran. XXVIII:77.83) "

        "file_text": "At the outset, I should like to congratulate the \nPresident and the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly on their respective \nelection. I am certain that their recognized personal qualities guarantee, in \nthe eyes of all those present, an outstanding stewardship of our work. \nI thank the outgoing President, Ambassador Samir Shihabi, for the \ndedication he showed throughout the last session of the General Assembly, \nthereby contributing to the consolidation of the process leading to the reform \nof the Assembly. \n \nI also address the Secretary-General, under whose aegis it has already \nbeen possible to take concrete and decisive steps towards a thorough reform of \nthe Organization and the restructuring of the Secretariat along more flexible \nand operational lines. My Government appreciates that initiative and gives it \nits full support. Portugal views \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277) in that \nlight. As was made clear by the British Foreign Secretary Mr. Douglas Hurd, \nwho spoke this morning on behalf of the European Community and its member \nStates, we believe that the proposals presented by Mr. Boutros-Ghali deserve \nspecial attention. \nIt fell to Portugal to preside over the European Community Council of \nMinisters during a period of turmoil in recent history. Everywhere \ntraditional alignments are disappearing. Regimes which until recently were \nheld to be unchangeable are giving way to new institutions, oriented towards \nthe defence of human dignity and democratic pluralism. The legacy of several \ndecades has been shaken up in a few short years. \nDuring the first half of 1992 the Portuguese Presidency of the Council \nsought to promote a greater opening of the Community to the outside. I do not \nspeak merely of enlargement and political dialogue; I speak of modalities of \ncooperation and assistance and the presentation of constructive proposals to \ndeal with important issues in international economic relations. I also speak \nof the incentives for regional integration throughout the world. \nFurthermore, the external activity of the European Community did not \nignore crisis situations. In this respect, the conflict involving several \nrepublics of the former Yugoslavia stands out. Priority was given to the \ninvolvement of the United Nations in the search for a political solution to \nthat grave crisis. We sought from the beginning to generate synergism between \n\nthe efforts of the European Community and the action of the Secretary-General \nand the Security Council. I believe that the degree achieved, both at the \nlevel of the decision-making bodies of the two organizations and in the field, \nwhere European Community monitors and United Nations peace-keeping forces are \ndeployed, is extremely positive. I am certain that it will have to continue \nto be so. \nI should like to take this opportunity to reiterate Portugal's full \nagreement with the principles and measures defined at the recent London \nConference. They are the basis for a negotiated settlement of the problems of \nthe former Yugoslavia. We support the peace process that was relaunched on \nthat occasion under the experienced guidance of Lord Owen and \nMr. Cyrus Vance. The foundation of that process consists of work already done \nin the framework of the Conference presided over by Lord Carrington, to whom I \nam grateful for his competence and dedication. \nLastly, I must pay tribute, for the tasks they have performed, under \ncircumstances of extreme hardship, even involving the sacrifice of their own \nlives, to the members of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), in \nwhich Portugal has the privilege of participating, the European Community \nmonitoring mission and all the humanitarian agencies involved. \nI have been emphasizing that the road to progress is built on a sharing \nof responsibility by various actors in the international community. It was in \nthat light that Lisbon hosted last May the Conference on assistance to the \nnewly independent States. \nFollowing the first Conference on that subject, the Washington \nConference, we sought to give an answer to the challenges presented by the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union, an event which I then considered to be among the \n\nmost significant of the century. Aware of the obstacles to be overcome, the \nparticipating countries agreed to lend their support to structural programmes \nof assistance and economic cooperation in a macroeconomic sense. Such actions \nwould complement and not duplicate the programmes being implemented by several \nfinancial institutions. \nAs for the political side of the Conference, it was restated that the new \nStates must try to develop progressively a regional form of cooperation \nreflecting the mutual dependence that exists in so many vital sectors. \nTo that aim we must add the demand for full respect for the principles of \nthe Charter of the United Nations and the commitments of the Conference on \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Such conduct is essential for \ncontinued assistance and the process of democratic reform. \nWe are witnessing events of great scope and significance in other parts \nof the world. The Middle East peace process exhibits a new and encouraging \nvitality which must be fostered by all. There are no viable alternatives to \nthat process, which was initiated in Madrid. \nPortugal, like its partners in the Community, considers that any just, \nlasting and comprehensive settlement of the question of the Middle East must \nbe based upon Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). That \nbelief was reiterated in June, together with a message of hope from the \nEuropean Community Council meeting in Lisbon. It is now reinforced by the new \npolicies of the Israeli Government, and it will be further strengthened by \ngestures of reciprocity from the Arab Governments. \nWe have always advocated the presence of the United Nations in the peace \nprocess, commensurate with the importance of its role in international \npolitics in general and the Middle East in particular. \n \nSecurity and stability in the Mediterranean are vital strategic factors \nfor Europe, especially for those States that, like ours, are close neighbours \nof that region. In this regard, the Maghreb is particularly relevant for us. \nGeographical proximity, a common history and close ties justify the genuine \nconcern with which we have followed the political, social and economic \nproblems the Maghreb is experiencing. We are aware that their effects \nthreaten a delicate balance and the well-being of its populations. \nFor these reasons, the European Community is committed to strengthening \nregional solidarity and establishing innovative forms of dialogue and \ncooperation reflecting the aims of partnership that motivate both sides. The \nLisbon meeting of the European Community Council confirmed this view of the \nfuture in a clear Declaration which will renew the ties between the European \nCommunity and the Maghreb in all fields. \nThough an Atlantic country, Portugal does not forsake its Mediterranean \nheritage. \nPortugal devotes special attention to Africa. We follow with expectancy \nand optimism the processes of reconciliation and democratization under way \nthroughout southern Africa. \nIn Angola the day of the long-awaited general elections is nearing. In \nspite of the structural and logistical difficulties, I am certain that, \nwhatever the outcome, the Angolan people will find their way towards a \npluralistic and tolerant society, whose foundations will be the nation's \nenormous potential and its human and natural resources. \nTurning to Mozambique, Portugal gladly welcomes the recent meeting \nbetween President Chissano and Mr. Afonso Dhlkama, President of RENAMO. \nMutual trust and open dialogue are, and will continue to be, decisive for an \n\nirreversible advance of the Mozambican peace process. We therefore hope that \nthe spirit of Rome will remain alive among all the participants. \nEverything indicates that the United Nations will play a preponderant \nrole in the subsequent stages of the process. In the wake of the success of \nthe United Nations involvement in Angola, I appeal to the Organization to give \nthe attention, the means and the resources needed so that Mozambique in its \nturn, in the near future, may reach peace, democracy and long-sought economic \nprogress. \nAs for South Africa, a country which is vital to regional stability, \nPortugal has maintained close contacts with its major political forces, urging \nthem to engage in dialogue and practise tolerance. \nA drastic reduction in social tension and the resumption of talks in the \nframework of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) are an \nabsolute priority which we must pursue so as to eradicate the structural \ncauses of a decades-old conflict. \n\nPortugal wholeheartedly supports the sending of United Nations, European \nCommunity and Organization of African Unity observers to South Africa. These \nobservers may play a significant role. We see no credible alternative to this \nconcerted effort. \nWe have sought to encourage the dialogue between Europe and Latin America \nin this period of noteworthy development and regional integration \ninitiatives. In this respect I should like to emphasize the significance of \nthe Eighth Ministerial Meeting of the San Jose countries, held in Lisbon, and \nthe Second Institutionalized Ministerial Meeting of the Rio Group, held in \nSantiago. At both meetings, new forms of cooperation were established \nagreement on the promotion of human rights at the first and on greater \ninvolvement of the European Investment Bank in programmes for the development \nof the South American continent at the second. \nMan is the reason for all our efforts. His dignity is, after all, our \nguiding universal value. Thus it is not legitimate to allow the collapse of \nGovernments, civil wars or adverse natural conditions to jeopardize human \nlives and render mere survival a daily battle. \nPortugal associates itself with the efforts under way to ease the \nsuffering of the civilian population of Somalia, a crisis which is constantly \nin our minds. Despite all the actions carried out by the international \ncommunity, a solution to this tragedy is yet to be found. Situations such as \nthese must be faced and dealt with in a different way. Relief for the \nafflicted populations comes before any local political conditionalities and \ncannot be subject to any preconditions or distortions whatsoever in it's \ndistribution. There is clearly a need for preventive action by the United \nNations, making available the necessary humanitarian aid and peace-keeping \nforces in the early stages of crises whenever possible. \n \nThe defence of each individual's dignity, an aim which must guide us at \nall times, has been the leitmotif of my statement as the representative of \nPortugal. \nThe universal and indivisible nature of human rights is a principle which \ndeserves general acceptance. Portugal maintains that condemnation of any \nviolations of such rights can no longer be considered to be interference in \nthe internal affairs of a State. We believe that the observance of the main \ninternational covenants is a fundamental condition for peace and progress. In \nthis respect, we state unequivocally that there is a direct link between human \nrights, democracy and development; that is, development aid, in order to be \nproductive and therefore justifiable presupposes the practice of democracy \nand fundamental freedoms at the receiving end. We still have a long way to go. \nI should like once more to alert the international community to the \nsituation in East Timor, a Non-Self-Governing Territory under Portuguese \nauthority illegally occupied by Indonesia, in violation of the principles \nenshrined in the United Nations Charter and the relevant resolutions of the \nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council. \nWe all recall the tragic events that took place in Dili's Santa Cruz \ncemetery on 12 November 1991, which rightly received universal condemnation. \nWhen faced with unprecedented criticism, the Indonesian Government made \npromises, set up committees of inquiry, offered condolences and subscribed to a \nconsensus statement of the Commission on Human Rights. Nevertheless, it \nrefused to accept any inquiry under international supervision which could shed \nlight on what had happened and clarify the circumstances which made it \npossible. The subsequently released report of the inquiry that did take place \ndid little in this respect. \n\nOn the other hand, heavy prison sentences including a life term were \ngiven to survivors of the killing, not indicted for violent activities, while \nthe military personnel involved in the shooting were charged with mere \ndisciplinary offences and given purely token prison terms. \nAll of this contradicted the undertaking in the Commission on Human \nRights, as the Sub-commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of \nMinorities recently recognized in a resolution adopted for the first time by \nan absolute majority. \nTo avoid the repetition of massacres and other grave violations of human \nrights, we must address the true causes of this situation and initiate a new \nstage of consideration of the issue. Portugal, in its capacity as \nadministering Power recognized by the United Nations, presented to the \nSecretary-General last January a proposal for a dialogue, without \npreconditions and under his auspices, with Indonesia and all the parties \ndirectly involved. The objective is a just, comprehensive and internationally \nacceptable solution, with full respect for the legitimate interests of the \nEast Timorese people, including the right to self-determination, in conformity \nwith the principles of the Charter and international law. \nTo that end, we have spared no effort and look forward to hearing the \nresults of the Secretary-General's initiative when, in the next few days in \nNew York, he will host an informal meeting of the Foreign Ministers of \nPortugal and Indonesia. \nIn conclusion, I recall that a year ago I exhorted all States Members of \nthe Organization to work together to achieve the essential aims of the Charter. \nThe responsibilities placed upon my Government in the course of 1992 have \ngiven us a clearer perception of the nature of the arduous tasks before us. \n\nIt is our duty to correct history's errors towards man, guided by legal and, \nabove all, ethical principles, so that future generations may remember us \nthrough a legacy of justice and peace. \n"

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, I should like to convey the sincere congratulations of the delegation \nof Burkina Faso to Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency of the \nforty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. In him, \nwe pay a tribute to Bulgaria and to the qualities that earned him these \nresponsibilities. \nWe also pay a tribute to the devotion and conscientiousness with which \nhis predecessor, Ambassador Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, performed his duties. \nNine months after our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, \nassumed his post, his energy, creative imagination and firm determination have \nleft their mark on the activities of our Organization. By strengthening its \nuniversality, all the countries that have been admitted since the forty-sixth \nsession give us grounds for joy. We wish them all a warm welcome and we have \nno doubt that we will all work together to attain the ideals of the United \nNations Charter. \nOur times have seen the irrepressible aspirations of peoples to freedom, \nnational identity, and well-being flourish with more vigour and insistence \nthan ever before. For some, these aspirations arose from the depths of their \nalienation, which they now reject; for others, from the example thus set by \nthe former. Baptized as a \\\"wave of democratization\\\", this tempest, sometimes \ncoinciding with developments already under way, swept away many inappropriate \nor obsolete human edifices to lay bare the ruins or foundations from which we \nmust start building. \nBorn in 1987, the democratization movement in Burkina Faso, after years \nof an emergency regime, led to pluralism, to the election of a Head of State \non 1 December 1987, and to general elections held in May 1992, in which the \npolitical parties asked the people for their votes. Today, democratic \ninstitutions are in place and the opposition, which sits in the Assembly, is \nalso represented in the executive branch, where it holds several ministerial \nportfolios. This transition has been without jolts or major crises, and has \nled to the social peace necessary to our development efforts. \nThis indispensable social peace is what is lacking in Somalia, where our \nfamished brothers are dying at a mind-boggling rate, whereas weapons are \nubiquitous there and have made that martyred country a victim bled dry by \nintransigence and the absence of dialogue. In this respect, we welcome the \nhealthy reaction of our Secretary-General, who is trying to size up the true \nscale of this tragedy and to find the requisite solutions. We are equally \ngrateful for the international humanitarian assistance channelled there. But \nmuch remains to be done to curtail and end the sufferings of the Somalian \npeople. \nLiberia is still in the throes of a civil war to which Burkina Faso and \nthe other countries of the region cannot remain indifferent. Burkina Faso, \nshoulder to shoulder with them, will spare no effort to restore lasting peace \nso that the policy of economic integration, begun within the framework of the \nEconomic Community of West African States, can also be pursued as well as \npossible. \nIn Angola, general elections are under way after 16 years of conflict \nsuffered by the Angolan people. We hail the maturity of all Angolans, who \nhave thereby agreed to close a difficult chapter in their history. The United \nNations also played a positive role there. We hope that these developments \nwill be successful. In Mozambique, similarly, a solution is in the offing, \nand we hope that a negotiated settlement will restore peace. \nIn South Africa, the hopes of the international community have been \ndimmed by the massacres of Boipatong and Ciskei. These events certainly were \na manifestation of apartheid, whose death throes are just as repugnant and \nbloody as was its existence. We need to remind the South African authorities \nthat they are responsible for the security of every South African and that \nthese tragic excesses cannot simply be ascribed to animosity among blacks. It \nis now well established that subtle manipulation, together with an absence of \nsecurity controls, can fan the flames of an already explosive situation. The \nresumption of the Convention for Democratic South Africa (CODESA) should take \nplace in a climate free of the suspicion born of manoeuvring and calculation. \nIn this respect, we believe that Security Council 765 (1992) of 16 July 1992 \nis only one step in the right direction. In order to assess the methods and \neffects of violence, more than 50 observers will be needed. \nIn the Middle East, the process begun at the Madrid Conference has yet to \nproduce the hoped-for results. The Palestinian question remains and the \naspirations of the Palestinian people are legitimate and justified. The \npolitical changes that have taken place in Israel raise hopes that we would \nwish to see fulfilled on behalf of the people of the region. \nIn Cambodia, efforts must continue to be made by all to implement the \nParis Agreements. The unprecedented commitment of the United Nations should \nbe welcomed, encouraged and reinforced. \nIn the heart of Europe, a conflict is developing, the nature of which is \nwhat observers tend to limit exclusively to Africa. Practices we thought had \ndisappeared with nazism and condemned alongside apartheid are emerging under \nthe label \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\". This is unacceptable. We cannot accept that \nBosnia and Herzegovina be crucified in the name of religion or ethnicity. The \nLondon agreement and the Geneva negotiations must be complied with and pursued \nby all parties sincerely desirous of peace and reconciliation. \nThat picture does not inspire optimism. The collapse of one of the two \nblocs did not solve the world's problems. Rather, it emphasized the \nNorth-South split; old wounds that are still open; internal contradictions \nwithin regions; and divisions among nations. \nIn their millions, people are cast out into a life of wandering; children \nare robbed of their childhood, and of their adolescence too; a future without \nhope is already the lot of a growing number of people caught in the crossfire \nbetween one world that is dying and another that is being born. In the midst \nof all the uncertainty, the United Nations seemed to be a place of recourse \nwhere East, West, North and South could meet to accept the principles of the \nCharter and institute methods guaranteeing that armed force would not be used \nsave in the common interest, and to promote social progress and better \nstandards of life in wider freedom. \nSecurity, solidarity, progress and freedom: these are words and concepts \nthat 47 years after San Francisco have yet to be given form in the interest of \nthe world's peoples. \nThe Secretary-General's proposals in his Agenda for Peace and in his \nannual report on the work of the Organization form a good basis for discussion. \nIt must be recalled and stressed that security not based on the interests \nof all, large and small, is self-limited. The maintenance of peace demands \nweighty and onerous operations that must be commensurate with the needs. It \nis right to stress preventive diplomacy: machinery for early warning and \naction that can be put into play before a conflict breaks out or that can \nprevent a conflict from taking place. \nThe United Nations, while in demand on all sides, remains available. It \nis regrettable that among the defenders of this new role for the Organization \nare those who by not paying their contributions are handicapping the United \nNations in this basic task. \nWe must ensure that the role of the Security Council does not give rise \nto questions about its involvement, its impartiality or its sense of \nfairness. The system devised 47 years ago has only been able to function for \ntwo years, and already there are concerns, some of which are justified. \nDepending on their geographical zone, conflicts seem to attract varying \ndegrees of vigorous attention from the Council. This makes us believe that a \nstructure created following the Second World War is now beginning to function \nin a completely different context. Some even talk of an anachronism. \nClearly, the role and composition of the Security Council must be reviewed. \nBut we fear that the discussion might be limited to merely expanding a club \nwhose members would continue to view their status as a privilege, not a \nweighty responsibility. The spirit and perhaps even the nature of the Council \nmust be changed. Clearly, we must begin the debate on the Security Council, \neven if we are still bound by the terms of Article 108 of the Charter. The \ndemocratization of international relations is necessary. \nThere can be no true security or just and lasting peace while three \nquarters of mankind continues to live in destitution, wretchedness and \nignorance. That is a fact that has been repeated in this Hall over the years \nby a majority of delegations. Today's world is a world in flux, where the old \nquestions remain and new solutions are taking too long in coming. \nThe North-South rift I mentioned before can be illustrated by figures, \nincluding the well-known fact that 20 per cent of the world's population \nreceives 83 per cent of the world's income, while the poorest 20 per cent \nshare but 1.4 per cent of the world's income. \nBeset by natural disasters, conflicts and the effects of an international \neconomic crisis, Africa still bears an external debt of more than \n$236.7 billion; it faces tariff and customs barriers erected by some of its \neconomic partners; and it must deal with a high rate of population growth. To \nthis we must add the obligatory adoption of structural adjustment programmes \nthat will first cause pain before possibly doing some good. \\\"Possibly\\\" is the \nright word, since these adjustments are put in place in a context of economic \nuncertainty that jeopardizes the results for which we hope. Thus, we in \nBurkina Faso are working to obtain all the necessary support so that slippages \nwill not call into question our political achievements, and particularly so \nthat the structural-adjustment programme can lay the lasting foundations of \ngenuine development and growth. \nThe rewards of the tireless efforts by African countries have not been \ncommensurate with the sacrifices we have made. The promises of the North \nremain promises, just as the United Nations Programme of Action for African \nEconomic Recovery and Development has not been truly implemented, except by \nAfricans themselves. A new page has been turned with the new programme for \nthe 1990s, but that page remains blank. We hail the few industrialized \ncountries that have honoured their commitment to contribute 0.7 per cent of \ntheir gross domestic product as official development assistance. \nThe international economic context is marked by increased monetary \ninstability, slower economic growth, high unemployment and the relative \nfailure of the Uruguay Round. But capital needs are first met among the \nindustrialized countries before they turn to so-called transitional \neconomies. Can we speak of competition for capital? Or must we say that \nAfrica is simply waiting for a response that has not been forthcoming? The \nresponse we want to hear and to turn into reality is the economic integration \nof our continent South-South cooperation along with allowing us the \nlatitude of choice. As we said at the forty-sixth session, Burkina Faso is \nconvinced that all our problems \\\"can be solved only by dialogue and \nnegotiation between developed and developing countries with a view to bringing \nabout specific solutions through a multilateral approach to these problems\\\". \n(A/46/PV.4. p. 56) \nThat was our approach to the United Nations Conference on Environment and \nDevelopment the Earth Summit at Rio, and that was why we welcomed the \nframework Convention on climate change and the Convention on biodiversity. \nThe establishment of a commission for sustainable development could \ndefine the framework for what we have come to call the new global \npartnership. But as we all know, the Rio summit will be meaningful only if it \nis followed by the needed commitments with respect to additional resources and \ntechnology transfers. The Earth Summit has made the link between environment \nand development indissoluble. \nWe welcome the decision of the United Nations Conference on Environment \nand Development to set up an intergovernmental negotiating committee to draw \nup an international convention in the struggle against desertification. \nBurkina Faso will participate actively in that process and could act as host \nto some of the committee's meetings. \nInternational events on the horizon include: the World Conference on \nHuman Rights in 1993; the International Conference on Population and \nDevelopment in 1994; the world summit for social development in 1995; and the \nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, also in 1995. What they have in \ncommon is their subject and their protagonist: man. \nWe have already said that no one is against human rights because those \nrights are inherent in man. A partial, piecemeal vision of human rights would \ndoom mankind to exploitation and abandonment. The right to development, to \nfood, to housing, to primary health care and to education: all these are part \nof human rights. To support that aspect without recognizing and accepting the \nbasic nature of the rights of the individual would clearly be an imperfect \napproach to defining and solving the problem. Likewise, stressing the rights \nof the individual while confining oneself to defending them would be to refuse \nto see the world as it is today. \nIndeed, earlier I spoke of the indomitable nature of the peoples' \naspirations to freedom, national identity and well-being. The revolution in \ncommunication, the spread of ideas, the untapped potential of techniques and \ntechnologies have turned our world into a global village. We cannot \nindefinitely guarantee the security of the haves, the well-fed, to the \ndetriment of others without doing permanent damage to the dignity and \nintegrity of others. \nThat is why Burkina Faso believes that population questions are \nfundamental, and that is why we spoke out in favour of the convening of the \nworld summit for social development. Nor can we approach the question of \nhuman rights and questions of population and development without including \nwomen, the mothers of the world. \nThese future conferences will be fairly meaningless if they do not lead \nto commitments that will lead, in turn, to tangible, concrete and satisfactory \nresults. In that connection the follow-up to the World Summit for Children is \nimportant, and I should like to take this opportunity to remind the \ninternational community that in November at Dakar, Senegal, an African \nregional meeting will be held, under the aegis of the United Nations \nChildren's Fund (UNICEF), to examine and evaluate responses to the commitments \nundertaken at New York in 1990 and to assess the support that could be \nsupplied by all the members of the international community. \nThose meetings are therefore based on the principle of our common \nmembership in the human race and on solidarity. \nIn 1995 the Organization will be 50 years old. The evolution in \ninternational relations has created an ever-greater role for the United \nNations. We can even talk about a central role for it, as a crucial junction \nwhere political, economic, social and environmental concerns can be expressed \nand actually dealt with. \nHitherto regarded as a forum, the United Nations can now add to \ncooperation, deliberation and the ongoing discussion of the trio of peace, \nsecurity and development its status as an unparalleled instrument at the \nservice of joint action for the common good. \nBurkina Faso will follow and actively discuss the various reforms and \nrestructuring being planned for the whole of the United Nations system, for \nit is our conviction that they afford the international community a unique \nopportunity to implement the concept of global partnership. \nIt is only under those conditions that we will at last be able truly to \nimplement the noble ideals of the Charter. It will no longer be a question of \nsome pitted against others but, rather, of fighting the only fight worth \nfighting: the fight for a humanity living at peace in a saved environment. "

He has succeeded \nSecretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, an illustrious Latin American who \ndischarged the duties of the office with great effectiveness, as the new era \nrequired. \nMy presence here, so soon after assuming the Presidency of my country, \nmust be taken as a clear sign of the enormous importance we attach to the \nUnited Nations, its principles and its work, which is increasingly \nfar-reaching and truly valuable, work that is essentially that of keeping the \npeace and, also, of course, bringing about the economic and social development \nof all the peoples on Earth. The latter task is particularly important for \nEcuador, which is striving to overcome underdevelopment and achieve decent \nliving conditions for its people, particularly the great majorities. To that \nend, we have begun to restructure the State, and we have already prescribed \nsome economic measures that will require sacrifice on the part of my \ncompatriots, but that will soon have positive effects. \nThe current international situation, stemming from the end of the cold \nwar, could be said to oscillate between disappointment and hope. There seems \nto exist something more than a truce between ideological rivalries, which we \nhope will lead us to a truer understanding among nations; and with the \nlessening influence of the private interests of individuals and nations, we \nhope it will give way to an international equilibrium which will allow us to \nforge ahead, together, towards universal, stable and lasting peace. \nThat circumstance explains the special importance of the fact that, in \ninternational life, respect for the human being has assumed top priority and \nman finds himself exalted, raised to heights never enjoyed until a few decades \nago. But the continued enjoyment of such a position, despite the \ndiscontinuities still existing in certain corners of the world, requires the \nconstant political commitment of States, which, fortunately, is widespread, to \nthe unconditional implementation of the constitutional and conventional norms \nthat reinforce that conquest at its various levels. \nSpeaking of human rights, my Government is firmly and irrevocably \nresolved to apply, both domestically and internationally, a policy of full \nrespect for, and defence of, those very rights, in consonance with the dignity \nof man, as a tribute to his spirituality and in clear recognition of his \ntranscendental values. Respect for human rights is not a gracious concession \nthat Governments make to their peoples, but rather an unwritten, intrinsic \nobligation of democracy and civil life. The opposite is barbarism, the denial \n \nof some men by others; it is the action of the few who, using the power given \nto them by the community for the common good, distort it and turn it into the \nsupreme evil of pitting man against man. My Government will use any and all \nmeans in the prevention against such ignominy. \nMoreover, one can see that the world community has emphasized, out of a \nconcept of solidarity, not only the promotion of human rights but also the \nrendering of humanitarian assistance to those most in need of it, and has \nfound itself searching for ever more effective mechanisms to extend such \nassistance to all corners of the Earth, wherever violence or natural disasters \ncontinue to breed hunger and despair. \nDespite the fact that we find ourselves in an ever more interdependent \nworld where it is essential that cooperation not be linked to specific \npolitical interests, a world where integration is and must be the language \nwhich best expresses the hopes of peoples, we still face positions that \nprevent economic relations from being equitable to and supportive of \ndeveloping countries within the effective exercise of the principle of \ninternational free trade, towards which my Government is working and will work \naccording to a plan. \nThe success of this new course will depend greatly not only on immense \ndomestic efforts but also on the necessary alignment of the theory of \ninternational solidarity with the real, sincere and favourable response of the \ninternational community, and on the understanding of the industrialized \ncountries concerning the need to settle, on mutually agreeable terms, the \nproblem of the external debt of the least developed countries, whose burden is \nanother of the serious difficulties preventing those countries from developing \n\nand attaining better living standards. It would be most promising were an \nagreement reached on the mechanisms for alleviating this problem, which is at \nthe same time economic and financial, and a problem whose repercussions in the \nsocial and political fields no one now denies. Among such mechanisms, those \naimed at converting external debt into investment, especially in development \nprojects, both social and economic, should be pressed forward. \n\nFortunately the dark atomic threat is disappearing. The agreements and \nundertakings which, with a new vision of the very destiny of mankind, have the \naim of eliminating nuclear arms, are a source of hope. At the same time, they \ncan be the means by which, by eliminating the enormous waste of resources, we \nmay help to solve economic and social problems and embark upon a process of \nfrank cooperation with nations that are in the greatest need of help to raise \ntheir standards of living. \nNotwithstanding these positive advances and these undertakings, we look \nto the future with concern, as the new situation resulting from the historic \ncircumstances of the last two years has not managed to prevent the outburst of \nbloody regional conflicts. Nationalist extremists have produced the \nphenomenon of the exceptionally violent disintegration of States, and in such \na climate new calamities and hardships have arisen. \nA responsible approach to the common obligations of mankind is now more \nimportant than ever before. The world has shrunk physically and in terms of \nhuman relationships. The problems of a particular State affect other States \nin various ways and make it necessary that we take remedial action in a spirit \nof solidarity. \nMeanwhile, the old problems of disparity between an economically powerful \nworld, embracing a limited number of countries, and the developing world, \ncomprising the bulk of mankind, continue to worsen. Insufficient funding for \ndevelopment has become endemic, making necessary decisions on a global basis. \nMoreover, the insufficiency of funding means that all States must carry a fair \nshare of the load. Without help, poor States cannot free themselves from \ntheir condition of impoverishment, and they cannot partake in the enjoyment of \n\na life of dignity, free from the fear of insecurity and poverty. For this \nreason, we firmly support the convening of an international conference on the \nfinancing of development, in order to alleviate in some way the situation of \nthe great number of States that urgently need extensive economic assistance. \nFelipe Herrera, the Chilean to whom Latin America owes so much, used to \nspeak of the \\\"mystique of urgency\\\" that we must regain. Today I pay tribute \nto his memory. The social problems are urgent, and we must press the \ninternational organizations to provide funds accordingly and, in this regard, \nto demonstrate flexibility in keeping with each country's stage of development. \nWe are convinced that international trade, conducted in a transparent, \nnon-discriminatory manner and on equitable terms, will be an important force \nin the revitalization of the world economy and will therefore be important to \nthe developing countries. It is paradoxical and serious that the countries \nthat are the greatest advocates of the elimination of trade barriers maintain, \nand even create new types of, protectionism and discrimination that make it \ndifficult for the products of developing countries to gain access to their \nmarkets. This applies at present, for example, to bananas. And all this is \ntaking place in the interdependent world that I mentioned at the beginning of \nmy statement. \nIn 1962 or 1963, as the representative of the Inter-American Development \nBank, I spoke here about social questions. I believe that once again the \nUnited Nations must give these questions urgent attention. Economic \ndevelopment is important only insofar as it meets human needs. It is time all \ngreat social problems were better understood so that the United Nations might \ndraw up an international programme of action to serve as the basis for the \nconference on social questions that it has been decided to convene. \n \nPreservation of the environment, which is linked inextricably to \nsustainable development, is of enormous importance because of its national and \ninternational impact. The Stockholm Declaration of 1972 represented the first \ninternational step towards the establishment of basic universal principles for \nthe protection of the world's environment. Since 1972 significant efforts \nhave been made to stop pollution of land, seas and air and to prevent \ndesertification and deforestation and other types of ecological damage. \nHowever, the constraints of reality made new initiatives necessary, and \nthese culminated in the Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de \nJaneiro in June 1992 a landmark event whose basic aim was to achieve \nagreement on certain programmes aimed at arresting the steady deterioration of \nthe environment. Let us hope that the outcome of that Conference will be \ngenerally beneficial and will help to guarantee the future development and \nwell-being of mankind. My Government is ready to take action to improve the \nenvironment of its own country and to contribute to universal efforts to \npreserve nature. \nBut I must emphasize that although the developed countries, which are \nmainly responsible for the deterioration of the environment, have a particular \nobligation, it is other countries that are being asked to make the sacrifice \nof restricting the exercise of their legitimate right to use the wealth that \nnature has given them. It is necessary to seek due compensation jointly, \nespecially in the shape of financial aid and technological cooperation. \n\nEcuador, having become a transit country and an operational bridgehead \nfor the drug trade, understands that drug trafficking, money laundering and \nrelated crimes are particularly harmful to young people, threaten democracy, \nproduce an unnatural economy and, above all, damage the moral values of \nnations. We condemn drug trafficking in all its forms, and, while we do what \nwe can to combat it, responsibility must be shared by the producer countries \nand the consumer countries. Thus we support the timely initiative of the \nPresident of Colombia, who, from this rostrum, suggested that a United Nations \nconference on illicit drugs be planned and convened with all the urgency that \nthis matter demands. \nUnresolved economic and social, as well as humanitarian and ecological, \nproblems of overriding importance continue to be a source of instability, and \nthey carry the seeds of damage to international relations and even of conflict. \n \nFor those reasons, the Council requested the Secretary-General to prepare a \nspecial report, appropriately titled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277). \nAs a fresh contribution to previous efforts within the United Nations, \nwhether to strengthen international security, promote good-neighbourly \nrelations between States or to further the use of procedures to ensure he \npeaceful settlement of disputes, and with the constant aim of maintaining \npeace, this new Agenda introduced by the Secretary-General has some creative \naspects and offers innovate alternatives for States to consider notably, the \none he has so aptly termed \\\"preventive diplomacy\\\". As the well-known popular \nsaying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. My country, \nwhich is profoundly peace-loving by vocation and abides by the international \nprinciples of peaceful coexistence, supports this felicitous initiative by the \nSecretary-General, which will surely alert the nations to new opportunities \nfor understanding and valid options for settling their disputes. \nPeace is not a blessing bestowed on us through the simple desire to live \ntogether peaceably: the need to cooperate in good faith while respecting the \nfundamental principles of the United Nations Charter is also important. Peace \nis the result of a universal awareness that it is only by making a genuine \ncontribution to the common weal, to the law of States, and with growing \nactivities in solidarity and with international justice and equity that peace \ncan grow and establish itself. Only in this way will peace be an integral \npart of the harmonious development of our peoples and of their security. \nA few weeks after my Government's inauguration, I came to this forum, the \nGeneral Assembly, to make known not only my country's general ideas about the \n \nworld situation but also the principles which it has traditionally applied and \nwill continue to apply in its international policy and, at the same time, to \nreiterate Ecuador's determination to contribute, as resolutely and \nwholeheartedly as possible, to the establishment of a permanent and \nconstructive peace among all people. \nThe people of Ecuador loves peace and believes in justice. My Government \nearnestly desires to maintain friendly relations with all countries and most \nof all with its neighbours; this is, of course, the natural result of \nEcuador's deep-seated feelings, which, historically speaking, been expressed \nsince the birth of the Republic, and are part of its character. \nEcuador, as representatives in this General Assembly will already be well \naware, is sincerely determined to solve its territorial problem with Peru. \nThe beginning of dialogue between the two countries' Heads of State was a \nmajor step forward in this quest: it overcame the political taboo that had \nprevented Ecuadorians and Peruvians from discussing this situation in cordial, \nfrank and constructive terms, without ignoring legitimate national interests \nand studying the obvious opportunities for joint development. \nIt is my pleasure to inform this world forum that I am determined that \nthe handling of the territorial problem with Peru - which, for so many years \npast has been a source of mistrust, concern and even discord between our two \ncountries will be directed towards transforming the mutual suspicions of the \npast on the basis of justice and realism, in cooperation and with our efforts \ndedicated to the development of our impoverished peoples. \n \nOur two countries, so alike on many counts, can and, above all, must find \na just, honourable and realistic solution to the territorial dispute, which \nwill mean a real process of economic integration. That is why, on the very \nday my Government took office, I said, in the presence of \nPresident Alberto Fujimori, that Ecuador would steadfastly continue to speak \nclearly and frankly, in an atmosphere of harmony and mutual respect with the \nhelp of the four countries which have historically been most closely \nassociated with Ecuador and Peru on this matter over the last 50 years, and \nwith the eminent participation of His Holiness John Paul II, in order to reach \na permanent solution to this territorial dispute as soon as possible. This \nwill enable Ecuador and Peru to extend a hand of friendship from the Pacific \nto the Amazon, which was discovered by an expedition that set out from Quito. \nIn fact, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States of America have \nbeen cognizant of the territorial crisis besetting Ecuador and Peru and have \nbeen witnesses in good standing of the hard times of sacrifice and suffering \nfor my country; they know the history of the formation of our Republics, the \nmisfortunes of their independence and of the subsequent years. They know \nabout the origins and the epics of our peoples, about our rights and the \nevents that have gone to weave the pattern of our history. For all those \nreasons, in a most special way, these four sister countries are destined to \ncontribute to the search for just and creative initiatives to encourage \nEcuador and Peru to overcome this territorial problem once and for all in \nshort, to enable' them, with vision and courage, to write their common history. \n\nWhat can I say about the invaluable aid and assistance that His Holiness \nthe Pope has given many countries, guided always by his vocation for peace and \nunderstanding between governments and peoples, particularly those of deep \nChristian faith? With his enlightened thought, as set out in the encyclical \n\\\"Centesimus Annus\\\", he has exhorted us to take specific steps to establish or \nconsolidate international structures designed to seek peaceful solutions, and \nhas reminded us that arbitration is an appropriate method of resolving \nconflicts which would otherwise keep nations unnecessarily estranged. \nThat is why my predecessor, President Rodrigo Borja, quite rightly \nsuggested, from this very rostrum, that His Holiness the Pope should offer his \nmost valuable assistance, which would without a doubt be of great \nsignificance. In different terms and in another context, the President of \nPeru, during his official visit to Ecuador in January 1992, also stressed the \nsingular importance of His Holiness's cooperation. \nIn my inaugural message to my Government on 10 August last, I \nacknowledged that our views on these matters might differ from those of the \nGovernment and President of Peru; but that is precisely why it is important \nfor there to be a frank and sincere dialogue between our Governments and \npeoples which dialogue would be the more significant for the fraternal aid \nof the four countries and the succour and assistance of the successor of Saint \nPeter. \nIn conclusion, my Government and country are more convinced than ever of \nthe immense contribution being made by the United Nations in the various \nfields of vital importance for humankind. I am personally honoured to recall \nthat my father was the first Ambassador of the Republic of Ecuador to this \n\nOrganization when it was taking its first steps in San Francisco. The \nGovernment of my country trusts that the noble objectives of peace and mutual \nunderstanding between all nations near and far, which have come notably to the \nfore in recent times, will eventually bring us good results which will make it \npossible for the world to enter the twenty-first century renewed and with its \ninternational relations restructured under the seal of law, justice and \nsustainable development for all peoples. \nI am quite sure that this General Assembly, by resolutely serving these \ninterests, will bring us noticeably closer to the goal we all wish so much to \nreach. Let us embark upon this new path. "

        "file_text": "Your election \nto the presidency of the General Assembly, Sir, is a tribute to you and to \nyour country, friendly Bulgaria, which has risen to the challenges of the \ntimes with a combination of determination and wisdom. Your qualities as a \nstatesman, which you have amply demonstrated, and your skills as a seasoned \ndiplomat are solid assets which ensure the success of our work. I wish to \ncongratulate you most warmly on your election to this post and to assure you \nof our complete support and cooperation. \nI also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi, \nAmbassador of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, who guided the forty-sixth \nsession of our Assembly with a competence, distinction, and effectiveness that \nI wish to emphasize today with pride. Another source of legitimate pride for \nus is the work accomplished by the Secretary-General of our Organization, \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. \nOnly a few months have gone by since he began his term of office, and \nalready the record is impressive. There can be no doubt that \nMr. Boutros-Ghali has brought to the United Nations a spirit of initiative, \ndetermination, and lucid leadership which it needs so much to face the \nchallenges posed by the fast pace of history at this century's end. The \nAgenda for Peace, his first annual report, along with his major statements and \nhis remarks before the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and at the Jakarta \nsummit of non-aligned countries, bespeak his vision and courage, which command \nour full support and esteem. \nI cannot fail to reiterate here our congratulations to all the new \nMembers of the United Nations and to welcome them to this forum. \nBearing as it does so much hope and promise, the end of the cold war and \nof the bipolar division of the world has not yet realized any of the hopes it \nhas given rise to with regard to the promotion of peace and international \ncooperation. The spectre of war, the horror of famine and privation, the \ntrampling of human dignity, and the denial of the right of peoples to \nself-determination still constitute the realities of the plight of many \npeoples. \nIn fact, the so-called world order remains a concept without substance \nfor the overwhelming majority of mankind, whose economic and social situation \nis steadily deteriorating and who also have reason to fear that this new order \nis being established outside the bounds of the basic principles of the United \nNations charter and without meeting the need to democratize international \nrelations. \nIt is time to embark upon a genuine dialogue in order to shape the \ninternational relations of the future. This is a vital task of the United \n \nNations, and the Organization's current prestige makes us believe that the \ntime is ripe to embark upon such an enterprise. Never before has the United \nNations seen so many hopes crystallized around it; never has it undertaken so \nmany initiatives or put so many plans on the drawing board. Whether the \nUnited Nations initiatives and plans are met by acceptance and praise as is \noften the case, or criticized, as sometimes happens, it is a fact that this more \nassertive presence of the United Nations is one of the most positive results \nof the major changes that have taken place on the international arena in \nrecent years. \nThe Security Council summit held last January, the proposals submitted by \nthe Secretary-General, the debates in the Economic and Social Council last \nJuly on the role of the United Nations system in the strengthening of \ninternational cooperation for development, and the results of the 10th summit \nof the Non-Aligned Movement held at the beginning of this month in Jakarta are \nall contributions to the joint thinking and action aimed at strengthening the \nUnited Nations and promoting its effectiveness. \nIt is hoped that this session of the General Assembly will be a new \nstarting-point for the United Nations that will place it resolutely on the \npath of greater democratization and enhance its effectiveness in promoting \npeace, cooperation and development. This is exactly what has been called for \nin the Jakarta Message, which was presented right here by the current \nPresident of the Non-Aligned Movement, His Excellency President Suharto of \nIndonesia. \nThe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has more than ever a positive role \nto play in the establishment, through dialogue and the harmonization of views, \nof a just, well-balanced world order which ensures international peace and \n\nsecurity, the right to development, and the promotion of more equitable \neconomic relations. The United Nations constitutes a natural and privileged \nspace for the action of the Non-Aligned, who intend in this way to participate \nfully in the current process of restructuring and strengthening the United \nNations. In this respect, restructuring initiatives should first of all aim \nat achieving a correct balance of prerogatives between the General Assembly \nand the Security Council. This undertaking should also meet the need to allow \naccess to the Council for all major cultural, political and geographic \ngroupings. \nAlgeria, which, since its independence, has undergone major \ntransformations in all areas and which has taken significant steps towards \nprogress and development, today faces a crisis which we do not underestimate \nand whose seriousness we in no way conceal. This crisis threatens the \nachievements made by our people through effort and sacrifice over three long \ndecades. While analyzing without any self-indulgence the causes of this \ncrisis, and while in no way trying to deny our own mistakes or the \nresponsibilities of the State in this situation, we affirm confidently and \nwith determination that our people has the means, capacity and will to \novercome this crisis and to embark again on global development and the \nbuilding of a society based on social justice and real democracy. This is the \nsubstance of the message behind the program of government approved recently by \nthe High Committee of State. \nThis responsible posture in the face of those challenges permits us to \nrecall as well the external constraints that have worsened the difficulties we \nface. This means that we expect our partners to cooperate readily in order to \nreduce the negative impact of an unfavorable external environment, or at least \nthat they not hamper the efforts of our people. \n\nAlgeria pursues a non-aligned policy aimed at promoting stability, peace, \njustice and cooperation in the region to which it belongs and in the world at \nlarge. In the Mediterranean, Algeria works for a new era of solidarity that \nresponds to the aspirations of the peoples on both coasts of this great shared \ninterior sea. Mechanisms for regular consultation and dialogue have been set \nup in order to promote the establishment of a comprehensive framework for \npeace, security, good-neighbourliness, solidarity and mutually advantageous \ncooperation. \nThe united Maghreb process which is rallying the energies of the member \ncountries of the Arab Maghreb Union and which constitutes a fundamental \naspiration of their peoples cannot but contribute to serving the cause of \npeace, relations of good-neighbourliness and cooperation between its different \nmembers and in the Mediterranean basin, the Arab world, and Africa. \n\nThere are two issues that are of special importance to my country. \nParticipation by the international community is required in dealing with \nboth. For the first of these, we wholeheartedly call for a peaceful solution, \nin consonance with international legality, to the situation of tension that \nexists between Libya and the major Western Powers. It is a situation that \nstands in the way of the building of the Arab Maghreb and threatens the \nstability of the whole region. The international community should respond to \nthe flexibility that characterizes the Libyan posture and to the initiatives \nand proposals that have been put forth. \nOn the other hand, the delays in the implementing the United Nations \nsettlement plan for the organization of a self-determination referendum for \nthe people of the Western Sahara continue to be the source of grave concern \nfor us and for the international community as a whole. Algeria hopes that the \ntwo parties to the conflict will refrain from any action that could hamper or \ndelay the implementation of the peace plan prepared jointly by the United \nNations and the Organization of African Unity with the full agreement of both \nparties. Algeria also hopes that the international community, through the \nUnited Nations and its Secretary-General, will redouble its efforts to \nimplement the plan in order to reach the desired solution. \nOf late, there have been positive developments in the disarmament issue. \nHowever, we look forward to a great deal of additional effort on the part of \nthe nuclear States, which, we must state not the major Powers alone. In this \ncontext, we note with satisfaction the conclusion of negotiations on the issue \nof a chemical weapons Convention in Geneva. However, this development will \nhave limited effects so long as it is not accompanied by concrete measures in \nthe field of nuclear disarmament, especially in a region as sensitive as the \nMiddle East, where a real nuclear threat persists. \n \nOnly if earnest efforts are made in this direction and significant \nprogress is achieved will that Convention - the conclusion of which is an \naccomplishment that we commend - respond to the concerns and expectations of \nall the parties concerned. Only then will it be possible to implement the \nConvention on a just non-discriminatory basis will and, thereby, ensure the \nuniversal acceptance necessary to this undertaking of genuine disarmament. \nThese were the observations and legitimate concerns expressed by the Arab \ncountries through a resolution adopted a few days ago, which they expect the \ninternational community to take into account. \nIn spite of the significant progress achieved in the field of \ndisarmament, it remains true that to address the issue of security in a manner \nthat focuses on one specific region and shows concern for the security of the \nfew without taking into account the interests and concerns of the many is to \nfall short of the objectives and ideals enshrined in the United Nations \nCharter. That is why the Non-Aligned Movement has just reaffirmed the \nunshakeable conviction of all its members that there is no peace or security \nother than peace and security for all, and that in order for peace and \nsecurity to be lasting they must be addressed in all their dimensions and not \nonly in the military aspects. In an increasingly interdependent world, peace \nand security should not be dissociated from their corollaries, namely economic \ndevelopment and the upholding of human rights. \nWhile we express satisfaction at the progress achieved in the settlement \nof certain regional disputes, we note with concern the emergence of new crises \nin the wake of the cold war, at a time when many of the old crises and issues \ncontinue to await just and lasting solutions. Cambodia has embarked upon a \nprocess of peaceful settlement thanks to the will of the Cambodian people to \n \nbuild for themselves a future of peace and harmony, to the determination of \nthe international community and the efforts of the United Nations which now \nsupervises the implementation of a peace plan with the participation of \nAlgeria. \nThe inter-community talks on Cyprus, under the auspices of the \nSecretary-General of the United Nations, have reached a crucial stage. We \nhope that the remaining differences will be ironed out during the next round \nof talks, in a context of respect for the sovereignty, unity, territorial \nintegrity, and the non-aligned nature of the island. \nThe recent news that has reached us from South Africa revives hope that \nthere will be a resumption of the process that began with the release of \nNelson Mandela, President of the African National Congress and was endangered \nin recent months by the return of violence encouraged by the complacent \nattitude of the Government. While we welcome such positive developments and \nthe encouraging prospects that pave the road toward the desired solution, we \nmust stress that the experience of recent months makes it necessary to closely \nmonitor developments in South Africa with a great deal of watchfulness and to \nlend full support to our brethren in that country. \nThe horrific plight of the Somali people is a glaring example of the \ndeteriorating situation in many parts of Africa, a continent that has been \nincreasingly marginalized and whose role has been greatly diminished. It is \nessential to learn a lesson from this tragedy, which underscores the need for \nurgent humanitarian assistance for the Somali people side by side with the \nintensification of United Nations efforts to reach a political settlement to \nthis crisis. \n\nThe question of Palestine continues to be the crux of the Middle East \nconflict. Given our firm commitment to Palestine's freedom of choice, has \naccepted the option chosen by the Palestinian leadership that has made it \npossible to negotiate with a view to reaching a solution to the Middle East \ncrisis. We in Algeria remain convinced that the success of the negotiations, \nbegun within the framework of the process initiated in Madrid, depends on \nreadiness by Israel to comply with international legality, especially in \nregard to the following: \nFirst, United Nations resolutions must be adhered to and implemented. \nSecondly, the operations of settlement in the occupied Arab territories must \nbe halted and existing Israeli settlements must be dismantled. Thirdly, the \ncontinuity of the different stages of the peace process must be guaranteed \nuntil a comprehensive solution is found that would guarantee to the \nPalestinian people the exercise of its full national rights, including its \nright to self-determination and to the establishment of its own State on its \nterritory with Al-Quds as its capital. \nMy country is convinced that participation by the United Nations in every \nstage of this peace process in the Middle East can contribute to the \nattainment of the objective that would guarantee a just comprehensive peace in \nthe region. \n \nWe emphasize once again that the Palestinian problem and the Middle East \nconflict are one and the same thing. They are indivisible. Consequently, the \nsolution which must be found cannot be partial or limited to certain parties \ninvolved in the conflict. In other words, and peace can be established in the \nregion only if it is peace for all the parties concerned, including the \nPalestinians. \nAlgeria wishes to reaffirm here its commitment to the independence, \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon within its internationally \nrecognized borders. \nIt condemns the continued Israeli occupation of part of southern Lebanon \nas well as Israel's repeated attacks against Lebanon's territory and its \npeople. We demand the total and unconditional withdrawal of the Israeli army \nfrom southern Lebanon in accordance with Security Council resolution \n425 (1978). \nWe also reaffirm the need to preserve Iraq's unity and territorial \nintegrity. It must be clear to all that any negative development in this \nrespect will create grave problems for all the countries of the region. It is \nour hope that respect for international legality will lead to reconciliation \nbetween the States of that region which continues to suffer the horrific \nconsequences of the devastating war that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. \nIn the same region, there has been another development whose gravity \ncannot be underestimated. It is Iran's illegal occupation of the island of \nAbu Mousa thus reneging on its commitments and agreements concluded with the \nUnited Arab Emirates. We support the demand of the Government of the United \nArab Emirates that the unilateral measures taken by Iran be nullified and that \na solution to the problem be found through negotiation in observance of \nlegality and international law. \n\nIn the face of the terrible plight of the peoples of former Yugoslavia, \nthe major imperative on which all efforts should focus is to ensure the \nimmediate return of peace to all of the territory of the former Yugoslavia, \nwith respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of \nall the republics that have emerged therefrom. In this respect, the situation \nwhich persists in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a source of grave \nconcern because of the increasingly terrible crimes that are being committed \nthere. The international community, and in particular the United Nations, \nmust take every measure necessary in order to put an end to the plight of the \nentire Bosnian people and to the threats to peace and security in the region. \nOne of the most disturbing aspects of the current world situation is the \nconstant exacerbation of the economic situation of the developing countries \nand negative developments that continue to rock the world's economy. The \nsharp slow-down in the growth of world trade, which declined from 8 per cent \nin 1988 to barely 3 per cent in 1991, the increasing deterioration in the \nprices of raw materials at an average 15 per cent pace in real terms in 1990, \nthe persistence of the foreign debt problem of the developing countries with \nthe attendant acceleration of the slow-down of growth in the developed \ncountries, and the magnitude of the financial needs of the former USSR and the \ncountries of Central and Eastern Europe, show how great are the challenges to \nbe met. \nGiven the new opportunities and the new challenges to be met in this \nperiod of profound change, the revitalization of international cooperation for \ndevelopment and strengthening the role of the United Nations system in this \nundertaking should be the high-priority task of the day. \n \nThis requires first and foremost the existence of real political will. \nSome progress has been achieved in this direction. The declaration by the \nSecurity Council at its summit meeting last January recognized the close \nrelationship that exists between peace and development. This recognition \nshould be translated into increased agreement on the need to move the economic \nand social dimension from the secondary position it now occupies to the \nforefront and to make it a principal and permanent concern of the United \nNations. \nIn fact, at a time when a great deal of thinking is taking place on the \nconcept and the instruments of preventive diplomacy, the success of renewed \ngrowth and development in the countries of the South affect the credibility \nand the effectiveness of any attempt to strengthen the role of the United \nNations in the areas of international peace and security. \nThe results of the Eighth United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment (UNCTAD) held at Cartagena in February of 1992, the results of the \nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development held at Rio de \nJaneiro last June, and the General Assembly's adoption of a new United Nations \nagreement for the development of Africa in the 1990s, all constitute new \nmilestones in our awareness of international interdependence and the need for \nrenewed international cooperation. \nOne of the basic objectives that we must strive to attain in this \nparticularly difficult situation in the third world is the need to ensure a \nbigger share in world trade for the developing countries, the formulation of a \ncomprehensive strategy that addresses the issue of indebtedness and the \nreactivation of the flow of funds and investments from the developed to the \n\ndeveloping countries. In general, the creation of favourable external \nconditions is a vital requirement in the case of the developing countries \nwhich are trying to carry out wide-ranging fundamental reforms at a very high \nsocial and political cost. This is a basic requirement on which the United \nNations system should mobilize the international community. \nThe implementation of \\\"Agenda 21\\\" and the commitments that arise \ntherefrom, especially with regard to financial support and transfer of \ntechnology, represent a major test both of the political will of the developed \ncountries and of the capacity of our Organization, through the Commission on \nSustainable Development, to ensure the implementation, follow-up and \ncoordination of a programme which aims at bringing about real and creative \nchanges in the concept of development and international cooperation. \nThere are new and vast horizons before the United Nations. Those \nhorizons give the work of this session of the Assembly particular importance \nand substance. The international community must seize the opportunity to \ndevelop at this world forum an integrated approach to the promotion of peace, \nsecurity, and stability in economic and social development and international \ncooperation. In so doing, it would contribute to the optimum utilization of \nour Organization's great potential. "

        "file_text": "It is with special pleasure that the \nGovernment and the people of the Philippines extend to you, Sir, their warm \nfelicitations on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at \nthis session. You were one of the most prominent and vigorous advocates \n\nof freedom and democracy in your country. We in the Philippines watched your \nstruggle with interest and sympathy, and we joined the rest of the world in \napplauding the triumph of that struggle as the triumph of us all. That \ntriumph led to your elevation to the high office you now hold in your country \nand, now, to your election as President of the General Assembly. Your \nelection, therefore, is a source of special satisfaction for us. \nAt the same time, we congratulate your predecessor. His Excellency \nAmbassador Samir S. Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for his excellent \nleadership in presiding over the Assembly at its forty-sixth session. \nMy delegation also warmly welcomes Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. He brings \nto his arduous and exalted mission decades of experience in and deep insight \ninto the relations among nations and the nature and work of the United \nNations. In less than a year in office, Mr. Boutros-Ghali has demonstrated \nnot only an unflinching devotion to the work of our Organization but also a \nkeen sense of the direction it must take in dealing with the great \ninternational issues of our time. \nPermit me at this point to express the heartfelt appreciation and \ngratitude of the Philippine Government and of the Filipino people for the \ngenerous assistance extended by the members of the world community and \ninternational organizations to the hundreds of thousands of victims of floods \nand mud flows from Mt. Pinatubo, whose fury has described by scientists as \n\\\"the volcanic eruption of the century\\\". Their dire prediction is that \nMt. Pinatubo's mud flows, which have already buried towns and villages and \nturned the once green fields of Central Luzon into a grey and desolate \nlandscape, will continue its destruction for several more years. As we embark \non large-scale relief and rehabilitation efforts in the affected areas, my \n\nGovernment would like once more to appeal for assistance from the members of \nthe international community and organizations even as we thank them for the \nhelp already extended since Mt. Pinatubo erupted in June 1991. \nWe hold this session of the General Assembly at a moment in history that \nhas seen the wave of democracy and national freedom sweep the world with \nastounding and unprecedented rapidity. This is manifested by, among others, \nthe roster of new countries admitted to the United Nations this year nations \nnewly emerged from the confining and oppressive darkness of totalitarian \nimperialism: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, \nKazakhstan, Krygyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, Slovenia, Tajikistan and \nTurkmenistan. This list of new States, new Members of the United Nations, \nreads like a roll of honour in the annals of freedom in our era. We welcome \nthem, as we also do San Marino, to these halls. \nWe Filipinos take pride in having been early in the ranks of democracy's \nmarch in recent history. In 1986, through the exercise of people power, we \nrestored the institutions of democracy in our country. This democratic \nrestoration found both fulfilment and renewed strength in the national \nelections our people conducted five months ago and in the peaceful transfer of \npower that resulted from the supreme exercise of the democratic process. \nThe very fact of that peaceful transfer of power through free elections \nhas affirmed, for all to see, the political stability of our land and, no \ndoubt, contributed to the climate of peace and stability in our region. \nIn pursuance of national stability and peace, our new leadership, under \nPresident Fidel V. Ramos, has embarked on a policy and mission of \nreconciliation among our people, closing divisions, healing wounds and \n \nreaching out to all. Among the measures we have taken is the granting of \namnesty to those disaffected groups which had taken the path of rebellion of \nwhatever ideological or religious persuasion they might be, to whatever \norganizational or ethnic affiliation they might belong. \nElected under the banner of people empowerment, our new leadership has \nchosen, through its policies, to ride the crest of the wave of economic \nliberalization that has inexorably rolled across the world and has, in so many \nnations, improved so many lives in so short a time. We have chosen this path \nfor the same reason others have done because we believe that it is the best \nroad to sustained economic growth and a better life for our people. \n\nOur new leadership, immediately upon assuming office, committed itself \nunequivocally to the liberalization of our trading regime and of the rules \ngoverning investments in our country. We have removed virtually all \nforeign-exchange controls, thus facilitating the international movement of \ncurrency. The privatization of key public industries proceeds apace. \nConsistent with the new primacy of commerce and economics in relations between \nnations, we have placed trade and economic relations at the top of our \ndiplomatic priorities. \nOnly a few weeks ago, in Jakarta, the capital city of our Indonesian \nneighbour, we joined the Non-Aligned Movement, in which the Philippines had \nbeen an observer for many years. Far from being rendered irrelevant by the \nend of the cold war, the Non-Aligned Movement, we found, was larger, stronger \nand even more relevant than ever before. Many of the old divisions in the \nMovement had closed, and a new cohesion had been found. Moreover, the \nMovement had turned more of its attention to problems of trade, finance, \ntechnology and all those other things that make up economic relations between \nnations. \nThe end of the cold war may have greatly diminished the likelihood of \nworldwide conflict and global cataclysm, but it has given rise to new \nchallenges that are just as threatening for the peoples of many nations and \nregions, even as many of the old issues remain unresolved. \nThe weight of their external debt continues to crush the economies of \nmany developing countries, including those countries, like the Philippines, \nwhich have made strenuous efforts to pay their debts religiously. Surely, \nwith some imagination and creativity, and a modicum of good will and \n\nenlightened self-interest, the nations of the world can, together, arrive at \nsome solution that would allow the debtor countries to develop and get out \nfrom under the crushing burden of their debt. At the very least, the debtor \ncountries should be given access to their actual and potential markets without \nany artificial restrictions, to allow them to develop their economies and \nimprove the lives of their peoples while they continue to service their debts \nfrom meagre resources. \nMore and more of the world's nations have adhered ever more strongly to \nthe proposition that economic liberalization is vital to the improvement of \nindustrial productivity and the generation of economic growth. And yet, most \nironically, protectionist barriers continue to rise and to hamper the flow of \ngoods and services. The world's peoples call upon the international \ncommunity, in particular upon the developed countries, to lay aside narrow \nself-interest and push forward the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade \nnegotiations to a speedy and successful conclusion. \nThe formation of trading blocs in some areas has aroused the apprehension \nof countries outside those blocs with respect to their potential for \nartificially diverting trade and investment, diversions damaging to the \nefficiency of the global economic system. We in the Association of South-East \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) have committed ourselves to the formation of an ASEAN \nfree trade area that would facilitate trade among ourselves. But we are \ndetermined to keep ourselves open to world trade, on which our economies \ndepend so much. \n \nEach country has an inalienable right to development. And the United \nNations has a paramount role in seeing to it that it is realized. The ongoing \nrestructuring and revitalization process in the economic and social fields \nshould therefore be geared towards the effective discharge of this role by the \nUnited Nations system. \nThe continuing scourge of poverty, the rapid increase in population, the \nuneven rate of economic growth among countries and the asymmetry in the \neconomic and social structures of nations, together with the dazzling advances \nin transportation and communication, have given rise to a new phenomenon of \nour times: the massive migration of labour. As one of the largest sources of \nthis migration, the Philippines is convinced that it is now time for the \ninternational community to deal with this phenomenon no longer in haphazard \nand isolated ways, but on a planned and strategic basis and on an \ninternational scale. \nIn so doing, we would do well to heed the appeal of the Secretary-General \nto accord deeper understanding and respect to the rights and needs of the more \nvulnerable groups of society. A substantial part of the migration of labour \nis the thousands of young women from many developing countries who venture \nforth to more affluent countries in search of a better life for themselves and \ntheir families, only to fall victim to unspeakable abuse, in many cases to \nviolence, sometimes ending in death, simply because they are women. Roaming \nthe streets of the world are 145 million children homeless, hungry, \nneglected, in most cases victims of abuse and mistreatment by adults. \nThousands of the disabled and the aging, particularly in the developing \ncountries, are cast away, stripped of their dignity, from the mainstream of \nsociety. \n\nThe untrammelled population growth in many regions, the profligate use of \nthe Earth's resources and the pollution of the land, water and air have \nseverely damaged the Earth's life-sustaining ecology in many places, \nthreatening the livelihoods of farmers and fishermen and the health of \neveryone. It was therefore with a keen sense of hope and high expectations \nthat the Philippines participated in the United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development in Rio de Janeiro last June. At that Conference, \nthe collective will of the international community was marshalled at the \nhighest level of leadership on behalf of the sustainable development of our \nEarth and its resources. The Philippines applauds its considerable \nachievements and remains committed to its goals and ideals, as embodied in \nAgenda 21, the implementation of which requires adequate new and additional \nfinancial resources. \nTo carry out on a national scale the objectives set forth in Agenda 21, \nmy President has created the Philippine Council for Sustainable Development, \nwhich counts non-governmental organizations and, particularly, the youth among \nits members. I am also pleased to announce that, in observance of the \nInternational Year for the World's Indigenous People, the Philippines will \nhost in April next year a Global Youth Earth Summit or Global YES in \ncooperation with the United Nations Environment Programme's Global Youth Forum \nand with the full endorsement and support of the United Nations Development \nProgramme, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization, and the International Labour Organisation. I appeal to the \nworld to support this undertaking. \n\nThe cold war's end has lifted a great pall of global threat from over the \nEarth and closed a fundamental division in the international community. It \nhas thus opened new vistas of hope for peace and global security, directly \nleading to major advances in some of the world's hitherto intractable \nconflicts: Afghanistan, Cambodia, the Middle East, Central America, South \nAfrica. Nevertheless, intra-regional and intra-national conflicts continue to \nravage people's lives and homes. \nThe end of super-Power confrontation and the dissolution of empires and \nblocs have freed nations and dismantled tyrannies. They have also unleashed \nage-old hostilities between antagonistic groups and released them to erupt in \ntragic violence. These conflicts, new and old, have taken various forms and \ndimensions. \nIn the Middle East, movement in the peace process has given rise to new, \nalbeit modest, hopes. However, hope must be tempered still, as the basic \ncause of conflict the denial of a homeland and sovereignty to the \nPalestinian people remains unresolved. \n\nIn South Africa, the institutions of apartheid have been dismantled, a \nhopeful development that can be attributed in no small measure to the resolute \nand patient efforts of the United Nations and the international community. We \nare heartened that the stalled negotiations on the future of that country may \nfinally get back on track with the expected resumption of the Convention for a \nDemocratic South Africa. In Somalia, intertribal warfare conspires with the \ncruelties of nature to inflict upon the people of that unhappy land death by \nviolence or starvation. The people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, specifically \nits Muslim population, are subjected to the barbarity of ethnic cleansing and \nthe horrors of fratricidal war while the international community helplessly \nlooks on. Similar forms, if not similar degrees, of ethnic violence have \nerupted in some places in the former Soviet Union. \nIn our own region of South-East Asia, in Cambodia, a peace agreement \npainstakingly worked out by the United Nations, the Association of South-East \nAsian Nations (ASEAN), other interested Governments and the Cambodian \nfactions themselves has provided for and led to the mounting of the largest \npeace-keeping operation of the United Nations and the assumption of one of its \ngravest responsibilities, the United Nations Transitional Authority for \nCambodia, to which the Philippines has contributed a contingent of policemen \nand naval observers. However, one of the factions has, of late, chosen not to \nparticipate further in the peace process until its conditions, some of which \ngo beyond the terms of the Paris peace Agreement, are met. It is now the \nresponsibility of the international community to ensure that the fabric of \nimminent peace does not unravel and to place the peace process back on track. \nConflicting claims in the South China Sea have given rise to acute \nconcern among the countries involved and other States with interests in the \n \narea. Last July the Foreign Ministers of ASEAN issued in Manila the ASEAN \nDeclaration on the South China Sea, calling on all claimants to settle their \ndisputes peacefully, pledging to embark on cooperative endeavours in the area \nand inviting all parties concerned to subscribe to the Declaration. Dialogues \nhave been taking place in the region involving officials and academicians from \nthe claimant States and other interested parties. It is our hope that these \ndialogues will help to avert misunderstanding and conflict and eventually lead \nto the day when this vast, vital and strategic portion of the sea can be \ntransformed from an area of incipient tension into a region of enduring peace \nand cooperation. All these fall squarely under the purposes and principles of \nthe Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation in South-East Asia, which the \nsignatories, including the Philippines, are requesting the General Assembly to \nendorse at this session. \nThus, even as the world welcomes the cold war's end and the march of \nfreedom and democracy across the earth, in the relations among nations old \nwounds fester, break out and recur and new ones are opened. And yet hopes run \nhigher than they have ever done since the last great war. These hopes are \nfocused especially on the new possibilities for the United Nations in its \nmission of preventing war, making peace, keeping the peace and building for \npeace. In this new era of opportunity it is both possible and imperative for \nthe United Nations to discharge the role envisioned for it by the Charter as \nthe primary keeper of peace and security in the world. \nIt is therefore extremely fitting that in his first report on the work of \nthe Organization our new Secretary-General dwells almost exclusively on this \nrole of the United Nations and the opportunities opened for it by the historic \nchanges of recent times. \n\nThe Philippines welcomes the Secretary-General's report, \\\"An Agenda for \nPeace Preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping,\\\" and is studying \nit with great attention. We commend it to the world for serious \nconsideration, for it seeks to bring the United Nations back to its roots as \nan organization with an effective capacity to make peace and keep the peace. \nThe report is filled with wise, timely and practical prescriptions, and I \nshould like to single out a few. \nWe support the Secretary-General's call for an enlarged and more \neffective role for the International Court of Justice. We join the \nSecretary-General in reaffirming the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful \nSettlement of International Disputes, as approved by the General Assembly. We \nendorse his recognition of the need to relieve the economic difficulties of \nStates that are affected by sanctions imposed on another State under \nArticle 41 of the Charter. \nWe commend for especially close consideration the Secretary-General's \nbold proposals for giving life to Chapter Vll of the Charter, particularly \nArticle 42, which authorizes the Security Council to take military action to \nmaintain or restore international peace and security, and Article 43, which \nmandates Members of the United Nations to place armed forces and facilities on \ncall for this purpose. \nGranting the United Nations increased power and greater authority for \npeace-keeping and enforcement action would gain stronger support from the \ninternational community if the Security Council could function with a greater \ndegree of democracy than heretofore. Why, for example, should a region with \napproximately 15 per cent of the world's population and 23 per cent of the \ntotal membership of the United Nations have 40 per cent representation in the \nSecurity Council this year, with three having the power of veto? \n \nClearly, that is a legitimate question. However, the composition of the \nSecurity Council is but one of the provisions in the Charter that could stand \nimprovement. My delegation appreciates current efforts to restructure and \nrevitalize the economic and social sectors of the United Nations and to reform \nboth the General Assembly and the Secretariat. We note, however, that such \nefforts are often limited by a hesitation to review the United Nations Charter \nitself. \nAddressing the work of the Special Committee on the Charter and the \nStrengthening of the Role of the Organization during the twenty-ninth session \nof the General Assembly, the then Philippine Foreign Minister, \nGeneral Carlos P. Romulo, said: \n\\\"At no time in history has it been more clear that the many and \nclosely interrelated global problems that beset us will not yield to \npiecemeal and national solutions. The paramount importance of the United \nNations as the capstone of human society has been reaffirmed with great \nforce by the momentous events even of this single year. The design of a \nnew world economic order, the mobilizing of world agriculture, a global \napproach to population problems, the equitable redistribution of world \neconomic resources, the achievement of disarmament and peace all \nrequire an ever more effective and more efficient world Organization. \n\\\"For these reasons, it is more than ever appropriate that we are \ncontinuing our consideration of the improvement of the United Nations \nitself. The centrality of the United Nations is obvious and \ninescapable. The increasing value of the United Nations is undoubted. \nBut its rate of adaptation to rapidly moving world affairs is doubted; \nits adequacy to perform the functions thrust upon it by its Members, and \nsimply by the urgent course of world history, is doubted. \n\n\\\"When we began this discussion in 1970, on the twenty-fifth \nanniversary of our world Organization, the effort seemed pertinent \nenough. But now, as we continue, the accelerating pace of change in the \nworld has already caught up with us and threatens to pass us by. The \nmechanisms of the United Nations are increasingly creaky and primitive in \nlight of the task of plenary management that the Organization is \nincreasingly called upon to assume. While the prescience of the founders \nwas remarkable, and they succeeded in designing a flexible and adaptable \nOrganization with a Charter of enduring worth, at the same time it was \nwholly impossible for them to anticipate the speed with which events \nwould carry us into the interdependent global age and the requirements \nthat would be placed on our world body.\\\" \n \nGeneral Romulo, who happened to be my father and one of the founders of \nthe United Nations, made these remarks in 1974. He might as well be making \nthem today. I do not wish to state the obvious, but I know that my father's \nmessage rings loud and clear in this Hall. Let us now proceed to rectify the \nomissions of the past. \nTowards this end, the Philippine delegation submits that the time has \ncome for the United Nations to avail itself of the provisions of Article 109 \nregarding the convening of a General Conference to review the Charter. My \ndelegation will consult with like-minded Members in the coming year with a \nview to definitively addressing this proposal, specifically through a \nresolution calling for such a review conference, which, according to the \nCharter itself, should have been placed on the agenda of the General Assembly \n10 years after its adoption in 1945. \nWe are only three years shy of the fiftieth anniversary of our \nOrganization. Its celebration, we believe, would be further enhanced by the \nadoption and implementation of such a resolution. Through it, we hope to \ncontribute to the noble work of making the United Nations a truly effective \ninstrument, as the signatories envisioned it to be, for saving \\\"succeeding \ngenerations from the scourge of war\\\" and for promoting \\\"social progress and \nbetter standards of life in larger freedom\\\". The confluence of historic \nevents in our time presents us with a unique opportunity to fulfil the mandate \nfrom our founders. Let us prove ourselves worthy of their trust. \n"

        "file_text": "Please accept my congratulations, \nSir, on your election to the presidency of the current session of the \nGeneral Assembly. I wish you every success in carrying out this \nresponsible task. Let me also add how glad we are to have a President \npersonifying the democratic transformation in Central and Eastern Europe. \nTo the outgoing President, Ambassador Samir S. Shihabi of the Kingdom \nof Saudi Arabia, I convey our appreciation for the quality of his \nleadership and work. \nI also want to assure the Secretary-General, \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, of our unfailing support for his tireless \nefforts to make the United Nations live up to the expectations of our time \nand to the law of the Charter. \nIt is with profound satisfaction that we welcome in our midst the new \nMembers of the United Nations: San Marino, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Armenia, \nKyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia, \nas well as Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. \n\nThe end of the cold war has opened up the possibility of building a world \norder free from nuclear terror based on mutual respect among nations, on \ngreater equality of opportunity, and on effective cooperative structures. It \nhas raised hopes for a safer, more equitable and more humane world. Yet we \nare still far from turning those hopes into reality. \nConsequently, the international community is led to re-examine and adjust \nthe structures and functions of the United Nations. Member States are \nthinking more and more in terms of stimulating efforts to enhance the \neffectiveness and efficiency of the Organization. In the words of the \nSecretary-General, they should seek the \\\"transfiguration of the house\\\". Our \nfiftieth anniversary will offer an appropriate occasion to reassess the \nstructure of the Organization with a view to tapping the full potential of the \nCharter. Before we talk about its revision, we first need to re-read the \nCharter in an attempt to implement it consistently and to adapt its \napplication to the post-cold-war realities and to the political and socio \neconomic challenges originating form the South-North relationship.* \nImportant suggestions have been made by the Secretary-General in his \nimaginative report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277). We welcome this document \nand the proposals contained therein. \nInternational security is a multidimensional issue. While the military \nfactor continues to play its key role, security and stability are becoming \nincreasingly dependent on other factors as well. \n\nWe are facing pressing tasks in the economic area: the economies of the \ndeveloping countries and the economies of the newly democratic countries, \nwhich emerged with the fall of communism, must become more efficient. There \nare enormous challenges with regard to the protection of the environment, with \nregard to the refugee question, and with regard to natural and man-made \ndisasters. The issue of refugees represents an external manifestation of \nproblems which cannot be addressed effectively without first attending to \ntheir underlying causes. The dramatic plight of famine- stricken Somalia is a \nmanifest example. It calls not only for urgent international relief but also \nfor long-standing assistance. \nThe advance made in arms control and in disarmament has a direct and \npositive impact on the international security climate. Over the last \n12 months, negotiations in this vital area resulted, amongst other things, in \nthe Open Skies Treaty, the agreements between the United States and the four \nsuccessor States of the former USSR (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan) \nrelating to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), and the Convention on \nthe Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of \nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. The Conference on Disarmament in \nGeneva must be commended for having finally reached an agreement to ban these \nabhorrent weapons. The States participating in the Conference on Security and \nCooperation in Europe (CSCE) have committed themselves to become original \nsignatories to that important instrument. We urge all Member States to do \nlikewise. \n\nHowever, arms control and disarmament are unfinished tasks. The United \nNations has to deal with the overkill capacity still present in arsenals, both \nnuclear and conventional, and with the growing danger of the spread of weapons \nof mass destruction and missile technology. There is an immediate need to \ncontrol international arms transfers. Openness and transparency in the \nmilitary field have to be promoted. Military stability and confidence will be \nelusive unless we make headway in all these areas. But even that is not \nenough. International peace and security will at best remain fragile as long \nas prevailing patterns and practices are not redressed to eliminate the \nnon-military causes of instability, including ethnic hatred and nationalism. \nThe crisis in the former Yugoslavia, and especially in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, stands out at present as the single greatest breach of \ninternational peace. It is a threat to the security of the region. \nNon-compliance with the law of armed conflict; the atrocities; persecution of \nvarious population groups, including forced resettlement and \\\"ethnic \ncleansing\\\" programmes; gross violations of human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms; obstacles put in the way of humanitarian aid, including obstacles to \nthe activity of the International Committee of the Red Cross - all these acts \nunderlie a regional conflict of unprecedented proportions which is brimming \nwith spill-over risks and incalculable conseguences. \nThe recent report of Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Special Rapporteur of the \nCommission on Human Rights, contains stark evidence of breaches of \ninternational humanitarian law and human rights. The report leaves no party \nto the conflict blameless, while recognizing that the degrees of \nresponsibility are far from being equal or even comparable. \n\nIn view of the reports on civilian and prisoner-of-war detention camps, \nthe Polish Government deems it necessary to reiterate its demand of 7 August \nthis year that all such camps be closed down forthwith and all the detainees \nbe released without delay. Moreover, criminal prosecution of all persons \nresponsible for breaches of the law of armed conflict must be ensured. \nPoland has contributed one of the largest contingents to the United \nNations Transition Authority in Cambodia and to the United Nations Protection \nForce in former Yugoslavia. At the same time/ Poland recognizes the urgent \nneed of reassessment of the tasks and structure of United Nations \npeace-keeping forces, including - as proposed by the Secretary-General the \nestablishment of a standing force at the disposal of the Organization. Another \nsubject which deserves examination is the financing of the peace-keeping \noperations out of the defence budgets of States. The earmarking of merely \nhalf a per cent of their annual military expenditures for peace-keeping \noperations would help to overcome the present budgetary constraints. In this \nway, the maintenance of peace and security would become a truly common \nresponsibility of the international community. \nPoland stands ready to contribute to the development of international \ncentres for preparing peace-keeping forces. To this end we propose to make \navailable to the United Nations one of the military bases in Poland vacated by \nthe Russian armed forces. \nLet me also stress at this juncture that the Government of Poland has \nindicated its willingness to assign to peace-keeping operations, as of 1993, \ntwo or three self-contained infantry battalions, in addition to logistics \ndetachments. This contingent could eventually be made available to the \nSecurity Council on a permanent basis. We thus fully agree with words that \n\nthe President of the United States of America uses in his address to us \nyesterday namely, that a new emphasis should be put on peace-keeping. That \nidea has also been entertained by other speakers. Furthermore, in response to \na recent suggestion by the Secretary-General, Poland stands ready to \nparticipate in consultations aimed at the implementation of Article 43 of the \nCharter. \nI shall now address the issue of regionalism. Some points have already \nbeen raised during today's debate. I am referring in particular to the \nstatements by the British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth \nAffairs and by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands. \nMember States should make more use of the opportunities inherent in \nChapter VIII of the Charter. Regional and continental security structures \nshould become, in our view, part of a global security architecture. \nThe aggression against Kuwait and the hostilities in former Yugoslavia, \nin Moldova and in Nagorno-Karabakh have laid bare the strength of nationalism \nand the weakness of some regional structures. Indeed, left to fester, \npolitical, ethnic, religious and other conflicts have spread insecurity and \ninstability across Europe and far beyond. While the United Nations is, as \nproved by the Persian Gulf experience, capable of playing its role in regard \nto the restoration and then preservation of peace and security, we still need \nto seek new security arrangements in keeping with the Charter. In Europe, \nthis need has already been recognized by the North Atlantic Alliance, which is \nthe pillar of security in our continent, the Western European Union and the \nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Poland supports \ntheir involvement and active cooperation with other institutions in \npeace-keeping, conflict prevention and crisis management. \n\nHarmonious and constructive interaction between the United Nations and \nregional organizations or arrangements may well constitute an important new \nelement in making the United Nations more effective in the field of peace and \nsecurity. This fact is rightly emphasized by the Secretary-General in his \nreport. \nIn crisis situations, where several organizations are acting \nsimultaneously, it could be advisable to set up, on an ad-hoc basis, a single \ncoordinating framework. This would help to avoid duplication, overlapping or \ndissipation of efforts. \nThe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe should be commended \nfor its offer of such cooperation. It declared itself a regional arrangement \nin the sense of Chapter VIII of the Charter. This implies the establishment \nof an important link between European and global security. \nIn our concern for peace and security we must consider the non-military \nfactors. Let me turn first to human rights, an area where the Polish nation \nhas accumulated considerable experience of internal struggle for the respect \nof the individual. Our debate on this issue is taking place at a time of both \nrising expectations and mounting fears about future developments. The \ninternational community is frustrated by its far-too-frequent helplessness in \ncases of grave and massive violations of human rights. Former Yugoslavia is a \nrecent case in point. \n \nThe United Nations should urgently consider additional measures to \naddress serious violations of human rights among other things, a system of \nenforcement of respect for human rights. In this connection, the Austrian \nproposal concerning the establishment of a human rights emergency mechanism, \nsubmitted to the Commission on Human Rights, deserves proper attention. \n \nThe forthcoming World Conference on Human Rights is an appropriate forum \nto discuss these questions. The Conference should adopt a comprehensive \napproach to human rights. It should elaborate an action-oriented programme \nfor the promotion and implementation of human rights as well as for the \nprevention of their violation. It should contribute to improving the \ncoordination of United Nations activities in that respect. The framework for \nthe preparations for the Conference is provided by General Assembly \nresolution 45/155. \nWhile noting the variety of factors which influence the status of human \nrights, the resolution places emphasis on their universality. There is no \njustification for any differentiation in understanding the contents and the \nmeaning of human rights, nor is there any room for their selective \napplication. We must do all in our power to prevent the weakening of the \nuniversal substance of human rights. \nMy country pays particular attention to the protection of minorities. \nThis attitude has found its expression in the treaties concluded by Poland \nwith its neighbours. We fully endorse the adoption by the General Assembly of \nthe draft declaration on the rights of persons belonging to national, ethnic, \nreligious and linguistic minorities. \nWhile the ideologically motivated East-West division no longer \nexists and we rejoice at that we now see a growing North-South division, \nwith the countries in transition, such as Poland, stranded in between. As a \nresult, the promise of peace, greater security and freedom for all is being \nslowly eroded. \n\nGlobal inequality, exemplified by the widening gap between the rich North \nand the poor South as well as the disparity in access to markets, must be \nalleviated not only for economic, but also for security, humanitarian and \nethical reasons. Ecologically sustainable development, with democracy and the \nmarket economy at its core, should be the focal point and the principal goal \nof the United Nations system as it prepares itself for the future: the year \n2000 and beyond. We shall not be able to cope successfully with the \nchallenges ahead unless a coalition for development is forged. \nAs it happens, there are also grounds to fear a division based on the \nlevel of economic development in Europe. In the case of countries in \ntransition, their long-awaited prosperity is lagging behind, not coming \nhand-in-hand with freedom. The Western industrial democracies have not yet \nadopted a coherent approach to the emerging problems of countries in Central \nand Eastern Europe. A grand strategy for supporting the democratic transition \nhas not yet been worked out, a strategy whose relevance, I dare say, may well \none day be highly appreciated in other regions and countries likely to face \ntransition and transformation problems. \nThere is little doubt that international economic relations need to be \nreformed in the overriding interest of international stability and security. \nThe stronger the economy, the sturdier the political and social fabric of \nStates and, in effect, the greater their resistance to the impact of ethnic \nconflicts, refugee exoduses and migration problems. This, I believe, is a \nvalid argument in favour of accelerated restructuring of the economies in \ntransition and their early integration into the world economy. \n\nThe social implications of economic reform and structural adjustment need \nto be carefully monitored, both in the developing countries and in those in \ntransition. We expect that the forthcoming United Nations Summit Conference \non social policies and development will address these implications in some \ndetail, especially as they relate to Central and Eastern Europe and the \nCommonwealth of Independent States. It would certainly be helpful if, in the \ncourse of preparations for the conference, the Secretary-General could \nprepare, by analogy with his report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277), a report \non the challenges of social and economic development. \nPoland welcomes the fact that the United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro earlier this year, has \nopened a new chapter of international cooperation by addressing environmental \nprotection issues in a manner compatible with the requirements of sustainable \ndevelopment. \nThe Decade of International Law has got off to a slow start, yet it still \noffers a unique framework for enhancing the role of law as the basic factor \nfor order in international relations. We should not miss this opportunity. \nThe United Nations itself is facing a number of legal questions of a highly \nsensitive nature: Let me refer, by way of example, to the contemporary \nmeaning of sovereignty; the rule of law and domestic jurisdiction of States; \nrespect for international law in conflict situations; global legal mechanisms \nfor the enforcement of human rights; the establishment of an international \ncriminal court; succession of States; and international compensation claims. \nAs to the solution of conflicts, recourse should be made to Article 36 of \nthe Charter. Security Council recommendations on specific procedures or \nmethods of adjustment of disputes should become a normal practice in cases \n\nwhere parties to a dispute are unable to settle it in accordance with their \nobligations under paragraph 3 of Article 2. Poland is in favour, in \nparticular, of reinforcing the role of the International Court of Justice. \nI wish to conclude by noting that enduring world peace is inconceivable \nwithout law and justice standing out as unfaltering beacons for all men and \nnations alike.\n"

        "file_text": " The delegation of Sri Lanka congratulates \nMr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria on his election as President of the forty-seventh \nsession of the General Assembly. We assure him of our full co-operation and \nsupport. \nWe wish to record our deep appreciation of the determined manner in which \nhis predecessor. His Excellency Samir S. Shihabi, conducted the affairs of the \nforty-sixth session and of the keen interest he took in moving forward the \nprocess of revitalization of the General Assembly. \nWe welcome the new Member States and wish them every success in their \nlegitimate national and international endeavours. \nIt is my special honour to convey to the General Assembly the greetings \nof the President of Sri Lanka, His Excellency Ranasinghe Premadasa, and his \nsincere good wishes for the efforts of the United Nations to ensure a just and \npeaceful world. \nThe cold war is over. Momentous developments continue to dominate the \ninternational scene. The consequences of these developments for a peaceful \nworld have yet to fully unfold. New independent States have emerged. The \ntransition to a stable and equitable order is full of uncertainties and \nchallenges. Several peace initiatives to resolve conflicts offer hope. \nNevertheless, there is simmering discontent within and among nations. Unrest \nand turmoil prevail in parts of the world. \n \nThe violence in the territories of former Yugoslavia continues unabated. \nThe tragedy in Somalia appals and shames the human conscience. The peace \nprocesses that began in Afghanistan and Cambodia have encountered setbacks. \nIn South Africa a non-racial and democratic Government is yet to be \nestablished. The question of Palestine still remains on our agenda. We hope \nthat the Middle East peace process will enable that troubled region to soon \nenjoy the peace for which its peoples yearn. \nWe thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his \ncomprehensive report on the work of the Organization in these and other areas \nof activity during the year. \nThe Secretary-General's report on an \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" is innovative and \nchallenging. The proposals in his report must be considered with the care and \nseriousness they deserve given the instabilities that prevail and the \nuncertainties that lie ahead. The central focal-point for any action in this \nregard should be a revitalized and democratized United Nations. \nThe Secretary-General himself has observed that \\\"the foundation stone to \nthis work is and must remain the State\\\". The fundamental sovereignty and \nintegrity of the State are crucial to any common progress we seek to achieve. \nPreventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and post-conflict peace \nbuilding must be pursued in a manner that meets the legitimate aspirations of \nall Member States. \nIn keeping with the principles of universality and sovereign equality, \nthe post-cold war peace process must encompass and involve all Member States. \nThis is fundamental to the legal and moral authority of the United Nations. \n\nThe General Assembly should continue to be the principal policy-making \nbody of the Organization. We support all efforts to ensure more effective \nfunctioning of the General Assembly as a forum of multilateral diplomacy to \nachieve our common objectives. \nThe role of the United Nations in conflict prevention and conflict \nresolution should be pragmatic. It should contribute to the stability and \nlong-term viability of the international system. The Secretary-General has \nreminded us that unlimited \\\"fragmentation\\\" of sovereign entities would make it \nmore difficult to achieve peace, security and economic well-being for all. \nExternal intervention in any guise cannot be justified, except in accordance \nwith the provisions of the Charter, particularly in cases where domestic \nsolutions have not been entirely exhausted. \nTo ensure the efficacy of our collective efforts towards fulfilling the \n\\\"Agenda for Peace\\\", it is imperative that the United Nations assume a decisive \nrole in formulating and putting into effect an \\\"agenda for development\\\". \nLasting solutions can be found only through enlightened \ndevelopment-cooperation policies pursued in tandem with strategies for \npreventive diplomacy. \nAs the principal organ entrusted with the maintenance of international \npeace and security, the Security Council now functions without the shackles \nthat made it ineffective during the cold war. However, its present \nconfiguration continues to reflect the realities of the immediate-post-war \npower structure. The Security Council could be made more representative. It \nis important that its procedures be democratic and transparent. Its decisions \nshould reflect consensus, arrived at after proper discussion, and respect for \nnational sovereignty. There should be a better balance in the relationship \nbetween the General Assembly and the Security Council. \n\nThe restructuring of the United Nations in its economic and social areas \nhas already begun. There is a need for better coordination of global economic \npolicies and for more effective policy-making and policy-implementation. \nCoordination and integration of operational activities of the specialized \nagencies and other bodies, functioning under the Economic and Social Council, \nand strengthening of the field presence of the United Nations have become \nvital. This will reduce duplication, inefficiency and a too-diffused focus of \nUnited Nations assistance. The ultimate aim of the reforms must be to enable \nthe United Nations to be more effective in the promotion of development \ncooperation for social and economic progress. However, in our enthusiasm to \nreform the United Nations in the social and economic fields, we must maintain \nthe principles of democracy, universality and respect for the sovereignty of \nStates. \nWe wish to commend the Secretary-General for his bold initiatives in \nstreamlining the work of the Secretariat. We hope that continuing efforts to \nmaximize efficiency in the Secretariat will not diminish, but will enhance, \nthe capacity of the United Nations to respond to the pressing socio-economic \nneeds of the developing world. \nWe welcome the Secretary-General's efforts to reorganize the Secretariat \nand to utilize fully its human resources. These efforts should be matched by \nMember States' meeting their obligation under the Charter to make available \nthe required financial resources. If the present financial crisis of the \nUnited Nations is to be resolved, these resources must be provided on time. \nThis year has witnessed a reaffirmation, by the nations of the \nBon-Aligned Movement, of the validity and relevance of non-alignment and of \n\nits basic approach in addressing international problems and development. The \ntenth Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Jakarta last \nmonth, emphasized the need to build a new and equitable international order \nbased on political and economic democracy both within and between nations. \nThe Jakarta Message conveys a clear consensus that the Non-Aligned Movement is \nnot a captive of its nomenclature, which reflects the historical context in \nwhich the first Summit Conference took place. \nIn our commitment to promote and preserve the \\\"dignity and worth of the \nhuman person\\\" we believe that the best defence of human rights lies in \ndemocracy and openness in societies. \nFor over half a century Sri Lanka has had a proud record of uninterrupted \nuniversal adult franchise and respect for the electoral verdict. My country \nis a party to the Covenants on human rights. In Sri Lanka, steps are being \ntaken to establish a human-rights commission to strengthen the fulfilment of \nour constitutional obligations relating to fundamental rights. We have an \nenduring commitment to both national and international accountability. \nSri Lanka's policy of openness and of cooperation with national and \ninternational bodies in the field of human rights is derived from democratic \ntraditions and institutions that are an integral part of Sri Lanka's value \nsystem. \nSocio-economic aspects of human-rights problems have found their \nmanifestations everywhere. This is evident from violent and undemocratic \nexpressions of grievances in both developing and developed countries. We \nbelieve that a cooperative rather than a coercive approach would help \ninternational action to achieve the desired results in the field of human \n\nrights. Sri Lanka will participate constructively in the World Conference on \nHuman Rights in 1993 to develop such a positive approach to the promotion of \nhuman rights world-wide. \nInternational peace, security and development are indivisible. It is no \nlonger possible to conceive of security essentially in military terms. The \ncold-war era, in which a highly militarized concept of security dominated \nEast-West relations, is over. Today, socio-economic factors have become major \ndeterminants of global security. Multilateral disarmament and world peace and \nsecurity are inextricably linked. This makes it necessary for the United \nNations to play the central role in global disarmament. The United Nations \nshould also be a catalyst in facilitating regional disarmament. \nThe monitoring of the illegal arms trade and its elimination should be a \npriority on the multilateral agenda on disarmament and conflict prevention. \nThe illegal arms trade and the highly destructive evils of drug trafficking \nand terrorism are interlinked and mutually supportive. States should not \npermit their territories or their citizens to be used for the perpetration of \nacts of destabilization against other States through support for, or tolerance \nof, arms smuggling drug trafficking and terrorism. Multilateral action to \naddress these real threats faced by democratic societies should constitute an \nindispensable element of the peace agenda of the United Nations. \n \nSri Lanka strongly supported multilateral negotiations aimed at a total \nprohibition of the entire chemical weapons cycle. The successful conclusion \nof the convention on chemical weapons demonstrates the competence of the \nUnited Nations in multilateral negotiations. Sri Lanka was among those \ncountries which signified an early interest in becoming an original signatory \nto the convention. We hope that States parties to this convention will \npromote international cooperation in the peaceful uses of chemicals in \naccordance with its letter and spirit. \nEfforts to establish a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean continue. In \nview of the changing international situation, the United Nations Ad Hoc \nCommittee on the Indian Ocean was of the view that the General Assembly might \nwish to consider alternative approaches. The Tenth Non-Aligned Summit Meeting \nin Jakarta took cognizance of this view and reiterated the determination to \ncontinue efforts to achieve the goals of the Declaration as considered at the \nmeeting of littoral and hinterland States held in 1979. We hope that the new \nspirit of cooperation evident elsewhere in the world will embrace the Indian \nOcean region as well. \nMy delegation is pleased with the conclusions reached at the United \nNations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro. We \nendorse the principles enunciated in the Rio Declaration, the programmes in \nAgenda 21, the commitment to a shared partnership by the provision of adequate \nnew and additional funding and the transfer of the necessary technologies to \ndeveloping countries. Sri Lanka has signed the Framework Convention on \nClimate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity. We expect that the \ncreation of a commission for sustainable development will without delay move \nforward the process of ensuring the sustainable development to which all \nnations and peoples committed themselves in Rio de Janeiro. \n\nThe United Nations must take a visionary perspective in shaping the \nfuture of a world already transformed into a global village by modern \ntechnology. Yet, developing countries are still in a disadvantaged position \nowing to the non-availability of the necessary technologies. Among these, \nspace technology is useful in the monitoring of the changing global \nenvironment and can assist developing countries in maximizing the use of their \nresources. \nHowever, the high cost of space and other advanced technologies prevents \ndeveloping countries from reaping their potential benefits. The United \nNations and its specialized agencies must therefore work to ensure equitable \naccess to these technologies so that the benefits can be shared by all. This \nwill enable the development of a new regime of technological democracy. \nThe Convention on the Law of the Sea was signed 10 years ago. The \nPreparatory Commission continues to labour painstakingly to ensure that the \nresources of the seas and oceans a common heritage of mankind will be used \nfor the benefit of all. We welcome the initiative of the Secretary-General to \nbring about universal participation in the Convention. \nIn different parts of the world regional organizations are being \nstrengthened. Sri Lanka hid the honour this year to be elected as Chairman of \nthe South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC). The dynamic \nleadership of His Excellency Ranasinghe Premadasa, President of Sri Lanka, has \nsignificantly moved forward cooperation among the seven States members of \nSAARC on a number of initiatives. \nA South Asian Commission on Poverty Alleviation, established this year, \nwill enable fresh approaches to be taken on the basis of shared experiences in \nalleviating poverty in our populous region. Sri Lanka's own approach has been \n\nto provide opportunities and access to the poor to participate actively and \nproductively as partners in national development, rather than being treated as \npassive recipients of charity. \nA South Asian Preferential Trading Agreement (SAPTA) seeks to promote \ntrade and commerce among SAARC countries. Efforts to expand cultural \nexchanges and to enhance people-to-people contact at various levels are under \nway. Regional recognition has been granted to the SAARC Chambers of Commerce \nand Industries. \nThe Second SAARC Ministerial Conference on Children in South Asia was \nheld in Colombo in September. The Conference resolved to set up several goals \nand a time frame for their achievement. The specific goals deal with \neducation, child-welfare and children's rights. \nSAARC is also looking forward to promoting mutually beneficial \ncooperation with other regional and international organizations. \nThis has been a year of heightened activity in the SAARC region. The \ncountries of our region are determined to maintain this momentum. \nIn this context I quote the words of our President, His Excellency \nRanasinghe Premadasa: \n\\\"A sense of innovation must animate SAARC cooperation. We cannot \nremain static. Fresh and imaginative approaches are needed. We have to \nface new challenges. New ways have to be found to deal with old problems \nthat have lingered, defying solutions. \n\\\"We in South Asia, have the ability to forge together a unity based \non our ancient ties. Let us accept the challenge to build together a \nsolidarity of mutual respect; one which will strengthen each individual \n\nnation in its independence. A solidarity which will weld our nations \ninto a purposeful and dynamic unity. We will be then be able to face \nwith confidence our common future\\\". \nThese sentiments are a beacon for regional cooperation in South Asia. \nIn meeting the challenges that lie ahead it is abundantly clear that the \nUnited Nations offers the best hope for humankind. The strong and the weak, \nthe rich and the poor, the industrialized and the developing are all \nrepresented here. It is only through our deliberations that the problems of \nour world come into global focus and solutions can be provided accordingly. \nFor the first time after the Charter of the United Nations was signed in \nSan Francisco, 47 years ago, the peoples of the world through their \nrepresentatives here assembled have it in their power to provide new \ndirections for ensuring peace, security, prosperity and social justice in \nkeeping with today's realities. The challenges are many; equally, the \nopportunities are great. We owe it to the millions who crave equity and \njustice and a better life in larger freedom that we shoulder our \nresponsibilities with courage and perseverance. We cannot afford to falter or \nfail. We must succeed."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of the \nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea, I would like to congratulate you, \nMr. Ganev, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its \nforty-seventh session. It is my conviction that under your able leadership \nthis session will come to a fruitful conclusion. \nI would like also to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for \nthe efforts made over the past year by His Excellency \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in carrying out his heavy responsibilities as \nSecretary-General, to ensure world peace and security and to strengthen the \nrole of the United Nations in line with changes in the international situation. \nThe end of the cold war that had persisted ever since the end of the \nSecond World War brought with it great changes in the recent international \nsituation. In this vortex of change in the international situation, the phase \nof detente is beginning in North-East Asia. \n\nRecent events on the Korean peninsula are attracting world attention. \nDialogue between the north and the south on many levels is under way to end \nthe distrust and confrontation resulting from prolonged national division. In \nparticular, the north-south high-level talks have resulted in the adoption of \nthe Agreement on Reconciliation, Non-Aggression, Cooperation and Exchanges. \nThis is a great victory in the nationwide struggle to bring about the three \nprinciples of national reunification: independence, peaceful reunification \nand great national unity. It is a new, historic milestone on the road to \nnational reunification. The north-south Agreement and the north-south Joint \nStatement of 4 July constitute a programme for national reunification that \nreflects the aspirations of the Korean nation to reunification and the current \ntrends towards peace. \nIn the north-south Agreement, the north and the south make it clear that \nrelations between the two sides are not inter-State relations but rather \nspecial relations formed provisionally in the process of moving towards \nreunification. In the Agreement, the north and the south also pledge to \nrecognize and respect each other's systems and to refrain from interfering in \neach other's internal affairs. \n\nThis Agreement shows that both the north and the south want a single \nunified State, not \\\"two States\\\", and look to achieve reunification along the \nlines of confederation. Reunification through confederation based on one \nnation, one State, two systems and two Governments has become a realistic \ngoal. It is an issue which can no longer be avoided both in view of the \npresent trend of the international situation which is moving towards \nrapprochement, detente and the end of confrontation and in the light of the \nspecific conditions on the Korean peninsula where two different ideas and \nsystems exist. \nThe highlight of our proposal for reunification through confederation is \nthat the north and south form a unified national Government to be represented \nby the north and the south on an equal basis under which the north and the \nsouth exercise regional autonomy with equal rights and power. It will be the \nmost peaceful and ideal method of reunification. It will form a single State \nby uniting the two autonomous governments, maintaining the two systems \nintact. And it will be based on the principle of coexistence with neither \nside conquering or overpowering or being conquered or being overpowered. \nThis proposal for confederation, acceptable to both sides during \ndialogue, is now turning from possibility to feasibility. The recent \n8th North-South High Level Talks in Pyongyang have led to the functioning of \njoint committees for the implementation of the Agreement in different areas \nsuch as political, military, economic, social and cultural. \nIt is true that the north-south dialogue for implementing the Agreement \nis confronted with a series of obstacles and difficulties because the feelings \nof distrust and confrontation conceived during the long period of the division \nstill remain. \n\nHowever, we are optimistic about the prospect of north-south dialogue and \nreunification. Blood is thicker than water. The homogeneous nationhood of \nthe Korean people surpasses the differences of the systems and ideas of the \nnorth and south. Our people, with their strong sense of national \nindependence, have good traditions and experiences of having achieved unity \nfor the common cause of the nation, transcending the differences of ideas, \npolitical views and religious beliefs. \nThe Government of our Republic will exert all its efforts to follow \nthrough the already-begun reunification process in order to reach the final \npoint of reunification by reviving such national traditions. We will also do \nour best to resolve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula at an early date \nin the interest of peace and reunification of Korea, as agreed upon by the \nnorth and the south in the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the \nKorean Peninsula. \nThe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and the nuclear suspicion that \nremains unresolved stem from the deployment of United States nuclear weapons \nin south Korea. Therefore, fundamental to resolving the nuclear issue on the \nKorean peninsula is the withdrawal of United States nuclear weapons from South \nKorea and the removal of the serious apprehension of our nation which has been \nunder a nuclear threat during the last 30 years. \nTo this end, it is urgent to adopt an agreement and regulations of \ninspection under the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean \nPeninsula and to inspect the United States nuclear weapons and bases in south \nKorea. The North-South Joint Nuclear Control Committee, although it has met \nseveral times, has not yet adopted the regulations of inspection to verify the \ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula nor has it carried out any inspection \n\nof the United States nuclear weapons and bases in south Korea. This is due to \nthe fact that the south Korean authorities are not in a position to exercise \ntheir sovereign right regarding the question of United States nuclear weapons \nand bases. \nThis situation, we believe, has prevented the North-South Joint Nuclear \nControl Committee from arriving at an agreement to include the United States \nnuclear weapons and bases in the scope of the parameters for inspection. \nQuite recently, it was revealed that United States nuclear weapons have been \nstockpiled in the secret nuclear storage in south Korea and a naval base in \nJinhae, south Korea, also serves as a United States nuclear submarine base. \nThis causes a great number of people to have suspicion about the sincerity of \nthe announcement of the non-existence of United States nuclear weapons in \nsouth Korea. It is most deplorable that the south Korean authorities do not \nhave a say on the presence of nuclear weapons from other countries which are \nnow on their own soil nor can they verify the withdrawal of these nuclear \nweapons. \nAs far as we are concerned, we have declared time and time again that we \nhave no nuclear weapons, nor any intention or capacity to make them. We have \nno need to produce them. It is our firm will, in line with our invariable \nanti-nuclear peace policy, to use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes \nand not to develop nuclear weapons. \n\nThe honesty of the peaceful nuclear policy of the Government of our Republic \nand the will for denuclearization have already been proved by several ad hoc \ninspections of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The so-called \nsuspicion of our \\\"nuclear development\\\" is fading away. We do what we say and \nwe never say empty words. \nIf the south Korean authorities are really concerned about the \\\"future\\\" \nof the Korean peninsula and interested in realizing its denuclearization, they \nshould take an independent stand free from outside forces and respond as soon \nas possible to adopting the regulations of inspection, so that the overall \ninspection of United States nuclear weapons and bases could be carried out as \nagreed upon by the north and the south. \nThe reunification of the Korean peninsula presupposes the eradication of \nthe legacy of the cold war and the termination of foreign interference. The \nKorean question has been closely related to international relations \nhistorically. The division of Korea was brought about not by the internal \ncontradictions of our nation but was imposed on it against its will to serve \nonly the interests of foreign forces. \nIt is foreign forces that impede the ongoing north-south talks. \nConsequently, the key issue in realizing the reunification of the Korean \npeninsula today is to end foreign interference in the Korean question. The \npresence of United States troops in south Korea is clear evidence of \ninterference by a foreign force impeding the solution to the Korean question. \nDuring the cold-war era the presence of foreign armed forces in other \ncountries was \\\"justified\\\" under the pretext of preserving the so-called \nbalance of forces. However, this argument no longer holds today since the \ncold war ended and power politics have become meaningless. \n\nThere is no justification whatsoever for the continued presence of United \nStates forces in south Korea. On the Korean peninsula, the north and the \nsouth have pledged themselves to non-aggression through the Agreement and have \nformed the joint military commission to deal with military affairs. \nNevertheless, the United States is still pursuing a policy of \\\"power \npolitics\\\" based on the cold-war way of thinking. The United States continues \nto \\\"justify\\\" the stationing of its armed forces in south Korea with the new \nargument that a \\\"power vacuum\\\" could be created. \nIt is contradictory to claim, according to one's interest, that on some \noccasions peace has come to the world and on other occasions to divide the \nworld into friends and enemies, talking about a \\\"power vacuum\\\". The United \nStates must drop its policy of power towards the Korean peninsula and withdraw \nits troops from south Korea, thereby fulfilling its responsibility in helping \nto achieve peace and the reunification of Korea. \nIn today's world - which stands at the crossroads of independence or \ndomination, peace or war, cooperation or division the peace, security and \nreunification of the Korean peninsula become one of the most urgent questions, \nthe solution of which brooks no further delay. The problem of Korea's \nreunification is a touchstone. Whether or not it is solved will clarify \nwhether international society is entering a stage of independent, peaceful and \ndemocratic development or still remains in the era of domination and \nsubjugation, conflict and confrontation. \nIt is our hope that Korea's reunification will be realized through \nconfederation on the basis of the three principles of independence, peaceful \nreunification and great national unity which the north and south have already \n\nannounced with full commitment, thus showing one part of the genuine \ndevelopment of international society. \nHumankind is now at a historical turning-point for opposing domination \nand subjugation and building a new, free and peaceful world. Such aspirations \nof humankind, however, are still being gravely challenged by the old forces \nthat pursue power politics. Despite the collapse of the cold-war structure \ncharacterized by confrontation between the super-Powers, there are new, open \nattempts to capitalize on this situation in order to establish world \ndomination. \nIf such attempts are allowed to go unchecked, the world will change from \nthe cold-war structure of a bipolar system to the hegemonistic structure of a \nunipolar system and the democratic development of international society will \nsuffer yet another setback. \nTherefore, today's era can brook no further delay in establishing a new, \njust international order to replace the old international order under which a \nfew countries go unchallenged and freely dominate the destiny of humankind. \nThere are big and small countries in the world, but there cannot be senior or \njunior countries; there are developed and less developed nations, but there \ncannot be dominating nations and nations destined to be dominated. \nAll countries and nations are entitled to independent and equal rights as \nequal members of international society, regardless of the size of their \nterritories or level of development. Neither privileges nor arbitrariness \nshould be tolerated in international relations, and friendship and cooperation \namong countries should be developed positively on the principle of mutual \nrespect, non-interference, equality and mutual benefit. \n\nIt is the expectation of the people of the world that the United Nations, \nunder the changed situation today, will play a pivotal role in securing peace \nand achieving the common prosperity of mankind by fulfilling its mission as \nthe international organization to safeguard world peace and justice. \nAt the recent tenth summit conference of non-aligned countries, the Heads \nof State and Government were unanimous in their emphasis on the necessity of \nstrengthening the role of the United Nations in safeguarding world peace and \nsecurity and in establishing an equitable international order. \nThe United Nations should pay careful attention to bringing about \ndisarmament and the dismantling of weapons of mass destruction, including \nnuclear weapons, in keeping with the present situation in which the cold war \nhas come to an end. Mankind can neither get rid of the danger of nuclear war, \nnor expect true peace, so long as the arms race continues unbridled and \nnuclear weapons remain. We hold that a comprehensive treaty banning nuclear \ntests should be concluded as soon as possible. Testing and production of \nnuclear weapons should be stopped, and nuclear weapons should be abolished \nonce and for all. \nThe prevention of the emergence of any new nuclear Power is another \nimportant issue in settling the nuclear problem. In this connection, we could \nnot but express our concern that, despite world condemnation, Japan is storing \nmore nuclear fuel than it needs, and is even carrying out an adventurous plan \ninvolving the marine transportation of plutonium. \nThe Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will in the \nfuture, as in the past, make positive efforts to abolish nuclear weapons, \nbiological and chemical weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction on \nthe globe. \n\nThe United Nations should pay particular attention to the economic issue, \none of the important problems in establishing a new international order at \npresent, and endeavour to eliminate the ever-widening gap between the \ndeveloped and the developing countries. People in many developing countries \nare enduring great suffering from famine and disease. Anyone who feels \nresponsibility for the survival and future of mankind cannot turn away from \nsuch tragedies occurring in the world. \nIt is the most urgent common task of mankind at present to spare the \npeoples of the developing countries the calamities of famine and disease. The \ndeveloped countries should feel due responsibility for the economic poverty of \nthe developing countries, and should refrain from hindering the economic \ndevelopment of the developing countries. In this regard, the Government of \nour Republic holds that dialogue between the developed and the developing \ncountries should be resumed at the earliest possible date, the present unequal \ninternational economic relations should be restructured, and constructive \nmeasures should be taken for the establishment of a new equitable \ninternational economic order. \nAlong with this, the developing countries should take practical measures \nto achieve South-South cooperation, starting with the spheres of food, \nagriculture and public health, which will be indispensable in eradicating \nfamine and disease. \nThe United Nations should also continue to concentrate on the peaceful \nsolution of regional disputes and the elimination of all kinds of interference \nin internal affairs and unjust pressure. Today, when the confrontational \nstructure between the super-Powers has collapsed and new, many-sided \ninternational relations are emerging, ethnic, national and racial \n\ncontradictions which have long been obscured behind the cold war are rapidly \nsurfacing with increased intensity, thus triggering new regional conflicts. \nThese constitute elements of instability, which will complicate regional \nsituations and cause serious damage to world peace and security. \nUrgent measures should be taken to settle the problems of regional \ndisputes peacefully through dialogue, negotiations and political \ncoordination. All countries and nations are entitled to decide freely on \ntheir own political and economic systems and development on the basis of \nrespect for the principles of national sovereignty, the right to \nself-determination, and non-interference in internal affairs. We should not \nallow any attempts to infringe upon the sovereignty of other countries, to \ninterfere in their internal affairs and to impose unfair blockades and \npressure. Human rights should no longer be used as leverage for political \npressure against and interference in the developing countries. \nWe take this opportunity to extend our unqualified support for and \nsolidarity with the struggle of the peoples in Asia, Africa, Latin America and \nthe rest of the world to safeguard national independence and sovereignty and \nachieve independent national development, particularly the struggle of the \nCambodian people under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk to restore \npeace and national unity and the status of a sovereign State; the struggle of \nthe Palestinian and other Arab peoples for a fair solution to the Middle East \nquestion, centred on the Palestinian question; the struggle of the South \nAfrican people to end the policy of apartheid and attain their country's \ndemocratic development; and the struggle of the Cuban people to defend their \nsovereignty against all kinds of foreign pressure and interference. \n\nThe Government of our Republic recognizes that the United Nations should \ndemocratize itself as soon as possible in order to fulfil its responsibilities \nand roles in establishing a new world order. Before anything else is done, \nthe United Nations should be restructured and reformed to develop \ninternational relations on a new democratic basis. \n\nThe restructuring of the United Nations is indispensable, inasmuch as it will \nenable the world body to perform efficiently its main mission as an \ninternational organization safeguarding world peace and justice by dynamically \ncoping with a changed reality and new challenges. \nTo this end, the United Nations should be democratized on the principle \nof ensuring independence, equality and justice for all Member States and never \ntolerating privileges within the United Nations. Independence, equality and \njustice are, indeed, strong binding forces that have enabled more than 100 \ncountries on this planet to join in one community, the United Nations, \nirrespective of differences in ideologies and systems and the gap between the \nrich and the poor. \nIn order to realize the democratization of the United Nations and to \nensure its impartiality in line with the present changing international \nsituation, the privileged positions of a few countries should no longer be \npermitted in the United Nations. The relations between the Security Council, \nthe General Assembly and the Secretary-General should be reorganized with a \nview to strengthening the United Nations. In particular, the Security Council \nshould not infringe the supreme authority of the General Assembly. \nIn this regard, we believe that special attention should be paid to the \nproblem of the composition of the Security Council. However, we consider that \na country that still fails to feel any responsibility for aggression and war \ncrimes committed during the Second World War is not qualified to become a \npermanent member of the Security Council, even if the number of the Council's \npermanent members is to be increased. \nOne of the most important problems in democratizing the United Nations is \nto eliminate the leftover inequities of the cold war. The United Nations \n\nCommand, a legacy of the cold-war era, still remains on the Korean peninsula. \nIt is indeed astonishing and surprising that these \\\"United Nations forces\\\" -\nwhich are not under the command of the United Nations and over which the \nUnited Nations cannot exercise any authority still exist in this world. \nThe United Nations should no longer deeply disappoint Member States with \nthe sense that its authority is applied selectively, depending on which State \nis involved. The United Nations should live up to the expectations of Member \nStates in terms of its impartial and sincere image by eradicating all unjust \nand contradictory remnants of the cold war. \nOur delegation attaches great importance to this forty-seventh session of \nthe General Assembly and will exert every effort to ensure its success. What \nis important in ensuring world peace and security and in strengthening \ninternational cooperation is to further enhance the responsibility and role of \nStates Members of the United Nations. \nThe Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will actively \ncontribute to building a prosperous, peaceful and free new world by faithfully \nfulfilling its obligations as a State Member of the United Nations at this \nhistoric turning-point in the achievement of a durable peace and security in \nthe world. \n"

        "file_text": "Exactly 500 years ago, in 1492, \ntwo worlds collided. That collision completely altered the fate of human \ncivilization and the destinies of the two peoples involved. One people \nachieved ascending heights; the other virtually disappeared. What remains of \nthe indigenous populations of the Caribbean, or much of the \\\"new world\\\", \nserves as a measurement of man's ability to be brutish in the pursuit of \nwealth. My Caribbean island country has been more than a witness of change in \nthe 500-year decline, transformation and recreation of the region. From \nconquest through slavery, from colonial hegemony to political independence, \nAntigua and Barbuda has been a maker of history in the Caribbean and, indeed, \nin the larger region. \nIn 1992, however, our country stands, with the rest of the world, on the \nthreshold of yet another momentous collision. This time the collision is \nbetween human civilization and nature; this time there are no ascending \nheights; this time humanity itself could disappear. \nFor 500 years, from Columbus to Rio, our forests and our oceans, our air \nand our lands - the Earth's gifts to humanity have been wrongly regarded as \ninexhaustible and unchanging. \\\"If Columbus uncovered our Earth's expanse, Rio \nrevealed its limits.\\\" Humanity, all agree, cannot march along on its present \ncourse for another 500 years. In fact, humanity cannot proceed with business \nas usual for even another 100 years. Island countries, like my own and others \nin the Caribbean and in the Pacific, stand in real danger of being submerged \nby swollen oceans. Moreover, global warming, insidious climate change, \nozone-layer depletion, the loss of forests and other dangers threaten \nhumanity's very existence. \nDramatic changes in the systems of production, distribution and disposal \nare required of the industrialized countries if we are to save ourselves. \n\nDeveloped countries cannot consume the Earth's resources at current rates; \ndeveloping countries cannot be made to languish in the dusty exhaust of \nrapidly accelerating technological societies. Sustainable development that \ntakes account of environmental costs must begin to guide humanity's \ntechnological future. Only the United Nations and its General Assembly can \nconstruct the new world which, in Rio, this family of nations agreed to \ncommence building immediately. \nIt is thus fitting that, in 1992, a representative of Bulgaria has been \nselected to preside over the General Assembly at its forth-seventh session. \nHis nation is taking part in a great regional experiment, the outcome of which \nis sure to influence the course of human civilization worldwide. Antigua and \nBarbuda hails Bulgaria for its courage, and I pledge the full support of my \ndelegation for the President throughout the forty-seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly. \nPermit me to applaud the outgoing President, Mr. Samir Shihabi of Saudi \nArabia, for his unfailing efforts to bring reform to the United Nations and \nfor his diligence during Saudi Arabia's year-long tenure. This community owes \nMr. Shihabi a debt that can be repaid only through a continuous effort to \nstrengthen the General Assembly during the coming years. We must focus our \nefforts on economic, social and humanitarian matters with no less vigour than \nis currently directed at political and security concerns. Antigua and Barbuda \ncan be relied upon to promote the multilateral approach to problem solving, \nconfident that multilateralism will always prove to be superior. \nIn that regard, it may be recalled that when we commenced the forty-sixth \nsession of the General Assembly one year ago Haiti was free. The first \n \n\ndemocratically elected President of Haiti stood at this podium. The United \nNations had contributed to the ending of tyranny in the Caribbean's oldest but \npoorest Republic, and all delegations celebrated with President Aristide. \nTen days after President Aristide\\\"s triumphant declaration in this Hall, \ntyranny once again raised its ugly head in our sister Caribbean isle. The \nmilitary plotters who brutally seized power in Haiti one year ago are still on \ntheir perch. But this Assembly will never rest until democracy is restored \nand Haiti's people are again free. \nAntigua and Barbuda, working within the framework established by the \nOrganization of American States, will continue to press for the expansion of \nsanctions in order to isolate further the military regime in Haiti and to \nreturn Haiti to democracy. If we do not succeed quickly in Haiti, the United \nNations will risk tarnishing its well-earned reputation for being able to \ntackle exceedingly complex problems in extremely violent situations in other \ncorners of the globe. \nIn South Africa, for example. United Nations sanctions have assisted in \nbringing the apartheid regime to the negotiating table. It was 46 years ago, \nin 1946, that India brought the question of apartheid in South Africa to the \nattention of the United Nations; today, 179 Member States are anxious to see \nlegalized racism exorcized from the body politic. \nTwelve weeks ago, when the Security Council convened to seek a solution \nto the violence in South Africa, my delegation gave notice to the racist \nregime that any attempt on its part to delay the establishment of democracy in \nSouth Africa by fomenting violence would cause us to press for the \nreintroduction of the sanctions that had been relaxed. We repeat our pledge \n\n\ntoday. While they praise the courage of those who have entered into \nconstitutional talks, my countrymen will never lose sight of the fact that \napartheid is an evil whose demise the world's peoples eagerly await. Until \napartheid is eliminated. South Africa will continue to be excluded from this \nfamily of nations. \nAntigua and Barbuda takes this opportunity to welcome to our family the \n12 newly independent nations that have emerged with the end of the cold war \nand the collapse of an empire. Island countries in the Caribbean gained their \nindependence, beginning 30 years ago, during the decline of another empire. \nIt is thus with a shared sense of exhilaration that we welcome Armenia, \nAzerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, \nthe Republic of Moldova, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to \nmembership of the United Nations. It may be too late to caution our new \nMembers to avoid the pitfalls of fierce nationalism and unharnessed ethnic \nrivalry. Both inevitably lead to fractious and violent turmoil, which, we \nknow, surely end without victors. All multiracial and multi-ethnic societies \nmust learn to settle historic and current differences peacefully. \n\n\nNotwithstanding the domestic discord which may obtain following the \narrival of independence, small nations which dwell in the geopolitical shadow \nof a giant must be forever diligent in protecting their sovereignty. The \nUnited Nations, fostering as it does respect for international law, remains \nthe most certain guarantor of a small nation's independence. \nKnowing the importance of the United Nations, therefore, we work towards \nfashioning a system which responds favourably to the interests of even the \nleast among equals. Our world parliament cannot become, and must not ever \nappear to have become, the handmaiden of a few powerful Member States. The \nintegrity of the United Nations lies in the ability of even its smallest \nMember to participate meaningfully in shaping United Nations policy. \nAntigua and Barbuda thus welcomes San Marino to membership in this our \nfamily of nations. As our smallest Member State, San Marino bears a special \nresponsibility to pronounce on the responsiveness of the United Nations to the \ninitiatives of the less powerful. Antigua and Barbuda pledges its fullest \nco-operation with the delegation of San Marino, now and in the future. \nWe also congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, on \ndemonstrating a willingness to speak boldly concerning matters to which \ninsufficient attention has been paid. United Nations leadership must chart a \ncourse which promotes peace, justice and freedom wherever these cherished \nhuman values are in danger of disappearing. \nThe danger to cherished human values is also manifested in \nunderdevelopment. Island developing countries, and other small countries, \nmust look increasingly to the multilateral institutions for varied assistance \nin finding solutions to vexing problems. The United Nations system cannot \n\n\nreduce its economic and social development roles without adversely affecting \nprevailing material conditions. \nNotwithstanding this admonition, our experience confirms that development \nis also greatly influenced by good governance and the intelligent use of \nscarce resources, including investment capital. While we have relied and will \ncontinue to rely on ourselves to provide good governance, our investment \ncapital has to be imported. Our small size, however, puts us at the mercy of \nthe major capital markets, over which Antigua and Barbuda, like other small \ncountries, exercises not one iota of control. The United Nations, aware of \nthe special disadvantages that are inherent in the small island developing \ncountry, must respond in a manner which appropriately reflects these \ncircumstances. \nMy delegation thus takes this opportunity to commend highly the United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP). Its funding of, and support for, a \nnumber of beneficial projects within my region earns it great applause. \nHowever, we continue to object to the use of the per capita gross national \nproduct (GNP) device for determining development status and funding \neligibility of small island countries. For large countries, the device is \nperfect. It was devised with large countries in mind. But when applied to a \nsmall island country, the per capita GNP device results in a distortion. \nThe measurement device fails to take into account the much higher cost \nper person which small populations incur for routine services that are \nprovided at minimal cost to large populations, even large populations in poor \ncountries. It fails to reflect the inherent inability of our embryonic \nmanufacturing industries to penetrate major markets because their production \n \n\nlevels reflect small size. It fails to reward good governance and sacrifice, \npreferring instead to believe the fiction that a well-run small island \ndeveloping country has graduated, is developed and, hence, in need of no \nassistance because a distorted per capita GNP device so determines. We are \nflattered to be regarded as developed, but that characterization is \ninaccurate. We reject the per capita GNP device and therefore call for the \nuse of more reliable indicators when assistance to small island developing \ncountries is contemplated. \nIn projects relating to improvement of the environment, small island \ndeveloping countries have been successful in persuading their larger partners \nto accept the fact that their unique vulnerabilities require special \nconsideration. In this regard, Antigua and Barbuda, in its country report to \nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), \nidentified high-priority areas pertaining to its heritage resources that \nrequire special assistance. It is our hope that the UNDP and its capacity 21 \nfunding mechanism will be persuaded to acknowledge our special needs. \nAntigua and Barbuda applauds the United Nations Development Fund for \nWomen (UNIFEM) for its very compelling promotion of the rights of women. It \ntakes no special effort for my small island developing country to recognize \nthat successful development requires the unhindered contribution of every \nable-bodied adult, regardless of gender. The elimination of de facto \ndiscrimination against women is therefore of paramount importance in my \ncountry and my region. UNIFEM, an active partner in the development process, \ncan rely upon Antigua and Barbuda's solid commitment to its universal \nobjective of empowering women in order to strengthen development and to ensure \nthat justice is gender-blind. \n\n\nThe injustices heaped upon the heads of the world's indigenous peoples \nmust also quickly cease. To that end, the United Nations has declared 1993 \nthe International Year for the World's Indigenous People. In December 1993 \nprogress made will be measured by deeds, not words. National legislation and \nfunded projects which are intended to ensure the continued survival of the \nindigenous peoples that inhabit remote corners of the Earth must be in place. \nHaving lost the indigenous Arawaks and Caribs of Antigua and Barbuda beginning \nin 1492, my country is duty-bound to ensure that powerless indigenous people \nwho have inhabited the lands of their ancestors for many millennia are \nadequately protected by the United Nations. \nEach year, Antigua and Barbuda brings to the attention of the Assembly \nthe state of affairs prevailing on Earth's last uninhabited continent \nAntarctica. Last year, we applauded when the 26 voting members of the \nAntarctic Treaty Consultative Parties entered into a binding agreement \nforbidding mining and oil exploration on Antarctica for 50 years, until the \nyear 2040. Although the agreement successfully curbs this generation's \ncupidity, we believe that Antarctica must never become the possession of large \nStates only. Transforming Antarctica into a world park or protected area \nunder the umbrella of United Nations control would be a more certain guarantee \nof its preservation. \nDuring the past year, more human beings died of starvation and violence \nin Somalia than the entire population of my country. Tens of thousands more \nwill die in the coming months by self-inflicted violence complicated by the \nravages of nature. The United Nations, recognizing the desperation of \nSomalia's 4.5 million people, must further increase its efforts to find a \nsolution to the crisis. \n\n \nOn the question of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United Nations has spared \nno effort to end the crisis. The European Community is apparently determined \nthat some crises require more than a regional response. Those of us from \nLatin America and the Caribbean, whose regional organization has addressed the \nintractable question of Haiti with little success, have the benefit of the \nEuropean experience as a guide. \n\n\nMy country rejoices with the Central American countries as peace blankets \ntheir region. The sound of working hands has replaced the sound of working \nguns, we are told. If future civil war is to be prevented, however, the \neconomic systems which prevail in Central America must become far more \ninclusive: the sharing of wealth must result in more than a trickle going to \nthe poor. \nThe trickling flow of peace in the Middle East is most heart-warming. \nAntigua and Barbuda applauds the Israelis and the Palestinians for finally \nsitting down together and negotiating their future. It is our hope that, \nsoon, Israel will be allowed to exist within secure and accepted borders and \nthat the Palestinians will have a sovereign State of their own. \nWe rejoice at the wave of peace which has engulfed Lebanon. Despite the \nunresolved problems, which the electoral system has attempted to address, \nLebanon is facing the future with a certainty of peace that has eluded it for \nmore than a decade. A land as beautiful, as culturally diverse and as full of \nso many warm people as is Lebanon must pledge to enter the twenty-first \ncentury at peace with itself. \nMy delegation concludes by recalling that the modern history of our \npeaceful Caribbean began 500 years ago when another world collided with it. \nThe pursuit of accumulated wealth which propelled one world towards the other \nremains the motive force of the dominant civilization of today. Yet, complex \nwebs have been weaved into this underlying theme, which even a small country, \na small place, like mine can take credit in reshaping. \n\n\nFor example, on 3 October 1736, exactly 256 years ago this year, an \nunsuccessful slave revolution took place in Antigua. The leaders of that \nrevolution are the heroes of the freedom-loving people of Antigua and \nBarbuda. In 1736, our heroes attempted to destroy a wicked system which \nguaranteed the most certain accumulation of wealth at the expense of human \nmisery. By our own choosing, therefore, Antiguans and Barbudans of today, the \ndescendants of those slaves and those slave-masters, have declared that in our \nhierarchy of values freedom is superior to all else. \nIn 1992, the human being, not wealth accumulation, is at the centre of \ndevelopment and civilization. Yet, our countries are now engaged in a great \ndebate about the future, and the United Nations General Assembly is the \nplatform. The importance of keeping the entire United Nations system from \nbecoming homogenized in its thinking is most important at a time when the \nemerging new world order is being shaped increasingly by a single Power. \nOur task is not merely to express a differing point of view, but to \ndemonstrate in a concrete manner that the raison d'etre of the civilization of \nthe next 500 years has not yet been decided. In fact, given the threat to the \nvery existence of small islands from rising sea levels, violent hurricanes, \nhazardous-waste disposal and other looming environmental calamities, the \nburden of defining the future may very likely fall upon the thinkers and \nactors from these most vulnerable, small countries. \nIndeed, our Prime Minister, the Right Honourable V. C. Bird, has \nfrequently said that small size does not mean small minds or the absence of \ngrand ideas. And so, my countrymen and I, having learned well the lessons of \nour history, shall continue to do all in our power at this United Nations and \nelsewhere to influence the future. We shall rely upon our collective wisdom. \n\n\nthe strength of our institutions, the vitality of our youth, and the will of \nour leadership to exercise that influence. Our very existence requires \nsuccess; and so we shall succeed. \n"

        "file_text": "As the first representative of the Independent \nRepublic of Tajikistan, I wish to congratulate you. Sir, on your election to \nthe presidency of the Assembly and to express my Government's confidence in \nyour guidance of the deliberations of the General Assembly at its \nforty-seventh session to a successful conclusion. \n \nI should also like to convey the felicitations of my Government to \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, under whose able leadership we are confident the \nUnited Nations will stand up to the new challenges in the years to come. \nThe breakup of the Soviet Union more than a year ago gave birth to new \nindependent States, which are making their mark on the world map. Although \nsome of these States obtained their independence fairly easily, most of them \nare experiencing a great deal of difficulty in forming new States. \nThe formation of a new Tajikistan is currently at a difficult and \nsensitive stage, which could be cause for concern. Tajikistan, like some \nother former Soviet States, is in the midst of an economic crisis. Since the \nreasons for this crisis are quite obvious, I should like to point out several \nother factors that exacerbate the severity of our situation. \nFirst, as an agricultural country, we were recently devastated by heavy \nrains and floods, which ruined our crops. Our economic losses are estimated \nat more than 10 billion roubles. In this context, allow me, on behalf of the \npeople and Government of Tajikistan, to extend our appreciation to the people \nand Governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, Turkey and the \nUnited States of America for their assistance. However, I must add that this \nrelief assistance has fallen far short of our proportionately large needs. I \ntherefore call upon all international humanitarian organizations to send \nemergency relief assistance and foodstuffs to Tajikistan as soon as possible. \nSecondly, our geographical location puts us at a disadvantage in terms of \ntransportation and accessibility. As far as transportation is concerned, up \nuntil the past few weeks there was even a threat of a blockade of the Republic. \nLastly, Tajikistan has been experiencing some political unrest during the \ncourse of the past year. \n\nDespite these problems, since its independence Tajikistan has been \nrecognized by 115 countries; established diplomatic relations with 37 \ncountries and opened the doors of the embassies of seven countries in our \ncapital, Dushanbe; and has become a member of such great world organizations \nas the United Nations, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nand the Economic Cooperation Organization. I humbly submit that this is an \nongoing process. \nAt this point, I should like to outline the foreign policy of the \nRepublic of Tajikistan. As members know, from the very first days of its \nindependence Tajikistan chose democracy as a system for its new development; \ndespite economic and social difficulties, and even the death of its own sons, \nit has remained and will remain firm in its choice. It is no secret that the \ntension in our country was caused mainly by the former Government's attempts \nto breach certain regulations concerning freedom of the media and human \nrights. But these attempts failed and we will not allow them to surface \nagain. At present, there is no power in Tajikistan that can stop the movement \nof democracy, but we need the support of the world community to ensure that \ndemocracy prevails in our Republic. \nUnfortunately, owing to the sensitivity of the situation, we cannot \ndisclose information concerning certain events in our country. We believe \nthat such information, if known, could only intensify the problem. But we \nwish the world community to know that we have no objection to the kind of \nfreedom of the media that conveys true facts from various points of view and \nwithin the framework of integrity and professional ethics. We have had no \ncase in which a journalist has been refused entry into Tajikistan or in which \nwe have interfered with his or her activities. \n\nNevertheless, we are often unhappy with the activity of the media from \nsome countries that distort the facts and actual events. For instance, for a \nyear certain media sources have been claiming that Tajikistan is building a \nfundamental Islamic State. They support this claim by alleging that \nTajikistan is going to adopt an Islamic ideology in the place of communism; \nthat Tajikistan is the only Islamic republic of the former Soviet Union where \na political Islamic party exists legally and has grown into a unique political \nforce; and that Tajikistan's foreign policy extends preferential treatments to \nIslamic countries. I declare before the General Assembly that none of these \nallegations is accurate and that we reject them all. \nThe communist system and the communist ideology failed, and their \ninfluence is insignificant now. To believe that the people of Tajikistan \nwould wish to replace communism with an Islamic ideology would be a great \nmistake. On the basis of freedom of speech and assembly, peoples of different \npolitical persuasions including democratic, nationalist and Islamic groups \nare legally active, in unison, in today's Tajikistan. This is the first sign \nof the democratization process in Tajikistan. We call upon the international \ncommunity to assist us in our process of democratization. A relapse into \ncommunist dictatorship is impossible in our country. The people of Tajikistan \nare against any totalitarian regime. There is no foundation in Tajikistan for \nestablishing such a totalitarian government. However, we are extremely \nconcerned that the critical state of our economy can lead our country off its \nchosen course. Therefore, I appeal to the representatives of the world \ncommunity to evaluate the situation in Tajikistan and to support the new \ndemocracy. \n\nAs I have already indicated, all political parties in Tajikistan function \nwithin the law. Any conclusion to the contrary would be ill-founded and \nunrealistic. \nOn the question of friendly relations between Tajikistan and the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran and the Islamic State of Afghanistan, I should say that for \nus these are not merely two neighbouring Muslim countries. Tajikistan, Iran, \nand Afghanistan recall for one another the historic memory of a single \nnation. All of us constitute a single cultural, ethnic and linguistic unit. \nWe rejoice in our independence, which allows us to establish friendly and \ngood-neighbourly relations with our brothers and sisters in Iran and \nAfghanistan. We are proud of our heritage, our history and our culture, and \nhope that the significance of these factors in our lives will never diminish. \nOnce one has strayed from one's origins, one must seek a state of reunion. \nI also want to emphasize that the goal of our foreign policy is to create \na democratic society that will live in peace with its neighbours. This is the \nultimate objective we pursue in our internal and foreign policies. Our \nforeign policy is, in fact, designed to secure this noble goal. The \nunderlying objective of our foreign policy is to create a positive environment \nfor Tajikistan in the international community. In this process, we will \nendeavour to adopt the type of measures and policies that benefit the people \nof Tajikistan while at the same time not constituting a threat or disservice \nto the interests of other nations. We support the guidelines established and \nrecognized by the world community with respect to the norms of international \nrelations, which stand against violations of human rights, oppression and \nracism. We support the peaceful settlement of all regional and international \nconflicts. \n\nTajikistan supports the development of large-scale relations with all \nmembers of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). We fully recognize \nand respect the inviolability of existing borders between the members of the \nCommonwealth of Independence States. We protect the human and cultural rights \nof all people living in the territory of our Republic and wish and hope that \nthe same conditions hold true for the Tajiks living in other States of the \nCIS. At the same time, we recognize that political borders in the Central \nAsian republics are not based on ethnic origin and that this reality demands \nthe exercise of much responsibility on all sides. \nTajikistan's foreign policy is based on peaceful coexistence, \ngood-neighbourly relations and non-interference in other countries' internal \naffairs. Hence, we wish to establish political, economic and cultural \nrelations with our contiguous and non-contiguous neighbouring countries, such \nas China, India, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. \nTajikistan is situated in a region where Islamic culture and spirituality \nare deeply rooted. We therefore establish relations with countries and \nIslamic organizations according to our spiritual and cultural requirements. \nIslam is a holy and divine religion and, in our view, certain Western media \nhave created an inaccurate picture of it. \nFor more than a century we lived under the Russian Tsars and later we \nlived under the Soviet Union. At this period of our history we are not making \nany judgement, positive or negative. What is past is past. Through our ties \nwith Russia and Russian intellectuals, we learned and became familiar with \nEuropean civilization. Today we are able to establish our own ties with \nEurope and come even closer to its civilization. We believe that the peoples \nof Western Europe will show us their support and assist the Tajik people in \n\ntheir noble struggle. We feel that our tremendous hydro-power, agriculture \nand mining industry offers great potential for cooperation with European \ncountries. \nAs a newly established democracy, Tajikistan greatly values friendly \nrelations with all States in Europe, the Americas, Africa, the Near and \nFar East and South-East Asia on the basis of mutual respect. We invite the \nrepresentatives of all countries in the world to visit Tajikistan and to \nwitness our open-door policy for friendly relations and mutual cooperation. \n\nWe wish to assure the world community that the leadership in Tajikistan \nis doing its utmost to stop gun-smuggling of all kinds on its southern borders \nand to prevent its recurrence. The Government has devised a scheme for\n \nconciliation and for the disarming of parties to the conflict. Conditions in \nour territory are gradually normalizing. In this context, progress has been  \nachieved; the conflict limited in any case to the central portion of one of \nthe provinces has de-escalated and a cease-fire has been agreed upon and \nannounced. Ninety per cent of our territory is in a peaceful state. This is \nnot a temporary calm, but the beginning of continued peace and durable \nstability throughout Tajikistan. We want to assure the world that we have no \nintention of becoming one of the globe's hot spots. \nI invite representatives to visit Tajikistan, one of the oldest human  \ncivilizations in the world, to begin a new era of friendship and cooperation.\n  \nOur goal is to become an economically developed country with friendly trade  \nrelations with our neighbours and with other countries in the world community.  \nTajikistan respects and fully observes the United Nation Charter and the \nrule of international law. We support the constructive programmes designed by  \nthe United Nations for the settlement of conflicts and problems throughout the  \nworld.\nWe wish to state that Tajikistan has designated a Permanent \nRepresentative to the United Nations and that he has already begun to fulfil  \nhis duties. We believe that this will contribute to a strengthening of our \nties with the United Nations and the rest of the world. "

        "file_text": "It is an honour and \nprivilege for me to address this forty-seventh session of the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly. \nOn behalf of the Government and people of Solomon Islands, I should like \nto express our sincere congratulations to you. Sir, on your election to the \npresidency of the Assembly. I am confident that under your able leadership \nmuch will be achieved. I should also like to convey our sincere thanks and \nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi, for his outstanding \nleadership during the forty-sixth session. \nSolomon Islands joins the United Nations community in congratulating and \nwelcoming Mr. Boutros-Ghali, our new Secretary-General. Mr. Boutros-Ghali has \nindeed an important and challenging task ahead. I assure the \nSecretary-General of my Government's continued support and cooperation. \nMuch has happened since the last session of the General Assembly. Like \nthe rest of the world community, Solomon Islands has viewed with interest the \npolitical developments in Eastern Europe since the latter half of 1991. \n\nSelf-determination has certainly taken its course. The former republics and \nStates of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have now gained their freedom to \ngovern and pursue their own destinies. We observe with concern, however, that \nthese changes have had some negative results. \nIt is worth noting that as a result of these changes a number of former \nrepublics and States have now become Members of this world body. In the same \nspirit as previous speakers, Solomon Islands would like to congratulate the \nnewly independent States of Georgia, Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. The presence of those countries with us in this world forum not \nonly binds us closely, but brings home a message of unity, hope and peace.\n \nDespite this message, Solomon Islands has learned with dismay about the \nrecent killings of the civilian population and United Nations personnel in \nBosnia and Herzegovina. We condemn this atrocious act. In this connection, \nSolomon Islands fully supports the various measures undertaken by the United \nNations. \nI now turn to the Middle East. Solomon Islands would like to register \nits recognition of the countries which have played a prominent role in the \nMiddle East peace initiative. We appreciate the complexities of the conflict \nand acknowledge the initiatives taken by the parties involved to find a \npeaceful and lasting solution. Solomon Islands urges those with the necessary \nresources and the will to do so, to continue to play a mediating and \nsupportive role in this process. In this context, Solomon Islands would like \nto raise the questions where and how the United Nations can best play its role \nin facilitating this effort. Given the emerging trend towards peace, Solomon \nIslands calls on the United Nations to be both sensitive and responsive in \nadopting resolutions. We look forward to more positive participation by the \nUnited Nations in this regard. \nWe should like to highlight issues that are of concern closer to home, \nthe South Pacific. As the current Chairman of the South Pacific Forum, \nSolomon Islands has an obligation to convey to this body the aspirations and \nconcerns of the region. At the twenty-third meeting of the South Pacific \nForum in Solomon Islands i 1 July this year, a number of issues of concern to \nthe region were discussed. These included environmental, trade and economic, \npolitical and security issues. \nThe South Pacific region is unique because the marine environment is an \nintegral part of our existence. Our people, perhaps more than others around \n\nthe globe, depend on the sea, the land, the rivers and the forests for their \nimmediate livelihood. But poor development planning and global environmental \nproblems, such as climate change and the associated raising of the sea level, \nare becoming a threat to our resources and aspirations. For this reason, our \nregion places environmental issues high on our agenda. Solomon Islands fully \nrecognizes the important outcome of the United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development, including the Rio de Janeiro Declaration, \nAgenda 21, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the \nConvention on Biological Diversity and the statement of principles on \nforests. We also endorse the concept of sustainable development, in which \nenvironmental protection constitutes an integral part of the development \nprocess. We are concerned, however, that the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change has not sufficiently addressed the issue of global \nwarming. We therefore earnestly urge the early commencement of the \nnegotiations on protocols to implement and elaborate upon the Convention and \nwe humbly request that this be treated as a matter of urgency. \nSolomon Islands welcomes the decision of France to suspend its nuclear \ntesting in our region. The suspension has led to an improvement in the \nrelations between France and the countries in the region. It is hoped that \nFrance will endeavour to cease nuclear testing activities in the South Pacific \nfor all time. \nSolomon Islands believes that environmental education and the need to \ncreate public awareness of environmental and related issues should form the \nfoundation for an implementation strategy for Agenda 21. My Government is \nconvinced that without educating the youth of today, who will be the adults of \ntomorrow, we will merely by paying lip-service to these conventions. \n\ndeclarations and principles on environment. In other words, sustainable \ndevelopment of the environment and its protection demand relevant and \ncost-effective educational programmes aimed at both the formal and the \nnon-formal sectors of our education systems. \nAs a step towards implementing Agenda 21, the primary and secondary \ncurriculums in Solomon Islands are being reviewed with a view to introducing \nand improving the quality of environmental science education in schools. \nWhile we might have the initiative and the motivation to enhance environmental \neducation programmes, the success of these undertakings is contingent on \nfinancial and technical assistance from the richer nations. It was heartening \nto hear, during the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development \nin Brazil, that developed countries have committed themselves to providing \n\\\"new and additional\\\" financial assistance to enable developing countries to \nmeet their obligations as stipulated under the conventions. \nOn economic and trade matters, Solomon Islands recognizes the adverse \nimpact which the global macro-economic trends have on its economy, which is \nboth open to, and susceptible to, external change. We realize that while the \ninitiative to begin economic reforms must come from the country itself, \nregional and international co-operation in such efforts is also very vital. \nSolomon Islands is at present pursuing a programme of structural \nadjustment. This programme emphasizes, first, active and effective \nprivate-sector participation; secondly, sustainable utilization of both human \nand natural resources; thirdly, privatization of government-owned companies; \nand fourthly, streamlining of the public service within the government. Being \nsmall, however, Solomon Islands cannot pursue such a programme effectively on \nits own. Success must depend on strategic regional development planning. \n\nproper coordination of development programmes, and the mobilization of \nresources to meet the needs. It also depends on the willingness and the \ncommitment of those with financial resources to be involved. In view of these \nreforms, it is our sincere hope that the international financial institutions \nand donor countries will support our efforts to achieve our goals and \nobjectives. \nThe vulnerability of small island countries to external and internal \nsecurity threats is not a new issue in this forum. It has been a major \nsubject of extensive discussion and debate over the past years. We are \nraising the issue again because, despite the end of the cold war, there has \nbeen little improvement in the situation in our region. Undesirable, criminal \nand atrocious activities and behaviour, both from within and outside the \nregion, continue to threaten the sovereignty, security and economic integrity \nof the South Pacific countries. \nAt the twenty-third meeting of the South Pacific Forum in Honiara, \nSolomon Islands, in July 1992, the Forum agreed on a Declaration on Law \nEnforcement Cooperation. This Declaration identifies priority areas and \nestablishes a framework within which security activities are to be pursued. \nBut these undesirable activities cannot be addressed at the regional level \nalone. \n \nFor the long-term peace and stability of the South Pacific region, or any \nother region for that matter, the involvement of and collaboration with \nrelevant international agencies is vital. \nOn decolonization, the Solomon Islands notes with appreciation the \npositive measures pursued in New Caledonia by the French authorities in the \nimplementation of the Matignon Accord. We encourage a continuing dialogue \namong all political parties in the territory. This is to ensure that \nself-determination consistent with the principles and practices of the \nUnited Nations Charter, in a framework within which all options, including \nthat of independence, is achieved. We encourage regular contacts and \ninteractions by the Kanaks and other New Caledonians with their South Pacific \nneighbours to give them courage and confidence as they prepare themselves to \ntake on greater roles in their affairs. \nAs a small nation, Solomon Islands sees the United Nations system as an \neffective insurance framework for our peace and security, fully realizing, of \ncourse, that we have no military forces or military hardware. To this \nimportant extent, we hail with gratification the Secretary-General's \\\"Agenda \nfor Peace\\\", which highlights preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping, peacemaking \nand peace-building as a fresh challenge to our Organization in the future. We \nrecognize these measures as they are defined in his report to be worthy of the \nattention of all Member States. \nTo conclude, may I on behalf of the Government and people of \nSolomon Islands thank the United Nations for its continued interest and \nassistance in the development of our country. \n\nI should like to place on record my Government's appreciation to the \nUnited Nations and the United Nations Missions in New York for their tributes \nand messages of condolence in honour of our former Permanent Representative to \nthe United Nations, the late Mr. Francis Bugotu. \n"

        "file_text": "It is with a \nfull awareness of the significant turning point reached by the world and the \nUnited Nations that the delegation of the Republic of Congo is approaching the \nwork of this forty-seventh session of the General Assembly over which \nMr. Ganev has the honour and privilege of presiding. On my own and my \ndelegation's behalf, I should like to congratulate him on his unanimous \nelection to the presidency. The General Assembly's choice reflects the high \nesteem and prestige which his country, Bulgaria, enjoys on the international \nscene. It is equally a tribute to his experience and personal qualities. \nI also wish once again to offer our profound gratitude to his \npredecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, who \nskilfully guided the forty-sixth session. \nMy delegation would like to ensure Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the \nSecretary-General of the United Nations, of its full cooperation. \nLastly, I wish to extend a warm welcome to the new Members, whose \nadmission further strengthens the universality of the United Nations. I am \npleased to say that the delegation of the Republic of the Congo will be happy \nto work with them during the forty-seventh session and in the future. \nThe cold war has run its course. Upon the ruins of more than 40 years of \nextreme tension. States and the United Nations system are striving to organize \non this planet a new, more democratic and more humane order. Under the \nimpetus of world developments, which have galvanized the spirit of reform \neverywhere, the United Nations as an institution is undergoing a process of \nchange. It has accordingly undertaken major initiatives in the realm of \ncooperation for development and in the realm of peace-keeping operations and \nthe restoration of peace. \nWhat new ideas are emerging? What are their chances of success? What \nrisks are posed to human rights and democracy by the challenges of growing \npoverty, third-world debt, the AIDS pandemic, drugs, and ethnic and religious \nhatreds, and by ecological disasters or those that, as we approach the end of \nthe century, result from the world population explosion? \nAs has been stated, the meeting held by the Security Council on \n31 January 1992 was the first it had ever held at the level of Heads of State \nor Government. That summit symbolized the end of an era of discord that had \nlong paralysed the United Nations. It is understandable that the \ninternational Organization should henceforth seek to define itself. It wishes \nto strengthen its potential in various areas, while at the same time \nincreasing its efficacy in complying with the provisions of the Charter. \nAfrica and the developing countries are active partners in reform. For \nis that not part of a new universalism which has become more urgent and whose \naim remains the satisfaction of fundamental needs? Let us concern ourselves \nas much with the flowering of dignity and human rights as with the economic \nand social well-being of all peoples. \nFor Africa in particular, external assistance stands as a basic \nprinciple. But it is also to a large extent the starting point of Africa's \ndevelopment. That is why Africa will remain vigilant about subtle proposals \nthat tend to marginalize its relations with the world system. Thus, in this \nnew interplay of interests aimed at introducing a new culture into the United \nNations, Africa has everything to gain by preserving, for instance, the \ndecisive role the United Nations plays, under the relevant provisions of the \nCharter, in the realm of cooperation for economic and social development. \nIn all times, the Governments that we have the honour to represent have \nassumed to right to lead people by assuming the duty to address forcefully the \nneeds of the immediate present, the hypothetical, the near future, and the \nlong-term. The first ambition remains to work for better societies that offer \nthe citizen, both as an individual and as part of the whole, less alienation \nand less constraint with more knowledge and more freedom. \nIt is noteworthy that in the constant struggle for man and society, the \ncommunity of nations assembled within the United Nations has accompanied \nnational efforts with appropriate assistance. The General Assembly, ennobled \nby its solemn nature, captures the resounding echo of public opinion from \naround the world. In this respect, it is a major source of hope. The demands \nwhich the Organization must now meet are unprecedented in their nature. The \nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in his report on the work of the \nOrganization, has written that: \n\\\"The turning-point in the scale and scope of United Nations \nactivities can be discerned after the year 1987. For the first time in \nmany years, agreement on a wide range of issues became possible, \neffectively marking an end to the cold war.\\\" (A/47/1, para. 14) \nThus, today more than ever, the debate in the General Assembly is rich with a \nvariety of issues that illustrate the expanding role of the Organization. \nIn actual fact, what is involved are generally new, modern challenges \nthat the States Members of the Organization will have to confront. This state \nof affairs, disturbing in itself, is mitigated by the dispelling of some \nproblems. Furthermore, a number of diverse national experiences, full of \nopportunity and hope, have developed in recent years and acquired real \nsignificance for freedom and restored democracy in a number of countries. \nI once again welcome the fact that the United Nations is contributing \nactively to the democratization efforts of these nations, which are referred \nto in the report on the work of Organization that I have already mentioned. I \nshould like to address the specific case of the institutions in my country, \nthe Congo. \nIn specific terms, the Republic of the Congo is moving towards an \nenlarged and more participatory democracy, the blossoming of the intellectual \nand psychological potential of the Congolese people, and the growth of \nnational solidarity. Decentralization, the keystone of the new policy of \nProfessor Pascal Lissouba, the first democratically elected President of the \nRepublic, will grant administrative powers to regions in the areas of \nmanagement and economic development. \nThere are two dimensions involved in this: the rehabilitation or \nconstruction of administrative installations, and the promotion of initiative \nand innovation in the area of development and the rural environment. The aim \nis to improve living conditions for the poorest sectors of the population by \ngiving them the means to gain access to decent housing, with the emphasis on \nlocal building materials, water supply and sanitation, family health, the \neducation of infants, and income-generating activities. \nIn the course of this year, 1992, through the exercise of universal \nsuffrage, the Congolese people, during successive free and fair elections \nperformed their duties as active citizens under the supervision of \ninternational observers, to whom my Government expresses its profound \ngratitude for the very beneficial assistance they provided our country. The \nhappy outcome of these elections today heralds a new era, that of democracy, \nto which our people is henceforth committed. Congolese public opinion, \nrevitalized by a reborn national press, has effectively contributed to \naverting political violence. In short, the Congo is now engaged in meaningful \nstructural reform, starting at the institutional level. \nThe Congo's new Constitution, adopted by referendum on 15 March 1992, \nduring the transitional period following the national conference, increases \nfreedoms in all areas. Almost 45 articles make up chapter II of the \nConstitution on rights and fundamental freedoms. Our Constitution also \nprovides for balanced public powers and seeks to establish strengthened \nsolidarity and equity. \nThe establishment of democracy at the local level not without its risks \nset the first conclusive test for the Congolese people. Local councils and \nmayors were elected by universal suffrage. Despite some inevitable but minor \nhitches, the overall system functioned in a satisfactory manner. \nIt is important to note the people's commitment to the new political, \neconomic, social, and cultural foundations upon which, after 30 years of error \nand disarray, the new political legitimacy of our country now rests. A \nbicameral parliament has been elected, with predominance given to the first \nchamber, the National Assembly, to which the government is accountable. Its \nfunctioning reflects the meticulous Congolese electoral process. \nThis process culminated with the presidential election held on 2 and \n16 August 1992. This final phase readily highlighted to public opinion, long \nunfamiliar with such things, the complex interplay of the many political \nparties and their strategic alliances. The presidential election was carried \nout in two ballots. It was hotly contested. The Congolese electors voted \nwithout constraint in secret ballot. Professor Pascal Lissouba was elected \nPresident of the Republic of the Congo. \nmessage of the President of the Republic, His Excellency \nProfessor Pascal Lissouba. There are many reasons for hope nowadays. For our \ncountry, the message proclaims, there is an irresistible democratic urge that \nhas freed energies and galvanized enthusiasm. Everything has once more become \npossible. \nThis historic new beginning implies a break with a development \nfundamentally based on such factors external to our civil society as \ninternational assistance, negotiated or imposed improvement in the terms of \ntrade, foreign investment, and the preponderant intervention of the State. \nThe new idea is that economic development and social progress should be based \nprincipally on the sense of initiative, the creativity of individuals and the \ncivil society, and on their capacity to act, innovate, and better manage the \nhuman resources and riches of the Congo. \nAs will have been noted, Congo's ambitions are bold. Mindful of the \nmagnitude of the task before us, the President of the Republic of Congo has \nstated: \n\\\"The concept of democracy nowadays may appear to be a gift. It is a \nculture, and any culture is a blending. Thus we, by virtue of our own \nculture, which involves a methodical and deliberate search for consensus, \nmust mitigate the inhumane or hard-to-accept aspects of a democracy \nfashioned in other climes.\\\" \nThe President went on to ask: \\\"What is law without custom?\\\" That is why he \ncalls for: \n\\\"respect for the assets of the community and for the love of work. This \nis what it will take to win the respect of our partners, even this must \nnecessarily rest with strengthening our links with our usual partners\\\"-\nIn this vital recovery effort, the Government of national union and the \nCongolese people will be able to derive the greatest possible benefit from \ncooperation with industrialized countries, with international organizations, \nincluding non-governmental organizations, and from the contribution of new \nforms of cooperation, without frontiers, between towns, regions and \nenterprises in the north and in the south. \nMembers will not be surprised to hear me speak of certain major problems \nthat call for the attention of the international community and, hence, of the \nUnited Nations. It is quite natural that any member State might ask itself \n\\\"What can be done? Where can we start?\\\" It seems to us that the general \ndebate is an excellent opportunity to gather together the material for a \nresponse to these questions, on the basis of proposals and of the desire of \nsome to take action and others to refrain from taking action. \nWhat is our attitude at this moment of great political and ideological \nupheaval? The Congo shares the view that it is essential that the United \nNations continue to be an especially well-suited forum for the analysis of \nevents and for concept development, particularly in respect of socio-economic \nproblems, in a spirit of renewed partnership. Indeed, the United Nations must \nserve as the right institution within which to strive for global solutions. \nThose solutions must take into account the political, humanitarian and \nsocio-economic dimensions of world problems. My delegation endorses this \napproach, particularly with respect to assistance, trade, the transfer of \ntechnologies, commodity prices and debt relief. \nThere is a prevailing feeling that the United Nations has a fresh \nopportunity to attain the objectives of the Charter - in particular, the \nmaintenance of peace and the restoration of peace and, it should be added \nsince the summit meeting of the Security Council, the promotion of preventive \ndiplomacy. Despite all the scepticism. Member States would be justified in \nkeeping alive the flame that was lit on 31 January in New York. In this \nrespect my delegation cannot but associate itself with the wise words that \nhave already been spoken from this rostrum. \nSadly, it must be acknowledged that the end of the cold war has not put \nan end to age-old antagonisms. After so many promising and hopeful events, we \nwitnessed the Yugoslav crisis break out suddenly in the heart of Europe. In \nAfrica, in addition to the mounting violence in South Africa violence that \nreflects the difficult birth pangs of a democratic, non-racial and united \nSouth Africa the Liberian and Somalian tragedies continue to give us reason \nto fear the destabilization of a number of States. As representatives must be \nwell aware, all these concerns have an impact on subregional security. \nIs it still acceptable that, in a world rich in rights and freedoms, not \nall peoples are really receiving the benefit thereof? Continued tribal or \nethnic conflicts, accompanied by war crimes, if viewed with indifference, may \nlead almost unnoticed to the extermination of tens of thousands of people. In \nEurope, people are dying in the name of ideology, and in Somalia, in the \nextreme eastern part of the African continent, the situation is even more \ntragic. Drought, combined with mindless blood-letting by clans fighting over \nthe shreds of power, are claiming thousands of victims. There is undoubtedly \na need for more international assistance. Here, once again, the activities of \nthe United Nations deserve praise. \nWe should also hail the role of the non-governmental organizations in \ntheir daily endeavours in the service of the human individual, as a gesture of \nsolidarity with mankind, regarded in its universal nature as a reasonable \nbeing. The picture is not an entirely gloomy one, if we can judge by the \nglimmers of hope coming from the talks that are under way in, for example, \nLiberia and the Middle East. \nIn the case of South Africa, all parties must agree to end the violence, \nand they must show restraint. The parties must cooperate in order to bring \nabout the earliest possible resumption of the negotiation process. The \ndevelopments of the last few weeks give us grounds to hope that this will, \nindeed, happen. In any event, the Republic of the Congo supports the \ninitiatives and all the efforts being made by the international community to \nfind the right solutions to these questions. It is in this spirit that, \ndespite its difficult economic circumstances, the Congo is contributing to \nvarious operations within the United Nations framework. Recently we \nparticipated in the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II), \nfollowing the positive experience of our presence in UNAVEM I. \nLikewise, my country supports the initiatives and decisions relating to \narms reduction, the halting of nuclear tests and the endeavours intended to \npromote transparency in international transfers of conventional arms. \nThe promotion of confidence-building, peace and security is still the \nconstant concern of many States - in particular, the States of the central \nAfrican subregion. In this context, in May, the Standing Advisory Committee \non Security Matters was created under the auspices of the United Nations. \nThis is one more instrument in the system of subregional cooperation. \nAlthough we must unite our efforts to overcome war, it is not true that \nthe peoples that are not experiencing the turmoils of war are necessarily \nliving in peace. A glance at a map of the world proves that the reverse is \ntrue. Africa, for example, is suffering from drought, famine and disease an \nappalling picture that calls for action from the community of nations. \nIt is clear that, along with the questions of the maintenance of peace, \ndrug abuse, the environment and humanitarian assistance, Africa is one of the \nfive priorities of the United Nations in the 1990s. Paradoxically, however, \nsince the adoption, on 18 December 1991, of the United Nations New Agenda for \nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s, the implementation of that programme, \nbased on a new partnership, is suffering from a lack of priority. This \nsituation requires attention. \nThe problems of drug abuse present another painful and devastating \npicture for the peoples of the continents of Europe, America and Asia. How \ncan we successfully tackle all these challenges and others the acquired \nimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic, for example without cooperation \nand solidarity between States? \nThere is one undeniable fact: the aspiration to democracy is now \nuniversal. This heightened awareness should be regarded as a tremendous \nadvance that will promote peace and security in the world. For the developing \ncountries, our thinking should now concentrate on the future and the fate of \nthat democracy in other words, on how to build on the achievements stemming \nfrom the advent of a democratic system in a good number of countries. In \nother words, democracy and development are indivisible. It is only by linking \nthe two aspects of the question that we shall be able to derive the proper \nbenefits from the changes that we all nowadays recognize as significant on the \neve of the third millennium. \n"

        "file_text": "The memory of the cold war is fading rapidly \nin people's minds. Yet, the efforts for adaptation to a world not structured \nby the East-West divide have not yet been undertaken. As the images of \nviolence, famine and destruction flicker on our television sets the urge that \nsomething must be done quickly seizes the consciousness and imagination of \npeople everywhere. \nThe world community turns to the United Nations the only universal \nforum at its disposal full of expectations that it will succeed in putting \nan end to the violence, the senseless destruction of human life and economic \nresources which, at this very moment, are plunging millions of people in every \npart of the world into despair. \nThe end of the cold war confrontation opened the way for increased \ncooperation. The triumph of democracy and the cooperation of the major Powers \ncreated possibilities for the resolution of conflicts which had originated in, \nor were maintained by, the earlier East-West confrontation. The universal \naspiration for a world of peace, liberated from the bondage of insecurity, was \nthus quite rightly roused. \nDuring this post-cold-war period we have witnessed positive developments \nin many regional problems, particularly Cambodia, Southern Africa, Central \nAmerica and elsewhere. At the same time, an effort has been undertaken to \nfind lasting peace in the Middle East through the convening of a peace \nconference. We welcome this positive and important development in the hope \nthat it will lead to a comprehensive solution, safeguarding the legitimate \nrights of the Palestinian people while, at the same time, ensuring the \nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). For \nit is our position that all United Nations resolutions must be implemented, \nwhichever country they concern, be it Iraq, Cyprus or former Yugoslavia. \nFurthermore we welcome the developments in South Africa that should lead \nto the end of the abhorrent regime of apartheid, in the hope that never again \nwill any human beings on the face of this Earth be forced to live in \nconditions of racial, ethnic, religious or other separation from their fellow \nhuman beings. \nThe fact that today we welcome 20 new Members in this universal \nOrganization is sufficient evidence of the tremendous forces at work following \nthe end of the East-West divide. Welcoming each and every one of these \ncountries, and all of them as a whole, I express our desire to work and \ncooperate with them to uphold the principles of the Charter of the United \nNations, in the interest of peace, security and the well-being of all. \nThe conditions are favourable for the United Nations, as the process for \na much stronger and effective Organization matures and gains momentum. \nHowever, the challenges that the Organization and its Members are called upon \nto meet are also crucial, for, as the old order crumbled, unparalleled forces \nof destruction were also unleashed. \nThe aspirations of humanity for a better world meet with disappointment \nin every part of the world. The proliferation of conflicts, due to a variety \nof reasons, is the other face of Janus. Along with the conflicts come the \nlong lines of refugees, the dead, the starving children, looking desperately \nto each one of us. \nEighteen years after Cyprus suffered the devastating effects of \\\"ethnic \ncleansing\\\" following the Turkish invasion of 1974, we are again witnessing the \nrestaging of similar tragedies in other parts of the world. In 1974, Turkey, \na strong neighbour of small Cyprus, invaded and occupied 37 per cent of the \nterritory of the Republic. One third of the Greek Cypriots were evicted from \ntheir ancestral homes and properties in order to create \\\"ethnically clean \nareas\\\". Being weak and defenseless, we turned to the United Nations. It is \nto the United Nations that a great part of humanity is at this very moment \nalso turning for help. \nThe demands are greater now and they are tending to increase. The fact \nthat the world Organization is free of the fetters imposed by the adversarial \nrelations of the super-Powers in the cold war era enhances its possibilities. \nThe burden, however, will be unbearable if the process towards a more \neffective United Nations, with the necessary resources and increased \ncapabilities not only in the field of peace-keeping, but particularly in the \nfields of peace-making and conflict prevention, as analysed in the Secretary-\nGeneral's Agenda for Peace - is not quickly realized. \nCyprus can again be brought up as a case-study and example. \nFollowing the invasion in 1974, the United Nations system was mobilised' \nThe Security Council and the General Assembly adopted resolutions demanding \nrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus and an \nimmediate end to foreign military intervention and called urgently for a \ncease-fire. The United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) \nsupervised the cease-fire and assured the peace-keeping operation. It has \nfulfilled this role as well as other humanitarian functions admirably. And we \nare grateful to all the men who served in UNFICYP for their contribution. But \n18 years later, the Cyprus problem is still not solved and as a consequence \nUNFICYP is confronted with serious financial problems. \nIf even a small number of the peace-keeping operations the United Nations \nis now undertaking have the duration of UNFICYP, given their scale and scope, \nvery soon the Organization will not be able to cope with the financial and \nother burdens. \nThe Cyprus example is, I believe, sufficient evidence that an intense \npeace-making effort must be pursued in parallel with every peace-keeping \noperation. For the cost can be limited not by simply eliminating the role, \nbut by opening the way for just and viable solutions. \nIn the case of Cyprus, despite the lack of results because of the \nnegative attitude of the Turkish side during the long negotiations aimed at \nfinding a solution, the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, \ncorrectly seized the moment and pursued an intense, renewed effort to this \nend. The Security Council, already actively involved in the process, put its \nweight behind those efforts and engaged itself in an unprecedented way. \nWe took our share of responsibility and engaged in those talks in the \nspirit of good will and conciliation. For we want to put an end to the \nforcible division of our country and the resulting suffering of so many, \nparticularly of the families of the missing persons. In brief, we want to see \nan end to the status quo, characterized by the Security Council as not \nacceptable. \nUnfortunately, the Turkish side remained intransigent on its aims of \nperpetuating the division of Cyprus into two \\\"ethnically clean\\\" regions, in \nutter violation of human rights and basic rules of international law. Even \ntoday we hear voices from Turkey speaking against federation, claiming that \nsince two different communities live on Cyprus the island should be \npartitioned. Just imagine how the world would look if this principle were \napplied universally. \nAs the Secretary-General underlined in an interview a few days ago, the \nnew danger that will appear in the world in the next 10 years is more \nfragmentation. Rather than 100 or 200 countries, said the Secretary-General, \nthere may be at the end of the century 400 countries. By way of example he \nwent on to say that in Africa there are 5,000 tribes, and if each tribe \nclaimed the right to self-determination we would end up with many small States \nof 50,000 to 100,000 people each. We can all imagine the effects that this \nwould have on the hopes of humanity for sustainable development. That is why \nwhat happens in Cyprus and the solution of the Cyprus problem based on United \nNations resolutions must be of concern to the international community. \nThe report of the Secretary-General on Cyprus (S/24472) clearly shows why \nno progress was made in the July and August talks. Furthermore, the \\\"Set of \nideas\\\" and the map which are annexed to the report have been endorsed by the \nSecurity Council in resolution 774 (1992) as the basis for reaching a \nsolution. We should like, in this context, to express our appreciation and \nthanks to the Secretary-General and the Security Council for all their support \nand involvement in our case. \nThe resolution also calls for resumption of the talks on 26 October. As \nalways, we intend to cooperate fully with the Secretary-General and negotiate \nwith good will. We sincerely hope that the Turkish side, despite its so-far \nnegative public statements, will at long last cooperate. \nIf, despite the efforts of the Secretary-General, our good will and the \ninvolvement of the Security Council, the talks in October become a repetition \nof the unpleasant exercise we experienced this summer, we are confident that \nthe Security Council and the Assembly will assure the conditions for progress. \nFor it would be tragic further to delay, or even frustrate, the effort \nfor a solution in Cyprus. The people of Cyprus, Turkish Cypriots and Greek \nCypriots alike, want to put the past behind them and advance towards a better \nfuture. The reunification of Cyprus will open a new era of prosperity and \nprogress to the benefit of all Cypriots in particular, of Turkish Cypriots \nand our region. I am certain that the solution of the Cyprus problem is the \nonly way, and a necessary condition, for the economic and social development \nof all Cypriots. In this competitive world of ours, only if Turkish Cypriots \nand Greek Cypriots are united and join forces will they be able to win the \nplace they deserve in the world. \nThe Secretary-General's \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" introduces peace-building and \npreventive diplomacy as concepts of the utmost importance. The conceptual \nframework of the \\\"Agenda\\\" is indeed remarkable in its ramifications and the \nlinkages it establishes between peace and security, international law, \ndemocracy, human rights and sustainable development. \nCyprus, which accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the International \nCourt of Justice, welcomes and supports the Secretary-General's proposals in \nthe field of international law, as set out in the report. \nOur long-term efforts should be aimed at creating such conditions as will \nmake the possibility of war unthinkable, even between nations that have a \nhistory of enmity. In order to achieve such a result on a global basis the \nUnited Nations must adapt itself swiftly to the changing conditions. A better \nbalance and coordination between the various bodies that form the Organization \nand the specialized agencies are needed. A more effective and more democratic \nUnited Nations is an essential component of a stable and democratic world \norder. Furthermore, as the Secretary-General pointedly underlines in his \nreport to the General Assembly, we must render our Organization \n\\\"capable of dealing comprehensively with the economic, social, \nenvironmental and political dimensions of human development.\\\" (A/47/1. \npara. 9) \nThe General Assembly, representing all the Members of the United Nations, \nhas a major role to play in the realization of this major objective. And I am \ncertain that under the able leadership of our President, my good friend the \nForeign Minister of Bulgaria, Mr. Ganev, it will rise to these challenges. I \nalso take this opportunity to pay tribute, Mr. President, to your predecessor, \nMr. Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for the skilful manner in \nwhich he steered the work of the forty-sixth session. \nProminent among the challenges we have to meet is the protection of human \nrights in all their dimensions, civil and political as well as social, \neconomic and cultural. The progress achieved in this field during recent \nyears, encouraging though it is, should not mislead us. Much progress still \nneeds to be achieved. That is why we look forward to the World Conference on \nHuman Rights, which will present us with a great opportunity not only to \nassess the progress achieved so far, but also, and mainly, to define the means \nfor rendering our collective action for the protection of human rights more \neffective. \nThe issue of human rights is crucial, for it relates not only to \npeace-making and peace-building, but also to preventive diplomacy. The first \nvictims of galloping nationalism and micronationalism everywhere, as we can \nclearly see, are the human rights of citizens. We in Cyprus, unfortunately, \nhave bitter experience of this fact. \nTolerance and respect for the beliefs and particularities of others \nwithin societies and peaceful relations among nations are the conditions \nfor the prevalence of the rule of law and thus of human rights. And as \npeace is no longer the end product of mutual fear, it will be maintained \nonly through the prevalence of mutual understanding, communication and \nconfidence. In this respect, the process of disarmament has a key \nfunction to play. \nIn spite of the progress we all welcome, and in particular the \nagreement reached within the Conference on Disarmament on a draft \nconvention for the elimination of chemical weapons, disarmament is still \nof the utmost priority in our quest for general stability. The positive \ndevelopments in the field of nuclear weapons constitute an asset that has \nto be safeguarded. However, the risk of intense arms races between \nregional Powers is more than a threat: it is a reality. \nIt is only through eliminating the roots of insecurity, which makes \nthe acquisition of arms a vital need for States, and through creating the \ninstitutional framework that will enhance the feeling of security and \nthereby diminish to the maximum the need for self-help in case of \naggression, that real progress can be achieved. \nWe know how painful it is to spend precious resources on arms and we \nhurt when we have to pay a few million dollars just to buy a new tank. \nBut what other choice are we left with when on a small island like Cyprus \nthe Turkish army outnumbers us in this field by a ratio of 7 to 1, \nconstantly threatening our physical existence? Time and again we have \nproposed the demilitarization of Cyprus, together with the withdrawal of \nthe Turkish forces from Cyprus. We are committed to using the resources \nthus saved for development purposes - most of them directed to projects \nthat will have an immediate effect on the standard of living of the \nTurkish Cypriots. Thus, the peace-building process will be further \nstrengthened and the people of Cyprus as a whole will benefit. \nHuman rights and democracy will amount to little if social misery, \nstarvation and underdevelopment are the lot of the great majority of the \npopulation of this planet. The fragile flower of democracy cannot bloom \non the arid soil of poverty. What sense can the right to vote have if one \nis condemned to remain hungry, roofless and without the very basic \nnecessities? \nAs the Jakarta Declaration, adopted during the tenth non-aligned \nsummit only some weeks ago, clearly states: \n\\\"A shift of forces in international relations towards strengthening \nmultilateral cooperation for development has become indispensable.\\\" \nThe division between rich and poor, developed and developing, should \nnot be allowed to become a new source of instability and tension that \nwould undermine the foundations of international society. It is an \nillusion to think that any country, however rich or great, can survive \nisolated, surrounded by an archipelago of poverty. \nIf we want peace and social stability we must address the issues of \ngrowth and sustainable development in their human and social dimensions. \nIndebtedness, mainly due to the collapse of commodity prices and the \nsubsequent transfer of resources from poor to rich countries, continues to \nhurt the developing world. Barriers to trade raise formidable obstacles \nto the efforts of developing countries to reach the markets of the highly \nindustrialized North and limit their possibilities for growth while having \nan adverse effect on the export prices of their products. That is why we \nare anxious about the delay in concluding the Uruguay Round of \nMultilateral Trade Negotiations and express the hope that the target for \ncompleting the negotiations - that is, the end of 1992 will be achieved \nthis time. Developing nations' access to technology is still very \nrestricted and this adds to the already existing inequalities that hamper \ngrowth on a global level. \nTechnology is not an end in itself. The transfer of technologies \nfrom developed to developing countries is a pre-condition for sustainable \ndevelopment on a global scale. The problem is also directly linked to \nthat of the flow of financial resources for productive investment in \ndeveloping countries. What is at stake here is not only the solidarity \nthat developed countries should demonstrate. It is also a rational \nresponse that will guarantee their own ability to continue to progress in \na world which progresses as a whole. \nIt is now widely acknowledged that in our quest for development in \nthe past we regarded environment solely as a commodity ripe for \nexploitation. Now we have come to realize that it is man who belongs to \nthe environment and not the environment to man. It is therefore necessary \nto define a new synthesis between environment and development. The Rio \nConference was a major step in that direction. The world summit gave the \ncorrect message; it shaped the international will and marked a new \nbeginning. Concrete and effective measures must follow. The Rio \nDeclaration must not remain a dead letter. We have to translate into \naction its provisions, which should guide us in every policy decision. \nThe 1990s is a decade of dramatic changes. The contradictory forces \nand undercurrents that shape the outcome of events must be shaped and \nguided towards the creation of a peaceful and democratic world order. The \nUnited Nations is the soul itself, the consciousness of humanity as a \ncollective entity. As such, it demonstrates a flexibility and a capacity \nfor adaptation which are admirable. People of worth, dedicated men and \nwomen, work in every part of the world fulfilling impossible missions. We \nthank them all. \nWe have reached a moment when, as Member States, we must assume \nfurther responsibilities and, faithful to the principles of the Charter of \nthis Organization, work in unison in helping the United Nations to achieve \nits objectives. Humanity has conquered mighty and formidable peaks. We \ncannot turn back. We are committed to shaping and channelling the hopes \nand aspirations of mankind for a more free, democratic and tolerant world, \nwith a better quality of life for all. "

        "file_text": "Let me start by \noffering you, Mr. President, my congratulations and best wishes. With your \nelection an outstanding representative of the new democracies in Eastern \nEurope has been chosen to preside over this Assembly. I should also like to \nconvey our appreciation to your predecessor. Ambassador Shihabi of Saudi \nArabia. \nI wish to pay special tribute to the Secretary-General. His report \nentitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" contains timely suggestions for a world in \nwhich the very nature of conflicts has changed and which therefore has \noutgrown the traditional means of conflict management. Austria supports the \nSecretary-General in his quest to develop better instruments for the United \nNations to discharge its ever-growing world-wide responsibilities to prevent \nand resolve conflicts. \nMany of the Secretary-General's proposals reflect the need for more \nefficient conflict prevention. In the case of the former Yugoslavia we have \nseen the devastating effects of doing too little too late. Let me recall \nAustria's proposal last year to dispatch peace-keeping forces to Bosnia and \n\nHerzegovina when there was still a peace to keep. Always, be it in Somalia, \nthe Balkans or elsewhere, time-lags between the appearance of the first signs \nof a crisis and resolute decisions for preventive action prove to be costly \nin human lives, in destruction of property and in the loss of credibility of \nthe international community. \n\nPeace-keeping operations must go beyond the mere observation of a \ncease-fire. In order to meet today's challenges, peace-keeping has to play a \nmajor role in conflict-prevention. Therefore, we support the \nSecretary-General's proposal envisaging the deployment of observers at the \nrequest of only one party to a conflict. \nPreventive diplomacy, peace-keeping operations, peace-making and \npeace-building will increasingly be among the main tasks of this \nOrganization. Inter-ethnic strife will, unfortunately, continue to be the \nsource of many conflicts in the future. We must all combine our efforts to \nimprove the Secretariat's capacity to deal effectively with these challenges. \nThe demands on the United Nations for peace-keeping and peace-building \nare increasing in numbers of operations and personnel, as well as in the scope \nof their mandates. We share the Secretary-General's concern about the need \nfor Member States to make the necessary resources available. \nAustria, one of the largest troop-contributors over the years, is willing \nto increase its contribution, both for traditional tasks, in the form of \nproviding military personnel, and for new tasks, in the form of assisting \ndifficult transition processes, through the dispatch of civilian police, \nadministrators and monitors of democracy. We have initiated a programme of \nmeetings and seminars on inter-ethnic peace-keeping and training for \npeace-keeping, peace-making and conflict-prevention. Austria is now \norganizing a seminar on assisting and monitoring elections, with the aim of \ntraining officials for participation in future such United Nations missions. \n \nAt a time of excessive demands on limited United Nations resources and of \nthe increasing political importance of regional arrangements, the \nSecretary-General's innovative approach of intensifying cooperation and \ncoordination with regional organizations should be wholeheartedly pursued. \nStrengthening the bonds between the United Nations Secretariat and the \nrelevant regional bodies calls for continuous contact and communication. \nIn Europe the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) \nrecently constituted itself a \\\"regional arrangement\\\" for matters of collective \nsecurity, in conformity with the Charter. Its Vienna-based Conflict \nPrevention Centre will play an important role in future CSCE peace-keeping \noperations. The negotiations in Vienna within the framework of the CSCE Forum \nfor Security Cooperation are particularly important for the development of \nconfidence and for security-building and disarmament. In view of the \nproximity of the CSCE Secretariat in Prague and the Office for Democratic \nInstitutions and Human Rights in Warsaw, both the United Nations and the CSCE \nwould greatly benefit from the creation in Vienna of a mechanism for liaison \nbetween the European regional arrangements and the United Nations \nSecretariat. Such an institution, a foundation of peace-keeping operations, \ncould make the combined efforts of all organizations more effective. \nAt a time of limited resources it seems necessary for the Organization to \nmake full use of all the facilities at its disposal world wide. \nDecentralization of the Secretariat must be seen as an asset for the \nOrganization. \nNo conflict illustrates more dramatically the utmost urgency of the need \nfor implementation of the Secretary-General's proposals with regard to the \ncontinuing aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a State \n\nMember of our Organization. The most fundamental principles on which the \nCharter is based are challenged: collective security, the non-use of force \nagainst territorial integrity and political independence, inviolability of \nborders, the rule of law, democracy, fundamental freedoms and human rights \nespecially minority rights. \nIn this regard, Bosnia and Herzegovina is a test case. If today \naggression and \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" are permitted there, tomorrow they may work \nin Sandzak, Kosovo, Vojvodina and Macedonia, and even in other parts of the \nworld. The consequences would be unimaginable. \nCertainly, the international community has reacted to this aggression, to \nthe atrocities and to the needs of the victims. Both the CSCE and the \nSecurity Council have clearly stated in various declarations and resolutions \nthe responsibility of the Serbian Government for these acts and have demanded \nthat they be brought to an immediate end. Cease-fires have been brokered, \ncrucial humanitarian assistance has been organized, sanctions have been \nimposed and a political framework for a resolution of the conflict has been \ncreated. \nWe owe a special tribute to all those courageous men who participate at \nenormous personal risk in the peace-keeping operations. We deeply regret the \nloss of human lives that has already occurred. It goes without saying that \nattacks against peace-keeping forces warrant our utmost condemnation, whether \nor not we know who might be responsible for such atrocious acts. \nDuring the last year many forums and organizations have adopted important \ndeclarations and resolutions dealing with this crisis. The London Conference \nproduced a comprehensive plan of action, which could serve as a basis for a \nsettlement. But have these plans and resolutions been implemented? What is \n\nneeded is pressure, serious pressure, to make the aggressor desist from his \nacts in flagrant violation of international law in particular, humanitarian \nlaw and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \nGenocide. We must effectively rule out any possibility of not complying with \nthe political commitments undertaken in London. This holds true for all the \nparties involved. The longer the conflict lasts, the greater the danger of \nviolation of the most basic standards of human rights. \n\nIn the context of this and other conflicts we should heed the \nSecretary-General, who on a general basis commends Article 42 of the Charter \nto the attention of all States; he says that under this Article \n\\\"... the Security Council has the authority to take military action to \nmaintain or restore international peace and security.\\\" (A/47/277. \npara. 43) \nCertainly, all peaceful means have to be employed to solve a conflict, \nbut if they prove to be of no avail, and in the case of clear, gross \nviolations of fundamental principles of the Charter, full application of all \nthe Charter's provisions must be envisaged. That is the core and essence of a \nfunctioning system of collective security. \nThe disappearance of the East-West confrontation that paralyses our \nOrganization for so long gives us the chance to resurrect this system of \ncollective security as envisaged by the founding fathers of the Organization. \nFor the sake of mankind in the North and in the South, in the East and in the \nWest of our globe we must not miss this chance. \nThe objective fact of the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia has been \nestablished in the convincing legal opinion handed down by the arbitration \ncommission, chaired by President Robert Badinter. Consequently, Austria, \nalong with many other countries, favours termination of the membership of \n\\\"Yugoslavia\\\" in all international organizations. We welcome the admission of \nSlovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina to the United Nations. \nUltimately all the successor States, including Serbia and Montenegro, have the \nright to be admitted as Members, provided that they comply with the \nestablished obligations of the Charter. Once the criteria established for the \n\nsuccessor States of the former Yugoslavia by the Charter of Paris and by the \npeace conference have been met, the conditions will be in place for the \nadmission of that State to the United Nations. We will continue to judge the \nreal willingness of the authorities in Belgrade and other Serbian forces to \nhonour their commitments and international obligations not by their words but \nby their actions. \nThe international community will have to act most vigorously to oppose \neffectively the intolerable practice of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\". I welcome the \ndecisions of the Security Council, which has taken steps towards the \nestablishment of security zones in Bosnia and Herzegovina to contain the mass \nexpulsions, to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance and to \nsecure the functioning of the legitimate Government. We must continue to work \nin this direction. The establishment of a no-fly zone over Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, as proposed by France, would supplement that measure and end the \nair attacks by the Serbian air force. \nThe horrible effects of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" will have to be reversed. The \naggressor cannot be allowed to enjoy the fruits of his aggression. The \ninternational community will have to do more than care for refugees and \ndisplaced persons: our goal must be to create conditions which would allow \nthose who were expelled or displaced to return to their homes and to regain \ntheir belongings or be compensated for property destroyed. \nMr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a hero of the liberation of Central and Eastern \nEurope, submitted, in his capacity as Special Rapporteur of the Commission on \nHuman Rights, a report containing a number of proposals, which should be \nimplemented as quickly as possible. I am thinking of the immediate necessity \n\nto disarm irregular armed forces and civilians, and the expansion of the \nmandate of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to the whole of \nBosnia and Herzegovina in order to be able to collect information on human \nrights violations and to deal with them. Another of Mr. Mazowiecki's \nimportant ideas is the creation of an investigative commission to determine \nthe fate of the thousands of missing persons. \nAt this point, let me express my firm conviction that ordinary people, \nboth Serbs and Montenegrins, want prosperity and, first and foremost, peace. \nThe abhorrent acts carried out under \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", the torturing of \ninnocent men and women in camps, the shelling of defenceless citizens: all \nthese crimes are being ordered and carried out by individuals who cannot claim \nto act in the name of their people. Appropriate machinery must be established \nto enforce Security Council resolution 771 (1992) and to provide for \n- proceedings against all individual perpetrators punishable under international \nlaw, such as by creating an international penal tribunal for war crimes. \nEarlier this year the international fact-finding commission established \nunder Additional Protocol I to the Fourth Geneva Convention on the Protection \nof the Victims of Armed Conflicts became operational. This commission could \n also assume an important role to ensure the full implementation of the rules \nof international humanitarian law. \nToday the former Yugoslavia is suffering from the horrible ravages of \n war. In a long-term perspective, economic recovery and concerted economic \nassistance will have to be a part of any peaceful solution for the region. \nLet me add here that Austria, long before the beginning of the process of the \nit disintegration of Yugoslavia, strongly advocated international assistance for \n\nthe economic development of our neighboring country through various European \norganizations in order to promote reform, prosperity and democracy. Then as \nnow our actions were motivated by a deep-felt desire to support economic and \npolitical reform for the sake of the well-being of all peoples living in the \nBalkan region, to which Austria is bound by strong ties of history. That is \nwhy I feel that I must make an urgent appeal for the mobilization of further \nfinancial means to bolster the humanitarian assistance necessary for the \nsurvival of the suffering populations. There can be no doubt that, with good \nwill on both sides, questions and tensions arising from the cohabitation of \ndifferent ethnic groups in the same area can be resolved in a process of \ncooperation. \n\nIt is with the greatest satisfaction that I am today in a position to \ninform the General Assembly of the resolution, through political dialogue, of \nthe controversy between Austria and Italy concerning the protection of the \nAustrian population in South Tyrol. This dispute originated in the different \ninterpretations of the agreement signed by the two countries on \n5 September 1946 in Paris. The issue was then addressed by the General \nAssembly in its resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661 (XVI), in 1960 and 1961. On \nthis basis, Austria and Italy reached agreement on a package of 137 measures \ndesigned to benefit the population of South Tyrol - measures that Italy \npledged to enact. At the beginning of this year further legal measures were \nadopted. On 19 June the two countries were able to inform the \nSecretary-General that the dispute which had been pending with the United \nNations since 1960 had been settled. \nAustria and Italy have thus been able to provide the community of nations \nwith a good example of how to resolve an ethnic conflict and how to guarantee \nand protect the rights and identities of minorities. The measures taken do \nindeed promise to provide a safe basis for the cultural, economic and social \ndevelopment of the German- and Ladin-speaking groups in South Tyrol, as they \ninclude sufficient legal safeguards at the national and international levels. \nThe resolution of this controversy was greatly facilitated by a positive \ndevelopment in the political attitudes of all the parties involved in \nparticular, by increased confidence between the State authorities and the \nethnic groups. Although the protection of ethnic groups is clearly a dynamic \nprocess, the minority has to be assured that the Italian republic will respect \nits separate identity and will maintain the laws and regulations that have \nbeen created for the advancement of ethnic groups. Furthermore, the minority \n\nmust be assured that its cultural bonds, based on common ethnic affiliation \nbeyond the Italian frontier, will not be impeded in the future. If such \nconfidence exists, the State will secure the loyalty of the minority. \nConfidence will also create an atmosphere conducive to better and intensified \ncooperation across the borders. \nRespect for human rights is a crucial requirement for the settlement of \ntoday's conflicts. The Austrian Government will take pride in hosting the \nWorld Conference on Human Rights to be convened in Vienna in June 1993. The \ninvitation to host such an important event highlights Austria's dedication to \nthe promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The \nprinciples embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and in other \ninternational human-rights instruments have undeniably become universal \nstandards. It is imperative that all members of the international community \nfulfil their voluntarily accepted obligations to promote and respect human \nrights, humanitarian law and democratic values. Human rights, democracy and \ndevelopment are inextricably linked and are of the utmost importance in an \nincreasingly interdependent world. We shall continue to promote a \ncomprehensive concept of human rights based also on different cultural \ntraditions and encompassing civil and political, as well as economic and \nsocial, rights. There must not be a new North-South divide in the \ninterpretation and application of human rights. Our unitary world requires \nconsensus on this vital issue. In preparing for the Vienna conference, we \nshall strive for such consensus. I can assure the Assembly that the Austrian \nGovernment will spare no effort to contribute substantially to the preparatory \nprocess and that it will provide excellent facilities for the Conference. \n\nThe Secretary-General has introduced the concept of an integrated \napproach by the United Nations to political, economic and social issues. \nAdequate economic and social development are prerequisites for international \npeace and security. The current and future status of the world social \nsituation, the inclusion of vulnerable and socially disadvantaged groups in \ndevelopment, drug-abuse control and crime prevention rank high on the \ninternational agenda of an increasingly interdependent world. Peace and \nsecurity are closely linked with economic and social development. We must \ntake advantage of the end of the cold war to put more emphasis on issues of \nsocial and economic development. \nAs the Secretary-General has said, the convening of a well prepared world \nsocial summit will remove a key aspect of current threats to global security. \nThis summit should concentrate on three concrete issues: poverty, \nunemployment and social disintegration. The Austrian Government supports such \na social summit. Good governance as a result of sound economic management and \ncomprehensive social and environmental policies, as well as respect for human \nrights and democratic values, should be the basic objective of political \nleadership. \nWhile the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development did \nnot fully succeed in producing a comprehensive Earth charter or a clear \ncommitment to protection of the world's forests, the agreements reached at Rio \ndo represent a positive achievement. We must all share responsibility for \ncare of our planet, and the developed countries must take the lead. This \nrealization should give rise to a new quality in North-South relations. \n\nAt Rio it became apparent that, in the long term, environmental \nprotection and economic prosperity cannot be achieved at each other's \nexpense. Ecology and the economy are not intrinsic foes; for the sake of our \ncommon well-being, and for the sake of future generations, they need to become \nvery close allies. After Rio it is impossible to speak of protection of the \nenvironment without also addressing the development challenge. Nor is it \npossible to focus on development without taking into account the ecological \ndimension. \nRegarding the issue of international conflicts in the environmental \nsphere, I am very pleased to note that the Austrian proposal for the \nestablishment of Green Helmets, submitted during the forty-fourth session of \nthe General Assembly, has been favourably received. That Austrian initiative \nis reflected by the machinery provided for in the main Rio documents for \npreventing and settling such disputes. \nRio demonstrated that the global problems of mankind cannot be solved by \ngovernments alone. Hence Austria welcomes the mobilization and the manifold \ncontributions of the non-governmental organizations and the media. This level \nof involvement of groups and individuals must continue. \nThe end of the East-West conflict and the growing awareness of the \ninterdependence between North and South are leading to a new era for mankind. \nRegional cooperation offers new dimensions. There is a keen desire for \npreventive diplomacy. The resolution of ethnic conflicts is one of the \ngreatest challenges of our time. Awareness of the interrelationship between \ndevelopment, environmental protection and the guaranteeing of human rights in \nthe broadest sense of the term are on the increase. Let us work together to \ntake advantage of all these opportunities. \n"

The disappearance of the \nblocs has not led to the emergence of the peaceful world of which we dreamed. \nUncertainty prevails. In many societies, one political order has disappeared \nand the order which has taken its place is in the midst of a difficult process \nof shaping itself. World trends are extremely contradictory. Some countries' \nefforts to integrate are in contrast to the disintegration of other \ncountries. It would appear that the potential for conflict, now free of \nideological bonds, has increased in various regions of the world. \nDespite the fact that bipolarity has vanished, international peace and \nsecurity continue to be threatened by aggressive nationalisms, political and \nreligious fanaticism and, above all, the conditions of critical poverty and \ninequality of opportunities that separate some peoples from others. As this \nsession of the General Assembly takes place, thousands of people are \ncontinuing to die in the fratricidal wars in former Yugoslavia and other parts \nof the world. In Africa, the life of whole populations is threatened by \nhunger. The life of more than half of the world's population is dominated by \nunemployment and the impossibility of attaining decent levels of health, \neducation, food and housing. \nDecisive progress in economic, social and human development and \nroot-and-branch rectification of the structural imbalances in international \nsociety are necessary conditions for genuine and lasting peace. One fifth of \nthe world's population, 1 billion people inhabiting the most industrialized \ncountries, consume 70 per cent of the planet's resources. In income terms. \n \nthe polarization of inequalities is even greater. The richest fifth of the \nworld's population accounts for 83 per cent of total income, while the poorest \nfifth has to make do with 1.4 per cent. Future prospects are no less tragic: \nthe World Bank estimates that the income of the population with the fewest \nresources will fall from $370 a year to only $225 by the year 2000. \nNow that the cold war is over, there is no argument strong enough to \njustify the persistence of these imbalances. Plenty and overabundance for a \nfew cannot coexist with poverty and deprivation for the majorities. We can \nalready see the global impact of these inequalities: The increase in \nmigrations to the more prosperous countries is unprecedented. Millions of \npeople throughout the world are forming legions of refugees and displaced \npersons. It would be a dangerous illusion for the rich societies to believe \nthat their security is not in jeopardy from the intensification of these \nimbalances. \nIt must be recognized that it will not be possible to cure \nunderdevelopment and the resulting poverty and marginalization in many \ncountries by the use of market forces alone. What is needed is a major \ninternal correction effort involving both the State and private individuals, \nor involving mainly the State, when private individuals are unwilling, do not \nknow how or do not have the resources to act. A favourable international \nenvironment is also required to more effectively encourage a comprehensive \nsolution to the serious problems of underdevelopment. \nThe Government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is promoting the \nexpansion of markets and the need for flows of goods and services to grow \nwithout artificial barriers of a political or economic nature. We therefore \nalready have a free trade agreement with Chile, and we have just negotiated a \n\ntreaty to establish the North American free trade area, which will be the most \npotent trading zone in the world. With an open trading system, without \ndiscrimination and protectionist barriers, the developing countries could earn \naround $44 billion more from exports. That would undoubtedly increase the \nviability of the structural reforms these nations have undertaken, and would \nreflect international solidarity with these countries. \nMexico has been active in promoting reform of the United Nations. It has \njoined the consensus that there is a vital need to redistribute functions and \nresponsibilities among its organs, increase coordination and democratize its \nprocedures. Our Organization is overworked and underfinanced. Its renewal \nmust include the fulfilment by all Members of their financial commitments. \nThat there is an endemic financial crisis at the United Nations, in the face \nof the extensive tasks the community is seeking to assign to it, is an \nincongruency which must be resolved without delay. \nMexico recognizes the relevance of the Secretary-General's report \nentitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", submitted for the consideration of Member \nStates. It is a rigorous document, and proposes the innovative measures that \nare needed in order to enable our Organization to respond to the challenges of \na new era. The ideas that it puts before us for achieving a better balance \nbetween the principal organs of the United Nations appear to us to be on the \nright lines. \nWe need to give the General Assembly the primacy it should enjoy as the \nOrganization's universal and pluralistic organ par excellence. We have to \nachieve better coordination between it and the Security Council, above all in \nmatters of international peace and security. We agree with the strengthening \nof the Secretary-General's capacity for action. We consider that the \n\nSecretary-General should be authorized to seek advisory opinions from the \nInternational Court of Justice on condition, of course, that the States \nconcerned have requested his involvement. \nMexico has also indicated the need for a better balance in the treatment \nof the items on the international agenda. We pay too much attention to the \nso-called new global issues at the expense of development problems, combating \nextreme poverty and strengthening international cooperation. The best \npreventive diplomacy is one in which programmes in support of development are \nan essential element. These are the best guarantees of stable and lasting \npeace. \nThe economic and social sector of the Organization needs to be \nrevitalized. Now is the time to increase the efficiency of the organs on \nwhich rests the main responsibility for economic and social activities: the \nEconomic and Social Council and the Second and Third Committees of the \nAssembly. \nMy country has reiterated that the internal transformation of the United \nNations organs, as well as of relationships between them, needs to be \nsupplemented by the democratization of decision-making. This will entail \nreviewing, in due course, the anachronistic veto system. We must dispel the \nrisk of the Security Council's becoming merely an instrument for lending the \nappearance of joint action to the designs of a few powerful countries. The \ndeliberative and decision-making processes must be transparent. The tendency \nfor the taking of decisions by consensus to become more widespread must not \npose an obstacle to participation by Council members, nor must it impede \nin-depth debate among them. \n \nSome of the measures proposed in the Secretary-General's report need to \nbe studied thoroughly and carefully, as they might prove to be \ncounterproductive. Deployment of troops along the borders of a State that \nfeels threatened might aggravate the problem it was designed to forestall. \nThe proposal for the conduct of preventive deployment operations in \nconditions of national crisis gives grounds for concern. A measure of this \nkind could involve the Organization in issues that are strictly within the \ninternal jurisdiction of States. \nSimilarly, what is known as \\\"support for the transformation of deficient \nnational structures and capabilities, and for the strengthening of new \ndemocratic institutions\\\" (A/47/277, para. 59). should be examined with great \ncare, since these matters fall within the exclusive sovereignty of States. \nThe report also echoes positions that Mexico has supported. We agree \nthat States should accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of \nJustice. Honduras and El Salvador have set the world an example of their \ndesire for harmony and peace by submitting their territorial dispute to the \nInternational Court for resolution. \nMexico welcomes the insistence of the Secretary-General that diplomatic \naction should be exhausted before use is made of the coercive measures for the \nmaintenance of international peace and security referred to in Chapter VII of \nthe Charter. \nDespite the disquieting signs in the international environment, obvious \nadvances have been made which enable us to look with hope to the potential of \nthe United Nations to work towards a more stable and a more secure world. \nLong-drawn-out conflicts that had been deadlocked for years are today on the \nway to resolution. The peace process in El Salvador is perhaps the most \n\nsuccessful of those in which the Organization has participated. It is up to \nthe parties and the Organization itself to do everything in their power to \nensure the implementation, within the time-frame scheduled, of the commitments \nentered into. Mexico appeals to the international community to provide, as \nsoon as possible, the economic assistance promised for the cause of peace in \nEl Salvador. \nIn the realm of disarmament, definite progress has been achieved in the \nquantitative reduction of nuclear arsenals but we are far from having \neliminated the danger of a nuclear catastrophe. There has been an increase in \nthe number of States that possess nuclear weapons, and the doctrine of nuclear \ndeterrence continues to serve as grounds for justifying the existence and \nimprovement of such weapons. \nIn the face of these dangers, we must put an end to nuclear testing. We \ntherefore express our gratitude to those countries that have decided to \ninstitute moratoriums. Mexico will continue to work to see to it that at this \nsession we are able to make progress together towards the total elimination of \nnuclear weapons from the planet. \nTherefore, the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons deserves our full attention. We are \ngratified at the progress in respect of the Treaty of Tlatelolco. We welcome \nthe ratification by France of Additional Protocol I and the process leading to \nthe full incorporation of Argentina, Brazil and Chile in the \nnuclear-weapon-free zone in Latin America. We hope that Cuba will also soon \nbe incorporated into this regime, as well as Guyana and St. Kitts and Nevis. \nMention also needs to be made of the Convention on chemical weapons, the \noutcome of 10 years' work by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Conference on \n\nDisarmament. Although the Convention is undoubtedly subject to improvement, \nMexico hopes that it will lead to the elimination of one of the most \nreprehensible means of mass destruction. \nThe Rio de Janeiro Conference, held last June, was a basic step towards \ngreater awareness at the world level of the relationship between the problems \nof the environment and those of development. The General Assembly has the \nresponsibility of creating institutional machinery to follow up, promote and \nperfect the implementation of \\\"Agenda 21\\\", approved at Rio. The establishment \nof the Commission on Sustainable Development is a central item on our agenda. \nIn this regard, I should like to make three points: the first is that \nthis Commission should not confine itself to reviewing the progress made in \nRio, but should become a high-level forum for updating and introducing new \nproposals designed to promote development and the protection of the \nenvironment. \nThe second point relates to its mandate of supervising and broadening the \ncommitment with regard to financing. We shall achieve little in the struggle \nfor sustainable development of the planet if the countries that possess the \nmost and have contributed the most to pollution do not increase the resources \nallocated to halting the destruction of the environment. The Commission to be \nappointed by this General Assembly must ensure that it is the polluter who \npays. \nFinally, following up on the Rio agreements calls for a competent \nsecretariat. We are expecting a small but high-level group with direct access \nto the Secretary-General and a clear mandate to avoid duplication of functions \nwith other bodies. \n\nWe are living through a phase characterized by profound respect for human \nrights and democracy as the foundations of peace, freedom and human dignity. \nThe defence of human rights has always been at the centre of our \nOrganization's attention. \nNevertheless, we are concerned at the desire to focus greater attention \non some aspects of human rights to the detriment of others. Only a \ncomprehensive view of human rights can ensure that their protection will not \nbe partial or motivated by veiled aspirations towards interference. \nThe Organization has the opportunity of becoming the cornerstone of a new \nworld order worthy of that name. It is our responsibility towards future \ngenerations to bequeath to them a forum in which peace is guaranteed and in \nwhich the conditions required for the development of all nations are created. \nInternational cooperation for development cannot be approached from one \nstandpoint alone. We must not view it solely as a complement to actions to \nresolve conflicts or to reduce it to technical assistance programmes, nor can \nit be confined to general recommendations regarding the liberalization of \ntrade and internal and international competitiveness. \nThe priorities are clear: putting an end to extreme poverty and creating \nthe conditions in which all human beings will find real opportunities for \ndevelopment. To this end, a tremendous and serious effort to coordinate \neconomic policies and the explicit will to make international law the \ncompulsory reference point governing relations among peoples are essential. \nInternational- law is the binding force that will make it possible to \nbuild a true international order at the end of this century. Our Organization \nmust assume with clear vision, dedication and courage world leadership in the \n \ndefence of international law. Respect for the internal jurisdiction of States \nis the basis for our civilized and peaceful coexistence. \nMexico categorically rejects the claim of any State to have the right to \napply its laws beyond its own frontiers. Nor can acts that violate the \njuridical order of another country on the pretext of ensuring respect for \none's law be legal. All States must conform in their actions to the rules \nthat have been accepted by the sovereign will of nations and agreements. This \nis the only lasting foundation on which to base changes in a world order that \nis in a state of transition. \nHere in this universal forum, Mexico emphasizes its unswerving commitment \nto the need to strengthen international law.

        "file_text": "I should like at the outset to extend my \nwarmest congratulations to Mr. Ganev of Bulgaria on his election as President \nof the General Assembly at its forth-seventh session. I am sure that with his \nexperience and skill he will guide the Assembly to a successful conclusion. \nI should like also to take this opportunity to express my deep \nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Samir S. Shahibi, who carried out his \ntasks with dedication and commitment. He made an invaluable contribution to \nthe revitalization of the work of the General Assembly. \nIt is also a pleasure for me, on behalf of Malaysia, to extend a warm \nwelcome to the delegations of those countries that recently joined us as \nMembers of the United Nations. \n. In the last two to three years we have seen dramatic developments and \nchanges around the world. In many ways we are at a historic point, where we \nmust make fateful choices that will determine the future of mankind. There \nare opportunities to develop a new era of international cooperation based on a \ncollective desire to seek social and economic progress in a peaceful and \nstable environment. There are renewed hopes in the ability of the United \nNations to play a central role in the maintenance of peace and security, while \nat the same time being the catalyst for the revival of international \ndevelolpment cooperation. \nThe end of East-West rivalry and the success of the role of the United \nNations in settling a number of regional disputes understandably gave rise to \neuphoria about a new world order. Unfortunately, events of the last two years \nprove that such euphoria has been rather short-lived. Numerous and complex \nchallenges, as well as uncertainties, are still unfolding. \n\nSadly, the dawn of the new post-cold-war era is looking more and more like the \nold world order, characterized as it was by open conflicts based on clashes \nbetween competing nationalists and ethnic forces. Certain parts of Europe are \nonce again becoming areas of tension and destruction, with ugly ethnic and \nnationalistic strife in the former Yugoslavia and a number of component States \nof the former Soviet Union. There are also disturbing unresolved local \nconflicts in other parts of the world in Afghanistan, Liberia, Mozambique \nand Somalia. \nIndeed, our initial hope and confidence that the end of the cold war \nwould encourage and bring about better cooperation at the United Nations are \non the wane. Experience over the last several months has raised serious \nconcern about certain developments at the United Nations. Too much emphasis, \nfor instance, is given to the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of \ninternational security, and there is less focus on the social and economic \ndimensions of peace. There is also concern over the dominant role of certain \npermanent members in the decision-making process in the Security Council, \npushing the scope of the Council's activities into areas considered by many to \nbe beyond its mandate. \nThere is also growing concern that the Security Council particularly \nthe permanent members - has a tendency to select when and where to apply \ncollective measures under the Charter to uphold the rule of law and restore \ninternational peace and stability. One obvious example of such selectivity is \nthe case of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Council has yet to respond to \nrequests by a number of countries of the Organization of the Islamic \nConference for an emergency meeting, with formal debate, to consider the \nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, much less to invoke Article 42 of \n\nChapter VII of the Charter. To uphold the rule of law, the Council should \nreverse the aggression by Serbia-Montenegro against Bosnia and Herzegovina and \nshould initiate legal proceedings against Serbian leaders and individuals \nresponsible for \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" and other war crimes against Bosnian \nMuslims and Christians. \nThe London Conference has yet to prove effective, and even the latest \nSecurity Council action, expanding the size and mandate of the United Nations \nProtection Force in Bosnia is limited to the protection of humanitarian \nrelief. It is Malaysia's strong belief that humanitarian relief, however \neffective it may be, will not bring an end to aggression and atrocities, which \nare causing so much destruction and loss of life, as well as outflows of \nrefugees to neighbouring countries. \nThe case of Bosnia and Herzegovina has highlighted the need for, and the \nimportance and validity of, preventive diplomacy. If the United Nations is \nexpected to play an effective role in the maintenance of international peace \nand security, there must be greater recourse to preventive diplomacy. \nSelectivity or double standards in dealing with potential conflicts and with \nthe parties involved would lead us nowhere and would only make a mockery of \nthe United Nations. \nWe are all conscious of the fact that the grave situation in Somalia was \nlargely ignored by the Security Council until the Secretary-General took the \nCouncil to task. Millions of Somalians have been suffering for months, and \nmany are dying by the day in a tragic civil war that is raging out of \ncontrol. Somalia is in many ways a casualty of cold-war politics and is now \nleft to struggle on its own. In this instance the United Nations must assist \nnot only in bringing humanitarian relief as is being done - but also in \n\nrestoring normality. Continuation of the civil war in Somalia is of no good \nto any party, and we urge the warring parties to settle their conflicts \nspeedily and peacefully for the sake of their people and country. There is a \nMalaysian proverb that aptly describes the futility of such a situation: \\\"The \nvictor becomes charcoal, and the loser the ashes.\\\" \nTwo international issues that have long been on the agenda of the United \nNations are Palestine and South Africa. The current Middle East peace process \nis showing signs of progress as, for the first time, negotiation, begin to \nenter into substantive questions touching on the principle of land for peace. \nThe time has come for the United Nations to be involved in confidence-building \nmeasures in the occupied territories, including the dispatch of observers, as \nwell as the extension of social and economic assistance beyond the current \nlimited efforts of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \nRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to help the Palestinians during the period \nof transition towards self-rule and independence. \nSimilarly, in South Africa, the process of change towards democracy and \nmajority rule has reached a critical impasse, which calls clearly for a more \nassertive and tangible United Nations role. Malaysia welcomes the decision of \nthe Security Council to send observers to help to create confidence and to \nfacilitate the process of change. But we believe that the United Nations \nshould be able to do more in extending confidence-building measures \nparticularly in restoring law and order as well as in looking at the needs \nof black South Africans living in squalid conditions, long neglected under the \napartheid system. \n\nOn the question of Cambodia, Malaysia, being part of the Association of \nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the region, has a special interest in \nCambodia's peace, stability and economic well-being. Bilaterally, Malaysia \nstands ready to join hands with its Cambodian neighbours in economic and \ntechnical cooperation. We are also fully supportive of the United Nations \nrole in Cambodia and we are doing what we can to both assist and support the \nUnited Nations peace-keeping efforts. To date we have already contributed a \ntotal number of 1,060 men to the United Nations Transitional Authority in \nCambodia (UNTAC). The task before UNTAC is certainly not an easy one in \nfacilitating the process of national reconciliation and paving the way for the \nsetting up of a freely elected democratic Government. Actions of some \nCambodian parties could well threaten the Paris peace Agreements. Clearly, \nthe Paris Agreements must be fully implemented and the United Nations is there \nto ensure such a course. Also the United Nations, as represented by UNTAC on \nthe ground, in its unique role in Cambodia, must gain the full confidence of \nall parties in order to facilitate implementation of the Agreements in the \npeace process. \nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in Somalia, is a serious \ntest of the credibility of the United Nations concept of collective security. \nAt a time when there is such enormous expectation concerning, and reliance on, \nthe United Nations collective security system to ensure the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security, there is an urgent need to examine the \nCharter and functioning of the collective security system. Under Article 24 \nof the Charter, Members of the United Nations confer the responsibility for \nmaintaining international peace and security on the Security Council \n\nand the Council acts on their behalf. The general membership of the United \nNations surely has the right to expect transparency and accountability in the \nwork and actions of the Council. A major reform of the Council to achieve \nsuch transparency, accountability and democracy is overdue. \nThe Council's present membership of 15 must be increased to a level that \nis more representative of the United Nations general membership, which has now \ngrown to 179 countries. The representation of Europe in the Council far \noutweighs the size of Europe. The present constitution of the permanent \nmembership largely reflects the situation immediately after the end of the \nSecond World War and has now become untenable and anachronistic. The veto \npower which guarantees the exclusive and dominant role of the permanent five \nin the Council must be examined anew. Malaysia will contribute to examining \nin all aspects the structures of the United Nations. We regard as timely the \ndecision of the recent tenth non-aligned summit meeting in Jakarta to \nestablish a high-level working group to pursue the restructuring, \nrevitalization and democratization of the United Nations and will give it our \nfull support. \nMalaysia would also support a collective effort by the General Assembly \nto study the content and conseguence of the extremely valuable contribution of \nthe Secretary-General in his report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". We hope that a \ncollective examination in a democratic fashion will help to define clearly the \nimportant principles contained in the document and the actions contemplated as \na programme of action for the United Nations in a changing world order. \n\nThe time has also come for us to treat the financial crisis facing the \nUnited Nations as a matter of utmost urgency if the Organization is to be the \nfoundation and centrepoint of the post-cold-war world order. The increasing \ndemands on the United Nations to undertake peace-keeping operations around the \nworld are overstretching its scarce resources. Arrears for both regular and \npeace-keeping budgets now stand at around US$1.75 billion and they are \naffecting adversely the ability of the United Nations to perform its tasks. \nOf particular concern is the fact that more than half of the total arrears is \nowed by two of the five permanent members. \nMalaysia, like many other developing countries, welcomes the bilateral \nagreements reached between the United States and Russia on nuclear-weapons \nreduction and arms control. As a strong proponent of a universal disarmament \nprocess within the United Nations framework, Malaysia welcomes the positive \nwork of the Conference on Disarmament on the proposed chemical weapons \nConvention and we are happy to cosponsor a draft resolution on it at this \nsession of the General Assembly. Malaysia also believes that the process of \ntransparency and confidence-building would contribute to the general goal of \ndisarmament and peace, and we support the idea of a United Nations register on \narmaments. Such a register, however, should not be limited only to the sale \nand transfer of conventional weapons but should also include the production \nand stockpiling of conventional weapons and in due course cover \nnon-conventional weapons. \nThe suitability of the United Nations as the focal point for \ninternational cooperation to build a new world order is its noble objectives \nand universal character. For it is here that sovereign States are equal \n\npartners, and hence the Organization provides a good starting point for \ninstituting democracy in inter-State relations and multilateral diplomacy. \nUnfortunately, since the collapse of communism there has been an increasing \ntendency on the part of the victors of the ideological rivalry to dictate \ntheir values relating to human rights and democracy to others, not only in the \nconduct of their bilateral relations but also in their activities at the \nUnited Nations and in its bodies. Malaysia believes that a comprehensive and \nconstructive treatment of human rights issues must certainly take into \nconsideration the cultural and religious values that influence the national \noutlook and development of Member States. We look forward to participating in \nthe World Conference on Human Rights next year. \nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is an important \ninstrument for the maintenance of law and order in maritime affairs and for \ninternational cooperation. As a littoral State, Malaysia would like to draw \nthe Assembly's attention to the use of the Straits of Malacca as a waterway \nfor international shipping. Larger and faster vessels capable of carrying \ncargoes of a previously unimaginable magnitude now ply the Straits in record \nnumbers. Most of them are expected to share the same narrow waterway with \nfishing boats and the ever-growing number of pleasure craft. \nThe increasing international traffic and the passage of large \nsophisticated vessels through our waters have certainly landed us with new \nproblems, risks and responsibilities. In particular, the passage of tankers \ncarrying dangerous and hazardous cargo adds to our worries and the risks to \nour environment. There have already been cases of collisions and spillage in \nthe Straits, polluting our sea and shore and affecting our marine resources. \n \nThe latest collison, last weekend, between two vessels in the Straits, \ninvolving an oil tanker and a container is a glaring example. When such \naccidents occur we have to do the clearing up, which is a financial burden, \nand endure the sudden harm and destruction to our marine resources caused by \npollution. This is too much for the poor littoral States to bear alone. \nObviously there is an urgent need to take a fresh look at existing \ninternational maritime law and regulations applicable to the Straits and find \na mechanism to share the responsibility of ensuring the safety of navigation, \nas well as collectively to combat the growing piracy with effective \nsurveillance through the use of advanced eguipment and with the improved \nresources at our disposal. To meet such objectives Malaysia is not suggesting \nthe introduction of levies or collection of dues but is asking for the \noperational and financial responsibility for this to be shared eguitably among \nthe maritime nations, users of the Straits and the littoral States. \n\nAny attempt at building a new world order must address the increasing \ninequity in the international economic system resulting in a widening \nNorth-South gap. The 1992 United Nations Pevelopment Programme human \ndevelopment report, for instance, in highlighting the increasingly difficult \nexternal economic environment and its adverse repercussions for developing \ncountries, has stressed that the North must be held primarily responsible for \nthis situation. The report pointed out that protectionism and subsidies in \nthe developed countries resulted in a loss of $500 billion a year for the \ndeveloping countries, ten times what they received in foreign assistance. The \ntotal external debt of developing countries has multiplied thirteenfold in the \nlast two decades, from $100 billion in 1970 to around $1,350 billion in 1990. \nWhile the deadlock in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) \nUruguay Round has yet to be resolved, recent tendencies towards unilateral \nprotectionist trade actions, the creation of new trade blocs and instability \nin the major currency markets would only worsen the already difficult global \neconomic environment. Nothing short of a major reform and restructuring of \nthe world economy, including the financial system, is required in order to \nbring about a strong revival and ensure its long-term stability. \nIn recent years some progress has been made towards revitalizing and \nrestructuring cooperation in the economic and social fields at the United \nNations. But those changes, no matter how constructive and well-meaning, are \nnot sufficient to revive international economic cooperation and to allow for \nglobal social development for as long as the developed countries are not \n\nprepared to initiate concrete changes at the policy level and to fulfil their \nobligations, particularly in terms of meeting the official development \nassistance targets. \nThe Rio de Janiero summit on environment and development has raised the \nhopes of many that we have, within the context of the decisions of the summit \nand the establishment of the Commission on Sustainable Pevelopment, set the \nframework for launching a new global partnership with a view to economic \ndevelopment and the protection of the environment. However, real success is \ndependent upon the availability of new and additional resources as well as on \nthe transfer of technology from the North to the South. As agreed at Rio, we \nare expecting our partners in the North to make their pledges during this \nsession of the General Assembly. \nThe world today has reached a defining moment in history. The \nimperatives of global interdependence require that we members of the \ninternational community work closely together in a new global cooperative \nspirit to move away from the past decades of ideological confrontation towards \nthe building of a better world for all. In this regard the United Nations \nremains the best forum and vehicle for bringing about a new global consensus \nfor international peace, security and development. Together, as a family of \nnations, we must have the vision and courage to address our common interest \nand future. \n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate \nHis Excellency Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its forty-seventh session. I am sure he will guide us well. \nI should like also to thank the outgoing President, His Excellency \nMr. Samir Shihabi. His valuable contribution to the work of the United \nNations was much appreciated. \nI wish also to thank the Secretary-General for his efforts on behalf of \npeace in the world. His report, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", should be given urgent \nattention by Member countries. I offer the Secretary-General my continued \nsupport in all his demanding work. \nThis year, we are very pleased to greet the new Members of the United \nNations. Their admission should further strengthen our Organization. \nSince last year's session we have continued to see great changes in the \nworld. Brunei Darussalam welcomed most of them. However, we have approached \nothers with caution. This is because we are not yet sure what they will lead \nto. Generally, though, we feel that the Members of the world body are now in \na better position than ever before to build a just and lasting peace in the \nworld. \nHowever, we believe that certain things must be in place before any \nUnited Nations action can have a good chance of success. These are strong \nbilateral relationships between individual countries which lead to \nmultilateral cooperation through regional associations. We feel that these \ntwo structures are essential. It is our view that, if they exist, the United \nNations will be able to function well in terms of both peace-keeping and \npeace-building. We think they are required because no one nation or single \norganization is able to stand alone. \nThat is why my country, like many others, has been engaged in intense \ndiplomatic activity over the past year. We feel we have to establish a wide \nrange of bilateral relations and participate fully in regional and \ninternational organizations. We think that, in this way, even small nations \nsuch as ours can contribute a great deal to the success of this Organization. \nWe would like to see United Nations action complementing regional and \ninternational institutions. \nI feel that this is illustrated by the part the Association of South-East \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) has played in finding a solution to the Cambodian \nproblem. ASEAN's hard work and patience in the initial stages was crucial. \nSo were the efforts of other concerned and interested parties. Also, the \nwillingness of the Cambodians themselves to seek a peaceful solution was a \nmost significant factor. The peace accord sponsored by the United Nations was \nbuilt on this foundation. \nThe situation in Cambodia today may offer a further illustration. We \nbelieve it shows that peace-building does not necessarily end when an \nagreement is signed. The effort must still go on. A continuing spirit of \ncooperation among all parties to any international settlement must be \nencouraged. \nWe, therefore, see reasons for optimism in our own part of the world. \nBut we do not overlook realities elsewhere. We are glad to note that, even in \nsome very difficult situations, individual countries are trying to play their \npart in bringing peace and stability to their regions. \nWe are particularly glad to see this happening in the Middle East. The \npeace talks sponsored by the United States and Russia are providing the \ncountries concerned with the means to make peaceful progress. Certainly, the \ncore problem of Palestine has not yet been resolved, and we regret that the \nIsraelis still defy Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). \nBut in spite of all this, we see some progress. For this reason, we urge \neveryone involved to try to make the talks succeed. At the same time, we feel \nthat the United Nations still has an important role to play in the search for \na solution. \nWe believe that the world body should increase its effort to help bring \nabout peaceful change in South Africa. This would strengthen the considerable \nefforts made by institutions such as the Commonwealth and the Organization of \nAfrican Unity. \nIn our opinion, there are sound reasons for the United Nations to be \ninvolved in Cambodia, the Middle East and South Africa. This is because \ncertain favourable conditions have been created by those directly involved. \nUnfortunately, this cannot always be the case. The situation in the \nBalkans seems likely to be typical of the dilemmas the world body may be \nforced to face in the future. On the one hand, there is a need to act because \nof our moral and human obligations. On the other hand, there may be no \nframework of good sense, reason and peaceful intent established at all \nlevels. Calls for United Nations action in similar circumstances may multiply. \nThat is why I do not feel we can consider peace and security only in \ntheir political context. We see them as closely linked with economic \ndevelopment. Here I refer to the grave social and economic problems faced by \na great number of developing nations. They pose a considerable threat to \nthose countries' internal security and, therefore, to international stability. \nIf present conditions continue, developing countries will be in no \nposition to undertake peaceful cooperation. This could mean that the United \nNations is called upon time and again to try to solve local conflicts under \nvery difficult circumstances. \nWe therefore think it is vital that developing and developed countries \nengage in peace-building together. We feel there is an urgent need to provide \nthe building blocks of international peace today. These take the form of \ncooperative international trading relations. \nIn my view, the first test we all face is whether we can bring about a \nsuccessful conclusion to the current Uruguay Round. Other things should then \nfall into place, such as open markets and the free transfer of modern \ntechnology to developing nations. \nThose seem to me to be the most practical ways in which we all can engage \nin preventive diplomacy. They will ensure that the primary role of the United \nNations is not only to solve political crises but also to help individual \nnations and regions build their own peace in their own way. "

        "file_text": "The General Assembly stands poised at a \nvital watershed. It is a time of opportunity and challenge, of promise and \nuncertainty, of hopes and unfulfilled expectations. In many ways we are \nentering new and uncharted territory. We must beat out our own track with \ncaution, deliberation and conviction. We must, above all, invoke and nurture \nthat spirit of commonality, commitment, innovation and imagination that is so \nuniquely manifest today, as we confront together the unprecedented transition \nin world affairs. \nWe are all conscious of the significance of this moment in history. We \nare in the last decade of a tumultuous century and millennium. We are \nstraddling the threshold of a new century a new era carrying with us the \naspirations of our people for a better, more prosperous, peaceful and \nfulfilling life. Three years from now the United Nations will celebrate its \nfiftieth anniversary. Our efforts in the interim will surely determine its \ncourse for future generations. \nThere is no doubt that the United Nations is but a reflection of the \nwishes of its component parts. It is in a real sense the collective \ninstrument for promoting the interests of all States, weak or strong, rich or \npoor, large or small. At the heart of its success or failure is the \ncontribution to its purposes and principles that each individual country must \nmake. It is the sum total of these individual efforts that is the real \nfoundation of the success of the United Nations in maintaining peace, securing \njustice and human rights, and promoting the key Charter prerogative of \\\"social \nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom\\\". \nI reaffirm today the total commitment of Bangladesh to furthering the \nobjectives of the United Nations Charter and the cause of multilateralism. \nIndeed, this is a constitutional commitment. In doing so, I would like to \nunderscore the dominant theme of my statement: How can a relatively small \nState contribute towards making this Organization a viable instrument, capable \nof dealing effectively and comprehensively with all aspects of human \ndevelopment, be they political, economic, social or environmental? \nMr. President, before I proceed further, let me join my voice to the \nwell-deserved tributes paid to you. Sir, on your election to the high office \nof President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. Your \nknowledge and experience will, I am sure, guide us well in these challenging \ntimes. I am confident that you will do great honour to the legacy left by \nyour illustrious predecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi, of Saudi Arabia, to whom we \nare all deeply indebted. \nWe extend our warm tribute to the Secretary-General, \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. He has taken charge and is steering the course of \nour Organization at perhaps its most daunting period of renewal, revival and \nresurgence. We pledge to him our unstinted support and cooperation in the \nfurtherance of his endeavours.* \nI would also like to welcome in our midst the many new countries that \nhave taken their seat in the General Assembly this year, swelling our ranks to \n179 Member States. Most of them represent peoples who have recently gained \nfreedom. Their\\\" presence strengthens not only our common goal for universality \nbut adds a new forceful voice that gives meaning to the expression of the very \nfirst words of the Charter of the United Nations: \\\"We the peoples of the \nUnited Nations\\\". We look forward to working with them in close and friendly \ncooperation. \nPrevious speakers have discussed at length the nature of the contemporary \nworld setting, the massive pressures that have radically changed relationships \nbetween States and individuals, and the resulting positive and negative trends \nthat have emerged. It is not my intention to repeat this analysis. Suffice \nit to say that one paramount task emerges: how to tilt the balance of \ncontradictory forces in favour of the evolution of a new, more beneficial, \nmore just and peaceful world order. \nAt the heart of the issue is the creation of an environment of peace. \nIronically, the sources of conflict are rooted in the absence of progress in \nobjectives we most seek to promote the enhancement of human rights and \nfundamental freedoms, the promotion of sustainable economic and social \ndevelopment for wider prosperity, the alleviation of human distress, and the \ncurtailment of the existence and use of weapons of mass destruction. \nOf real concern to third world countries are certain negative impulses. \nA prime factor is continuing anxiety that their interests are being \nmarginalized both politically and economically. Insularity and internal \ndomestic preoccupations of the major Powers open up prospects of a power \nvacuum and of the consequent danger of regional competition and hegemony. \nDiversion of resources along an East-West axis can leave the South starved of \npolitical resources and investment. \nThese fears are multiplied by the emergence of new constraints that \ncircumscribe development cooperation standards of good governance, rigid \nstructural adjustment measures, environmental criteria and scrutiny of \nmilitary intentions and preparedness. \n\nWhat is basically at issue is a degree of perception. It is not opposition to \nthese recognizably needed changes, but resistance to any form of dictation \nwith regard to how they should be achieved. A flexible attitude is perhaps \nthe best prescription. Too often the role of people has been ignored to the \nperil of the world community. One extreme manifestation is that national \nself-assertion has resurfaced. It has brought realization to the right of \nself-determination, but it has also released long-suppressed ethnic, cultural, \nlinguistic and cultural rivalries and has unleashed bigotry, extremism and \nviolence. This is at a time when, after years of patient pressure, racism and \nracial discrimination were being isolated and apartheid dismantled. They have \ngenerated powerful centrifugal forces that threaten established boundaries. \nAt the same time, poverty, disease, famine and repression have joined together \nto produce a massive movement of people within and beyond national borders \n17 million refugees and 20 million displaced persons worldwide all of which \nhave combined to create a new dimension of insecurity that must be addressed \nin all its ramifications. \nThe pre-eminent task before us is to forge a new, more focused and \naction-oriented world agenda to promote peace, tolerance, justice and \ndevelopment. It is of crucial import that this should be time-targeted, \nprioritized, fully-funded and cost-efficient. \nThe structure and shape of this agenda has already assumed significant \nsubstance. The first-ever summit of the Security Council members took place \nin January 1992. The outcome of that meeting concentrated on an agenda for \npeace encompassing preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and what \nthe Secretary-General characterized as post-conflict peace-building. Other \nsubstantial inputs have been made or are envisaged including, inter alia: \nthe 1990 World Summit for children; the special session of the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly on narcotic drugs; the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Conference on \nEnvironment and Development; the 1993 summit on human rights; the 1994 \nconference on population and development; the 1995 world conference on women \nand a world summit for social development. These accompany far-reaching \nproposals that are under way to reform, strengthen and streamline the \nOrganization to enable it to fulfil its responsibility as the central organ \nfor the cooperative management of the world's problems. \nIf the world Organization is to succeed and flourish, it will depend as \nmuch on the resilience of its Member States to prosper individually as on \ntheir ability constructively to contribute to its great goals and purposes. \nPositive efforts by each country cumulatively strengthen the sum total of the \nUnited Nations mandate. What then is Bangladesh's contribution to this grand \ndesign? \nThe quest for a new world order must begin with putting our own house in \norder. In our region, Bangladesh has sought actively to maintain the momentum \nand credibility of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation \n(SAARC) and by promoting its essentially socio-economic mandate to create a \nbroad-based climate of confidence-building, to reduce tension in the region \nand to resolve outstanding bilateral differences by dialogue and negotiation. \nIt is on us, as Chairman of the forthcoming seventh summit of SAARC, that the \nonus of responsibility has fallen to promote these aims in more productive and \ntangible ways, especially as SAARC stands poised to enter its second cycle of \nannual summit meetings. \nBilaterally, the democratically elected Government of \nPrime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, has initiated concerted steps to bolster a \n\nnew chapter of positive interaction with our immediate neighbours, following \nyears of inactivity. The upsurge of democracy throughout the region has \nsignificantly contributed to this objective. In recent months official visits \nby the Prime Minister to Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan have been motivated by \none major determinant to eschew past inhibitions and look to the future. \nSome issues remain complex and sensitive but approaches to solutions are being \nforged through continuing and pragmatic dialogue. \nThe exodus of Myanmar refugees to Bangladesh since November 1991 imposed \na heavy additional burden on the new government, coming as it did in the wake \nof the devastating cyclone of May 1991 and the cumulative adverse impact of \nthe aftermath of the Gulf War. The option of confrontation loomed large. Yet \nthrough circumspection, restraint and a conscious defusion of tension, the \ngroundwork was laid for an eventual solution by mutual agreement in April 1992. \nDespite this agreement, some 270,000 Myanmar refugees still remain in our \nterritory as efforts continue to repatriate them in honour, safety and dignity \nand above all on a voluntary basis. Given the dire compulsions under which \nthe refugees fled, the process of persuading them to return is a difficult and \ndrawn-out one. Time targets are at best approximate and increase the \nliabilities of the Government in terms of costs, environmental damage and \ntension with and among the local population. The critical catalyst for \nguaranteeing safe repatriation and resettlement remains an impartial United \nNations presence. Efforts continue to overcome Myanmar's reticence on this \nscore. Yet, bilaterally the two countries are cooperating positively. I am \nhappy to announce that the first minimal step has been taken with the \nvoluntary repatriation of some 49 refugees on 23 September 1992. It is hoped \n\nthis will constitute a crack in the wall towards the voluntary return of the \nremaining refugees. \nGlobally, Bangladesh supports all measures to strengthen the United \nNation's capacity to prevent war and resolve conflicts and to extend this \ncapacity in new and imaginative ways. It is of key importance to preserve the \nsecurity of small States and to promote the concept of preventive diplomacy, \nespecially to anticipate and contain damage in times of man-made or natural \ndisasters. It is a matter of some satisfaction that the role of the United \nNations in helping to resolve the Myanmar refugee problem was the first \nobjective test of preventive diplomacy in action. The visit of \nMr. Jan Eliasson, the Coordinator for Humanitarian Affairs, to Bangladesh and \nMyanmar respectively, was to trigger the agreement between the two countries \nfor repatriation of the refugees. \nWe believe that there is a real chance today that collective security can \nbe achieved through promotion of the unrealized premises of the United Nations \nCharter, including the fostering of regional security arrangements under \nChapter VIII. Regional groupings can and must concentrate on harnessing \ndurable structures of stability, starting at the base and working through \nconfidence-building measures and broad-based socio-economic cooperation. \n\nReduced reliance on military security must be buttressed through \nmonitoring, regulating and limiting the growing traffic in arms. At the \nnational level, doctrines of minimum defence self-sufficiency equated with the \ninnovative use of armed forces as human development investment could lead to a \nrealistic release of a peace dividend. One recent measure of note in \nBangladesh is that budget allocations for defence this year are less than \nthose for education. At the same time, we have purposefully contributed to \nUnited Nations peace-keeping efforts through the despatch of military and \ncivilian contingents to monitor the elections in Namibia, to police cease-fire \nlines in the Gulf, to help clear mines and support the restructuring effort in \nKuwait, and to assist the United Nations peace processes in Cambodia, \nYugoslavia and Western Sahara. We strongly support the strengthening of the \nfinancial and institutional base of peace-keeping and its growth in new and \nimaginative directions. \nWe have striven, through specific initiatives, to participate \nconstructively and with moderation and pragmatism in all socio-economic \nforums, especially to project the concerns of the least developed countries \nand to keep alive the commitment to preferential treatment of the poorest of \nthe poor. The critical socio-economic situation in Africa deserves special \nattention. \nIn Bangladesh we have learnt one fundamental lesson: there is no \nshortcut to progress, no matter how reliable or generous our friends may be. \nWhether it relates to achieving freedom from political oppression, vindicating \nhuman rights or seeking social and economic emancipation, a country must \nultimately depend on itself. \n\nThree consequent goals have emerged: first and foremost, to bolster \nindividual self-reliance and move away from aid-centricity to more defined \ndevelopment cooperation; secondly, to intensify South-South cooperation and \ncollective self reliance in such specific and practical areas as food \nproduction, manpower planning, trade, investments and joint ventures and \nmodalities to implement them; and finally, to reactivate constructive \nNorth-South dialogue and the creation of an external environment conducive to \nthe revitalizing of growth and the targeting, in particular, of the reduction \nand elimination of poverty. \nThere has been a growing convergence of strategies to redress the \ncritical issues of falling investment, reduction and restructuring of debt, \ntrade promotion and the transfer of technology. Successful conclusion of the \nUruguay Round remains a pressing priority. These goals must be pursued to a \nlogical and urgent conclusion. \nAnother crucial element must be stressed: the development objective must \nbe put in sharper focus than the theme of adjustment that has long \novershadowed it; structural adjustment measures are necessary, but must avoid \nundue hardships which often lead the poorest sections of the population to \nbear a disproportionate part of the burden. \nAt home, a crucial policy imperative has been the drawing up of a vision \nand strategy for the future that would align participatory democracy with the \ncountry's development needs. This new development perspective focuses on \nhuman development, participatory planning, and greater induction and \ninvolvement of women in development and the alleviation of poverty. It \nrecognizes the need to raise investment so as to achieve growth in excess of \n5 per cent per annum, and identifies efficiency improvement as one of the \n\nimportant means of attaining this end. It aims at achieving a symbiosis \nbetween agriculture and industry that will address the needs of growth, \nemployment generation and poverty alleviation. To ensure that this link is \nsustained and can lead to a take-off for the economy, investment in the social \nsectors is given central importance. \nThe factors I have mentioned highlight one basic reality: the fabric of \nself-reliance is intimately woven out of three strands democracy, \ndevelopment and human rights. \nOur own experience has underlined certain basic truths. Without \ndemocracy, a people's potential for socio-economic progress cannot flower. \nEqually, without improved standards of living and a vision for the future that \ncan sustain hope, democracy will wither. Human rights become meaningless in \nthe face of the dire constraints of poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy. \nNo other right can take precedence over the amelioration of this condition. \nBangladesh fully reaffirms that basic human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms are of universal validity. We believe that a human rights culture \nembracing all freedoms must evolve in a uniform way. Perhaps the most vital \naspect of this that has yet to find universal acceptance is recognition of the \nright to development. Surely, peace and stability cannot be achieved unless \nconditions are created to remove the root causes of war and conflict, that is, \neconomic and social deprivation. \nWe look forward to participating in the second World Conference on Human \nRights, in June 1993, and to ensuring that the Conference addresses all \naspects of human rights on the basis of universality, indivisibility and \nimpartiality. \n\nSince the only real protection of small and weaker States is firmly \nrooted in the rule of law, Bangladesh has constantly striven to promote its \nprogressive development and codification internationally and regionally, and \nto promote its due reflection at home through enabling legislation. We shall \nremain active in pursuing these endeavours, especially in promoting such \npriority areas as the non-navigational uses of international water-courses, \nthe international law of the sea, environmental protection and the status of \nrefugees, economic migrants and displaced persons. No one can doubt the \nserious potential for conflict that the absence of law holds in these areas. \nThey remain a pressing priority for concentrated movement forward. \nThrough national legislation, its regional extension and international \nparticipation, we have also contributed to addressing solutions to global \nproblems of drugs, terrorism and protection of the environment. We welcome in \nparticular the outcome of the Rio Conference, which has addressed the issues \nof environment and development, which are inextricably linked. Sustainable \ndevelopment calls for a new global partnership, including the provision of new \nand additional financial resources to developing countries and adequate access \nfor them to environmentally sound technology. \nSocial aspects must also remain at the heart of our endeavours, \nespecially concentration on disadvantaged groups that the pursuit of economic \ngrowth tends to bypass. We therefore wholeheartedly support the convening of \nthe World Summit for Social Development. \nBangladesh supports the view that the full integration of women in the \ndevelopment process at all levels is of critical importance. We stand \ncommitted to promoting the success of the World Conference on Women to be held \nin 1995. \n\nEqually, the rights and status of children remain a paramount priority. \nThis year the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, along with the \nUnited Nations Children's Fund, is focusing particular attention on the rights \nof children in South Asia, in keeping with the commitment of the countries of \nthe region to the full implementation of the Declaration and Plan of Action of \nthe World Summit for Children. \n\nNo statement is complete if we do not address ourselves to some of the \noutstanding conflict and tension points around the globe. Since the creation \nof the United Nations, over 100 major conflicts have taken a toll of some \n20 million dead. The cold war imposed its own peculiar threat to security. \nWith its demise, vital new possibilities have opened up for forging a new \nsecurity regime. The United Nations has emerged as a central instrument for \nthe prevention and resolution of conflicts. Bangladesh is determined to \ncontribute in whatever ways it can, directly or indirectly, to making it more \neffective and responsive in new and creative ways. \nI turn now to the critical political issues on our agenda. \nBangladesh's consistent and categorical position on the Middle East \nquestion and the issue of Palestine needs no reiteration. We believe the \nPalestinians' cause to be founded on justice. We welcome the convening of the \npeace conference and the start of substantive parallel negotiations over the \nframework of a peaceful settlement. We believe that this should be \ncomprehensive, should include Palestine, and must be based on a serious \ncommitment by Israel to abide by Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), \n338 (1973) and 425 (1978), and the principle of returning land for peace. It \nis our hope that Israel will show sincerity of purpose and greater flexibility \nand will refrain from delaying the peace process. \nIt is our fervent hope that all parties in Afghanistan will respect the \ncease-fire and faithfully implement the Peshawar Accord of April 1992, which \nreflected a broad consensus of all Afghan leaders. This would lay the \ngroundwork for holding free and fair elections so that a permanent government \ncould emerge reflecting the wishes and aspirations of the Afghan people. At \nthe same time, it would ensure much needed political, economic and social \nstability. There is vital need for the world community to contribute \n \ngenerously and actively towards the reconstruction and rehabilitation of \nAfghanistan and towards the safe and voluntary return of refugees to their \nhomeland. \nThe implementation of the 1991 Paris Agreement on a comprehensive \nsettlement in Cambodia has progressed apace, despite obstacles raised by one \nof the four factions to move into the second phase of implementation. We \nwelcome this advance and commend the intense and diverse attempts by the \nUnited Nations to nurture national reconciliation to foster the democratic \nprocess and to build peace and stability. In our own small way, as a part of \nthe United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC), Bangladesh is \ncommitted to end the suffering of the Cambodian people and to allow them to \ndetermine freely their own destiny. \nThe vicious cycle of starvation, factional fighting, the break-down of \ncentral authority, the violence and the exodus of refugees in Somalia has \nshocked the world. The response has been belated. We fully support the \nSecurity Council decision to strengthen the United Nations peace-keeping \npresence so as to break this cycle through a comprehensive programme of action \nthat could reach vital relief assistance, consolidate the cease-fire, curtail \nviolence and bring about national reconciliation. We also welcome the efforts \nof the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Organization of the Islamic \nConference (OIC) and the Arab League to convene a conference on national \nreconciliation and unity in Somalia. \nThe upheaval in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a \ncause of utmost concern. It has unleashed a bitter mix of conflict, ambition, \nhatred and ethnic brutality. The August 1992 London Conference and the \nmechanisms it has instituted remain a vital hope for the intensification of \n\nthe search for solutions in all aspects and on a continuous basis. Meanwhile, \nthe world is appalled by the Serbian aggression in Bosnia and Herzegovina, by \nthe massacre of innocent civilians, the systematic persecution and even \nannihilation through the abhorrent policy of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\". \nBangladesh has taken a forthright stand in all international forums to \ncondemn these acts. It has joined in the call for more decisive and resolute \naction that would reverse the aggression, stop the brutality, and ensure the \nunhindered supply of relief. We have also denied the claim of Serbia and \nMontenegro to be the successor State of former Yugoslavia in the United \nNations and other international bodies. We believe that much more needs to be \ndone to end the bloodshed and fully restore the sovereignty, independence and \nterritorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \nWe remain steadfast in our support for the people of South Africa in \ntheir struggle to achieve their cherished goal of equal rights and majority \nrule. There can be no compromise until we have achieved the complete \ndismantling of apartheid. The international community must remain vigilant in \nits efforts to bring an effective end to the recent outbreak of violence and \ncreate conditions for negotiations leading towards a peaceful transition to a \ndemocratic, non-racial and united South Africa. \nBangladesh welcomes the intensification of efforts to find a just and \nviable solution to the Cyprus problem. We commend the Secretary-General for \nhis personal initiatives a\u00ac\u00aaid role in the difficult process of reaching \nagreement on a broad-based set of ideas leading towards an overall framework \nagreement. We hope that the leaders of the two communities who are to meet on \n26 October 1992 will pursue direct and uninterrupted negotiations to reach an \namicable and durable solution that will serve the legitimate interests of both \ncommunities. \n\nIn Western Sahara, we fully support the Secretary-General's initiatives \nto reactivate the implementation of the settlement plan and to help overcome \ndifferences over criteria of eligibility to vote. We hope that the referendum \ncan be effectively organized and supervised and thus bring about an early end \nto this long-standing dispute. \nIn other parts of the third world, bilateral, regional and international \nefforts have seen many positive initiatives and advances. It is the combined \nsolidarity and sustained moral pressure of the world community that has \ncreated a climate conducive to peaceful change. The enhanced role and \ncontribution of the International Court of Justice also now assumes much \ngreater relevance and credibility and must be strengthened. \nLet me say in conclusion that the world has reached a critical point in \nits struggle to advance stability and well-being. No doubt violence, \naggression, foreign occupation, narrowly conceived nationalism, racial and \nreligious discrimination and gaping social and economic disparities still \npersist. Yet there is today greater confidence and conviction that a better \nworld is truly within our reach. We are faced with an opportunity rare in the \nhistory of civilization to carry forward the momentum to resolve disputes \npeacefully, to promote partnership and responsible relations among States, to \nstrengthen the rule of law and uplift the quality of life of all peoples in \ngreater freedom. We must surely move with deliberation towards the \nrealization of what the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, calls \n\\\"the vast potential of this unique Organization to bring new life to the \nworld of the Charter.\\\" (A/47/1, para. 170) "

        "file_text": "Let me begin by congratulating the \nPresident upon his election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of \nthe General Assembly. \n\nI wish to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. His able and efficient leadership of the United \nNations since he took office only nine months ago has impressed us all and I \nwish to assure him of Denmark's full support of his continuing efforts to \nreform and streamline the Organization. \nDuring the past year the world Organization has become more nearly \nuniversal than ever. What in 1945 started out as an organization of 51 Member \nStates has now become an organization consisting of 179 Members. This year 13 \nnew States have joined the United Nations. All the new States of the former \nSoviet Union, as well as Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and \nSan Marino, have now joined the Organization. \nLet me take this opportunity to welcome all the new Member States and to \nexpress my hope for future fruitful cooperation in the spirit of the United \nNations. \nThe very deplorable developments in the former Yugoslavia have \ndemonstrated how fragile the situation is in many parts of the world in the \npost-cold-war era and have led to the largest refugee crisis in Europe since \nthe Second World War. The international community has reacted with great \nresponsibility to the intensified crisis in the former Yugoslavia and the \noverwhelming humanitarian needs it has caused. We have made very large \nresources available for monitoring, mediation and peace-keeping operations, as \nwell as for humanitarian assistance. I welcome the enlarged role of the \nUnited Nations in the peace efforts in the area as well as the central role of \nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the provision of relief, \nwhere coordination remains of paramount significance in ensuring that the \nrelief work is carried out with maximum speed and efficiency. \nDenmark has worked closely with the High Commissioner in providing very \nsubstantial humanitarian assistance, both financially and otherwise. Lately \nwe have accepted a more direct involvement in the provision of accommodation \nand shelter for refugees and displaced persons. We intend to continue our \nefforts. \nThe Yugoslav crisis is a crisis in Europe, and Europe is willing and able \nto take its part of the international responsibility, but the United Nations \nas the international, global actor has its important role to play as well. \nThe international Conference in London on the former Yugoslavia assembled all \nthe main actors involved in the crisis and war in the region. The results \nwere encouraging. The framework for the absolutely necessary political \ndialogue and for the negotiations was established, including the structure and \nthe principles upon which any peaceful solution must be based. \nDevelopments in the first month after the London conference have shown \nthat the conference was able not only to produce very good documents but also \nto establish the follow-up mechanism enabling us to turn words into deeds. \nDenmark wholeheartedly supports the efforts in Geneva under the \nco-chairmanship of Mr. Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. \nUnder the impact of all the combined international efforts - the United \nNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), the European Community Monitoring Mission \n(ECMM), the Geneva talks we must not forget that the main responsibility for \nbringing an end to the cruelties and violence lies with the conflicting \nparties. All the peoples, groups and minorities and their leaders must \nrealize that the only way their communities can flourish is through a \nnegotiated, commonly accepted political settlement of their disputes. \nDiverging interests can coexist peacefully only through compromise. The basic \nprinciples for a political solution will not change: the inviolability of the \nborders which can be changed only by mutual, peaceful agreement; the human \nrights and the rights of minorities must be respected; the sanctions against \nSerbia-Montenegro will be upheld until the acts of aggression have stopped; \nthe so-called \\\"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\\\" is not the sole successor to \nthe Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; humanitarian help to all in \nneed shall be possible; persons who have committed crimes against \ninternational humanitarian law shall be prosecuted individually, if possible \nby an international court under the United Nations. \nThe situation in the former Yugoslavia is still grave, but I think we \nhave created the foundations for a possible improvement and eventual \nsettlement. There will be difficulties and backlashes ahead. As Prime \nMinister Major said at the London Conference, it will be a long haul. But \nnobody should doubt that Denmark, nationally as well as in its capacity as the \nnext holder of the Presidency of the European Community, will devote all its \nstrength to the international efforts aimed at obtaining a political, peaceful \nsettlement in the former Yugoslavia. \nAfter a period of impressive progress, the reform process in South Africa \ncame to an unfortunate standstill in the middle of this year because of new, \ntragic outbreaks of violence. The high level of violence remains one of the \nmajor obstacles to a resumption of negotiations. \nThe Secretary-General took an important step by sending his Special \nRepresentative to South Africa. As a result, a number of United Nations peace \nobservers have been deployed in violence-stricken areas. After a visit \nearlier this month by the Troika of European Community Foreign Ministers, the \nEuropean Community has also decided to send peace observers to South Africa. \nIn addition, European experts will support the work of the Goldstone \nCommission and other efforts to curb the violence in South Africa. \nAt the end of the day, however, only the South Africans themselves can \nbring about the new, democratic South Africa that we are looking forward to. \nWe stand ready to provide our fullest support. For more than 25 years, \nDenmark has granted humanitarian assistance to the victims of the apartheid \nsystem, and it is prepared to initiate a programme of transitional assistance \nto South Africa once an interim government is in place. We encourage the \ninternational community to join in the efforts to redress the social and \neconomic imbalances in South Africa, and to contribute to the creation of a \nnon-racial and democratic South Africa. \nThe tragedy in Somalia amply illustrates the need for a process of \nnational reconciliation in that country leading to the re-establishment of a \nlegitimate government. Following the visit to Mogadishu by the troika of \nEuropean Community Foreign Ministers in early September, the European \nCommunity Foreign Ministers stressed this, as well as the particularly \nimportant role of the United Nations, in their declaration of 13 September. \nIn the Middle East the parties involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict and \nthe Palestinian question have embarked on a negotiating process that gives \ngrounds for hopes of a just, comprehensive and lasting settlement. Denmark, \ntogether with its European Community partners, fully supports, and remains \ncommitted to the peace process. \nThe policy adopted by the new Israeli Government has given a new impetus \nto this process. The subsequent response of the Arab countries and the \nPalestinians bodes well for the future. I sincerely hope that all parties \nwill now engage in substantive negotiations by building incrementally on the \nprogress achieved so far. Pragmatism is what counts at the present stage. I \ntherefore call on all parties to translate good intentions into concrete \nproposals and open-mindedness. \nIn Iraq the Baghdad regime continues to ignore its obligations under \ninternational law by obstructing the work of United Nations inspection teams. \nThe regime is continuing its flagrant violations of human rights and \nfundamental freedoms, in particular by victimizing Kurds and Arab Shiites \nliving in the marshes. And Baghdad is actively impeding the efforts of the \nUnited Nations and non-governmental organizations to relieve the plight of \nthose suffering. The harassment of United Nations peace guards, the refusal \nto renew the Memorandum of Understanding and the rejection of the food-for-oil \narrangements laid down in Security Council resolutions 706 (1991) and \n712 (1991) are all cases in point. \nSaddam Hussein's strategy, however, is doomed to failure. In no \ncircumstances will the international community relax the United Nations \nsanctions imposed on the Baghdad regime unless it fully and unconditionally \ncomplies with all relevant Security Council resolutions. \nIn my speech last autumn I pointed out how Security Council \nresolution 688 (1991) might become a turning point as to the balance between \nthe principle of national sovereignty and that of humanitarian intervention. \nThe question of humanitarian intervention has had a considerable impact on \ninternational debate during the last year. The course of events in Somalia, \nthe former Yugoslavia and recently, anew, in Iraq has shown the relevance and \nimportance of the concept. \nThere seems to me to be growing support for the point of view that the \nprinciple of non-intervention in the internal jurisdiction of States cannot be \ntaken as a shield behind which massive violations of human rights can be \nallowed to take place, especially not where the human rights situations have \nbeen characterized by the Security Council as a threat to peace. A new \nbalance between sovereignty and international intervention is being struck, in \nfavour of international intervention. My Government welcomes that \ndevelopment. We should insist on recognition of the basic principle that \nGovernments have to cooperate fully to ensure access to all persons in need of \nassistance. Far too often political motives continue to prevent humanitarian \nassistance from entering a country or from reaching population groups in need \nof such assistance. \nIt has been appalling to witness the continuing disregard for \nhumanitarian conventions shown by Iraq during the Gulf War, and, most \nrecently, by parties to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The \nperpetrators of these criminal acts are individually responsible, and must be \nprosecuted individually. \nIn this connection I welcome the work of the International Law Commission \non the question of establishing an international criminal tribunal. The \nDanish Government is ready to contribute constructively in these efforts \nduring this and the coming session of the General Assembly. \nThe Secretary-General's report entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277) \ncontains a number of interesting proposals, some of which Denmark can support \nwholeheartedly: for example, the proposal to make wider use of good offices, \nthe proposal to establish a reserve fund for peace-keeping operations and the \nproposal to make wider use of the International Court of Justice. However, \nboth the use of the good offices of the Secretary-General and the use of the \nInternational Court depend on the political will of the parties involved. \nThe United Nations is facing steadily growing demands for peace-keeping \nefforts, and the scope of these efforts is increasing. Suffice it to mention \nCambodia, Somalia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the United Nations is \nalready heavily overburdened, we welcome the Secretary-General's call upon \nEuropean regional organizations to carry out peace-keeping functions in \naccordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter, as in Bosnia and Herzegovina. \nDespite the substantial Danish contribution to the United Nations \nProtection Force, we remain committed to further contributions to United \nNations peace-keeping operations, both in Europe and in other parts of the \nworld. Let me add, however, that a peace-keeping operation must be seen as an \ninterim offer to the parties to a conflict, and thus must be limited to a few \nyears. A peace-keeping operation must never, by the mere length of its \nexistence, turn out to be an excuse for the parties not to seek a negotiated \nsettlement of their dispute. \nIn fulfilling its mandate as the guardian of peace, the United Nations \nhas an important role to play by contributing to social and economic \ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty. The significant role that the \nUnited Nations has acquired in efforts to solve political conflicts should not \novershadow its responsibilities in the economic and social field. As pointed \nout by the Secretary-General, no lasting peace can be achieved while the \nexisting gap between rich and poor nations persists. \nThe improved international political climate, the breakup of the old \npower blocs and the reductions in military expenditures offer a unique \nopportunity to promote social development. \nWe must now face our responsibility to improve living conditions for the more \nthan one billion people living in absolute poverty, and for the even larger \nnumber of people suffering under unemployment and social insecurity. If we do \nnot, problems will multiply and put global stability at risk. \nThe solutions to those problems must be based on respect for human \nrights, the rule of law and political institutions that are effective, \naccountable and enjoy democratic legitimacy. It is time to face, discuss and \ntackle these interlinking aspects of social development. \nDenmark welcomes the proposal adopted by the Economic and Social Council \nto convene in 1995 a world summit for social development. We intend to \npropose Copenhagen as venue for the world social summit, thereby confirming \nDenmark's commitment to social development and our wish to make the summit an \nimportant event in the mobilization of all efforts to attain the ultimate \nobjective to improve the quality of life of man. \nThis year, the General Assembly will undertake a review of the \noperational activities of the United Nations system. It will give us an \nopportunity to assess the functioning of the development activities of the \nUnited Nations system during the past three years, and establish new \nguidelines and priorities for the coming three years. At the same time, \ndiscussions of fundamental reforms of the United Nations system as such have \nentered an important stage which gives an excellent opportunity for a \ncomprehensive discussion of the demands of the emerging new world order as \nthey relate to the. structure and functioning of the United Nations and its \nSecretariat. \nAt the centre of the reform discussions is the need for a clearer \ndefinition of the role of the United Nations system in development activities, \nincluding better distribution of work and improved coordination among the \nvarious organizations. The United Nations must also show leadership in this \nfield and carry out its own operational activities in a consistent and \ncoherent manner. \nProgress in the discussions of reforms of the United Nations operational \nactivities was made at the recent session of the Economic and Social Council. \nIt is our hope that at this year's session the General Assembly will bring the \nprocess forward from the level of discussing principles to that of concrete \naction. The proposals contained in the Nordic United Nations project would, \nin our view, enable the United Nations to regain its rightful leading role in \noperational development activities. Only through substantial changes in the \ngovernance and financing of United Nations funds and programmes will it be \npossible to ensure a more effective and efficient role for the United Nations \nin this field, to the benefit of developing nations. \nDuring the last few years, we have seen a succession of natural and \nman-made disasters of unprecedented frequency, scope and complexity. After \nthe extraordinary events of last year, we all hoped to see a reversal of this \ntrend in 1992. Unfortunately, such hopes have not been fulfilled. \nThe adoption of resolution 46/182 on emergency assistance at last year's \nsession was seen as a major step forward in the direction of improved \ncoordination within the United Nations system and increased efficiency in the \ndelivery of humanitarian emergency assistance. It was an important step. \nHowever, much more needs to be done to translate the aims of that resolution \ninto reality. \nThe public criticism which has been raised in many countries, including \nin Denmark, of the response of the United Nations system to the large-scale \ntragedy in Somalia is an example which makes it clear that this year the \nGeneral Assembly must give increased and renewed attention to the issue of \nimproved performance by the United Nations. A determined effort must now be \nmade to ensure that sufficient humanitarian assistance is given in time, with \nmaximum speed, and in a well coordinated manner. We appeal in particular to \nthe organizations of the United Nations family to try harder to cooperate, act \njointly and compete less. \nThe World Conference on Human Rights, scheduled to take place in June \nnext year, will provide an opportunity to review progress made in the field of \nhuman rights since the adoption of the Universal Declaration. Obstacles to \nfurther progress will be identified, and specific measures which can assist \nindividual countries in their efforts to promote respect for human rights will \nbe outlined. \nThe Danish Government is committed to ensuring a successful outcome to \nthe Conference, and will work for a balanced result containing both political \nbenchmarks and operational guidelines for corresponding implementation \nactivities. In this regard, special attention should be paid to the \ninterlinkages between democracy, human rights and development and to the need \nfor a concentrated assistance effort in this area, based on the principle that \nviolations of human rights are a legitimate concern of the international \ncommunity. \nDemocracy, respect for human rights, equal status for men and women and \nprinciples of good governance play an essential role in development efforts. \nThis has been increasingly recognized in recent years, and reflected both in \nthe wide-ranging reforms undertaken in a number of countries and in the \ncontinued policy dialogue aimed at supporting development efforts. At the \nsame time, the process towards broadening public participation in the \ndecision-making processes is bound to continue. \nThe Danish Government will seek to assist countries undertaking policy \nreforms in establishing administrative and political structures which are \nconducive to development for instance, by setting up new democratic \ninstitutions and by strengthening the rule of law. \nEqually we attach great importance to the question of military spending. \nExcessive military spending not only reduces funds available for other \npurposes, but can also contribute to increased regional tensions and \nviolations of international law, and can in some cases compromise moves \ntowards democracy and the rule of law at the domestic level. \nDenmark stands ready, through its programme for development assistance, \nto provide substantial support for specific activities aimed at consolidating \nhuman rights, democracy and good governance, and we shall seek our future \npartners in development from amongst countries which are making a genuine \neffort in this regard. \nNext year has also been designated the International Year of the World's \nIndigenous People. The Danish Government looks forward with great interest \nand high hopes to that Year, and plans are well under way both in Greenland \nand in Denmark on how to work actively towards increasing the understanding of \nthe special situation facing these peoples and how to further the respect for \nthe cultures and rights of indigenous peoples. \nIt is well known that the Inuit, the inhabitants of Greenland, have \nchosen the status of home rule within the Danish realm, and at the domestic \nlevel we will cooperate closely with the representatives of the home-rule \nGovernment of Greenland in our preparations for the Year. \nThe results the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development \nrecently achieved in Rio provide a good basis for a new global partnership \nbased on common responsibility for the Earth, even if it did not meet all our \nexpectations. The Rio Declaration, Agenda 21 and the Conventions on climate \nchange and biodiversity are far from being the end result: they are \ninstruments to mobilize governments and peoples from all over the world in a \njoint effort towards sustainable development in the future. \nThe most significant institutional recommendation of the Conference to be \nfollowed up at the international level is the high-level Commission on \nSustainable Development. It is important that the Commission's scope of work \nbe oriented towards the future in order to ensure a dynamic approach to future \ntechnological and economic developments. \nImplementation of Agenda 21 and the conventions requires financial \nresources and thus calls for partnership and real burden-sharing among \nnations, not only between North and South but also among the donor countries \nthemselves. \nFrom the very beginning, the Danish Government has been committed to the \nprocess of the United Nations Conference and Environment and Development. We \nare prepared to provide our fair share of the necessary resources, and would \nlike to see similar firm commitments from as many countries as possible. \nAt this session we are marking the end of the United Nations Decade of \nDisabled Persons. The disabled remain among the most vulnerable groups, in \nparticular in the developing countries. During the Decade awareness of the \nproblems and difficulties facing disabled persons all over the world has been \nincreased. Much however, still remains to be done. The development \norganizations of the United Nations should play an important role in this \nrespect by integrating the needs of disabled persons more strategically in the \nregular programming of their activities. \nLet me end by stating the obvious: we all wish the United Nations \nsuccess in the reform process and in carrying out its many tasks. But that \nwish must be accompanied by a willingness to live up to our legal obligation \nto pay our contributions to the Organization and to do so in full and on time. "

        "file_text": "Exactly 34 years \nago today Guinea attained independence. On this anniversary I am very happy \nto convey to you. Sir, the warm greetings of the people of Guinea, its \nGovernment and its President, General Lansana Conte. \nBeyond its being simply a matter of tradition, I find it a very pleasant \nduty to congratulate the President on his election. I am convinced that our \nwork will produce tangible -results, thanks to his personal experience and the \ninternational prestige of his country. \n\nI also wish to express to our President's predecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi \nof the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with whom my delegation had the good fortune \nto cooperate within the Bureau of the forty-sixth session, our appreciation \nfor the competence and dedication with which he conducted the work of that \nsession. \nMr. Perez de Cuellar also earned the high esteem of my Government for \nhaving marked his two consecutive terms of office with effectiveness and \nconsensus. \nSimilarly, I pay tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, for \nhis dynamism and the many initiatives he has taken since assuming office. His \nreport \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" is a source of valuable inspiration in the \nmaintenance and strengthening of international peace. The preventive \ndiplomacy he advocates in it should have the support of the international \ncommunity. \nThe Guinean Government warmly welcomes the admission of new Member \nStates, confirming once again the universality of our Organization's \nprinciples. \n\nMany events have occurred since our last session. Mankind is living \nthrough an age of hope, but also one of uncertainty. \nTrue, many promises are being made, but there does not appear to be a \nsufficient awareness of dangers. Indeed, the new world architecture is taking \nshape against a backdrop of persistent poverty and misery in the South, in \ncontrast to the general well-being in the North. \nThe international landscape still contains dark zones of actual and \npotential conflict. The transition towards the emerging order is creating for \nthe countries of Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and South America problems whose \nsolution will require sacrifice, farsightedness and solidarity from the \ninternational community. \nAlong with the political stakes, which are of crucial importance, there \nare no-less-important economic and social challenges. Clearly, poverty is \nundermining the fabric of States, creating profound imbalances in the \ndeveloping countries and threatening the very foundation of human rights. And \nthe first human right, the one on which all the others depend, is the right to \ndevelopment. \nNor can there be development without a guarantee of sources of income \nderived from basic commodities, prices for which, unfortunately, are not \nwithin the control of developing countries. This disturbing situation \nrepresents a real threat to the North as well, for it is already one of the \ncauses of the strong wave of migration from the South in search of prosperity. \nThis is compounded by the external indebtedness of the third world \ncountries. Payments for debt servicing, which increase exponentially, are in \nthe final analysis an unbearable burden on economies already severely tried by \nthe imbalances in the world economic order and by natural disasters. \n\nMany solutions have been advanced, but the international community must \nfinally give priority to the growth and development of the poor countries \nmust, in other words, build on the ruins of the old East-West order a new \norder based on more dynamic and more innovative North-South relations. Such\n a \nsystem could take into account, inter alia, free access for export products \nfrom the South to markets in the North and a growth in public aid to \ndevelopment and investments. \nIt has been recognized that improving the situation in Africa necessarily \ninvolves economic reforms, the sound management of public affairs and popular \nparticipation in development. In this connection, most of the countries of \nAfrica have undertaken deep political, economic and social reforms. But the \nefforts undertaken on the national, subregional and regional levels have not, \nunfortunately, enjoyed the expected international support. The United Nations \nProgramme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990, \nwhich gave rise to so much hope, has not produced the desired results. \nCapital flows from North to South have been negative in relation to the flow \nof resources from South to North. \nNevertheless, my delegation welcomes the adoption by the United Nations \nof the New Agenda for African Development in the 1990s, which will, I hope, \nenhance the impact of United Nations action in the economic and social \ndevelopment of the continent. \nFor Africa, one thing is clear: recovery and the diversification of \neconomic activities require subregional and regional integration. In this \nconnection, the establishment of the African Economic Community will enable \nthe continent to benefit from the complementarity of its human, natural and \nfinancial resources and offer at the same time the best opportunities to take \nadvantage of major international markets. \n\nI must stress that Africa is determined to fulfil its part of the \ncontract in order to meet all the development targets set forth within the \nframework of the Community. To that end, it needs the constant support of the \ninternational community. \nAnother of our concerns is the situation in South Africa, which has been \nincluded in our agenda for 46 years. While the international community was \nattempting to derive satisfaction from some of the progress achieved in \nnegotiations, the events at Biopatong, along with the deliberate massacres at \nCiskei on 7 September 1992, have strengthened our belief that the end of \napartheid was proclaimed much too prematurely. \nMy delegation believes that the South african Government must put an end \nto the escalation of violence, free political prisoners and rescind the \nHomelands Law and other discriminatory laws. Similarly, our country \nappreciates the recommendations made by the Secretary-General's Special \nRepresentative and also welcomes the sending of United Nations observers to \nassist in strengthening the structures established by the peace agreement. \nNegotiation is the only viable solution. The international community must \nencourage the resumption of the talks within the purview of the Convention for \na Democratic South Africa. \nThe situation in many other African countries continues to concern us. I \nam thinking first of Liberia, a fraternal country and neighbour battered by \ndestructive internal war. At any early stage the countries of West Africa \nmembers of the Economic Commission of West African States (ECOWAS) united in \nsolidarity to seek a negotiated settlement. A peace plan was drawn up with \nthe constant participation of all the parties to the conflict. The recent \nsummit meeting of ECOWAS Heads of State, at Dakar, took new steps to make \n\nthe peace plan fully effective. My Government appeals to the world \nOrganization, and especially to the Security Council, to give unreserved \nsupport to the implementation of that plan. \nIn addition, hundreds of millions of individuals have fled Liberia to \nseek refuge in Guinea, Cote d'lvoire and Sierra Leone. In Guinea alone there \nare nearly 600,000 refugees, two thirds of whom are children. The suffering \nendured by these human beings calls for additional efforts within the \nframework of the greatly appreciated assistance of the Office of the High \nCommissioner for Refugees. \nWhat can we say about Somalia, now in flames and so sorely tried by \nfamine and drought? My Government believes that peace can return to that \ncountry only if all the fighting factions display political will and agree to \ndialogue. Only the establishment of an immediate and definite cease-fire will \nenable the Somalians to engage in serious negotiations on the future of their \ncountry. Indeed, there is no point in turning to international forums for \nsome futile recognition or confirmation. Our brothers in Somalia must agree \nto bury the hatchet of war and allow the international community to help them \nto help themselves. \nIn addition to the political stakes, the tragedy in Somalia raises thorny \nhumanitarian problems, for whose solution emergency measures have been \neffectively implemented through the joint efforts of the United Nations, the \nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, the Organization of African Unity and \nmany countries and non-governmental organizations. \nAs for Angola, the cessation of hostilities and the dialogue opened \nbetween the parties to the conflict have made it possible to hold pluralistic \nelections. \n\nNot far away, in Mozambique, the Rome peace negotiations and the recent \nagreement reached in Botswana between RENAMO and the Maputo Government \nrepresent a decisive step towards settling that long and painful conflict. \nThe crisis in Rwanda is the subject of joint discussions to restore \nstability and security among the countries of the subregion. Direct \nnegotiations between the Government and the Rwanda Patriotic Front have \nemitted a glimmer of hope that an end may be put to a deadly conflict and that \nthe bases of national unity may be strengthened. \n\nFor many years, the crisis in the Middle East has occupied an important \nplace in our discussions here in the Organization; it is still one of the \ngreatest threats to international peace and security. The Palestinian \nquestion is at the heart of this formidable crisis. Only the return of all \ntheir rights to the Palestinian people under the auspices of the Palestine \nLiberation Organization, their sole and legitimate representative, can lead to \na just, comprehensive and lasting solution. The Government of Guinea urges \nthe parties to pursue the peace negotiations. By the same token, we support \nany other initiative directed towards breaking the log-jam in this situation \nquickly. \nWith regard to Cambodia, the establishment of a Supreme National Council \nin Cambodia headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk is putting an end to a very \ndifficult war and heralds the dawn of a new period which will, we hope, be \ncharacterized by a climate of tolerance and peaceful coexistence. \nDespite the efforts of the international community, engagements of a rare \nviolence are tearing apart the republics of the former Yugoslavia. Every day \nthe peoples of these lands are seeing their historic legacy, which it took \nthem centuries to build, reduced to ruins. \nInternational pressure must continue to be brought to bear in order to \nassert international legality and human rights and to ensure they are \nrespected. We welcome the peace efforts of the London Conference and the \nrecent summit conference of the non-aligned countries. \nWith regard to the question of Korea, my delegation supports the \nreunification process on the peninsula, from which nuclear weapons should be \nprecluded. My Government appreciates all the efforts towards reconciliation, \nnon-aggression, exchanges and cooperation between the two Koreas with a view \nto their peaceful reunification. \n\nThe spectacular and most often rapid transformations taking place in the \nworld today should have beneficial effects for disarmament and arms control. \nEven if on the bilateral level we are seeing agreements with regard to \nreducing or destroying certain types of weapons, at the multilateral level \nnegotiations are marking time. \nThe disappearance of the bipolar world is tending to make the senseless \narms race incomprehensible. However, in this new context, the risk of war has \nnot yet been ruled out, because of the existence of arsenals of weapons of \nmass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons. This is why the Republic of \nGuinea will continue to appeal urgently for general and complete disarmament. \nMy delegation welcomes the appreciable results achieved in the \nnegotiations on the signing of a convention on chemical weapons. However, the \nprincipal issues that are the cornerstone of disarmament, namely, the \nprohibition of nuclear tests and the arms race and the prevention of a nuclear \nwar, have not experienced the same positive development. \nMoreover, the close interconnection established in 1987 by the \nInternational Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and \nDevelopment is still just as important: a reduction in military expenditures \nand budgets could boost economic and industrial activity in the have-not \ncountries while strengthening the economic and social development efforts of \ndeveloping countries. \nIn recent years, relations between States have expanded and diversified. \nMultilateralism is strengthened as a result. The large number of States \nMembers of the universal Organization increasingly reflects their desire to \nengage in integrated and coordinated action at the international level in \norder to take up the various challenges: the challenge of peace, the \n\nchallenge of economic and social development and the challenge of the \nenvironment. \nHere is where multilateral relations must play an important role in \nmapping out the new order, which mankind hopes will be democratic and will \ngenerate prosperity for all. This is the path of multilateralism that the \nnon-aligned countries recently embarked upon in Djakarta. Our Organization \nshould take this duly into account in future international relations. \nThe United Nations is in the process of carrying out positive work on \nvarious fronts; this is work which gives it undeniable authority, particularly \nin the area of the settlement of conflicts. Never before has there been such \na strong consensus regarding the profound significance of peace. \nThe aspiration of peoples to justice, security and greater prosperity has \neverywhere initiated an enormous process of social transformation, which is \nperceived as the obvious sign of democratic change. In the Republic of \nGuinea, the democratic transition is taking place peacefully. The \nconstitutional institutions, governed by the principle of the separation of \npowers, are being established. Some 40 parties are engaged in the guest for \npolitical power. A supreme court, in which is invested the judicial power, \nwill ensure that elections take place in a regular way. The legislative \nelections are scheduled for December 1992, followed immediately by \npresidential elections in 1993. \nThe Government is pursuing a coherent policy of transition on the basis \nof dialogue and transparency. In any case, the form of democracy must be \nadjusted to suit the historical, economic, social and cultural realities of \neach country. \n\nThe Government of Guinea, resolutely committed to building a State of \nlaw, supports the actions of the international community to promote and \ndevelop human rights. In this respect, Guinea welcomes the convening of the \nWorld Conference on Human Rights in June 1993 and the international conference \non the African child scheduled for November 1992 in Dakar. Here I wish to \nappeal urgently to the international community as a whole, and particular to \nthe donors, to finance the various national programmes of action prepared in \nthe context of the decade for children. \nTwo important international events are to be commemorated in a few days' \ntime by this Assembly, which will devote plenary meetings to them: the end of \nthe United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons and the tenth anniversary of the \nadoption of the International Plan of Action on Ageing. My Government, which \nis always sensitive to the fate of these two social categories and their \nsufferings, is devoting a major part of its efforts under its national \ndevelopment programmes to them, and endorses the measures adopted as part of \nthe Decade of Disabled Persons as well as those taken under the International \nPlan of Action on Ageing. \nFor development strategies and programmes to be viable, they must pay \nparticular attention to the problem of the environment. That is why my \ndelegation requests the countries of the North to participate fully in \nfinancing Agenda 21, as defined and adopted in Rio, for the protection of the \nenvironment and lasting development. \nAnother major source of concern is the production and consumption of \ndrugs and the illicit traffic in them. To get rid of this scourge once and \nfor all, police pressure, the destruction of plantations and the prohibition \nof money laundering must be backed up with the parallel development and \npromotion of substitute crops. \n\nThe revitalization of the United Nations system is now a categorical \nimperative. This revitalization should in particular include enlarging the \nSecurity Council with a view to ensuring that a larger number of countries \nparticipate as permanent members. That reform could also make that vital \nbody, responsible as it is for maintaining international peace and security, \nmore efficient and effective. Expanding the Council is, in our opinion, one \nof the fundamental aspects of the democratization of international relations \nthat is now needed. \nThe Government of the Republic of Guinea attaches the utmost importance \nto the strengthening of the role of the United Nations and to respect for the \nprinciples of its Charter, which is a prerequisite for the advent of a new \norder based on justice for all and on peace, prosperity and international \nsolidarity. \n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate Mr. Ganev on his unanimous \nelection to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General \nAssembly. We are certain that his diplomatic skills and considerable \nexperience will lead us to historic conclusions. \nI also wish to pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Samir S. Shihabi, \nPermanent Representative of Saudi Arabia, for the excellent manner in which he \npresided over the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. \nIn his short time in office our Secretary-General, \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has inspired our confidence that he has the \nqualities essential to perform the duties of chief executive of the United \nNations. I take this opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment to \nthis high office last year. I assure him of the continued cooperation of the \nCommonwealth of the Bahamas during this session of the General Assembly, as he \nleads a United Nations challenged to reaffirm its fundamental purposes and \nprinciples, and obliged to redefine its role and function in this world of \nunprecedented change. \nThe Bahamas warmly welcomes those States that have joined the United \nNations since our last session of the General Assembly. \nIn just six days on 12 October we who live in the Western Hemisphere \nwill mark the five-hundredth anniversary of the encounter between the old \nworld and the new, which comes at a most pivotal time in modern history. It \nall began on one of the many islands of the Bahamas, now called San Salvador, \nand we are pleased to mark this historic occasion. \nOn a number of occasions during that 500-year interval these worlds \nreferred to as East and West have encountered each other in angry and even \nbloody disagreement, and sometimes those disagreements have resulted in a cold \nseparation of peoples, countries and cultures. \nThe quincentennial presents an opportunity and an invitation to East and \nWest to re-enact that initial encounter in a way that is relative and \nmeaningful to the nations and the cultures of the twentieth and the \ntwenty-first centuries for mutual benefit and for global preservation. \nThe present-day inhabitants of the Bahamas, like those of 1492, are a \npeace-loving and hospitable people. Small though we are in population, we \nfirmly believe in the significance of the role we can play in achieving the \npeaceful coexistence of nations and environmental preservation. In that \nbelief, I extend a warm and cordial invitation to all the nations represented \nhere to come and see and experience the peace and tranquillity of the country \nwhere that encounter took place 500 years ago. \nToday I address the Assembly on behalf of the Government and the people \nof the Commonwealth of the Bahamas to reaffirm our commitment to the \npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to pledge my \nGovernment's cooperation as we seek to ensure that our Organization maintains \nits objectives and enhances its effectiveness in international affairs. \nThe winds of political change, stirred by the innate desire of the \nelectorate for democratic representation and the concomitant responsibility of \nthose elected, did not bypass the Bahamas. The Bahamian people once again \ndemonstrated their long tradition of, and unswerving commitment to, the \ndemocratic process when in the most dramatic yet tranquil manner, in the words \nof Aldous Huxley, a \\\"brave new world\\\" was ushered into the lives of Bahamians, \nand a new administration, the Government of the Free National Movement (FNM), \nwas democratically elected only seven weeks ago, on 19 August. That signal \nevent heralded a new era in Bahamian history. It is a reinvigorated Bahamas \nthat is now poised to take its place in this emerging new political arena. \nOur vision is of a world free of tension, thus enabling us to deliver to \nour people a new kind of freedom and social and economic justice. \nThis year natural disasters have occurred worldwide, exacting high tolls \non human life and the destruction of property and natural resources. \nJust recently the Bahamas endured the ravages of Hurricane Andrew, which \ncaused severe damage $250 million-worth to several islands of the Bahamas, \nresulting in a tragic loss of life and leaving more than 1,200 persons \nhomeless. \nI wish on behalf of my Government to thank all those countries and \ninternational organizations, as well as many, many individual friends, for \ncoming to the aid of the Bahamas as we begin the task of reconstruction. At \nthe same time, we extend our sympathy to the Governments and people of the \nUnited States of America, China, Nicaragua and Pakistan for the devastation \nand loss of life inflicted upon their countries by recent natural disasters. \nAll our countries face potential natural hazards. But natural hazards, \nno matter how great, need not result in natural disasters. We often spend too \nmuch time and money recovering from disasters and too little on prevention. \nWidespread upheavals and conflicts, within States and between States, \nhave been responsible for the mass movement of persons from one country to the \nother. This phenomenon not only threatens the security and stability of the \naffected countries, but also creates competing demands for attention and vital \nresources. This Organization must not be perceived as selective in mediating \nproblems of a political nature, nor as elevating the suffering of one group of \npeople over that of another. \nIn our region, the critical situation in Haiti demands urgent \ninternational attention. \nAlmost two years ago, the people of Haiti spoke for democracy. But the \nunconstitutional seizure of power by the military has subverted the popular \nwill. The great expectations which the world had for Haiti under a \ndemocratically elected Government were dashed. Political unrest, economic \ndeprivation and poverty have caused a mass exodus of its people, who are \nfleeing their homeland in unprecedented numbers and thereby placing an \nunacceptably high burden on neighbouring countries, particularly the Bahamas. \nI now make a plea for the people of Haiti. We call on the international \ncommunity to come to the aid of Haiti. \nIt must be appreciated that no matter how grave our disillusionments over \nthe plight of the Haitian people, no matter how solicitous our efforts to \nunderstand and to help, and no matter how expansive our Christian charity in \nthis whole unfortunate affair, the Bahamas has a priority responsibility for \nthe welfare of the Bahamian people. \nIn the comprehensive Manifesto on which the Governing Party in the \nBahamas was swept into power in August this year, we reaffirmed our commitment \nto that priority, and it is necessary that our sister nations in this \nOrganization fully understand the Bahamas' position on the matter. \nFor almost three decades the Bahamas has been subjected to this serious \nproblem of illegal Haitian immigration. The presence of large numbers of \nillegal immigrants in the Bahamas has created unexpected demands on the \ncountry's economic, health and welfare agencies. This situation cannot \ncontinue, and the Bahamas :an no longer afford to be penalized by the \nsituation simply because of our geographical position. \nThe Bahamas supports the efforts of the Organization of American States \n(OAS) to negotiate a settlement to the situation in Haiti. Fully appreciative \nof the practical limits to action by the OAS, the Bahamas advocates and \nsupports United Nations efforts aimed at strengthening OAS initiatives and \nfinding a solution to this problem. \nThe Bahamas wishes to place on record its deep appreciation for the \ncontinuing assistance which the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \nfor Refugees has rendered to us in the difficulties caused us by this \nproblem. We implore all concerned to continue to pursue all peaceful means to \nreach a comprehensive settlement of the Haitian situation. \nI should also like to decry the problems of drug abuse, drug trafficking \nand the illicit production of drugs, which continue to haunt the international \ncommunity with their catastrophic effects on our individual societies. \nThe creation of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme \nhas been our most recent collective step to strengthen, improve and \nrationalize the legal and institutional framework for control of the \nproduction, trafficking and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic \nsubstances. My Government wishes to affirm its support for the Programme and \nits efforts in providing valuable assistance to countries fighting this menace. \nHowever, a most significant element in the fight against the drug trade \nis the requisite cooperation between States. My Government pledges to \ncontinue its collaboration with our neighbours to fight against the drug \nmenace. In this regard, we wish to thank the Governments of the United States \nof America and Canada for the assistance they have rendered to the Bahamas. \nThe world breathed a sigh of relief earlier this year when it appeared \nthat talks between the Government of South Africa and the African National \nCongress gave promise of establishing a political solution to the problems of \nSouth Africa. The Bahamas deeply regrets that the process of dialogue has \nbeen interrupted. We condemn the massacre at Boipatong and other massacres of \ninnocent civilians, as we equally condemn the efforts by the South African \nGovernment to delay the realization of majority rule in South Africa. \nThe United Nations has been a critical force in opposing the abhorrent \nsystem of apartheid in South Africa and in moving that country towards a \nnon-racial, unitary and democratic society. The role of the United Nations is \neven more critical since the lifting of sanctions by many influential States. \nThe United Nations must not fail the people of South Africa at this critical \nmoment. My country strongly supports the phased lifting of sanctions agreed \nby States members of the Commonwealth, and it firmly supports the effort that \nthe United Nations is making to encourage the resumption of negotiations \ntowards a new constitution for South Africa and ending the violence which \nthreatens a total disruption of these negotiations. \nThe Earth Summit held in Rio in June of this year was a historic \nbeginning. The fact that wore than 118 world leaders attended is a measure of \nthe seriousness with which the global community is viewing the question of the \nenvironment. \nIt is perhaps a trite truism to observe that the survival of the human \nfamily depends to a great extent on how this generation protects the natural \nenvironment. The positive results achieved by the Summit were due in large \nmeasure to the cooperation fostered by the United Nations. Real success, \nhowever, will be judged by the abilities of countries to carry out programmes \nat the national level. Tins can come about only when national capacities are \nstrengthened and additional resources are available. We must therefore \ncontinue to maintain the vision and basic principles of multilateral \ncooperation. \nThe Bahamas therefore welcomes the decision to establish a United Nations \ncommission on sustainable development to monitor the follow-up action after \nRio. The Bahamas, an archipelagic State of pristine aquamarine water, with a \nvibrant tourist industry, is committed to the protection of its own natural \nenvironment as well as the promotion of the global environment. My Government \nsees eco-tourism as a powerful instrument for sustainable development of the \nBahamas, and we are fully committed to protection of the environment. The \nBahamas therefore gives its assurance that it will scrupulously abide by the \nconventions signed at Rio, and its commitment to sustainable development \nremains absolute. \nThe World Economic Survey of 1992 indicates that world output has \ndeclined for the first time since the Second World War. World trade has \nexperienced slow growth. Countries continue to wrestle with economic \nrecession and the decline in world financial markets. Failure to complete the \nUruguay Round of negotiations will undoubtedly lead to increased \nprotectionism. These are areas of concern to us all, as are the uncertainties \nprevailing in world markets with regard to the future course of interest \nrates. These introduce many constraints on investment capital flows and \nconsequently on the growth of developing countries in particular. \nIn spite of all these problems and uncertainties, the performance of the \nworld economy can be improved through the enhancement of international \ncooperation and policy coordination, which must now be a principal objective \nof the United Nations. \nThe United Nations has become the centre of a diplomatic revolution, one \nthat mirrors the revitalization of national political institutions in many \ncountries. Fundamental changes not only promise greater personal freedom and \nmore dynamic societies, but frequently provide new challenges which create \nuncertainty in international relations. The United Nations will have to adopt \na new strategy for addressing these challenges. \nToday, we live in a world of much lowered ideological tension, a world in \nwhich representative democracy is of fundamental importance. Indeed, the \nrenewal in many parts of the world of the democratic process implies greater \nrespect for human rights. In that regard, the United Nations must play a \ncatalytic role in ensuring that human rights are assured. \nWe have also come better to understand the relationship between respect \nfor human rights and our search for economic and social development, and we \nmust measure that development by actual improvements in human lives and not \nexclusively in monetary terms. \nWe are hopeful that the greatly changed international environment and the \nrenewal of interest worldwide in human rights will contribute to the success \nof the World Conference on Human Rights scheduled for 1993. In this regard my \nGovernment has undertaken to give early consideration to all of the human \nrights conventions to which the Bahamas is not yet a party, including the \nCovenants relating to economic, social and political rights. \nThe pace of change in international politics is straining mankind's \ncapabilities of assimilation and assessment. In Western Europe the outlines of \nsuper-nationalism have become visible. In Central Europe the echoes of history \nare heralded again after more than 40 years of silence. And in Eastern Europe \ncommunism is in full-scale retreat under the implacable pressure of the \nrecognition of its limitations and of rising expectations. In Asia countries \nthat could scarcely feed themselves a generation ago have become tigers of \neconomic competition. Meantime, the spectre of famine remains over the Horn \nof Africa, demonstrating that not all change is positive. Almost everywhere \npluralistic democratic values are surfacing and tending to dominate. \nIn a world of tinder, fire-breaks are needed. The United Nations \npeace-keeping operations can be considered just such fire-breaks. The support \nof the international community, both political and material, remains an \nessential characteristic of peace-keeping operations, regardless of their \nsize. Political support by Governments can mean the difference between a \nparty's compliance with the terms of an agreement and serious infractions that \njeopardize lives and progress towards peace. \nThe price of United Nations peace-keeping is, by monetary standards, a \nbargain. But the United Nations is more than just good value. The \ncontributions of the membership are certainly a more cost-effective and humane \nsolution to international disputes than the conflict and human suffering that \noccur when States feel that they are unable, or are unwilling, to use the \nmachinery offered by the United Nations and resort to war. \nWe welcome the recent pronouncements of the Presidents of the \nUnited States of America and of the Russian Federation of 17 June 1992 to \nreduce their nuclear arsenals below the numbers agreed to last summer during \nthe Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty Talks (START) and their joint statement on \nchemical weapons in which they reiterated their commitment to the global \nelimination of such weapons. The recently concluded negotiations on a \nconvention banning chemical weapons is a further important step forward in \ncurtailing the use of weapons of mass destruction. Further progress in this \narea will be determined by the political will of Member States, their \ncommitment to their obligations under existing disarmament agreements, and the \nmore recent agreements, such as the United Nations universal and \nnon-discriminatory Register of Conventional Arms, which became operational on \n1 January 1992. The Bahamas remains totally committed to general and complete \ndisarmament. \nThe bedrock for action by the United Nations lies in States adhering to, \nand consistently applying, the principles of the Charter. It costs money to \nput principles into practice. Expanded responsibilities translate into greater \ncosts, which must be borne by the States Members of the Organization. \nIn the coming decade it is vital to use in the most effective and \nefficient manner this Organization, which has demonstrated the importance of \nits promotional and catalytic role, particularly in bringing to the surface \nissues which are likely to assume importance in coming years. \nThe creation of a stable and more favourable international environment is \nfundamental to the strengthening of multilateral policy coordination within an \nenhanced framework, especially if we are to realize our new vision for an \nimproved new world order. This requires the collective resolve of the giant \nnations as well as of tiny nations, such as the Bahamas, to work together to \nremove constraints and to allow for optimum growth and development. The new \nworld order can be lasting only if all constituent elements grow in harmony. \nA multilateral, concerted and comprehensive approach is vital for the \nimplementation of effective and lasting solutions to global problems. \nAs I noted at the outset, this year's commemoration of the quincentennial \nin the Bahamas and in the Western hemisphere offers a unique opportunity to \nmake real and meaningful and mutually beneficial that original encounter of \nthe old and new worlds. There are those who condemn that encounter but \nColumbus did come and as a result a medley of old and new cultures and \ncivilizations emerged. \nIt was fitting that with the coming into being of the United Nations in \nSan Francisco in 1945 the Preamble to our Charter reaffirmed our determination \nto save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and our faith in \nfundamental human rights, and established conditions under which justice and \nrespect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of \ninternational law should be maintained. \nIn those 47 years, many swords have been beaten into plowshares, and many \nspears into pruning hooks. It is now left for us to make abidingly true the \nend of that refrain, that nation shall not lift up sword against nation, \nneither shall we learn war any more. "

        "file_text": "\nFirst, I wish to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to this \nimportant post. The fact that a representative of Bulgaria has assumed this \npost at the head of the Assembly at precisely this time is a sign of the \nimportance that the world community attaches to the peaceful democratic \nrevolution in Eastern Europe. And we are proud that our countries, linked by \nties of traditional friendship, are treading this path together. \nThe democratic movement has prevailed in the cold war. For the first \ntime in history unprecedented opportunities have opened up for the \nimplementation of the principles proclaimed by the United Nations. \n\nThe post-confrontational and post-communist world is not a \npax Sovietica. a pax Americana, a pax Islamica or a pax Christiana, nor is it \na monopolistic system of any kind, but rather the multipolar unity in \ndiversity that the United Nations has symbolized from the very outset. \nFor the present, such a world is only a possibility yet to be realized \nthrough our joint efforts. Realism leaves no room for euphoria. A difficult \nperiod of transition lies ahead. But realism compels us to reject any \nalternative to the democratic choice. \nRussia, which has rejected communism, has, perhaps more than any other \ncountry, learned from its own experience that there can be no alternative to \ndemocratic development; our country voted for democracy during the first \nnation-wide presidential election in its history, and defended it at the \nbarricades around the Moscow White House. Neither the President, nor the \nGovernment, nor the majority of Parliament, nor the country at large will turn \naside from the path of reform, no matter how difficult it may prove. \nTotalitarianism robbed Russia both of its unique identity and of the \npossibility of self-fulfilment in its relations with other nations. Through \nits self-imposed isolation, the richest country of Eurasia became the sick man \nof Europe and Asia. In contrast, only an open society and a policy of \nopenness will enable Russia to find and play to the fullest extent its unique \nand historic role. \nThis policy has its roots in an age-old Russian idea. Back in the \nthirteenth century Saint Alexander Nevsky, one of the founders and defenders \nof the Russian State, said: \\\"God is to be found not in power but in truth\\\". \n\nToday this is the policy of the true national interests of the Russian \nState as a normal rather than an aggressive great Power, as one that \nrecognizes and shoulders its responsibilities as a permanent member of the \nSecurity Council. \nThe basic elements of this policy are as follows: partnership and \nalliance for democracy and a dynamic market economy with countries that share \nthese values; good-neighbourly relations with all neighbouring States; \ncomprehensive strengthening of the Commonwealth of Independent States, \nstrategic partnership with Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and all \nother countries created in the place of the former Soviet Union; and \nsolidarity and mutually advantageous cooperation with all the members of the \nworld community. \nRussia intends to act in support of United Nations efforts to address \nthe twofold task of the democratization of societies and the renewal of \ninternational relations. This is consonant with the concluding statement of \nthe summit meeting of the Security Council, with Secretary-General \nBoutros Boutros-Ghali's report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" and with the first \nstatements already made from this rostrum. Russia is ready to give practical \nsupport to the proposals made yesterday by George Bush, President of the \nUnited States. \nFirst of all, it is necessary to extinguish armed conflicts. \nThe Russian Federation will increase its efforts to eliminate conflicts \ninherited from the past in the territory of the former USSR, bearing in mind \nthe special interest and responsibility of Russia in strengthening the \ncivilized principles of the United Nations and the Conference on Security and \nCooperation in Europe (CSCE) in this part of the world. \n\nRussia supports the participation of the new independent States in these \ntwo organizations and other international forums. We welcome their \nrepresentatives in this Hall. \nWe categorically reject imperialistic ambitions, diktat and violence, \nboth in the area of the former USSR and in other parts of the world. Should \npolitical means fail, force can and should be used to separate the warring \nsides, to protect human rights and humanitarian missions and to restore peace \nin strict conformity with the Charter of the United Nations. \nAgreements for cease-fires and for the establishment of peace-keeping \nforces, concluded with Russian participation, are already in effect in \nOssetia, the Dniester region and Abkhazia, where Russian soldiers are carrying \nout their peace-keeping duties. Together with CSCE, we will strive to end the \nwar and bring peace to Karabakh and to secure the integrity of Tajikistan and \nbring national reconciliation to that country. In all those efforts we count \non continued active cooperation with the United Nations. \nWe support efforts aimed at forcing Iraq to implement the decisions of \nthe United Nations and ensuring at the same time the territorial integrity and \nthe peaceful nature of that State. For that purpose, Russia has sent two \nnaval vessels to the Persian Gulf. \nWe also must ensure that the demands of the Security Council are \ncomplied with by all the Yugoslav sides and must enable them to maintain \ncontact with the United Nations. A Russian infantry battalion is serving \nhonourably with the United Nations forces in Yugoslavia. \nI agree with the preceding speaker concerning the need to support the \nefforts of Mr. Panic for the practical implementation of the intentions he has \ndeclared. \n \nRussia will continue to cooperate actively with the other permanent \nmembers of the Security Council and with all the parties concerned in \norder to seize the opportunity for a peaceful settlement in the Middle \nEast, Cambodia, Angola and other areas of conflict. \nWe have no doubt that it is the task of the United Nations to combat \nviolence with force based on law, with its potential for enforcing peace. \nThe Blue Helmets should take action in response even when they are fired \nupon. \nIt is time to strengthen the capacity of the Security Council to \ntake swift and decisive action in humanitarian emergency situations \narising from mass violations of human rights and inter-ethnic clashes, \nincluding those within national borders. \n\nIt is important to strengthen the preventive component of United Nations \nactivities. This includes the establishment of hot lines to United Nations \nHeadquarters, the submission of intelligence information to the \nSecretary-General and the further development of fact-finding. \nEnhanced United Nations efforts to safeguard human rights and the rights \nof national minorities are also a priority. In the past it was chiefly the \nvictims of totalitarian regimes and ideologies who needed protection. What is \nincreasingly needed now is to combat the aggressive nationalism that is \nemerging as the new global threat. \nThe replacement of ideological intolerance with national and religious \nintolerance would threaten the world which is increasingly becoming one \nworld - with rifts just as serious and with national, regional and global \ncatastrophes. Democratic Russia categorically rejects any form of chauvinism, \nbe it Russophobia or anti-Semitism. \nWe feel special concern at the growing discriminatory practices against \nRussians, Ukrainians, Jews and all other non-indigenous nationalities in some \nof the new States that have emerged in the territory of the former USSR, \nparticularly in Estonia and Latvia. A situation in which 42 per cent of the \npopulation of the Estonian Republic are disenfranchised is totally \ninconsistent with international law. \nWe have raised and will continue to raise these issues in the United \nNations and other forums. We have the right to do so, among other reasons, \nbecause the countries in question won their independence, to a substantial \nextent, through the triumph of the democrats in Russia. The practices I have \nreferred to can in no way be justified by invoking the problem, inherited from \nthe USSR, of the withdrawal of armed forces from the Baltic States. We are \n\nalready working together to resolve that problem, and we intend to resolve it \nas soon as possible; however, due regard must also be given to the rights of \nthose who are in military uniform. \nIt would be appropriate to give thought to a joint interpretation of the \ninternational trusteeship system set forth in the Charter of the United \nNations, particularly since one of its basic objectives is and I quote the \nCharter - \\\"To encourage respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms \nfor all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\\\". That \nsystem has brought many nations to independence. Today national minorities \ndesperately need the trusteeship of the world community. \nThe fate of former Soviet servicemen taken prisoner in Afghanistan \nremains one of the gravest humanitarian problems. We call upon the General \nAssembly to proclaim its support for the urgent resolution of this problem. \nThe rejection of the game of \\\"nuclear roulette\\\" in favour of cooperation \nin the interests of strategic stability for all and with the participation of \nall States concerned is reflected in the agreements on further drastic cuts in \nstrategic offensive arms and on a global defense system reached in Washington \nby the Presidents of Russia and the United States of America. \nReaffirming its commitments under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons, the Russian Federation invites all countries that have not \nyet done so to join the Treaty as non-nuclear-weapon States. It is our belief \nthat all the former Republics of the USSR, including Ukraine, Belarus and \nKazakhstan, will do so. This step should be taken as soon as possible, since \nthe entry into force of the treaty on strategic offensive arms depends on it. \n\nWe expect that a sense of high responsibility and a readiness to reach \ncompromise solutions will prevail in the decisive phase of the approval of the \nConvention on the banning of chemical weapons. \nRussia is in favour of control, including control through the United \nNations, over international arms transfers, especially over offensive and \nhighly destructive weapons. The approach taken with respect to regimes that \ndisregard the standards of international law should be particularly strict. \nThere is an obvious need for the development of concrete \nmilitary-industry conversion programmes, not only through the efforts of \nindividual countries but also through the combined action of the international \ncommunity. The United Nations and its specialized agencies could play a \npioneering role in this endeavour. In the long run, real disarmament and the \nconversion of military industries to peaceful production will make it possible \nto release additional resources for the needs of development. \nBut development cannot be achieved without ensuring full political and \neconomic rights and freedoms, without releasing human creative potential in a \nmarket environment. Russia has learned this from its own experience. \nFor a successful solution of the problems of development, it is extremely \nimportant to strengthen the interaction between the United Nations and the \nBretton Woods institutions. Herein lies the key to the harmonization of the \nworld community's efforts in such areas as support of macroeconomic reforms \nand technical assistance and the provision of help in resolving social \nproblems. Both developing and developed countries will benefit from this. \nThe United Nations Conference at Rio de Janeiro reinforced the consensus \non the need to integrate development policies and environmental protection. \n\nThe task of renewing international relations calls for the \nrationalization of the United Nations itself and of the United Nations \nsystem. The desire of some States to play a more active role in the United \nNations is quite natural. The Charter provides ample scope for this. In \nparticular, the Charter permits the Security Council to establish auxiliary \nbodies in which many States would participate. We are convinced that the \nUnited Nations and other international organizations will play a growing role \nin regulating international relations. \nIn conclusion, I should like to address you, Mr. Secretary-General. \nRussia supports your efforts to bring about the settlement of international \ncrises, to improve the efficiency of the United Nations Secretariat and the \ncoordination of the activities of all international agencies. \nSupport of the United Nations presupposes the fulfilment of financial \nobligations to the Organization. Despite its economic difficulties, in the \nperiod from September of this year to March 1993 Russia will pay $130 million \nas partial payment of our arrears to the United Nations and an additional \n$30 million to other agencies. \nYour recent statements in Moscow, Mr. Secretary-General, have confirmed \nthe similarity of our vision of the great future of the United Nations. \n"

        "file_text": "First of all, let \nme convey to all members of the General Assembly the greetings of the people \nof Djibouti. \nI should like to take this opportunity to address to you, Mr. President, \nmy warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its forty-seventh session. I am convinced that you will guide our \ndeliberations in such a way as to bring them to a successful conclusion, and I \nwish you every success. \nThat was the case at last year's session, at which Mr. Samir Shihabi, \nAmbassador of a great fraternal country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, presided \nover the General Assembly. We are indebted to him for the important \nachievements in the field of restructuring and revitalizing the United \nNations. I should like to express to the former Permanent Representative, who \nis leaving us, our best wishes for the future. \nI should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the son of Africa \nand the Arab world, my brother and friend Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, \nSecretary-General of the United Nations, for the dignified and enlighten way \nin which, for almost a year, he has been discharging his duties in the \nSecretariat. I wish to emphasize that my country fully appreciates the \nefforts Mr. Boutros-Ghali is making to find lasting solutions to the various \ncrises and wars throughout the world, thus promoting peace and international \ncooperation. \nMoreover, in his annual report on the activities of the Organization, the \nSecretary-General has highlighted the many vital issues before the United \nNations ranging from the Organization's financial crisis to its added \nresponsibilities as a result of the changes under way, which are sorely \ntesting the resources available to the Organization. \nIn this respect, the establishment by the Secretary-General of an \nadvisory group of eminent persons to study and formulate proposals to make the \nUnited Nations financially solvent seems to us to be an appropriate and timely \ninitiative. \nLastly, it is with great pleasure that I welcome the States which have \njoined the United Nations this year. \nThe end of the cold war has brought important issues into sharp focus, \nnamely, sovereignty, peace-keeping and democracy. National boundaries are \nfast collapsing and internal civil strife is growing with increasing intensity. \nThe changing context of the international political landscape and the \nconcomitant flareup of conflicts in many regions of the world are sufficient \nreason to reflect upon new ways and means to contain the evolving threats to \ninternational peace and security. In that regard, the Secretary-General's \nAgenda for Peace contains ideas and proposals such as the use of preventive \ndiplomacy, peace-keeping and peace-making; it deserves the fullest attention \nof the General Assembly. \nStates new and old are ravaged by ethnic and clan rivalries. The United \nNations therefore needs the unwavering support of the international community \nin order to be able to respond urgently, effectively and substantially to \nthese new phenomena of our time. Will the nascent democracies, in their weak \nand poorly equipped condition, be able to cope with urgent demands for \nmaterial improvement? And if they cannot deliver, could they not lose popular \nsupport? Democracy under relatively favourable conditions is obviously far \ndifferent both in theory and in practice indeed, in every respect from \ndemocracy in a country in a vicious circle of dependence, poverty and \ninstability. \nThe proliferation of political parties in a pluralistic system invariably \nleads to parties based on ethnicity. Clearly, there must be an alternative \nframework for these democracies suffering from dire economic conditions and \nfrom chronic problems of debt, disease, hunger and poverty. The Speaker of \nNamibia's National Assembly described the situation forthrightly: \n\\\"We have learned that once you have acquired a constitution and achieved \nthe goal of political independence and freedom, you will find that you \ncannot eat votes in a ballot box\\\". \nIn Africa and many countries elsewhere in the developing world, we see \npressure being exerted to reduce and disperse national sovereignty. This is a \ndangerous precedent in the new regional and international order that is \nemerging. In his address to the summit of non-aligned countries at Jakarta, \nthe Secretary-General forcefully expressed his apprehension, saying that \n\\\"Recent geopolitical changes are characterized by a greater degree \nof homogeneity in the world, which we welcome as a precious harbinger of \nconcord and unity. Yet neither decolonization nor the dismantling of the \nblocs has erased the phenomenon of power. Attempts to dominate, either \nworld-wide or regionally, remain. They continue to threaten the weakest \nand poorest States, which are still the most numerous in the world\\\". \nI share the view of the Secretary-General that the new world order must \nbe based on democracy in international relations, and that at the same time \neach of us, particularly the developing countries, must remain steadfast on \nthe fundamental principles of national sovereignty, non-intervention in the \ninternal affairs of a State, and international cooperation. \nIn my last address to this Assembly, on 21 September 1977, on the \noccasion of my country's admission to the United Nations, I described in \naddition to the joy we felt on acceding to our freedom my determination to \ncontribute to adherence to respect for human rights in the Horn of Africa. \nThat ambition was no doubt too lofty, or premature, for since then too many \nevents - often tragic have occurred; their harmful consequences show no sign \nof abatement. \nWe are aware of, and grateful for, the vital and essential role played by \nthe Secretary-General in bringing the question of Somalia squarely before the \nSecurity Council, in the signature of the cease-fire agreement concluded in \nNew York between hostile brothers, and in the deployment of United Nations \nforces to deliver humanitarian assistance. \nThus, to the international community, which has now made a massive \nresponse with humanitarian assistance, we convey all our gratitude and our \nsupport in this urgent task, which includes the restoration of civil peace and \nsecurity in Somalia. \nThe nightmarish sight of children breathing their last in their mothers' \nemaciated arms, and those equally unbearable images of women and old men who \nno longer have the strength even to walk or to show the least expression in \ntheir faces and whose death is already in their eyes, shocked us as they \nshocked the whole world. In the name of what might could a whole nation \ncondemn itself to self-destruction? The tragedy in Somalia is not inevitable; \nthat is to say, human stupidity sometimes causes more devastation than natural \ndisasters. While the world has belatedly come to realize the full extent of \nwhat is happening today in that country, there is nothing to indicate that \nthis tragedy will not claim more victims hundreds of thousands of them in \nthe months to come. \nSomalia as we knew it no longer exists. In the absence of national \ngovernment and central authority, the nation has been plunged into total \nanarchy. Indeed, it has returned to a state of veritable barbarism. \nThe differences involved have nothing to do with ideology or politics. \nIt is simply sheer, blind obsession with power. We clearly see the result of \nthe tenacity of the oppressive, tyrannical warlords and clans who have reduced \na whole country to rubble. \nSomalia, which has never in its history known such a famine or such a \ndisaster, needs all of us to save it from this apocalypse that has descended \non its people, victims of the folly and narrow-minded egotism of men. A whole \ncountry has been razed, reduced to rubble, by war, drought and famine. It is \na wasteland ruled by armed gangs of bandits and looters. death, human misery \nand abject poverty are rampant. \nProviding humanitarian assistance under such conditions of warfare is \nextremely dangerous. In Somalia's neighbouring countries, including Djibouti< \nthe Somali refugees are either in urban centres, straining already-limited and \nunderdeveloped resources, or in camps that are dangerously crowded, facing \nshortages of food and medical supplies. \nNobody can say with certainty how many people have already died, but at \nleast 1.5 million people, one-third of the population, are threatened with \nstarvation, children, women and old people being especially vulnerable. I can \nonly echo the desperation of a Red Cross official in Baidoa who said, \\\"We are \nin the middle of the tunnel, and we can't see the light yet.\\\" \nOur hearts go out to the personnel of the international humanitarian \norganizations who, despite the dangers, care for, feed and save the lives of \nthe innocent victims of this senseless fratricide. \nThe question before us today is not only how to save lives through the \ndelivery of sufficient food to end the famine or how to stop the senseless \nfighting. Rather, in a scenario like that of Somalia, the question is what \nthe United Nations, together with the international community, can devise \ncollectively to reorganize a new nation of Somalia. Let us make a commitment \ntoday that we are bound together by the purposes and principles enshrined in \nthe Charter not to let any country simply vanish from our midst! \nThere is another persistent crisis which continues to shock us all, \nnamely, the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The entire world is horrified \nat the war being waged in that very young republic. For several months now, \nthe country has been facing armed aggression from outside. The efforts made \nto date by the international community to halt the aggression by Serbia and \nMontenegro by political and economic means and to settle this crisis \npeacefully have been in vain. It is, on the contrary, becoming more and more \nevident that the Serbian authorities are using this conflict to carry out a \npolicy of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\". \nIf peace is to prevail in that region, all the provisions of the \nagreement reached at the London Conference must be implemented immediately. \nAnd if hostilities still continue, we call on the international community to \nimplement all the provisions of the Security Council resolutions concerning \nrecourse to all necessary measures, including military force, to come to the \naid of that martyred country. \nDjibouti is addressing the Organization today at a time when it is in the \nprocess of overcoming a war that has been imposed upon it. It will succeed, \nthanks to the unfailing attachment of Djiboutians to their homeland and their \nwill to live together in peace; thanks to the support of fraternal and \nfriendly countries, and thanks, lastly, to the continued assistance of the \nUnited Nations in defence of our right to sovereignty, independence and peace. \nSince its accession to independence, on 27 June 1977, the Republic \nof Djibouti has had to face not only complex problems of economic and \nsocial development, but also and above all - the negative impact on its \nprecarious socio-economic infrastructure of the constant, destabilizing \nwars in the region. \nDevastation is never confined to the geographical area of one \ncountry or one subregion; it extends across frontiers and endangers the \nstability of neighbouring countries, whose populations are, in most cases, \nof the same origin. \nThis is precisely what is happening in Djibouti, whose population is \nincreasing daily as a result of the continual influx of men, women and \nchildren with no alternative but to abandon their country for a more \nhospitable environment. For many months now Djibouti has been playing \nhost to an alarming number of refugees and displaced persons. I therefore \nfeel compelled to look to the future needs of our State, which cannot \nindefinitely share its meagre resources without risking to the adverse \nreactions of the community whose interests it has a duty to safeguard. \nWhile we have been struggling through this difficult ordeal the \ninternational community, rather than relieving and helping us, has \nunfortunately perceived the problem only from the purely humanitarian \nstandpoint, thus disregarding the negative consequences for the entire \nsocial and economic life of my country. \nIn response to the egalitarian ideas we have been hearing for many \nyears, which originate from beyond our frontiers, my Government has been \nconstantly engaged in examining all possibilities which might lead to the \nrestoration of peace. It has also pursued a process leading to the \nestablishment of new institutions, which were put to the judgement of the \nvoters at the beginning of this month. \nThe response of the people was astonishingly clear. The vote was \npreceded by a law instituting a general amnesty relating to events during \nthe period characterized by the de facto partition, brought about on the \ninitiative of a negligible portion of the population. They had \nconsiderable foreign reinforcements, who came from not very far away, and \nwhose motives, as well as the origin of the resources they received, were \nnot hard to ascertain. \nSome may consider that this is only a phase, despite the \nintroduction of a multiparty system and the fixing of dates for the people \nto choose their representatives at all levels of political life. I \nbelieve that I have reason to hope that, with the understanding of \nfriendly countries, the support of international organizations, the good \nwill of our people and the help of the Almighty, our nation can look to a \nfuture full of possibilities and with renewed hope. \nThe serious recent events in South Africa in particular, the \nBoipatong massacre on 17 June 1992 and more recently the killing of 28 \ndemonstrators show the extent to which violence is still the order of \nthe day. The refusal of the South African authorities to control that \nviolence is casting a shadow over the progress made in South Africa's \npolitical life and is disrupting the process of peaceful change which the \nmajority of the South African people so earnestly desire. \nThere is no alternative to negotiations for peaceful change in South \nAfrica. To this end, the international community will have to continue to \nput pressure on the authorities in Pretoria to take the energetic measures \nrequired to contain once and for all the forces opposed to the elimination \nof apartheid. To do this, they must create a climate of security \nconducive to the resumption of dialogue for the emergence of a united, \ndemocratic and non-racial South Africa. \nWe welcome the deployment of United Nations observers, who I hope \nwill help to avoid further massacres and to relaunch a constructive \ndialogue between the Government and the majority of the South African \npopulation. \nAll of our attention has been focused on the initiatives and efforts \nunder way in Washington to promote a credible peace that will lead to a \njust and comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli crisis. In welcoming \nthose developments, Djibouti pays tribute to the Government of the United \nStates of America and to all those contributing to the establishment of a \njust and lasting peace in that part of the Middle East. \nNevertheless, the following are essential conditions for peaceful \ncoexistence among the peoples of the region; the self-determination of the \nPalestinian people; a total freeze on settlements; the abandonment of all \nrepressive policies and practices against the population of the occupied \nterritories; and the withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied \nsince June 1967, including East Jerusalem. \nLike all nations of the world, the Arabs want peace. They have \ndemonstrated this desire and proved it time and again through a series of \ngoodwill gestures and indeed through substantial major compromises in the \ncurrent negotiating framework. This wisdom and this openness of mind have not \nto date been reciprocated by compatible language. What the Arabs are calling \nfor is comprehensive and genuine talks that fully and seriously address the \nkey issues of peace, land and security. Let us see if Israel will start once \nand for all to negotiate in good faith. Let us see if it will move in tandem \nwith the propitious international political climate. By continually demanding \nmore security and more concessions while the status quo over territory and \npeace persists, Israel is simply squandering a precious moment. It is high \ntime that reason prevailed over age-old hatred, acrimony, injustice and \nobstinacy. \nIn his annual report on the work of the Organization, the economic \nsituation in the world in general and, in particular, the constant \ndeterioration of the economies of most of the developing countries, the \nSecretary-General amply illustrates the bleak economic situation that exists \nin most of the world. Although the responsibility for solving economic \nproblems at the national level rests in the first place with the countries \nconcerned, no national effort, however forceful it may be, can be viably \nsustained unless it is undertaken within the framework of a responsibility \nshared with the international community and, even more important, unless it is \nbacked by appropriate arrangements, a favourable environment and effective \ninternational assistance. \nThe task facing the Africans is complex and of considerable scope. It \nwill call for great efforts, indeed sacrifices, on our part. In this respect \nthe new programme for the development of Africa in the 1990s, which is a \ncontract between Africa and its international partners, merits the support of \nthe international community. \nI cannot disregard the fact that the impressive changes we have mentioned \nhave taken place against a background of rising levels of poverty among vast \nsectors of the world's population. Redefining international cooperation for \ndevelopment must consequently be the new priority of the multilateral \nprogramme. It is thus essential to define a broader approach to this \ncooperation, one which pays particular attention to the developing countries \nin general, and to the least developed countries in particular, with a view to \nachieving sustainable development. \nThe adoption of the Rio Declaration, Agenda 21 and the other agreements \nreached at the historic Rio Conference demonstrates that the international \ncommunity is prepared to work in partnership for the protection of the \nenvironment and the introduction of a development taking into account the \neconomic equilibrium of all. The \\\"Spirit of Rio\\\" has engendered great hopes \nfor the one billion human beings living in extreme deprivation. Now \neverything depends on the follow-up and implementation of the programmes \nagreed. \nThe new mechanisms and practical measures to be negotiated during this \nsession of the General Assembly ought, in our view, to permit access by the \ndeveloping countries to technology and additional financial resources. We \nexpress the hope that the pledges to finance the objectives of Agenda 21 will \nbe commensurate with the task; the credibility of the international community \nis at stake. The new commission on sustainable development, soon to be \nestablished, will have to provide the necessary infusion of energy and \ninstitute bold policies that will enable us to face the attendant challenges. \nIn conclusion, we in the Republic of Djibouti are confidently awaiting \nthe day when all the peoples of the Horn of Africa will have overcome the \nspectre of famine and poverty and will live in peace and prosperity.

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to extend to you. \nSir, my sincere congratulations on your unanimous election as President of the \nforty-seventh session of the General Assembly. To your distinguished \npredecessor. Ambassador Shamir S. Shihabi, I should like to convey our deep \nappreciation for the exemplary manner in which he presided over the last \nsession. \nI am also pleased to see our eminent Secretary-General, \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, by your side. His incisive analysis of the \nimpediments to the realization of the full potential' of the United Nations and \nhis recommendations on how to strengthen its capacity to maintain peace, \nsecure independence and justice and foster generalized prosperity in the \nworld, as contained in his report entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277), \ndo indeed deserve our serious consideration. \nWe welcome the new Members in our midst: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of \n\nMoldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Their \naccession to membership not only brings us ever closer to the goal of true \nuniversality of our Organization but also underscores the unflagging hope that \nhumanity reposes in this multilateral forum for resolving the global issues of \nour time. \nIt is my privilege and responsibility to bring to the Assembly a message \nfrom the developing countries belonging to the Non-Aligned Movement. I come \nhere from the Tenth Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Movement \nof Non-Aligned Countries, which Indonesia had the distinct honour to host \nearlier this month. It was the largest Non-Aligned Summit ever convened. \nI am honoured, therefore, to address the Assembly not only on behalf of \nthe 180 million people of Indonesia, but also on behalf of the Non-Aligned \nMovement, which has 108 members, representing the vast majority of humankind \nand close to two thirds of the members of the Assembly. \n\nOn behalf of the leaders of the Movement, whose consensus views were \nsummed up in what has come to be known as the Jakarta message, may I \nconvey to the Assembly the gist of that message. \nAs a political coalition encompassing more sovereign States than has \nany other grouping in history, we shall not be mere spectators nor agree \nto be on the sidelines of the currents of historical change now sweeping \nacross the globe. We commit ourselves to the shaping of a new \ninternational order free from war and poverty, intolerance and injustice, \na world order based on the principles of peaceful coexistence and genuine \ninterdependence, one that takes into account the diversity of the social \nsystems and cultures of the world. We pledge to seek that new \ninternational order through the central and irreplaceable instrumentality \nof the United Nations. \nHolding fast to the principles of the Movement as first articulated \nat Bandung 37 years ago, we affirm the fundamental rights of every human \nbeing and every nation to development, to social progress and to full \nparticipation in the shaping of their common destiny. Through dialogue \nand cooperation our Movement will seek to place itself as a vibrant, \nconstructive and interdependent component of the mainstream of \ninternational relations so that a new international order can take shape \non a truly universal basis, ensuring harmony, peace, justice and \nprosperity for all. \nThat is the essence of the Jakarta message. Permit me now to \nelaborate on a few points. \n\nThe comprehensive decisions and positions adopted by the tenth \nnon-aligned summit, as recorded in its final documents, constitute both a \nresponse and an initiative, a dynamic adaptation in the face of the \nchallenges and opportunities posed by the profound and radical \ndevelopments that have transformed the patterns of international \nrelationships. To a large extent the Non-Aligned Movement contributed to \nthese global transformations. The unrelenting drive that it imparted to \nthe world-wide decolonization process and to the struggle against racism \nhastened the demise of colonial empires, the rise of numerous newly \nindependent States and the retreat of the inhuman policy of apartheid. \nAnd yet the world today is still far from being peaceful, just and \nsecure. Simmering disputes, violent conflicts, aggression and foreign \noccupation, interference in the internal affairs of States, policies of \nhegemony and domination, ethnic strife, religious intolerance, new forms \nof racism and narrowly conceived nationalism continue to obstruct the \nbuilding of harmonious coexistence between States and peoples and have \neven led to the disintegration of States and societies. A profoundly \nanguishing example is that of the former Socialist Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia, whose break-up has led to the formation of separate, \nindependent States, three of which, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and \nSlovenia, have since become Members of the United Nations. \nOn these explosive and tragic crises in various parts of the world \nour Movement has taken a clear stand. We have called for speedy and \nresolute action to end the carnage in Bosnia and Herzegovina and condemned \nthe massive atrocities and violations of human rights being committed \n\nagainst the people of that Republic, especially its Muslim population. We \nhave also condemned the repugnant policy of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", reaffirmed \nthe inadmissibility of aggression and of acquisition of territory by \nforce, and called for full respect for the sovereignty, independence, \nterritorial integrity and cultural identity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \nWe have launched collective action to help alleviate the immense \nsuffering of the people of Somalia and to play a critical role in the \nsearch for a comprehensive solution to the fratricidal conflict in that \nland. \nWe have reiterated our unflinching support for the struggle of the \nPalestinian people, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization (PLO), to realize their inalienable right to self-\ndetermination, independence and sovereign statehood in their own \nhomeland. We call on the world community to prevail upon Israel to \ncontribute to the search for peace through the implementation of the \nSecurity Council resolutions that provide for the withdrawal of Israel \nfrom all occupied Palestine and Arab lands. And once again we stress the \nimperative need to end the universally condemned system of apartheid, once \nand for all, and of establishing a non-racial, democratic and united South \nAfrica. \nHaving welcomed the end of the Gulf War and the restoration of \nKuwait's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, we have \nurged the commencement of a process of reconciliation that will finally \nheal the wounds of war and restore stable peace and harmonious cooperation \nin that region. \n\nWhile we rejoiced at the establishment of the transitional \ngovernment of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, the tenth summit noted \nwith regret that the process towards national reconciliation and the \nestablishment of a permanent government through free and fair elections is \nstill marred by continuing internecine strife. We hope that these \nobstacles will soon be overcome so that peace can be restored and national \nreconstruction can commence. \nOn Cambodia, we have reiterated our confidence in the \ndetermination and capability of the Cambodian people, under the leadership \nof Prince Samdech Norodom Sihanouk and the members of the Supreme National \nCouncil, with the assistance of the United Nations Transitional Authority \nin Cambodia (UNTAC), to uphold the Paris Agreements in their balanced \ntotality. We remain convinced that the Paris Agreements are still the \nbest basis for the achievement of a comprehensive, just and durable peace \nin Cambodia, based on national reconciliation and reconstruction. Only \nthrough their strict implementation will it be possible to bring to an end \nthe protracted war that has inflicted unspeakable suffering and \ndevastation on the Cambodian people. \n\nA world caught in the throes of pervasive change and transition is \nbasically an unstable and unpredictable world. The Movement has therefore \nresolved to intensify its efforts in the field of disarmament. While it is \ntrue that there has been encouraging progress in limiting nuclear and \nconventional armaments, the disarmament agenda is still largely unfinished. A \nnuclear-weapon-free world has always been the vision of our movement, for \nuntil it is achieved this threat to human survival will continue to cast its \nshadow over all other endeavours and aspirations. We have urged accelerated \nefforts on other priority disarmament issues, particularly the prohibition of \nall weapons of mass destruction. \nBesides posing an acute danger to world peace and security, the \ncontinuing global arms race and unbridled military spending also constitute a \nhuge drain on national economies and on the world economy. Our Movement has \nconsistently maintained that the resources released through disarmament and \narms reduction should be redirected towards the social and economic \ndevelopment of all countries, especially the developing countries. The \nestablishment of this productive linkage between disarmament and development \nwill also make it possible to attain security at lower levels of armament. \nWe should now recognize that peace and security depend as much on \nsocio-economic factors as on military ones. Sharply reduced prospects for \neconomic and social advancement, large-scale unemployment, abject poverty, \nmassive cross-border migrations and severe environmental degradation also \nendanger peace. We cannot hope to attain comprehensive security and stable \npeace without making substantive progress in the war against poverty, \nunderdevelopment, disease and social injustice. \n\nThat is why it should deeply concern us that the world economy is mired \nin sluggish and uneven growth. With few exceptions, developing countries are \nexperiencing stagnation or vastly inadequate growth rates, with the most \nvulnerable ones slumping into sharp decline. Most alarming is the prolonged \ncritical situation in Africa where the plight of millions requires speedy and \ndecisive action. Africa deserves our special attention. \nDeveloping countries in general are severely hampered by an unfavourable \nexternal economic environment characterized by inadequate access to \ntechnology, unabated protectionism, historically low prices for commodities \nand raw materials, severely contracted financial flows and the crushing burden \nof external debt, resulting in reverse financial flows to the developed \ncountries and the multilateral financial institutions. \nThe external debt crisis of the developing countries has intensified in \nmagnitude and global impact, and is being exacerbated by volatile \nexchange-rate fluctuations for the major currencies and by high interest \nrates. The debt-reduction schemes that have been tried are far from adequate; \nthey need to be broadened to include all kinds of debts and all categories of \ndebtors, including those that have made great efforts to meet their debt \nobligations. A differentiated approach should be adopted that would allow \ndebt cancellation for the least developed countries and more generous terms, \nin both debt servicing and new concessional loans, for lower-income developing \ncountries. Our Movement will continue to press for a coordinated and \ndevelopment-oriented approach to the solution of this problem that will bring \nrelief as well as allow for the recovery and continued growth of debtor \ncountries. \n\nEven global developments that appear to imply positive prospects could \nhave a negative impact on the developing countries. The transformation of \nCentral and Eastern European economies and the formation of powerful groupings \namong developed countries could deflect the focus from poverty alleviation in \ndeveloping countries and adversely affect their trade and growth prospects. \nParticularly lamentable is the continuing impasse in the Uruguay Round of \nmultilateral trade negotiations. The Non-Aligned Movement has therefore \ncalled on the developed countries to ensure without further delay a balanced, \nequitable and satisfactory conclusion of the Uruguay Round that would take \ninto account the interests of all parties, especially the development needs \nand concerns of the developing countries. \nWe, the non-aligned countries, realize too well that global problems are \ninterlinked, especially in the economic sphere. And because most of today's \nproblems are global in nature, they cannot be solved through short-term relief \nmeasures or through piecemeal reform. Hence, it is time the countries of both \nthe North and the South forged a new compact on development and a new \ndemocratic partnership in fashioning global solutions to these global \nproblems. Only in that way can we deliver the world economy from its present \ndisarray and do away with the inequitable international structures and \nmodalities that have resulted in deepening disparities and unacceptable \ninjustices in international economic relations and an inexorably widening \nprosperity and technology gap between the developed and the developing \ncountries. Only in .that way can we hope to restructure the international \neconomic system and international economic relations so as to make them more \nequitable and thus more viable. \n\nWe, the non-aligned countries, have therefore called for a revival of the \nconstructive dialogue between the North and the South. But this time the \ndialogue should be based on the imperative of genuine interdependence, \nmutuality of interests and of benefits, and shared responsibility, with the \npositions of each side clearly elaborated and presented, and rationally \ndiscussed and negotiated. Never before have the fate and fortunes of the \nNorth and the South been so inextricably intertwined. \n\nIn the absence of stability and development in the South, the North \ncannot hope to sustain its economic prosperity. Without a favourable global \nenvironment, which the policies of the North should provide, the South cannot \nachieve its development goals. Thus, common sense dictates the need for both \nsides to sit down and discuss how together they can manage the massive changes \nand challenges of the decades ahead. \nAt the same time, we have resolved to intensify South-South cooperation \non the basis of collective self-reliance. This is imperative, for South-South \ncooperation is vital for promoting our own development and for reducing undue \ndependence on the North. It is also an integral element in any strategy for \nthe attainment of a new and equitable international economic order. Towards \nthat end, we are initiating concrete cooperative ventures in such areas as \nfood security, population, trade and investment, and devising practicable \nmodalities for their implementation. By thus pooling the resources, expertise \nand experience of the South, we hope to translate the concept of collective \nself-reliance into reality. We invite the developed countries and the \nmultilateral financial institutions to support us in this endeavour, for it \nshould be clear that the fostering of expanded economic cooperation among the \ndeveloping countries will in turn impart added vitality to the growth and \nexpansion of the world economy as a whole and yield corresponding benefits to \nthe developed countries as well. \nA global concern that requires the heightened attention of the entire \ninternational community is the rapid degradation of the environment. We, the \nnon-aligned countries, welcome the results of the Conference held in Rio de \nJaneiro. They confirm the long-held conviction of our Movement that the \n\nissues of environment and development are inseparable and should be integrally \naddressed on the basis of equitably shared responsibility. The pursuit of \nenvironmentally sound and sustainable development will require a global \npartnership that will have to address the need of developing countries for \ncommensurate, additional financial resources and access to environmentally \nsound technology. Even more important is the effective implementation of the \nagreed policies, which will require constant monitoring and consistent \nfollow-through. In this context, we welcome the establishment of the \nhigh-level Commission on Sustainable Development. \nWe also believe that social development is no less vital than political \nand economic development. We therefore support the convening of a world \nsummit on social development which should place the social needs of people at \nthe heart of United Nations endeavours. The full and equal integration of \nwomen into the development process has always been a goal of the Non-Aligned \nMovement. Consequently, we shall fully cooperate in ensuring the success of \nthe World Conference on Women in 1995. We believe that all children should be \nraised with a standard of living that is adequate for their health and \nwell-being. We shall work to achieve that goal as a matter of moral \nimperative and commit ourselves to the full and effective implementation of \nthe Declaration and Plan of Action of the World Summit for Children. \nAt Jakarta, the non-aligned countries enunciated an unequivocal stand on \nhuman rights. Allow me to quote from the Jakarta Message: \n\\\"We reaffirm that basic human rights and fundamental freedoms are of \nuniversal validity. We welcome the growing trend towards democracy and \ncommit ourselves to cooperate in the protection of human rights. We \n\nbelieve that economic and social progress facilitates the achievement of \nthese objectives. No country, however, should use its power to dictate \nits concept of democracy and of human rights or to impose conditions on \nothers. In the promotion and protection of these rights, we emphasise \nthe inter-relatedness of the various categories, call for a balanced \nrelationship between individual and community rights, and uphold the \ncompetence and responsibility of national governments in their \nimplementation. The Non-Aligned Countries, therefore, shall coordinate \ntheir positions and actively participate in the preparatory work for the \nSecond World Conference on Human Rights in June 1993 in order to ensure \nthat the Conference addresses all aspects of human rights on the basis of \nuniversality, indivisibility, impartiality and non-selectivity.\\\" \nMoreover, it is our firm conviction that the objective of human rights is \nthe realization of the full potential of the human being, and human potential \nis not confined to the political field. The fundamental right to economic and \nsocial development, for example, cannot be separated and cannot be treated \nseparately from the other categories of human rights. These rights apply to \nnations as well as to individuals. Thus, every nation has the right to \ndetermine its own political and economic system and to preserve its cultural \nidentity as shaped by its own particular historical experience. \nThe advanced countries of the West have recently been vocal in calling \nfor democracy and good governance as an integral part of the development \nprocess, especially in the developing countries. Some are even inclined to \nmake it a new conditionality in development cooperation. The call for \ndemocratization and democratic reform in all countries is indeed valid, for it \n\nrelates directly to the basic aspirations of individuals and nations. But \ndemocracy is not a static concept limited to certain established forms and \npractices. Its basic principles and tenets are indeed of universal and \nimmutable validity. But no single model of democracy can be assumed to be of \nuniversal applicability, given the diversity of cultural values and historical \nexperiences of the nations of the world. \n\nMoreover, it would be a denial of the basic tenets of democracy if its \nvalues were to be strictly observed within nations while they are being \nignored among nations. Hence democracy and democratization are dynamic \nprocesses that should conform to the fundamental values of each nation and \nconstantly adapt to evolving realities in order to remain relevant and, more \nimportant, democratic. \nThese observations equally apply to the United Nations. That is why the \nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries has always insisted that this multilateral \nOrganization should likewise reflect the democratic spirit of equality, equity \nand transparency, in representation as well as in the processes of \ndecision-making. Therefore the United Nations and its principal organs should \nperiodically undergo a process of review and revitalization in order to ensure \nits dynamic adaptation to the evolving realities of international life, and in \norder that it may continue to play an effective role as the focal point for \nthe management of the critical global issues of our time. \nWe the non-aligned countries have therefore resolved to play an active \nand constructive role in the revitalization, restructuring and democratization \nof the United Nations system. For this purpose, we have decided to establish \na high-level working group charged with elaborating concrete proposals for the \nrestructuring of the United Nations. \nWe believe that a balanced relationship among the General Assembly, the \nSecurity Council, the Economic and Social Council and the Secretary-General is \nimperative. There should be greater accountability of the Security Council to \nthe General Assembly on decisions and actions affecting the interests of the \nentire international community. The role of the General Assembly as a forum \nfor deliberation, negotiation and decision-making must be enhanced. \n\nIt is our conviction that the United Nations capacity for enhancing \ninternational development and cooperation should be strengthened by \nrevitalizing the Economic and Social Council. We believe that the office of \nthe Secretary-General should be provided with resources that are commensurate \nwith its tasks, which have vastly expanded as a result of recent world \nevents. The Secretary-General's mandate should be enlarged to enable him to \ntake the necessary initiatives in the pursuit of preventive diplomacy and in \nenhancing the efficacy of United Nations peace-making, peace-keeping and \npeace-building operations. \nWe believe also that it is time to address the matter of the size and \ncomposition of the Security Council. This, we realize, should be done with \ncircumspection, for it involves a fundamental aspect of the Organization's \npurposes and functions. \nWhen the Charter of the United Nations was framed and its organs \nestablished in 1945, the main preoccupation of its founding members was \nrightly so that never again should the scourge of war be allowed to \ndevastate humankind. They therefore envisioned a collective security system \nthat they thought could be capable of preventing another world war. \nSince then, however, the world has changed in a most profound way. Over \nthe past 47 years, numerous nations achieved their independence and joined the \nUnited Nations as sovereign Member States, thus giving the Organization \nnear-universality in its composition. Their entry reflected the universal \ndrive of peoples to liberate themselves from colonial bondage. But what was \nthe ultimate goal of the struggle? They fought for political independence, \nnot because it was an end unto itself, but because it was the necessary \ncondition for the attainment of a further and larger goal: development. \n\nThose who fought for independence invariably had a vision of their own people \nattaining the blessings and the dignity of economic and social progress, which \nis never possible in a state of political subjugation. \nIn a very real sense, true freedom is attained only through development, \nand the formal trappings of political independence are empty until they are \nsubstantiated by economic and social progress. While it may be true that \ncolonialism in its classical form has virtually come to an end, the process of \ndecolonization will not be finished until economic independence is achieved. \nThus, if in the past the major preoccupation of the United Nations was, \nrightly, the prevention of another world conflagration and the liberation of \npeoples from political bondage, today the world, and therefore the United \nNations, should be seized with the struggle of all countries for national \ndevelopment. This preoccupation should be reflected in the work of the United \nNations and in the composition and dynamics of its organs, in particular the \nSecurity Council. \nWe live in an age of development in which economic power has become more \ndecisive than ever. We live in a world where billions of people in the \ndeveloping countries of the South are beginning to assert their right to \nrealize their economic and social potential. \nWe believe therefore that the Security Council should be expanded to \naccommodate new members who, if they are not to be given veto powers, should \nat least serve as permanent members. They should join the Council on the \nbasis of a combination of relevant criteria that more faithfully reflect the \nworld situation today. That means that the criteria should also take into \naccount the changing concept of security, which has now to emphasize the \neconomic and social aspects as much as the military. We cannot close our \n\neyes to the fact that the economic policies of industrialized countries and \nthe economic weight of the developing countries, particularly the most \npopulous among them, have as much bearing on international peace and security \nas the armaments of the military Powers. We further believe that it may also \nbe timely and pertinent that the manner in which the veto powers are now \nexercised should be subjected to a constructive review. \nThe full elaboration of the meaning and intent of the Jakarta message \nwill be found, not in our speeches, but in the concrete work of the Movement \nin the days to come. It is a momentous task that we have to undertake the \nbuilding of a new world order dedicated to peace as well as to justice, to \nsecurity as well as to development, to democracy both within and among States, \nand to the promotion of the fundamental rights of nations as well as of \nindividual human beings. Let me re-emphasize that to the non-aligned \ncountries, any new world order is viable and commonly acceptable only if based \non recognition of the United Nations as its center-piece and its universal \nframework and if rooted in the fundamental principles of the United Nations \nCharter. \nThis endeavour will take more than the exercise the best efforts of any \nsingle country or any group of countries. But with the help of God Almighty, \nwith the support and participation of all nations that share our aspirations, \nwe shall, God willing, achieve that new world order. "

I anticipated then that the vertiginous changes taking place in and \naround us would bear the hallmark of what I termed the revolution of \ndemocracy. \nToday, after all we have experienced in this brief but intense period, we \ncan see more clearly that the growth of universal awareness among men and \nwomen has not only given democracy, as a system, a global dimension for the \nfirst time in the history of mankind, but has also meant that its power for \nchange and its potential for transformation are clearly challenging old ideas, \nold structures and old habits. \nI will say without fear of contradiction if I may be permitted to \nparaphrase what someone has said that democracy is racing round the globe, \nno longer a phantasmal newcomer but rather a wind of renewal and hope. \nAccordingly, what we must now surely call global democracy is shedding \nnew light on old truths, leading us to understand better, for example, that \npower is, by definition, something to be shared; that we need a new and better \nunderstanding of the dynamics of consensus and dissent; and that the various \nforms of intermediation necessary for social life are now in crisis. \nIndeed, the more complex the organizational processes of a particular \ngovernment, as is the case in democracy, the greater the need for that power \nto be shared if we wish to see it adequately maintained and developed. By the \nsame token, the more rudimentary and simple power is, as is the case in \nauthoritarianism and dictatorship, the less evident is the necessity of \nsharing power. \nSimilarly, we can now see that the useful consensus on the basis of which \nthe old democracies of the industrialized countries were built, with \ngovernment and opposition thinking and acting virtually in the same way, seems \nto citizens a worn-out mechanism that hampers change. Paradoxically, at the \nopposite pole, in the young democracies of developing countries, the citizenry \nzealously calls for consensus as an essential means of uniting the nation's \nforces in pursuit of indispensable changes. \nIt would seem, then, that where the art of consensus was perfected, the \nneed is arising to learn how to manage dissent in an appropriate way; and \nwhere dissent had become a way of life and a cause of stagnation, there is a \nneed in turn to learn how to build consensus. This could well be described as \nthe dynamics of consensus and dissent under democracy. \nAs to the forms of intermediation to be found in social life, we also see \nthat the citizens of universal democracy are striving to reduce intermediacy, \nstriving to take the initiative in everyday life in a more direct way. It is \nthen that the citizen comes to regard intermediation as something of his own \nthat is inescapable, genuine, close, efficient, transparent and \nrepresentative. Therefore, we should not be surprised today to find a state \nof crisis in the political, religious, trade-union and cultural forms of \nintermediation, and even in that great intermediator, the State itself. \nThis last point is especially useful and relevant as we turn to an \nexamination of the present state of our Organization, for, in our view, what \nhas come to be called the crisis of the United Nations seems to be in essence \nnothing other than a crisis of intermediation. I say this because in fact we \nhave always thought that the United Nations represents the most advanced \nmechanism of intermediation on Earth but that, in order to continue to be \nsuch, it must adapt itself to the newly emerging global scenarios of the \nrevolution of democracy. \nFor nearly half a century after its inception, the United Nations played \nthe privileged role of intermediary during the era of hegemonic blocs and the \ncold war. That indicated the quantity and quality of intermediation possible \nwithin that context, at the same time creating a way of sharing international \npower and a method of managing the dynamics of consensus and dissent, within \nthe prevailing balance, managing in that context to determine even its own \nstructure, organization and functioning. Under that old order, the United \nNations achieved great credibility. And although in many places peace was not \nalways preserved, the Organization achieved something that appeared \nimpossible: prevention of a nuclear conflagration between opposing and \nseemingly irreconcilable blocs. \nBut things have changed dramatically and, with them, so must our \nOrganization. In saying this I believe I am voicing what all of us in the \nAssembly are thinking. It is clear that the new world order needs new \ncredibility, which the United Nations must earn. The citizens and nations of \nglobal democracy are placing unavoidable challenges before our Organization, \nchallenges that require us to adapt its structures, modernize its machinery \nand identify new priorities and thus the new intermediation that is possible \nin terms of quantity and quality. And, with no other aim in mind than that of \nseeking answers, allow me to illustrate these ideas by describing a few \nselected developments which, in addition to being new, have the common feature \nof having gained global proportions, which makes them particularly deserving \nof the Organization's keenest attention. \nThe first of these is what I would describe as the dialectic of the \nuniversal and the particular, or, alternatively, the dialectic of \nuniversalisms and particularisms. I am referring to the obvious fact that \npeoples today are expressing two attitudes that are seemingly contradictory \nbut are none the less part of the same dynamic. \nOn the one hand they are striving for complementarity through processes \nof integration that are laying out ever broader geographical, political, \neconomic and commercial areas that already constitute a new world geography. \nOn the other hand, simultaneously and paradoxically, those same peoples and \ncitizens are reaffirming their identity and their essence, sometimes \nintransigently demanding their own cultural, historic, religious, and \nimmediate political frameworks. In an apparent contradiction, they seem to be \ntrying to experience, simultaneously and complementarily, the great and the \nsmall, the longer-term and the immediate, the universal and the particular. \nThe second of these developments arises from the fact that the market \neconomy has gained ascendancy in the same manner as democracy and, together \nwith them, the awareness of a better life and the need for well-being and \nhuman and social development have also become global. Consequently, we face \nas never before the urgent need for a form of solidarity that will enable us \nto hit upon an appropriate relationship between the market economy, democracy, \nand human development. That solidarity, by emphasizing social development \nand, for many of our countries, in a frontal assault upon poverty, will enable \nus also to redefine the foundations of new social legitimacy for States, \ninternally and internationally. \nThe third development has to do with something that we agreed upon at the \nrecent Conference in Rio de Janeiro. We live in a single global ecosystem and \nwe are all jointly responsible for its conservation and clean-up. We also \nagreed that little purpose would be served by preserving a world to be \ninhabited by an impoverished human race, which clearly implies that the \necological stewardship of the planet does not run counter to our peoples' \nneeds for development. Consequently, it remains for us promptly to endow the \nCommission on Sustainable Development with the resources, powers and machinery \nit will need to fulfil the objectives we have set for ourselves. That means \nimplementing Agenda 21, a true plan of action for the next century, as a point \nof departure for offsetting the historical environmental debt we have spoken \nof in other forums. \nThe fourth development pertains to technology. In the joint \ndeliberations the Presidents of the Ibero-American countries engaged in to \nmark the Quincentennial of 1492, we concluded that the final explanation for \nall colonial processes is to be found in a confrontation in which the winner \nachieves ascendancy by virtue of his technological superiority, and that this \nfirst technological defeat lies at the root of dependency and \nmarginalization. We then agreed that in order to redress that situation it \nwas necessary to share technological power more democratically, and that one \nappropriate way to do so might well be to declare as the common heritage of \nmankind those basic technologies that are indispensable to satisfy adequately \nthe equally basic rights of mankind: health, nutrition, education and \nhousing. I venture to reiterate that initiative before the Assembly with an \nexplicit proposal by Bolivia to the international community that we should \nseek participatory, creative and markedly personal machinery that would become \nthe main thrust of the work of the social summit we should now convene. \nThe fifth, and last, development I wish to bring to the attention of the \nAssembly relates to a right which is already recognized under Article 19 of \nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights of our Organization, which states \nthat everyone has the right to \n\\\"seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and \nregardless of frontiers.\\\" (resolution 217 (III). Article 19) \nRepresentatives will surely agree that in recent decades technology has \nturned information, too, into a phenomenon of equally global proportions. At \nthe same time, the universal revolution of democracy has instilled an \nunprecedented awareness among citizens of their right to inform and be \ninformed. That growing awareness is in turn linked to the observable fact \nthat the gap now separating the well-informed citizen from the poorly informed \ncitizen seems quantitatively and qualitatively greater, or at least equal to, \nthat other gap separating extremes of wealth and poverty. \nAll of this leads us, in modern terms, to the perception that information \nhas become the Gordian knot or, if you wish, the crossroads of human rights. \nIndeed, although it may appear an arbitrary simplification, the \nbetter-informed citizen eats more and better than the citizen who is not \nwell-informed and has greater opportunities, among other things, to obtain \naccess to better health and education. The problem becomes all the more acute \nwhen, as mentioned earlier, information today has become a phenomenon that is \nincreasingly dependent on advanced technology and, consequently, the exercise \nof the right conferred by the aforementioned Article 19 of the Declaration \nreally depends on each citizen's greater or lesser opportunity to have access \nto technology on an equal footing. \nI believe that a matter of such great importance requires special \ntreatment and attention on the part of our Organization. With that in mind, \nit seems most appropriate to suggest that serious and urgent consideration be \ngiven to the inclusion as a central focus of the World Conference on Human \nRights in 1993 the topic of citizens' information. I say \\\"citizens'\\\" \ninformation because I am not referring to that other matter, relating more to \ninformation among nations, which came to be known as the \\\"new international \ninformation order\\\". Rather, I am referring to the citizens' right to \ninformation and to the urgent need to guarantee, in principle and in reality, \nequality for mankind with regard to information. \nI wish to share with the Assembly my impression that, if we keep up with \nhistory in moving along this road, we will be arming mankind against what \nmight be the most serious threat to democracy: the new authoritarianism, or, \nif you prefer, the great dictatorship of the twenty-first century - the \nperverse, systematic, sophisticated, invisible and elusive subjugation of the \ncitizens to the distorted and monopolistic control of information technology. \nAllow me now to devote a few moments of my statement to recent \ndevelopments in my country. The curtain has just fallen on a period which is \nnow gone, perhaps never to return. In my country, the signs of new times are \nmuch more visible than in other regions. Members here have themselves often \nexpressed that judgment and often urged and encouraged the efforts of my \npeople, who may now take pride in achievements that have impressed sceptics \nand enlightened those whose minds were weighed down by the weary logic of the \npast. \nBolivia is a nation at peace, and, collectively and individually, it is \nperhaps one of the safest on the continent. It has consolidated its \ndemocratic system and is making concordance the basic instrument of its \npolitical endeavours. \nOn 9 July, all my country's political parties Government and \nopposition, right and left made a solemn commitment to carry forward in the \ncoming months the basic tasks of modernizing the State and society through \njudicial, electoral and educational reforms, reforms in the administrative and \npolitical machinery and, finally, reforms in the Constitution itself. \nHow encouraging it is to have left behind the Bolivia of factionalism, \none of the nightmares of the twentieth century, and to be entering the \ntwenty-first century free of those shackles. \nWe have built, first, financial stability and, then, growth. To do this, \nit was necessary to face squarely the need to carry out the in-depth reform \nand modernization of the economic system. That reform stands on four \nfoundations: stimulating competitiveness in the economy and freeing it from \ntariff barriers, subsidies and State protection; expanding the scope for \nprivate initiative in order to achieve the broadest citizen participation in \neconomic growth; stimulating investment, generating employment and extending \nthe benefits of development to the majority of Bolivians; and transforming the \nState into an efficient manager respectful of solidarity, and into the main \nparty responsible for infrastructure and human development. \nIn this way, and based on the wisdom and capabilities of its people, \nBolivia has achieved the lowest rates of inflation in South America in the \nlast three years. At the same time, its growth rate was one of the highest in \nthe region, and per capita income has grown systematically during my \nAdministration. \nAll of this has brought us to a time of happiness and harmony. For the \nfirst time in my country's contemporary history, there are more Bolivians \ncoming back than leaving, and more money flowing in than flowing out of \nBolivia. Never before has so much been invested in health, education and \nbasic sanitation, simply because we have never had as much access as we have \ntoday to concessional resources, which are coming to Bolivia thanks to the \ninternational community's confidence in the responsible way in which my \ncountry is being governed. We are building an optimistic Bolivia, a Bolivia \nwith a future and with international stature. \nWhile Bolivia is a country which reaches the Atlantic through the major \nwatercourses of the Amazon and the Rio de la Plata, it is by history, \ngeography and culture a country of the Pacific Ocean. There is no better \nplace than this forum of peace for me to reiterate that an unjust war deprived \nus of the status of a maritime nation, in which our life as a republic began, \nand thereby turned Bolivia into a country without a seacoast. The Bolivian \npeople will never give up its aspiration to the sea and to a sovereign and \nuseful presence on the Pacific coast. It matters not how much effort and \nsacrifice may be required in pursuit of that objective. \nTo this end, we have laid out a strategy of peace and integration, a \ngradual and pragmatic strategy by which an appropriate solution to Bolivia's \nlandlocked situation can be found that could be generally and mutually \nbeneficial to the countries of the region. Proof of the soundness and impact \nof that strategy is the outcome of the Mariscal de Santa Cruz agreements \nsigned with Peru on 24 January in the southern city of Ilo. Although not \nencompassing the sovereignty to which we aspired, and although not in the \nlocation which historically is rightfully ours, agreement has been reached on \na commercial and industrial duty-free zone and on administration of the port \nby Bolivian and Peruvian entrepreneurs. Moreover, a tourism area of \n5 kilometres of beach has been granted, and it has already been named \n\\\"Boliviamar\\\". \nThree years ago I described to the Assembly Bolivia's national strategy \nto fight the production of, trafficking in and illicit consumption of \nnarcotics, a strategy which my Government was then beginning to implement, \nasking the international community for its understanding and support. In 1989 \nthere were reasons to fear that drug trafficking might irremediably corrode \nthe political and institutional system of Bolivia, that it might come to \ndominate the economy as a whole and might lead, sooner or later, to escalating \nviolence. Although at that time there were doubts as to Bolivia's ability to \ncarry out the plan, today I can say categorically that cocaine traffic has \nceased to be a strategic risk for Bolivia. \nBolivia is proof that the struggle against drug trafficking not only is \npossible but can also be successful. Against the temptation to yield to \ndiscouragement and pessimism, Bolivia stands out as a symbol, as a banner of \nhope and optimism. We have systematically reduced the areas devoted to coca \ngrowing; we have reduced the production of paste and cocaine hydrochloride; we \nhave taken firm action in the selection of specialized personnel, following \ncriteria of efficiency and honesty; and we have broken up the main networks of \ndrug trafficking in Bolivia by means of a decree-law known as the \\\"Repentance \nDecree\\\", as a result of which the leaders of these organizations are now in my \ncountry's jails. \nAll this was possible because we managed to avoid the imposition from \noutside of concepts and plans ill-suited to our national reality. On the \ncontrary, we forged ahead with a peaceful struggle, ruling out the \nmilitarization of the struggle and spared the country from the confrontation \nand violence which had occurred elsewhere. In the light of this unquestionably \npositive picture, Bolivia asks the international community to redouble its \nefforts to reduce consumption, to control chemical precursors and to increase \nquantitatively and qualitatively the resources allocated to improved \nfunctioning of alternative development mechanisms, Bolivia's substantive \ncontribution to the body of knowledge on this topic. \nAbove all, we ask most earnestly that the coca leaf not be confused with \ncocaine: the coca leaf is a good thing and is an expression of an age-old \ncultural tradition originating in the Andes; cocaine, by contrast, is foreign, \nalien, and came from outside. \nFrom this rostrum, I pay a tribute to all the Bolivians who made possible \nthe enormous advances we have achieved in this fight against one of the \ncruelest and most pernicious forms of corruption in contemporary society. I \nwish to express my special thanks to the self-sacrificing workers and farmers \nof my country. \nTomorrow, at the offices of the Interamerican Development Bank in \nWashington, intergovernmental meetings will begin with a view to defining the \ncomposition of the governing board of the Development Fund for Indigenous \nPeoples of Latin America and the Caribbean, created on the initiative of the \nIbero-American countries meeting at the Guadalajara and Madrid summits. \nBolivia, a country of original indigenous stock, like so many others of \nour continent, asks the international community to support this programme, \nwhich is vital for the lives of many men and women, especially as we prepare \nto celebrate 1993 as the International Year for the World's Indigenous People \nwith the theme of \\\"Indigenous people a new partnership\\\". \nThis is the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. But for the \npeoples of the Americas, and in particular the Ibero-American peoples, this \nsession marks the quincentennial of 1492. It is therefore a psychological \nreality for us that one chapter of history is drawing to a close and another \nis opening, one in which mankind will continue its tireless search, \ndiscovering and building new worlds. \nThat is why Bolivia, a peaceful country of the South, which is \nexperiencing the profound challenges of development, is also concerned about \nthe fate of the industrialized North, where, following the natural euphoria \nafter the end of the cold war and the victory of democracy, there have been \nworrying signs of uncertainty, lack of confidence and pessimism. I say I am \nconcerned about the North because, in contrast with the past, we are now all \nliving in one global political ecosystem, where threats, risks, victories and \nfailures have repercussions for us all. \nFor its part, Bolivia is prepared, together with other countries, to run \nthe shared risk of building a new and better world. In that endeavour, there \nis only one requirement: that no one ignore anyone else. "

        "file_text": "\nIt gives me great pleasure, on behalf of the Syrian delegation, to \ncongratulate the new President on his election to the presidency of the \nforty-seventh session of the General Assembly, particularly as our two \ncountries and peoples enjoy bonds of traditional friendship. I should also \nlike to express our appreciation to your predecessor, the permanent \nrepresentative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for the success and skill with \nwhich he presided over the proceedings of the previous session of the General \nAssembly. May we wish his sisterly country progress and prosperity. \nI should also like to take this opportunity to reiterate to the \nSecretary-General of the United Nations our confidence and our appreciation of \nhis unremitting efforts in the service of the international community and the \nprinciples and objectives of the United Nations Charter. In that respect, we \nvalue the effort that has gone into the preparation of his report entitled \\\"An \nAgenda for Peace\\\" and many of the valuable ideas contained therein. \nAs is customary in this forum, we welcome the new States Members which \nhave joined our international Organization and hope that their new membership \nwill contribute to the process of enhancing its effectiveness and \nstrengthening its role in formulating more democratic and equitable \ninternational relations. \nFor the third time, the twentieth century witnesses an important change \nin the political map of the world. The change is such that schools and \nlibraries all over the world have become in need of a new atlas, just as they \nhad in the wake\\\"of the two World Wars. We fear that, because of the \ncontinuing upheavals in the world the designers of that new atlas may have to \nleave a wide margin for possible new changes that may occur in the map of this \nplanet as it crosses the threshold into the twenty-first century. \n\nFortunately, that great change in the political map of the world has not \ntaken place through war, as was the case in the two previous instances. \nOtherwise, it would have meant the end of all life on earth. Regrettably, \nhowever, the change has not been totally devoid of tension and violence. It \nhas carried the seeds of small-scale wars that have spread here and there for \nnational, ethnic, religious, tribal, economic and social reasons. \nAt this historic juncture, the real concern is not only the number of \nvictims claimed by such small wars or the scale of the destruction that may \nensue, but rather, the possibility of the spread of the seeds of those small \nwars, in the North as well as in the South, in the absence of a world order \nthat is capable of containing and addressing their causes. \nThis is the major challenge which faces the United Nations today. It \nwould be paradoxical indeed if the twentieth century, whose grand bang of \nscientific and cultural achievements have been hailed by all, were to end with \nthe whimper of small was that are waged by people with small primitive minds \nthe international community cannot curb. \nMany have rightly spoken of the non-implementation of United Nations \nresolutions and of the paralysis of its Security Council during the years of \nthe cold war that used to rage between East and West. But the cold war has in \neffect been over for a few years now, and its demise has been officially \ndeclared by both sides. And yet, we find that the ultimate ambition of the \nSecurity Council today is no longer to stop the fighting and put an end to the \nmassacres in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Somalia, Afghanistan and other hotbeds of \ntension and conflict, but merely to try and deliver humanitarian assistance to \nsome of the peoples of those unfortunate countries. \n\nThe end of confrontation between East and West ought not to lead to the \nend of concern for the fate of the many peoples and countries which are being \ntorn apart by conflicts, as is happening today in Bosnia and Herzegovina, \nSomalia, Afghanistan and other places; nor should it lead to the withholding \nfrom their peoples of the assistance that would help heal their wounds and \nenable them to reconstruct what has been destroyed by conflict and war. \nIf only a very small percentage of the sums that used to be spent by the \ntwo camps on the cold War were channelled to the assistance of peoples of the \nthird world, such a small percentage would make it possible to overcome most \nof the difficulties and tragedies those peoples now face and to avoid further \nsuch disputes. \nAt a time when the world witnesses the disintegration of whole States and \nthe outbreak of civil wars and conflicts, one must appreciate the exceptional \nefforts that led to saving the Lebanese people from the inferno of civil war \nand helping them on the road to national reconciliation through the efforts of \nthe Lebanese themselves and the brotherly assistance and sacrifices of Syria. \nWe hope that pledges made to reconstruct what the civil war destroyed in \nLebanon and to contribute to the special fund created for that purpose will be \nhonoured. \nSince the end of the Second World War, the Middle East has enjoyed \nneither security nor stability because of the continuing Arab-Israeli conflict \nand its repercussions. But the convening of the Madrid conference last year \nhas opened for the first time, as all acknowledge, a rare and historic window \nof opportunity to achieve a just and comprehensive peace based on \ninternational legality and the resolutions of the United Nations, particularly \n\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978), which, \naccording to the Charter of the United Nations, are binding and must be \nimplemented by all parties to the conflict. \nAlmost a year has passed now since the convening of the Madrid \nconference. Ten months after the conference, the whole world came to realize \nthat the peace talks between the Arabs and the Israelis were futile, because \nof the intransigence and the evasiveness of the previous head of the Israeli \nGovernment, who admitted publicly after his defeat in the elections that his \nintention was to go on quibbling and prevaricating with the purpose of \nprolonging the negotiations for 10 more years. \n\nIt is also regrettable that the latest round of peace talks was concluded \nin Washington without the Israeli side changing the substance of its approach \nto the question of a full withdrawal from the Golan and the other occupied \nArab territories, including Al-Quds, despite the readiness of Syria and the \nother Arab parties to commit themselves to all that is required of them in \nconformity with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). It \nappears that the change in policies and priorities claimed by Mr. Rabin's \nGovernment in comparison with those of Mr. Shamir's Government to date lacks \nboth credibility and actual application. \nThe fact of the matter is that the great expectations and noticeable \nmomentum which accompanied the latest round of negotiations were a result of \nthe earnest contribution of the Arab side and the great impact of the Syrian \ndocument at both the regional and international levels. That comprehensive \ndocument contains the bases and principles of a peaceful settlement of the \nArab-Israeli conflict in conformity with the Charter and resolutions of the \nUnited Nations, which were the basis for the convening of the Madrid \nConference. \nThe international community has affirmed that the achievement of peace in \nthe Middle East has always been and continues to be rooted in the \ninevitability of Israel's withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories \nthat were occupied by force and war, and in securing the legitimate national \nrights of the Palestinian people. \nThose in Israel who believe that total peace can be achieved without a \ncomplete Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories are gravely \nmistaken. Those who also believe that the Israeli arsenal of mass destruction \n\nand its qualitative military edge can make it immune to the repercussions of \nthe end of the cold war are equally mistaken. Saturating Israel with \ndestructive and sophisticated weaponry cannot guarantee the true security of \nIsrael as long as it continues to occupy the territories of others by force \nand to violate the rights of the Palestinian people, and as long as it lacks \nthe human compass that may guide it to the shores of peace and security. \nThe road to a comprehensive, just and durable peace is clear and well \ndefined; it remains for Israel to choose to take it. Any manoeuvres of \npartial withdrawals or interim steps will not bring peace either to the region \nor to Israel itself. The higher level meetings Israel demands are merely a \nploy that is meant to undermine the framework and mechanism within which the \nArab and Israeli parties met at the Madrid Peace Conference. \nAs declared by its leader. President Hafez Al-Assad, Syria wants an \nhonourable peace which our people would accept, a peace in which not a grain \nof sand of our land is lost, no concession of any of our rights is made, and \nwithout dereliction of the duty of safeguarding the dignity of our nation. We \nwant the peace of the brave, the peace that survives and lasts and guarantees \nthe interests of all. But if there are to be games and ambushes no one could \nmake Syria forsake its patriotic and national stand. There is no place for \ncapitulation in our dictionary. \nWe have already voiced our readiness for a complete peace in return for a \ncomplete withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories and we reaffirm \nthat now. That is our challenge to Israel from this rostrum, a challenge that \nhas found no response to this day. \n\nIf comprehensiveness and justice were observed in arms control it would \nundoubtedly contribute to the consolidation of the security and stability we \nall long for. The subject of arms control would come within reach and be more \neffective in ensuring security and stability in the Middle East if it were \nbased on the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction, with nuclear \nweapons first and foremost, in accordance with criteria which have no bias in \nfavour of one State at the expense of another and which apply to all countries \nof the region without exception within the framework of the United Nations and \nunder its auspices. \nSyria has never spared any effort in supporting United Nations \nresolutions and conventions relating to disarmament, particularly the \nnon-proliferation Treaty to which Syria has acceded. Syria also signed the \nnon-proliferation Treaty safeguards agreement on 25 February 1992. Syria has \nsigned the Treaty on the prohibition of biological weapons and has \nconsistently supported the initiative to make the Middle East region free of \nall nuclear weapons. Syria was the first officially to suggest at the 1989 \nParis Conference on chemical weapons that the Middle East should be free of \nall chemical and biological weapons and weapons of mass destruction. \nAt a time when the whole world knows that Israel is the only State in the \nregion to possess nuclear weapons in addition to its possession of other \nweapons of mass destruction, Israel has to date refused to accede to the \nnon-proliferation Treaty and has also refused for decades to allow inspection \nof its nuclear installations and continues to do so today. \nThe logical option for all peoples of the world is to ensure security for \nall through complete disarmament and the elimination of all weapons of mass \ndestruction. The measures adopted by the Conference on Disarmament in \n\nrelation to the conclusion of a draft convention on the prohibition, \ndevelopment, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and their \ndestruction will remain short of realizing the ambitions of the international \ncommunity so long as they are not coupled with a similar prohibition on \nnuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. \nThe situation in South Africa continues to be a source of deep concern \nfor my country. While we express our satisfaction over the repeal and \namendment of some of the basic laws of apartheid, we would also like to \nexpress our deep concern over the persistence of repression and violence that \nthe Government of South Africa continues to perpetrate against the population, \nat a great cost in victims to that population. Syria strongly supports the \ndemands of the overwhelming majority of the people of South Africa for the \nestablishment of a democratic and non-racial society. \nConcerning Cyprus, we welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General to \nfind a just and lasting solution to the Cypriot problem based on United \nNations resolutions and taking into account the interests of the parties to \nthe conflict. \nConcerning the Korean peninsula, we reaffirm our support for the efforts \nof Democratic Korea to reunite the Korean peninsula peacefully and through \nnegotiations. This would lead to prosperity for the entire Korean people \nwhile consolidating peace and stability in North-East Asia. \n\nIn view of all the issues and problems with which the international \ncommunity is occupied, some of which I have mentioned in my statement, the \npeoples and countries of the world are looking to our international \nOrganization to contribute towards the establishment of a world of peace and \nsecurity. We believe that, in order to be able to realize the aspirations and \nhopes of the peoples of the world for instituting a new world order in which \nthere is no aggression or occupation and which is based on international \nlegality and the rules of international law, the United Nations must apply the \nprovisions of its own Charter and implement its resolutions without bias, \nselectivity or double standards. As we find ourselves on the threshold of the \ntwenty-first century, we hope to be able to reach a world of peace and justice \nin which stability and prosperity would prevail. \n"

As in a traditional family, the birth of a new member \nis a symbol of joy and hope: joy, because of the new-found vitality of our \nOrganization; and hope, because of the new experiences, opinions and \nalternatives that there will be to enable us to resolve the problems and \nsituations confronting the international community. \n\nOur Government, in the conviction that there can be no better unity than \nthat which flows from and is based on diversity, has formally recognized all \nthose States that are members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and \nhas initiated and established diplomatic relations with each of them; our \nGovernment hopes to be able to proceed in the same manner with each of the new \nMembers of the United Nations family. \nOn the political scene, the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly \nis taking place at a historic time characterized by new crises, new \nobscurantism and new methods of exerting pressure and oppression that stand in \nreal contrast to the hope and the optimism that filled the international \ncommunity with the end of the cold war. \nThe reason for this is very clear and appropriately reflected in the \nreport of the Secretary-General, in which he so rightly states that: \n\\\"The cold war confronted the international community with a singular \nthreat to security; now, a widely varying array of resentments, \nambitions, rivalries and hatreds masked for decades have come to the fore \nto threaten international harmony and shared purpose.\\\" (A/47/1, para. Ill) \nFigure 6 of that report, on peace-keeping forces and observer missions, \ntestifies most tellingly to this sad reality: before 1988, the United Nations \nhad conducted 13 missions, while between then and now there have been 14 of \nthem in only four of the Organization's 47 years of existence. \nTrue, there are glimpses of optimistic, hopeful signs on the horizon; \nhowever, it is also true that all generations have the right to live in peace, \njustice and security and to enjoy life so as to leave a better legacy to \nfuture generations. \n\nWe note that high-level international conferences are being held these \ndays in order to find solutions to the problems facing peoples and nations: \nNew York saw the World Summit for Children in September 1990; Geneva hosted \nthe summit on the advancement of the rights of rural women this year; \nRio de Janeiro hosted the Earth Summit in June 1992; the international \ncommunity's agenda includes the holding of the second World Conference on \nHuman Rights in 1993, the conference on population and development in 1994 and \non the advancement of women and on social development in 1995. \nEquatorial Guinea welcomes these and other similar events, and once again \nreaffirms that, for these events to succeed and their results to be \nimplemented in practice, the principle of the self-determination of peoples \nand the promotion of responsible relations between States are necessary \nconditions if justice, peace and international security are to prevail. \n\nIn South Africa, apartheid and racial discrimination continue to claim \ninnocent victims. In Somalia, selfish political interests and the desire for \npower have combined with natural disasters to accelerate the disappearance of \nan entire nation. The civil war in Liberia, which continues to claim victims \nand cause the permanent exodus of its citizens, has spilled over its borders, \ndestabilizing the countries of the subregion and blocking the way towards a \npeaceful solution to the conflict: the holding of free elections in an \natmosphere of peace and security. \nIn the former Yugoslavia, war is resorted to in order to slow down the \neffects of the end of the cold war, setting an extremely dangerous precedent, \nbearing in mind that the geopolitical and demographic spectrum of the former \nYugoslavia is not unique in the community of nations. Our Secretary-General, \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, pointed out that sad reality when he rightly wrote: \n\\\"This is, then, a conflict with an international dimension. The \nfuture shape and security of one or more Member States indeed their \nvery existence has come under threat.\\\" (A/47/1, para. 141) \nOn the Korean Peninsula, as in Cyprus, intervention and interference in \nthe internal affairs of States, including foreign occupation and domination, \ncontinue to play the same role as they did in the days of the cold war. The \nlegitimate desire of the Korean people, both North and South, to see their \ncountry reunited, and the legitimate aspiration of Cypriots to attain their \nnational identity, free from ethnic disputes and narrow-minded nationalism, \nare receding farther and farther from the process of peaceful solution and are \ndisappearing in the sea of hegemonic interests. We believe that the best \ncontribution that the international community, the United Nations and peoples \n\nwho love peace and justice can make to the peaceful and lasting solution of \nthese and other conflicts is, above and beyond all interests, to ensure \nrespect for the self-determination of the peoples affected. \nIn Equatorial Guinea we welcome and applaud the efforts to restore peace \nand justice to all the affected areas and the multifaceted humanitarian \nassistance provided by the international community in the collective framework \nof the United Nations system in general and in particular the European \nEconomic Community, the Organization of African Unity, the Non-Aligned \nMovement, the Economic Community of West African States, the United States of \nAmerica, Japan and other States and governmental and non-governmental \ncharitable bodies. \nThe increasingly acute economic and financial crisis afflicting all \ncountries, and the developing ones in particular, with special emphasis on the \nleast developed countries, still rests on the well-known pillars built by the \ncurrent economic order, which has been so often denounced in almost all \ninternational forums. With the passing of time, the external debt becomes \never more unpayable, in spite of the constant efforts and sacrifices the \ndebtors make to increase the output of raw materials and export commodities \nwhile accepting the discipline imposed by structural adjustment programmes. \nIn the international markets, to which access is difficult because of the \nprotectionist policies of the fortunate countries of the North, the prices of \nraw materials remain low, while the prices of manufactured goods remain high, \nmuch to the despair of the less fortunate countries of the South. \nWe are sure that everything needed to solve these and other problems in \nthe context of international cooperation for development is within our grasp: \n\na reduction in military budgets and progress in disarmament and the curbing of \nthe arms race, which, together with democracy, free markets and respect for \nfundamental freedoms, would carry us swiftly to the goal that we all share: \nwell-being. \nWe take the opportunity given us by this world forum to express in this \ncontext our profound and sincere gratitude to the World Bank, the \nInternational Monetary Fund, the United Nations Development Programme and \nother international financial organizations and individual countries for their \nongoing contribution to the task of rehabilitating and rebuilding the economic \nand financial structure of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. From this \nrostrum we invite them all to continue along that path and to support \nEquatorial Guinea on the occasion of the Third Round Table, to be held soon in \nGeneva, Switzerland. \nEquatorial Guinea cannot presume to be immune to and free of the ills, \noften a legacy of the past, that afflict national communities and the world \ncommunity in the vital social domain and in the equally vital area of human \nrights. \nThe economic and financial restrictions caused by the unbalanced \ninternational economic order prevent our having enough schools and training \ncentres and make us unable to guarantee the provision of health services \nmeeting the needs of all our inhabitants. Nevertheless, the effort of our \nGovernment, within the limitations of its modest means, combined with the \nassistance received from friendly countries and international organizations, \nis becoming increasingly evident in improvements in those sectors. \n\nWe in Equatorial Guinea believe that as long as a people lacks a basic \ninfrastructure to resolve problems of education, medical and pharmaceutical \ncare, a clean environment, drinking water, housing and so on there should be \nserious, profound reflection on the concept of human rights. \nIn the face of all the factors affecting the human being, including the \nchallenges of his natural enemies, our Government has started out on the road \nto the fullest enjoyment of fundamental freedoms and the guarantee of respect \nfor human rights. In this context, we express our deepest appreciation to the \nfollowing for their support of the work being carried out by our national \nconstitutional bodies and special commissions, such as the National Commission \non Human Rights, the National Commission of Support for the Children of \nEquatorial Guinea and the National Commission for the Protection of the \nEnvironment, to name but a few: the United Nations Educational, Scientific \nand Cultural Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children's Fund, \nthe World Food Programme, the United Nations Population Fund and all those \nothers that directly or indirectly provide effective and disinterested \nassistance to our country. \nOn mentioning, however briefly, the question of human rights, I cannot \nfail to refer to the erroneous image of our country held by the Commission on \nHuman Rights and certain journalistic circles. We believe and maintain that \nthe Commission is an organ at the service of the United Nations and therefore \nof the Member States. Its components, including experts and rapporteurs, \ncannot become prosecutors acting against sovereign States Members of the \n\nUnited Nations, nor can they assume the role that a country's legal system and \ninternational law grant to State authorities. \nWe have seen, to our regret, that in exchange for the firm political will \nand readiness of our Government to promote respect for human rights in \nEquatorial Guinea by providing, inter alia, all sorts of logistical \nassistance local transportation, public and private contacts, access to \npublic and private locations and places that were off limits for security \nreasons, and so on - the report of the Rapporteur assigned to Equatorial \nGuinea only denigrates the image of our country and its Government, incites \nviolence and undermines the peace and order that prevail in our country. \n\nWhile flatly rejecting the report presented to the Commission on Human \nRights at its session in Geneva in March 1992 for its lack of realism and \nobjectivity, the Government of Equatorial Guinea pledges to the international \ncommunity that it will, within its means, continue its programme in defence of \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, launched on 3 August 1979, in a climate \nof peace, justice, harmony and understanding, and that it will not allow \nitself to be swayed by attempts at intimidation and/or provocation. \nEquatorial Guinea wishes to express its satisfaction at the bilateral and \nmultilateral efforts made by the international community to promote global, \nregional and subregional disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons. In \nthis regard, we welcome the decision taken by the General Assembly, at the \ninitiative of the Economic Community of Central African States, to support the \nformulation of confidence-building, disarmament and development measures, as \nwell as the establishment of a Standing Consultative Committee to deal with \nquestions of security in Central Africa. We hope that its programme and \ntimetable of activities, drawn up during the organizational meeting held in \nYaounde in July 1992, will be given the complete support of the Assembly at \nthis session. \nWe could not conclude this statement without availing ourselves of the \nopportunity to inform the Assembly of the current state of the democratization \nprocess being carried out in our country. \nWe overwhelmingly approved our new Fundamental Law at the end of last \nyear. It is based, inter alia. \n\\\"on the principles of social justice, reaffirmed solemnly in instruments \non the rights and freedoms of the human being, as defined and enshrined \nin the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\\\". \n\nAt the same time, it recognizes political pluralism in Equatorial Guinea. A \nset of laws regulating these rights and freedoms was promulgated early this \nyear, and a transition Government was established with the sole and exclusive \ntask of preparing the people and adapting the Republic's institutions to \ncurrent realities, characterized by the multiparty democracy that has been in \neffect over the 12-month period that will end on December 1992. \nAt present, five political parties the Partido Democratico de Guinea \nEcuatorial, the Union Popular, the Convencion Liberal Democratica, the Partido \nSocial Democrata and the Union para la Democracia Social - have been \nregistered and given official status under the provisions of the Law on \nPolitical Parties of 6 January 1992. These parties are already conducting \ntheir political activities throughout the country in a climate of dialogue, \norder, peace and tranquillity. \nIn the same direction, and with the two-fold objective of involving all \nthe country's forces in the construction of a new era of democratic \ncoexistence, on the one hand, and of alleviating the sad and heavy burden that \nthe phenomenon of exile and displaced persons places on the international \ncommunity, on the other, the President of the Republic, \nHis Excellency Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, approved and promulgated for the \nsecond time since 1979 the Law on Amnesty, under which \n\\\"All acts of commission or omission of a political nature committed \nby Equatorial Guineans and characterized as political offences and crimes \nin the Criminal Code or in special criminal laws passed prior to \n2 December 1991 shall be forgiven and forgotten.\\\" \n\nTherefore \n\\\"All citizens of Equatorial Guinea granted this amnesty who are \noutside the country will be able freely to enter the national territory \nand reside therein. They shall be entitled to all rights and freedoms \nunder the conditions set forth in the Fundamental Law and other legal \nprovisions of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.\\\" \nIn this context, we hope that, on the same humanitarian grounds that \ninspired the Governments of the host countries and the international \ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations, they will continue to give \nall assistance necessary to facilitate the voluntary return of our brothers \nand sisters, just as our Government has already taken, and will continue to \ntake, steps to do so and to ensure their integration into the society of \nEquatorial Guinea. \nIn the coming months, the People's House of Representatives - the \nparliament of Equatorial Guinea - will be taking a decision on the draft \nElectoral Law, which is to be formulated with the help and participation of \nall duly constituted political parties. This will conclude the planned \nmedium-term actions and will lead to the final stage in the process of \ndemocratization through the organization and holding of municipal, legislative \nand presidential elections in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. \nMay I conclude my statement by emphasizing the relevance and timeliness \nof the report of the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, entitled \n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". We believe that the content of this important document \nis a challenge to our generation and to the United Nations, since, if by \n\nnational and international \\\"preventive diplomacy\\\" we succeed in attaining the \nfollowing objective: \n\\\"To seek to identify at the earliest possible stage situations that \ncould produce conflict, and to try through diplomacy to remove the \nsources of danger before violence results\\\" (A/47/277, para. 15). \nwe shall have marked the real beginning of the new era, and future generations \nwill indeed be grateful. \n"

        "file_text": "I have the honour to convey to you and to \nall the representatives here the warm greetings of \nHis Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, King of Bhutan, and his good wishes for \nthe success of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. \nI should first like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as \npresident of the forty-seventh session of the Assembly. Your unanimous \nelection is testimony to the high regard the international community has for \nyour country and the Assembly's confidence that your leadership will provide \nthe necessary direction on many important issues that we shall take up during \nthis session. \nI should like to take this opportunity to place on record our deep \nappreciation to Mr. Samir S. Shihabi, for the excellent manner in which he \nconducted the proceedings of our last session. \nI wish to extend our warm welcome to the Governments and peoples of all \nthe new Members of \\\" \u00ac\u221e United Nations. The large number of new Members is \ntestimony not only to t' 3 historic changes that are taking place in the world, \nbut also to the universality and importance of the United Nations. We welcome \nthem and look forward to the opportunity to work together. \nDuring the last three years the world has witnessed the disappearance of \nthe ideological conflict that had divided it and pervaded every aspect of \nsocial and economic life for much of this century. While these sweeping \nchanges have brought new opportunities for peace, stability and progress, \nhopes have been dampened on the one hand by the unleashing of old hostilities \nand new conflicts, and on the other by the further impoverishment of millions \nof people for whom the changes in the international scene have little \nmeaning. The social and economic situation remains dismal not only in many \ndeveloping countries but also in many developed countries which are suffering \nfrom a prolonged recession. Though the opportunity for peace and progress has \nnever been better, the challenges of inequity and poverty, which are the main \nreasons for instability and conflict, continue to be daunting as ever. \nIn many ways the United Nations has been the greatest beneficiary of the \nchanges in international affairs. After many years of blatant disregard and \neven disrespect by many and a lack of confidence in its abilities by others, \nthe international community is now increasingly turning to the United \nNations. There is greater willingness on the part of everybody to work \nthrough the Organization. \nIn this context we should like to record our appreciation to our previous \nSecretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, for having created this opportunity \nand increased respect for the United Nations. We should also like to express \nour admiration and appreciation to our present Secretary-General, \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for taking immediate steps to make the Organization \nrelevant and more responsive to the needs of the world, particularly in the \narea of conflict. We share his views on the need for immediate peace-keeping \nand peace-making and for greater emphasis on conflict resolution. Above all, \nwe share his view on the need to give equal importance and attention to \nconflict and suffering wherever they may be in the world. \nThe situation in the Middle East continues to be a major concern for \nglobal peace. While the unnecessary and senseless aggression against the \npeaceful people of Kuwait has been reversed, the issue of prisoners and \ndisarmament remains. This new confrontation has added another dimension to \nthe region, where peace and stability have already been denied for a long time. \nWe fully appreciate the efforts of the sponsors of the dialogue that is \ntaking place on the Middle East. We sincerely hope that the talks will defuse \nthe conflict and pave the way for peace in the region. However, this process \nwill not be successful unless the question of Palestine and occupied Arab \nlands is addressed and the legitimate rights of the Palestinians to \nself-determination in their homeland are guaranteed. Equally, the territorial \nintegrity of Lebanon and the security and safety of all States in the region, \nincluding Israel, must be assured. Only then will there be meaningful peace \nin the region. \nIn South Africa, while there has been progress towards change, the \nprocess has been continuously marred by a heavy toll in human lives. The \nviolence must stop and the talks should continue. The inevitable course of \nchange should not be restrained any further. \nWhile the cold war has ended, one of its last remnants still stands in \nthe division of the Korean peninsula. We welcome the recent exchanges between \nthe two countries and believe they will eventually lead to unification. We \nfully support the pragmatic steps set forth by President Roh Tae Woo of the \nRepublic of Korea in his address to this session and share his vision of the \nKorean peninsula presenting itself as one nation before this body in the near \nfuture. \nThe supply of arms over the years has made it possible for conflicts in \nSomalia and other regions of the world to continue despite the major changes \nin the international scene. The results have been tragic, and we cannot but \nemphasize the immediate need for humanitarian assistance and for resolution of \nthe problems. \nThe disappearance of the bipolar world has provided the best opportunity \nfor ending the arms race and bringing about complete disarmament. The chance \nto direct all efforts and resources from the production of weapons of mass \ndestruction towards the service of humanity must not be allowed to slip by. \nWhile there has been reduction of major weapons, the production and supply of \nsmaller arms have continued to thrive in many parts of the world. Developing \ncountries can ill afford to spend their resources on such unproductive and \ndestructive enterprises. \nThe tragedies of war and conflict are not the only factors contributing \nto human suffering. While they may be dramatic and require immediate \nattention, more suffering is taking place on a day-to-day basis, involving \nmillions of people in the world. Just as it is important to end conflict, it \nis essential that the problems of poverty be addressed. \nThe decade of the 1980s produced few, if any, positive results in the \nfield of socio-economic development; consequently, the living conditions of \nonly a few are better than when the decade started. The International \nDevelopment Strategy for the 1990s, adopted by the General Assembly at its \neighteenth special session; the Cartagena Commitments agreed to at the Eighth \nConference of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development \n(UNCTAD VIII); the Rio Declaration of the Earth Summit; and the Jakarta \nMessage of the Tenth Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement all call \nfor renewed efforts in international development in the decade ahead. \nOn the otherwise discouraging scheme there have been two important \nevents: the World Summit for Children, in September 1990, and the \nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in \nRio de Janeiro in June this year. The children's Summit clearly drew our \nattention to the need to redouble our efforts to give our children the \nnecessary care, attention and education if we are to ensure a better future \nfor humanity. \nThe Earth Summit clearly established the common stake we all have in the \nwell being of the planet. It recognized that, while the responsibility for \npreserving the delicate ecological balance falls on all nations, at the same \ntime those responsible for its degradation and abuse must be held \naccountable. Our planet can no longer sustain a high level of exploitation, \nand there must be a willingness on the part of those placing a high demand on \nnatural resources to reduce consumption. At the same time more resources are \nnecessary to improve the conditions and meet the basic needs of billions of \npeople in developing countries, particularly the more than 1.1 billion people \nwho live in absolute poverty. As further misuse of the earth's finite \nresources would be disastrous, the only alternative is a greater willingness \nto share. \nThe high pace of population growth and the resulting increase in demand \non resources is a serious threat to the environment and to the future. \nDeveloping countries, where 4.3 billion of today's population of 5.5 billion \nlive, and where nearly all the next billions will be added in the decades \nahead, must take all measures to ensure that population and development are \nbalanced in a sustainable manner. \nThe next three to four decades will be the most challenging humanity has \never faced, as they will determine the long-term survival of our planet. Just \nas we have a common stake in the environment and social well being, our \nfutures are also tied in terms of overall global economic health. The slow \nrecovery in the North from a long protracted recession has affected all \ncountries. Similarly, the economic strength of developing countries clearly \naffects economic opportunities for the North. \nThe long established target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for \nofficial development assistance has not been reached by most donor countries \nand is not likely to be during this century. Official development assistance, \nwhether through bilateral or through multilateral channels, has been set back \nnot only in terms of slow growth but also in terms of slow disbursement \nresulting from increasing modalities and conditionalities. \nThe question of debt still awaits comprehensive solution after more than \na decade of discussion. Both the need for debt relief and the requirement of \nadditional credit must be dealt with in a fair and comprehensive manner. The \nserious imbalances in international trade in terms of prices for commodities \nas well as volume of trade must be made more stable. Trade is one of the few \navenues available to developing countries for progress, and must not be \nrestricted. It is also necessary that access to knowledge and technology be \nmade easier. \nOur discussions on development and political change must take into \naccount the human and social dimensions. There is increasing social tension \nand disregard for human dignity arising out of poverty, high population growth \nand resulting unemployment, migration and competition for scarce resources. \nThe wholesome well being of individuals and their rights can be assured if \nthere are stable social, economic, political and natural environments. We \nlook forward to the Second World Conference on Human Rights, in 1993, and the \nproposed world summit for social development to address these important issues \nin an integrated manner. \nIn my own country, Bhutan, development activities started only in the \n1960s. Since then, major changes have taken place: an effective fiscal and \nfinancial management system, a basic network of social services, roads \nconnecting all population centres, and a growing export sector comprised of \nenergy, minerals and agricultural products have been established. The \ndevelopment of human resources and the preservation of our rich environment \nhave been given special attention. Despite the considerable progress, our \neconomic infrastructure remains inadequate, and the country's communications \nand transport systems require expansion. In addition to the problems all \nleast developed countries face, Bhutan is further handicapped by being \nlandlocked. \nBhutan has always taken full responsibility for its own development, and \nwe will continue to do so, but the progress we have made thus far would not \nhave been possible without generous support, particularly that of India, \nJapan, Switzerland, Denmark, Kuwait, Austria, Norway, the Netherlands, \nGermany, the United Kingdom and Australia and various agencies and bodies of \nthe United Nations, in particular the United Nations Development Programme, \nthe United Nations Children's Fund, the International Fund for Agricultural \nDevelopment, the United Nations Capital Development Fund, the World Health \nOrganization, the World Food Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization \nof the United Nations, the United Nations Volunteers, the United Nations \nPopulation Fund, the United Nations Department of Technical Cooperation for \nDevelopment and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization. I take this opportunity to express the sincere gratitude and \nappreciation of the people and Government of the Kingdom of Bhutan to our \ndevelopment partners. \nOne of the important issues before the Assembly is the establishment of \nthe Commission on Sustainable Development. We fully welcome such a \ncommission, but we must emphasize that its mandate and relationship to \nexisting organizations must be very clear, and its task must contribute \ntangibly and substantively to socio-economic development. Let it not be one \nof the multitude of international organizations struggling to bring about \ndevelopment. \nThe strengthening, revitalization and reorganization of the United \nNations must extend to all its organs and organizations. In this context we \nwelcome the concrete steps that our Secretary-General has taken in \nstreamlining the Secretariat. The United Nations is finally being geared to \nundertake its peace-keeping, peace-making and humanitarian relief work \neffectively. We urge that a similar effort be made to ensure that the \nmultitude of organs and agencies involved in development be streamlined and \nrevitalized with the same vigour. \nWe have listened carefully to the various views on reforming and \ndemocratizing the United Nations. This is an extremely important matter that \nmust take into account the significant historical changes and the current \nmembership of the international body. There is need for a new enlightened \nbalance among the principal organs of the United Nations. The General \nAssembly must be provided with more responsibility, and the International \nCourt of Justice with more authority. \nFinally, the United Nations is no longer the hostage of ideological \nconflict and now has new found respect and confidence. While this opportunity \nmust not be missed, the path ahead is a long one, and the United Nations must \nmove quickly to make itself relevant and capable of meeting the \nresponsibilities it has long not been permitted to carry out. But above all \nthe United Nations must be fair in fulfilling the aspirations and meeting the \nhopes and needs of all its Members, big and small. "

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, I wish to greet this Assembly and to convey to it our esteem as well \nas Tunisia's appreciation for the United Nations' tireless efforts to realize \nthe aspirations of mankind for peace, security and prosperity. \nI should like to take this opportunity to repeat my warm congratulations \nto you, Mr. President, on your election to preside over this session. We know \nthat your skills will contribute to the success of our work. I should also \nlike to command the positive role played by your predecessor, \nMr. Samir Shihabi, representative of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, \nwhose activities have extended the Arab and Muslim to the international level \nunder the leadership of King Fahd Bin Abdul Aziz, Custodian of the Two Holy \nMosques. Your predecessor made a major contribution to the work of the \nGeneral Assembly at its forty-sixth session. \nI wish also to congratulate Mr. Boutros Boutros Ghali, the new \nSecretary-General of our Organization and wish him every success in his \nmission. He has embarked on his work with his accustomed characteristic \ndynamism and determination, which augur well for our Organization's future. \nI welcome the new Member States recently admitted to the Organization. \nNo doubt, they will make a valuable contribution to the work of the \ninternational community in the service of security, peace and justice. \n\nFor a number of years now, the world has been undergoing radical changes \nwhose effects are beginning to make themselves felt at the international \nlevel. Detente is starting to emerge within the community of nations, and to \ncreate a climate conducive to the advent of world peace and security and the \nattainment of the lofty objectives that inspired the establishment of the \nUnited Nations. \nThe international community has welcomed the dawning of a new era based \non peace, security and the upholding of human rights in the wake of the ending \nof the cold war with its ideological conflicts that were the source of \ntensions and disputes in all parts of the world. Those changes show that the \ninternational community has begun to regain its self-confidence and to put its \nfaith in concerted international action in the knowledge that international \nproblems can be resolved only through the strict application of the principles \nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which all Member States have \nundertaken to uphold. \n \nTunisia, in this new era continues to be devoted to the noble purposes \nand principles upon which the United Nations was founded, and, therefore, \nconsiders that the desired new world order must be forged, as of necessity, \nthrough a process of peaceful and lasting settling of conflicts and resolving \ndisputes by dialogue and negotiation with a view to establishing peace and \nsecurity in the world. \nDespite the encouraging developments in international relations, the \nworld today still faces major challenges in all fields and at all levels. We, \ntherefore, must show realism and determination in facing up to those \nchallenges within the context of the just and equitable application of \ninternational legality. \nConsequently, it is the first duty of the international community to \nfocus, without delay, on questions that threaten peace, on the basis of the \nnorms of international law and the values enshrined in the United Nations \nCharter as well as on the methods of preventive diplomacy as set out by the \nSecretary-General in his \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277). \nThe cause of the Palestinian people is one of the most important of these \nquestions. This people has for too long been the victim of injustice, and it \nis time for it to exercise, like all other peoples, its right to \nself-determination and the establishment of its own independent State on its \nterritory, in conformity with international legality and international \ninstruments. \nProceeding from the stance of championing the rights of peoples and \nadhering to the tenets of international legality, Tunisia has supported the \nefforts of the United States of America, the Arab countries and the \ninternational community to hold a peace conference on the Middle East, just as \nit has supported every constructive effort aimed at settling this question on \n\nthe basis of returning the occupied Arab territories, including Al Quds, and \nthe exchange of land for peace pursuant to Security Council resolutions \n242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978). \nTunisia has followed with interest the bilateral negotiations between the \nparties concerned, particularly Israel and the Palestinian delegation acting \non the instructions of the Palestine Liberation Organization. It has also \nparticipated in the multilateral negotiations on the Middle East. \nWhile reiterating its support for the peace process, Tunisia joins the \ninternational community in calling upon Israel to put an end to its policy of \nsettlement which aims at changing the demographic and social structure of the \noccupied Arab territories, changing their Arab cultural identity and imposing \na fait accompli, as it is this policy that poses a major obstacle to the \nachievement of peace in the region. \nTunisia has welcomed the positive developments witnessed by the people of \nSouth Africa in the direction of constitutional reform and the search for a \nformula that may lead to the emergence of a new, democratic society based on \nequal opportunity and the elimination of disparities. However, the halting \nnegotiations between the authorities in Pretoria and the African National \nCongress of South Africa and the escalation of violence are cause for grave \nconcern. \nTunisia again expresses the hope that the necessary conditions will be \nmet for the resumption and continuation of negotiations and the establishment \nof a transitional Government to implement the desired political reforms with a \nview to establishing a just and egalitarian society and putting an end to all \nforms of racial discrimination and all types of violence. In this way, the \npeople of South Africa will be able to exercise their legitimate rights. \n\nparticipate in bringing about the recovery of the African continent and \ncontribute to the strengthening of peace in the world. \nIn this respect, we wish to express our highest regard for the efforts of \nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, as well as those of the \nOrganization of African Unity under the chairmanship of President Abdou Diouf \nwith a view to reopening dialogue and putting an end to the use of violence as \na means of settling disputes. \nThe developments that have taken place on the international scene have \nsubstantially contributed to the defining of the parameters of the new world \norder and highlighted the tendency to effectively implement the principles and \nachieve the goals of the United Nations Charter. This has given the \nOrganization a prominent status in the international arena, imparted a great \ndeal of effectiveness to its action and enabled it to move rapidly and \neffectively, whenever possible, to put out the fires of discord, settle \nconflicts and restore lasting peace. \nProceeding from this, Tunisia considers that the new world order cannot \nemerge and gain strength without the elimination of all sources of tension in \nthe world. \nTunisia, while welcoming the start made in putting into effect principles \nthat it has long upheld, notes with deep concern the emergence of new sources \nof tension in the world, particularly in the Arab Maghreb region, in Somalia \nand in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the exacerbation of the dispute \nbetween the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United Arab Emirates over the \nislands of Abu Musa, the Greater Tunb and the Lesser Tunb. \nAs far as the Arab Maghreb region is concerned, the Arab Maghreb Union is \nentering its fourth year. In that short period, it has taken significant \n\nsteps towards the establishment of its structures within the framework of \nrotation of its chairmanship between its member States. Nevertheless, certain \ndifficulties exist and stand in the way of the Union. We are trying to \novercome those difficulties and to find appropriate solutions to them. Among \nthe difficulties is the crisis between Libya and certain Western countries. \nWe hope a peaceful solution will be found for this dispute within the \nframework of international legality, particularly since Libya has accepted \nSecurity Council resolution 731 (1992). We hope that dialogue will be pursued \nwith a view to finding a political solution that would be in the interest of \nthe young Arab Maghreb Union and spare the region any escalation that may lead \nto instability. \nTunisia also wishes to voice its profound concern over the situation in \nthe sister country of Somalia due to the famine, the prevalent violence and \nthe devastating war that threatens Somalia's very existence. Tunisia urges \nthe parties to the conflict to put an end to the bloodshed and hopes that they \nwill try and find an appropriate solution to the crisis, through a balanced \napproach of dialogue and negotiation. \nDespite its modest means, Tunisia has contributed to the humanitarian \nassistance extended to that sisterly country. In this respect, we wish to \ndraw attention to the final document of the tenth summit meeting of the \nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries on the subject of Somalia and urge the \ninternational community to work for its implementation in order to put an end \nto the martyrdom of the Somali people. \nWhile denouncing the deterioration of the situation and the continuation \nof acts of aggression, as well as the \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" to which the people \nof Bosnia and Herzegovina are being subjected, Tunisia considers that these \n\ninhuman acts perpetrated against the Bosnian people should inspire the \ninternational community to show more resolve and firmness in its actions so as \nto preserve the existence of that people and protect its rights. \nTunisia supports the Security Council resolutions calling for measures to \nprotect the population and halt this savage aggression against the Bosnian \npeople, convinced as it is that such actions constitute a breach of the rights \nof peoples and a flagrant violation of the values and principles enshrined in \nthe United Nations Charter. \n\nThe escalation of violence is also illustrated elsewhere by Iran's \nmilitary occupation of the islands of Abu Mousa, the Greater Tunb and the \nLesser Tunb, which belong to the United Arab Emirates. Proceeding from its \nadherence to the principles of the United Nations and tenets of international \nlegality, which constitute an indivisible whole, Tunisia supports the United \nArab Emirates' full and complete sovereignty over its territory, recalls the \nresolution adopted by the League of Arab States on this question, emphasizes \nthe necessity of avoiding any act that would threaten the security of the Gulf \nregion and calls for compliance with the principle of good-neighbourliness, \nfor acting in accordance with international treaties and other instruments, \nand for resorting to the bodies that are competent to settle disputes of this \nkind. \nIn the same vein, we wish to reiterate our support for the sovereignty \nand territorial integrity of Kuwait, in accordance with international legality \nand also wish to voice our concern over the destiny of the fraternal Iraqi \npeople, as well as for the territorial integrity of Iraq, which must be \npreserved. In this connection, we hope to see our brethren in the region in a \nposition to treat the past as a closed issue, in consonance with the spirit of \nunderstanding and solidarity that has always inspired the Arab nation. \nThe new international order will not be able to take shape unless an end \nis put to the arms race, which constitutes a constant threat to international \ndetent-p. Tunisia, which, since the Paris Conference, has made clear its \nposition with regard to chemical weapons, welcomes the progress made towards \ngeneral and complete disarmament, particularly with respect to weapons of mass \ndestruction, which consume vast sums of money and huge resources. We also \n\nwelcome the current efforts to strengthen and consolidate the process. In \nthis respect, the agreement on chemical weapons recently concluded in Geneva \nis a positive step towards disarmament and the strengthening of international \npeace and security. However, the implementation of that agreement must go \nhand in hand with the elimination of other types of weapons of mass \ndestruction, particularly nuclear weapons, especially in such a sensitive \nregion as the Middle East. \nWe see the new international order as one of freedom, democracy, and \nhuman rights, which are noble and universal values that are consonant with the \nideals of the United Nations, to which the Tunisia of the new era subscribes. \nOn the basis of this conviction, Tunisia is working to make those values a \nreality within the framework of a democratic process, the underlying \nfoundations of which are the upholding of the rule of law and the functioning \nof the State through institutions based on respect for individual and \ncollective freedoms within a tolerant and open civil society where justice, \nfreedom, and equality prevail for all citizens and human rights are protected \nand promoted. \nTunisia is convinced that genuine democracy rejects anarchy, the pursuit \nof supremacy, and violence. Democracy is a civilizing value based on a sense \nof responsibility and self-denial within the framework of recognized moral and \nsocial principles. Nevertheless, the success of this process also depends on \nrecognition, in the case of every country of that country's specific features, \nas well as its characteristic socio-economic and cultural conditions, which \nare the foundations of their identity. \nTunisia takes pride that it will host, next autumn, the conference \norganized by the United Nations on human rights in Africa as a prelude to the \n \nInternational Conference on Human Rights. We also take pride in the fact that \nour country has been chosen by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and \nCultural Organization to host the Conference on human rights and education to \nbe held next November. \nProceeding from the conviction that democracy and development are \nmutually complementary, Tunisia has given human rights their full meaning by \nextending them to the political, economic, social, cultural, and environmental \nspheres. In this respect, we see it as one of our first duties to improve the \nquality of life in a natural environment not threatened by desertification, \npollution, or erosion. For this reason, Tunisia has decided to draw up an \nintegrated national plan for the protection of the environment, and \nparticipated in the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, where it put \nforward constructive proposals. \nTunisia regards the protection of human rights as a daily duty that it \ndevelops and strengthens in the interest of its citizens in order to ensure \nfor them a life of stability and dignity within a framework of sustainable \ndevelopment. The protection of human rights, in our view, means reconciling \nthe interests of the individual and those of the community, for the interests \nof individuals would lose all meaning if society were threatened by anarchy \nand instability as a result of extremism and terrorism, especially when the \nperpetrators employ violence and exploit religion for unstated ends. \nThe Tunisia of 7 November, being deeply attached to its Arab-Islamic \nidentity, has always been one of the torchbearers of Islam and one of its \nlargest bases. It therefore believes deeply in the message of openness, \nbrotherhood, and coexistence preached by our Muslim religion and by the other \n\nrevealed religions in general. Accordingly, concerned to prevent religion \nfrom being turned from its true path and to protect human rights and civil \nsociety from the actions of those who exploit religion in order to attain \ntheir unstated objectives, Tunisia has decided to set extremism and terrorism \nin their true context, and has done so in many regional bodies. \nTunisia believes that it is time to adopt a collective position regarding \nthis phenomenon and to cooperate sincerely in order to isolate extremist and \nterrorist groups which hide behind religion, in order for us to protect the \ninterests of our peoples and our States and create conditions that make it \npossible to address the real problems, face up to the challenges and protect \nreligion from any attempt to exploit and manipulate it. \nIt is common knowledge that many countries continue to suffer from a \ndifficult international economic situation that impedes their progress and \ndevelopment. These countries await with impatience the fruits of the new \nworld order in the hope that this new era will be one not only of peace and \nstability, but also of development and economic and social prosperity. \nAlthough peace-keeping is the main concern of the new world order, the \nfact remains that its viability will depend on its ability to assign to \neconomic and social issues their full measure of importance and to establish \njust and equitable rules for international cooperation. For this reason, we \nbelieve that the international community is today called upon to realize the \naspirations of .our peoples regarding cooperation, solidarity, and the \nsettlement of their basic problems. Thus, the new international order has a \nduty to reconsider the structure of the world economy with an eye to the \ngeneral interest, without discrimination or exclusion. \n\nGiven the exacerbation of the world economic crisis and its adverse \neffects on the process of development in the countries of the Third World \ndespite the major efforts and immense sacrifices made by our peoples, it is \nessential that we put our heads together and try to find the best means of \nfacing up to the economic problems of the world in an appropriate manner. The \naim should be to enable our peoples to fully enjoy their economic, social and \ncultural rights and to make it possible for them to contribute to the \ndemocratization of our societies and the development of relations of \nunderstanding and friendship between peoples. \nMoreover, we hope the wealthy countries will be convinced of the need to \nexpand their cooperation and to change the way they deal with us \neconomically. This would encourage us and show appreciation for our efforts \nand sacrifices in the drive to restructure our economies. What we are asking \nthe developed nations to do is to renounce their protectionist policies \nagainst our exports, and to seek a solution to the debt problems. \nWhile endorsing the Secretary-General's ideas in his \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" \nwherein he calls for regional arrangements to contain crises in accordance \nwith Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, Tunisia will continue \nto contribute with all the means at its disposal to the strengthening of this \nprocess. It will do so in particular in the bodies of which it is a member, \nnamely, the Organization of African Unity, the League of Arab States, the \nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement. We also \nhope that international economic issues will be accorded a larger share in the \nprocess of restructuring the United Nations, because of their effects on the \nfuture of peace in the world. \n\nTunisia is convinced that the United Nations has a decisive role to play \nin the process of development in the Third World, and hopes that the \nOrganization will continue to play that role in order to help those countries, \nwhich still sorely need the support of the Organization, and its specialized \nagencies in finding appropriate solutions to the problems of indebtedness, \ndeteriorating commodity prices, deteriorating terms of trade, drying up \ncapital inflows to middle-income countries and the transfer of the wealth of \ndeveloping countries to the rich creditor nations. \nIn this connection, Tunisia calls for a strengthening of trade in \naccordance with the international trade order which has emerged from the \nmultipartite trade negotiations at the eighth session of the United Nations \nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), as this would be the ideal \nframework for strengthening the efficacy of international trade. Tunisia also \ncalls for more participation by the developing countries in the \ndecision-making process relating to international trade. \nSocial questions today have assumed a higher position in the \nOrganization's scale of priorities, particularly the issues of employment, \nhealth, education and the environment, which play a highly significant role in \neliminating the causes of tension and in improving the quality of life for all-\nWhile welcoming the high priority accorded to such issues, Tunisia calls \nfor promoting the tendency further and for the allocation of more adequate \nfinancial resources that would make it possible to meet the needs of the \npeoples of the Third World and to enable them to exercise their natural rights \nto employment, education and health. Proceeding from this, Tunisia supports \nthe proposal for convening a world summit meeting on development in 1995 on \n\nthe occasion of the Organization's fiftieth anniversary, following the \ninternational Conference on Human Rights scheduled for next year, the \nConference on Population and Development that would be held in 1994 and the \nWomen's Conference in 1995. \nThe eyes of the peoples of the entire world are today turned towards the \nUnited Nations, which is the living conscience of mankind and the beacon of \nits hope for a better future. \nTherefore, Tunisia has renewed its longstanding attachment to the Charter \nand the goals of the Organization. It has always supported the Organization's \nefforts and is determined to support its action to ensure that law, justice \nand peace will have the upper hand in the world. The best proof of the stance \nis, of course, my country's continued participation in the peace-keeping \noperations organized by the United Nations, in the Congo and Namibia, in the \nsixties and, recently, in Western Sahara, Cambodia and the former Yugoslavia. \nWe are convinced that the establishment and maintenance of peace depend \non the intensification of peace-keeping operations whenever the need arises. \nIn this connection, it may be necessary to conduct an in-depth study of the \nbest means of tightening and supporting those operations while increasing the \nOrganization's ability to continue to stage them successfully. \nThe ideas and proposals that were thrashed out in the summit meeting of \nthe Security Council last January have highlighted the need to develop and \nmaintain a balanced relationship between the General Assembly, the Security \nCouncil and the Organization's Secretary-General, as well as for a \nstrengthening of the role of the General Assembly, in the light of the \n\nimportant functions assigned to the Assembly under the Charter and in \nconformity with the new realities that have been created by the current \ndevelopments in the international situation. The Security Council's role \nshould be developed in consonance with those developments. \nWe consider that it is high time we considered collectively the \nrepresentation of the international community in the Security Council in the \nlight of the great responsibilities assigned to it in maintaining \ninternational peace and security. \nIn so doing, we shall have strengthened the democratic character of the \norgans of the United Nations in conformity with the new spirit of democracy \nnow prevailing in the world. This will satisfy the yearnings of many peoples \nand will ensure for our Organization greater confidence and credibility in the \neyes of international public opinion. \nWe are fully convinced that our Organization, by virtue of its great \nexperience and influence, is capable of giving effect to this ambitious \ncivilizing project and making a valuable contribution to the strengthening of \ncooperation among Member States within the framework of a new outlook that \nwill open up promising vistas for mankind and give it renewed hope and \nconfidence. \nTunisia has already put forward many ideas and proposals to bring about \nthese new reforms and tendencies that, in our view, must shape international \neconomic relations. On more than one occasion it has made appeals to this \nend, most significantly in the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session by \nPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali from this very rostrum, for the conclusion \nof a covenant of peace and progress between the industrialized and the \ndeveloping countries. \n\nThe constructive spirit prevailing in the work of this session once again \nconfirms the determination of the United Nations to play to the full its \nassigned role in the international arena in the maintenance of peace and \nsecurity in the world. We are convinced that the Organization will succeed in \nconsolidating the achievements of mankind and in providing it with the \nopportunities it needs for progress and prosperity."

        "file_text": "It is a great pleasure for me to \ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to your high office at such an \nimportant juncture in the history of the United Nations. I should also like \nto greet the many new Members that have been admitted to our Organization in \nrecent months. We welcome them all and look forward to cooperating closely \nwith them in our efforts to strengthen the United Nations. \nMany of us had hoped to see a new, more equitable world order emerge in \nthe wake of the profound changes we have experienced over recent years. \nUnfortunately, this has not been the case. The tragic conflicts in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and Somalia illustrate the challenges we are up against. In many \nways they are similar. Underlying ethnic, religious, social and economic \nproblems were \\\"frozen\\\" during the cold war. They were suppressed rather than \ndealt with in a constructive way. Democratic traditions were not allowed to \ndevelop. Some leaders have exploited the absence of democratic traditions, \nappealing to narrow ethnic and even clan interests. The disastrous \nconsequences are brought home to us daily on our television screens. In \nSomalia the political crisis has been deepened by extreme poverty and by \nenvironmental degradation. \nWe must strongly condemn the unspeakable cruelties being committed in \nBosnia and Herzegovina and other parts of the former Yugoslavia. We cannot \naccept, and will not recognize, any attempts to change international borders \nby force. The parties must understand that they cannot achieve their goals by \narmed force. I urge the parties to the conflict to cease fighting at once. \nThe \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" in the former Yugoslavia is an unacceptable violation of \n \ninternational law and must be brought to a halt. An international tribunal \nshould be set up to punish all those responsible for the war crimes that are \nnow being committed. All prison and detention camps should be closed down \nimmediately, and the captives must be allowed to return freely to their homes \nwithout any further harassment. \nStrict observance of the sanctions introduced by the United Nations \nSecurity Council is essential to exert maximum pressure on the parties \nconcerned. As the former Yugoslavia no longer exists, Serbia and Montenegro \nmust apply for membership of the United Nations, along with other new States. \nWe must all give our firm and unequivocal support to the London Agreement and \nthe Geneva process. All parties to the conflict must now honour their \ncommitments. The United Nations Protection Force, in which we are proud to \ntake part, is doing a tremendous job under exceedingly difficult \ncircumstances, particularly in Bosnia. We must all stand united behind the \nUnited Nations and refrain from actions that will only prolong the conflict. \nOur first priority must be to alleviate the sufferings of the civilian \npopulation by providing humanitarian assistance. A great number of human \nlives will depend upon how the United Nations manages to protect humanitarian \nsupplies and monitor heavy weaponry. I strongly condemn the cowardly attacks \non United Nations forces engaged in humanitarian supply operations around \nSarajevo. Those guilty of these crimes must be found and brought to trial. \nIt is now of the utmost importance to prevent the conflict in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina from spreading throughout the Balkan area. We must consider all \navailable means, and support those measures which have already been applied. \nThe recent decision by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to \nsend observer teams to Kosovo, Sandzak and Vojvodina is an important step. \n\nWhile we are grieved by the tragic war, we must not lose hope. We must \nassist the people of the former Yugoslavia to accept and respect each other \nand to come to terms again, making peace through reconciliation. We must \nencourage the forces of moderation and good will; we must ensure that all \nparties take part in a peace-making process. We must act justly - and, if \nneed be, forcefully. \n\nIn Somalia the United Nations must give top priority to providing \nsufficient food and medical supplies to the starving people. This will be an \nimportant test of our collective ability to respond quickly and effectively in \nthe face of natural and man-made disasters. Somalia also needs assistance in \nfinding political solutions to its internal problems, and, equally \nimportantly, in building a more sustainable economy. Norway supports a United \nNations peace-keeping presence in this war-torn country, and we are willing to \nparticipate in such an operation. \nThe time for peaceful change in South Africa is running out. We condemn \nthe recent killings of innocent people, and call on the South African \nGovernment to restrain the police and the army throughout South Africa, \nincluding the so-called homelands. We are confident that this can be \nachieved, if it really wants to. \nWe urge the South African Government to meet the reasonable demands of \nthe African National Congress of South Africa so that negotiations can be \nresumed in order to work out the framework for adopting a new constitution and \nestablishing an interim government. Norway is prepared to contribute at a \npractical level by sending observers to monitor the violence and facilitate \nthe negotiation process in South Africa. We will maintain our economic \nboycott until we see some real progress in the negotiations. \nAll these crises and conflicts demonstrate the need for more effective \ninternational crisis-prevention and crisis-management mechanisms. The end of \nthe cold war has opened a window of opportunity for the United Nations to live \nup to the great objectives of its Charter. We must seize that opportunity. \nThe Secretary-General's report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277) is a \nstarting-point for a serious discussion on how this can be achieved. \n\nWe need to consider further the circumstances under which the United \nNations should resort to real enforcement, mindful of our obligations under \nthe Charter. Burden-sharing is essential with regard to peace-keeping. Every \ncountry has a duty to participate, including those which so far, for various \nreasons, have refrained from getting involved. \nSome 35,000 Norwegian men and women have participated in a total of \n16 United Nations peace-keeping operations. We are prepared to intensify our \nefforts in this field. But our collective efforts must move beyond \ntraditional peace-keeping into such fields as refugee-repatriation, electoral \nassistance and human rights monitoring. This concept proved successful in \nNamibia and is now being put to a new test in Cambodia. As a means of \nimproving our capacity for such broader operations, we have proposed the \nestablishment of a special United Nations institute for education and training \nin peace-keeping and related activities. \nThere can be no lasting peace in the world as long as a large part of \nhumanity lives in misery and despair. Maintaining international peace and \nsecurity is a prime responsibility of the United Nations, as is promoting \neconomic and social progress and respect for human rights. \nWe must adamantly oppose any tendency to ignore the fundamental \nchallenges of the continuing North-South divide. Otherwise the very future of \nour planet is in danger. \nIn spite of remarkable economic and social progress in many developing \ncountries, the inequalities persist. According to the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme's latest human development report, the richest \n20 per cent of the world's population receive 83 per cent of total world \nincome, whereas the poorest 20 per cent have only 1.4 per cent. We cannot \nallow these inequalities to persist. \n\nThe African continent has been particularly hard hit by economic decline, \nand a concerted international effort must be mounted to reverse this \nunfortunate situation. \nTo break out of the development impasse, increased contributions from the \nindustrialized countries will be needed, in the form of better market access \nfor developing countries, more investment, increased development aid and debt \nrelief for the poorest countries. \nBut the slow rate of economic growth and high level of unemployment in \nmost countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development \nlimit demands for products from developing countries. The outlook is \nuncertain, and the unfinished business of the Uruguay Round adds to this \nuncertainty. Capital needs are enormous; competition for capital is fierce. \nDeveloping countries are the losers. \nThe current financial and monetary instability poses great risks to \ncountries and individuals. We need to impose stability and prevent \nspeculation from throwing national economies into peril. There is no \nalternative to effective coordination of financial and monetary policies. But \nthat coordination can succeed only when coupled with social purpose, a fair \ndistribution and public efforts to create employment. In fact, most of the \neconomic problems that we are faced with are linked to lack of coordination, \nto rivalry and to laissez-faire attitudes among industrialized countries. \nThe developing countries are, as always, the ultimate losers. Their best \nline of defence is to undertake policy reforms to mobilize their people, \neducate them and and diversify their economies. Development is not likely to \naccelerate without good governance, democracy, respect for human rights, \nreduced military spending and improved redistribution systems, with increased \nemphasis on health and education. \n \nAlleviating world poverty is necessary if we are to reduce the rapid \npopulation increase in many parts of the world. At present rates, the world \npopulation is doubling every 40 years, and could reach somewhere between \n8 billion and 14 billion by the middle of the next century. Keeping to the \nlow end of that scale will make all the difference to life on Earth and \nhumanity. \nWe must deal with population growth through an integrated human rights \napproach, including education and the enhancement of the status of women, \nimproved public health and family planning. \nConfronted with these great challenges, we find it a sad paradox that \ndevelopment aid flows continue to stagnate and remain at less than half of the \nUnited Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). \nNorway's official development aid has exceeded 1 per cent of our GDP for more \nthan 10 years, which reflects our strong commitment to the fight against \npoverty. \nAt the Rio Conference on Environment and Development it was made clear \nthat we are heading towards a crisis of uncontrollable dimensions unless we \nchange course. The North as well as the rich in the South will have to change \nconsumption and production patterns. \nDeveloping nations came to the Rio Summit with open economic demands, and \nunderstandably so: for them, the Conference was essentially about development \nand justice. \n \nAt Rio, we achieved progress in many fields, but too little in most \nfields and none at all in some fields. We opened two important conventions \nfor signature. It is imperative that we make them more effective. They will \nnot work unless all major countries sign, ratify and implement them. \nFurthermore, Rio made it clear that the challenges of dealing with \nenvironmental threats and poverty are cross-cutting, long term, predictable \nand unavoidable unless we establish a world order of burden-sharing, common \nperceptions and common responsibility. \nTherefore, critical decisions remain to be taken. Traditional \ninternational conferences run by consensus can advance only at the pace of the \nmost reluctant mover in each field. The future requires stronger \ndecision-making procedures. Nothing less will serve us. I welcome the \nhigh-level Commission on Sustainable Development and expect it to become \neffective under a revitalization of the economic and social responsibilities \nof the United Nations. Norway proposed the establishment of such a Commission \nand expects to take an active part in its work. \nThe challenge of economic and social development requires a more unified \napproach and stronger direction within the United Nations system. Over the \nyears the number of agencies, programmes and councils has mushroomed, with too \nlittle inter-agency cooperation. This cannot continue. We must streamline \nour organization to avoid duplication and to improve effectiveness. \nThe Nordic countries have addressed these challenges through the Nordic \nUnited Nations Project. Although we have made some headway, we need to \nproceed during the present session of the General Assembly. \nIn view of the greater demands now being made on the United Nations, we \nmust stress the importance of sound and predictable financing. Being the \n\neighth largest contributor to the United Nations system in absolute terms, and \nby far the largest in per capita terms, we find it exceedingly difficult to \nunderstand why so many countries fail to honour their obligations. \nIt is disappointing, to say the least, to read in the Secretary-General's \nreport: \n\\\"Perennial shortages, the absence of reserves, and a debilitating \nuncertainty over the immediate future, are the main characteristics of \nthe financial situation of the United Nations.\\\" (A/47/1, para. 46) \nImmediately preceding this sentence the Secretary-General points out that some \n$900 million in assessed contributions are unpaid, together with some \n$844 million dollars towards peace-keeping operations. \nFrankly, this is an unworthy situation. We must increase our financial \ndiscipline. The permanent members of the Security Council have a special \nresponsibility in this respect. And the question must be raised whether \ncountries should be eligible at all for membership of the Security Council if \nthey have not paid their dues. \nWe must be willing to provide the Secretary-General and his staff with \nthe necessary means to promote peace and to wage war against environmental \ndegradation and underdevelopment. \nOur daily diet of printed and electronic presents a picture of a \nworld in need of better governance and of more coordination. Our present \nforms of cooperation, developed in a less interdependent world, are still too \nweak and unlikely to stand the test of time. We should not pretend that they \ncan. \n"

We are most confident in his ability \nto guide deliberations in this distinguished gathering towards successful \nconclusions. \nAllow me also to express Swaziland's gratitude to his predecessor, \nAmbassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, for his extremely effective \nleadership as President at the forty-sixth session, during which much valuable \nwork was conducted. \nOur thanks and admiration are also due to the members of the Bureau, \nwhose role in the day-to-day activities is central to the success of the \nAssembly. \nI should also like to take this opportunity to express Swaziland's \nappreciation of the outstanding service given this Organization by the former \nSecretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, whose diplomatic experience \n\nand dynamic leadership contributed so much to the re-emergence of the United \nNations as the only international institution with the influence to improve \nsocial, economic and political standards throughout the world. \nOur congratulation, too, go to his successor, our new Secretary-General, \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has already shown the experience, diplomacy and \nwisdom necessary to make a success of this most important and challenging post. \nWe wish him strength through God's held and blessing as he continues to \nlead us in these difficult times. \nThis year has seen the admission of new Member States, once again \ndemonstrating the principle of extending the advantages of membership to all \nwho desire to embrace our founding Charter. We welcome our new Members, and \nwe are confident that their presence will contribute substantially towards \nthis new age of international understanding and cooperation, as we strive to \nattain universal harmony. \nMany obstacles remain in the way of true international peace and \nstability but, as has been shown in the past, with the release of East-West \ntension and the subsequent removal of the atmosphere of fear and mistrust \nwhich had so clouded past deliberations, this forum remains our one hope in \nour search for acceptable solutions to the many challenges that confront us. \nAlthough the Kingdom of Swaziland remains, thankfully, peaceful and \nstable, it is a fact that, in these times of global interdependence, we are \nsubject to, and affected by, the pressures or events occurring outside our \nborders; not just in our own subregion but also by the tragedies and crises \noccurring throughout the world. \nThe role of the United Nations as the most powerful and influential body \nfor immediate humanitarian aid, and as the most acceptable international \n\nbroker for peace, continues to stretch our collective resources to the \nutmost. The priorities for our efforts become ever harder to define, as the \nincidence of disaster and conflict, with their corresponding calls on our \nresources, appear to increase. \nWe in Swaziland accept our responsibility, through our membership of the \nUnited Nations, to lend our support wherever the call for humanitarian aid, \nand assistance to end the bloodshed of a conflict, is made, regardless of our \ndirect or indirect involvement in those situations. \nOur regular and prompt payment of dues testifies to our commitment to \nthis policy, and we are proud of our record. \nThe various unresolved conflicts on our own continent are, of course, of \nprimary consideration to us, and of immediate concern is the situation \naffecting our neighbour. South Africa. \nWe have watched as the momentous changes of the last two years have \nbrought the inevitable ebb and flow of hope and despair. We have been \nconstant in our support of a peaceful process, through negotiation, towards \nthe establishment of a new South Africa whose guiding principles would be \nacceptable to all partners, and we have been reassured by the words and \nactions of the United Nations in its acceptance of that goal. \nWe have suffered along with the victims, many of Swazi origin, of the \nterrible violence that continues to plague the peace process; and we welcomed \nthe initiative of the United Nations in dispatching a team of observers, under \nthe capable leadership of the distinguished Special Envoy, Mr. Virendra Dayal, \nto assess the violence in the townships. We are confident that they will \nsuccessfully bring to bear their collective expertise and experience in \nhelping to resolve this most distressing problem. \n\nSwaziland now urges all political leaders in South Africa to put aside \ntheir differences and to return to the negotiating table in a spirit of \ncompromise and conciliation for the sake of their country and for the future \nof their children. \nWe in southern Africa can only pray that there will be an early, peaceful \nconclusion of the process, so that we too can benefit from the advantages that \ncloser social and economic links with a new South Africa will inevitably bring \nus and the other countries of the subregion. \n\nThe situation within the borders of our other neighbour, Mozambique, \noffers at last some ray of hope for an early resolution, and our support for \nthe processes of peace there seem finally to have been rewarded. Swaziland \nwishes to express its deepest admiration and praise for all those involved in \nthe peace negotiations between FRELIMO and RENAMO, which resulted in the \nmomentous accord signed in Rome last month. In particular, the efforts of the \nGovernments of Italy, Portugal and the United States, and the individual \ncontribution of His Excellency President Robert Mugabe, deserve our applause. \nBut without the commitment of both sides of the dispute to peaceful \nsettlement, the assistance and advice of these international friends would \nhave been worthless. We salute the initiatives of both parties and entreat \nthem to carry through the undertakings of the accord without further bloodshed \nand with a determination to regain the peace which has so long been denied the \nMozambican people. \nThe crisis in Mozambique has a great and direct bearing on our own \nsituation. At least 80,000 Mozambican refugees currently enjoy Swazi \nhospitality at continuing great expense to our national economy in the \nform of resources in land, finance, employment opportunities and other social  \nservices. We, and indeed the refugees themselves, look forward to the \nresumption of a secure and peaceful atmosphere in Mozambique so that  \nrepatriation can reasonably take place and thus relieve the pressure of the  \nsubstantial burden that is being carried by us. \nJust as we continue to rely on the efforts of the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian agencies for help in coping \nwith these unfortunate victims, so we shall be looking for assistance when the \ntime comes for them to return home. We are confident that we, and the \nrefugees, deserve such aid. \nSwaziland welcomed the end of hostilities in Angola, and we would like to \nexpress our appreciation to those whose efforts brought the crisis to an end. \nWe now join the rest of the international community in praying for a \nsuccessful election process so that all Angolans will be able to reap the \nbenefits of peace. \nThe horrifying situation in Somalia continues to give us cause for grave \nconcern. The almost unbelievable proportions of the disastrous effects of \nfamine and the continuing interfactional fighting beg action on an \ninternational scale. We fully support all United Nations efforts to bring \nrelief to the starving, suffering millions. Words mean little in such \ncircumstances, but the people of Somalia should know that our prayers are with \nthem; with God's blessing and with positive assistance from us, they will pull \nthrough this dark episode in their country's history. \nThe situations in Chad, the Sudan and Liberia also give little cause for \nhope for early solutions. Again, we pledge our full support to all efforts to \nbring about peaceful and lasting solutions to these problems which affect the \nstability of our continent. \nIn Europe, too, the ravages and upheaval of war and social change have \nhad their devastating effect. The situation in former Yugoslavia in \nparticular gives immediate cause for concern, with the ongoing war in Bosnia \nand Herzegovina and the crises of uncertainty in the other newly-independent \n\nStates. The efforts of the United Nations and the European Community to bring \nabout peace are to be applauded and they deserve our fullest support. We pray \nthat sense will prevail amongst the leaders of different factions and that use \nwill be made of the negotiating table in bringing about an early end to the \nhorrific bloodshed in this unfortunate corner of Europe. \nWe applaud the work of the United Nations Special Envoy, Mr. Cyrus Vance, \nand that of the European representative. Lord Owen, in their extremely \ndifficult task as intermediaries. The performance of the multinational \nmonitoring force, operating under the most frustrating and challenging \nconditions, is also in the best United Nations traditions and deserves our \nadmiration and praise. \nSwaziland has been watching with great interest, and not a little \noptimism, the developments over the last year in the Middle East. The \ndisputes and conflicts in this important area have for too long been the cause \nof international concern, and we welcome all efforts to bring about an \natmosphere in which all parties can resolve their differences. The Government \nof the United States of America, in particular, deserves mention in its \ndetermination to get the Middle East peace initiative up and running. \nMoreover, the latest conciliative remarks by His Excellency, the new Israeli \nPrime Minister, with the correspondingly constructive responses from the \naffected countries, give cause for encouragement that our prayers for positive \nsteps towards the achievement of lasting peace in the whole region may at last \nbe answered. Much, of course, remains to be done, but we can only support and \nencourage all initiatives towards the achievement of this aim. \n\nSwaziland is distressed to hear of the latest disasters which have \nafflicted some areas of Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Philippines, the United \nStates of America and other countries in different parts of the world. The \ndisasters which have caused so many thousands of deaths and destroyed the \nhomes of millions constitute a crisis of unprecedented proportions. We join \nothers in the international community in pledging our moral support for \nimmediate substantial aid to relieve the suffering and to help rebuild the \nshattered economies of these areas. \nSwaziland joined the rest of the United Nations last year in welcoming \nthe two Koreas as Members of our Organization. The resolution of the crisis \nbetween these two countries has been on our agenda for a long time, and \nSwaziland welcomes and supports any initiative to bring about an atmosphere of \nconciliation and peace between them. \nWe call on the people of Afghanistan to use the present opportunity for \npeace to bury any divisive differences between them and to move on with the \ntask of national reconciliation and economic development so that all may enjoy \nthe hard-won fruits of peace. \nIn Cambodia, we have welcomed the efforts of our sizeable United Nations \npresence in assisting with the consolidation of positive trends towards peace \nand stability. We look forward to having a unified Cambodia add its \ninfluential support in the restoration of peace throughout the region of \nIndo-China. \nIn these and other conflicts around the world, the United Nations has \ndistinguished itself in trying to act as brokers for peace and as the provider \nof humanitarian aid. This has been achieved, often in the most hazardous and \ndifficult circumstances, but with an increasing rate of success and with the \nnoblest intentions of creating a safer, more stable world. To that end, the \n \ninitiatives towards limiting proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are \nof paramount importance in our efforts to bring about true international peace \nand harmony, and Swaziland gives these efforts its fullest support. \nThe pressing issue of the environment was important enough to attract all \nmembers of the United Nations family to the Earth summit in Brazil earlier \nthis year. \n\nThe commitment shown there by all participants, and ratified by a number \nof far-reaching treaties, to address the multiple problems posed by man's \nthoughtlessness and ignorance was fully justified and was a timely reminder of \nhow much irreparable damage we have already caused. For us in Swaziland, the \nSummit served as a catalyst in our efforts to become more aware of our \nenvironmental responsibilities, and we are now taking those responsibilities \nvery seriously indeed. In fact, no greater reminder of our own reliance on \nour natural resources was needed, as we found ourselves in the middle of the \nworst drought on record. \nIt is ironic that, as we strive as a nation to develop along the right \npaths and as our economic base becomes more and more dependent on increasingly \nsophisticated industrial development, it takes the failure of a basic natural \nresource to make us realize how complete our reliance still is on the basic \ngifts of nature and how carefully we must nurture our country's precious \nresources to ensure that future generations inherit a fruitful and productive \nland. \nWe are indebted to the United Nations for its prompt response in \nconvening the successful pledging conference in Geneva in June to benefit \nthose who have been hardest hit by the drought, and our gratitude is also due \nthose in the international community that responded so generously. \nBut a short-term response is not enough. We in the region have \nrecognized that our emphasis must now be on ensuring that we are adequately \nprepared for any such natural disaster in the future. We shall be looking to \nthe Organization for advice and assistance so that our people may never again \nsuffer as they have this past season. \n\nOne principle to which Swaziland is attaching increasing importance is \nthe linkage of our nation's development, both social and economic, to a \ndependence on closer cooperation with our regional partners. Social \ndevelopment is inextricably linked to economic performance, and the \neradication of many of our national social problems, such as poverty, \nunemployment, crime and the like, depends on improvement in our economic \nsituation. \nOur membership in such regional organizations as the Preferential Trade \nArea Authority and the Southern African Development Coordination Conference \nand the Treaty signed recently at the Organization of African Unity (OAU) \nsummit in Abuja, establishing the African Economic Community, point out our \nstrong commitment to improving our economic performance through closer \neconomic and trade cooperation with the rest of our continent. Those \norganizations and initiatives are serious attempts by Africans, for the \nbenefit of Africa, to pull themselves out of the economic and social quagmire \nof recent years. We deserve and expect the support, encouragement and \npositive assistance of the international community if we are to make a success \nof it and thereby reduce future dependence on the developed world. \nAfrica is disturbed to see much-needed developmental funds being diverted \nto other targets, and while Swaziland, for one, is making every effort to \nprepare itself to stand on its own, our country and others in our subregion \nare still in desperate need of continuing assistance in many areas, precisely \nso that we shall be able to establish the mechanisms and organizations that \nwill allow Africa to be self-sufficient in the future. \nSwaziland hopes and prays that Africa will not be neglected now at a time \nwhen assistance is most needed. That fact has been driven forcefully home to \n\nus with the production of the latest World Economic Survey, which, as is \ninevitable in the midst of an international economic recession, has once more \npainted a miserable picture for developing countries. For Africa, in \nparticular, the litany of depressing economic news makes for distressing \nreading. \nOne area of particular concern to us as we strive to become less \ndependent on the developed world is the widening gap between North and South, \nbetween the primary-commodity producers and the manufacturers of finished \nproducts, a situation exacerbated by the protectionist trade policies employed \nby some and by the inability to bring to a successful conclusion, so far, the \nUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. \nThose are some of the areas which inhibit the release of the developing \nworld from the chains of dependence on the developed countries. We appeal to \nall to address these problems in the only way that will produce results: in \nthe spirit of true international brotherhood within this family of nations. \nOur Organization has much to be proud of and much still left to do. The \nUnited Nations remains the only truly global forum in which the world's \nproblems can be discussed and from which the collective experience and \nexpertise of all our Member nations can be pooled to find solutions. \nSwaziland is proud to count itself one among this illustrious company and, on \nbehalf of His Majesty King Mswati III, Her Majesty the Indlovukazi and the \nwhole Swazi nation, I have the honour of once more reaffirming my Kingdom's \ncommitment to the guiding principles enshrined in the Charter of the United \nNations. \nMay almighty God watch over the deliberations of the Assembly and reward \nit with the success it deserves. \n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour \nand a particular pleasure for me, on behalf of the Albanian delegation and the \nAlbanian people, to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you, Sir, upon your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. \nIt is a tribute to your personal accomplishments, an honour to your country, \nand an expression of the qualitatively new role that countries in transition \nare playing in the international arena. I believe that the current session, \nunder your presidency, will successfully attain its goals, which are the goals \nof the international community at large. I should like to assure you of the \nsupport of the Albanian delegation in the Assembly's work during this session. \nI take this opportunity to convey my thanks and express my highest \nconsideration to your predecessor, Mr. Samir S. Shihabi, for the admirable way \nin which he presided over the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. \nAllow me also to extend my greetings to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the \nSecretary-General of the United Nations, for his commendable role at the head \nof the world Organization, for his contribution to the strengthening of the \nspirit of cooperation, and especially for his personal contribution to solving \nvarious problems in different hotbeds of tension in the world of today. \n \n29 \nMy special greetings go also to the 20 newly admitted Members of the \nOrganization, which are going to play their part in upholding the common \nvalues of the new society that is taking shape. Their accession to membership \nof this world body has enriched the universal character of the United \nNations. The Republic of Albania has strongly supported their membership, \nbelieving that it will further promote the peace process and strengthen the \ndemocratic way of development. \nSince the last session of the General Assembly we have witnessed a \nnumber of significant events which followed the cold war and which will have \nan effect on the future of mankind. The fundamental values of the \npost-cold-war era are being established. Confrontation between the blocs, \nand the attendant political tension, has been supplanted by the universal \nvalues of democracy and equality in international relations, which are \ninterdependent in terms of the economic and social development and security of \nevery country. This has been confirmed. Today, the aspirations of the \npeoples towards self-determination and their striving to establish their \nnational identity, which had been marred under communism, as well as their \nthirst for democracy and equality, have become the driving forces of the \nsituations we are faced with today. Nationalism is not a product of \ndemocracy. Nationalism is the affirmation of national identity which, only \nafterwards, will work towards integration. \nThe blows dealt by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to the \nparalytic system of some years ago are today translating euphoria into onerous \nefforts to overcome a very difficult period of trial and transition. The year \nthat has passed has strengthened the tendency towards political union and has \nwitnessed the victory of the basic principles of respect for human rights, \ndemocracy, the rule of law and the move towards the market economy system. \n \n30 \nThe contribution of the United Nations and in particular of the Security \nCouncil to these ends since the last session of the General Assembly has been \nremarkable. In seeking to add a human dimension to the delicate balances to \nbe struck, the United Nations is shouldering historic responsibilities. The \npolitical vector of its activities is aimed precisely at promoting those \nprinciples and thus at creating a common political psychology of thought and \naction. Unity in diversity that is, the realization of one's national \ninterests in the overall equation of world development is undoubtedly the \nfoundation and the raison d'etre of the Organization; it is the very \nembodiment of the predominance of peaceful reasoning over passionate action \nand the preservation of the very delicate balance between the two. \nThe resolutions of the Security Council, especially the one imposing \nsanctions against Serbia and Montenegro; the Middle East peace talks that are \nincreasing the chances of finding a solution; the talks on resolving the \nconflict between the communities in Cyprus, as well as other activities, all \nreaffirm the universality of the Organization and the overall impact of its \nunique and inalienable role, which is the universal yardstick in measuring \ncompliance with implementation of the principles of international law and \ntacit norms of world civilization. \n \n31 \nIn this context, Albania welcomes the recent contribution of the \nSecretary-General in the form of his report entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" as \na comprehensive approach to the challenges of the world of today and of the \nOrganization. \nThis session of the General Assembly gives Albania the opportunity to \nproclaim from this rostrum the remarkable victory scored by the democratic \nanti-communist forces in my country in the general parliamentary elections of \n22 May 1992 and in the local elections of 26 July. Those events finally \ndetermined the course upon which Albania has embarked and which it is \npersistently pursuing. Those events laid the foundations, in Albania, of the \nrule of law which is becoming institutionalized. They marked the beginning of \nour first epoch of non-communist, democratic governments, the first of which \nis implementing a very profound reform as the only course towards the overall \ntransformation and development of the political, economic, social and other \nfields, at the level of the individual and of society as a whole. \nMy Government's main goal is to establish the legal framework needed to \nfacilitate that reform in order to harmonize the integration of the Albanian \neconomy with the world economy, in order to eradicate the disastrous \nconsequences of isolation and to overcome the economic collapse which the \nGovernment inherited from many years of totalitarianism. \nThat, however, is not all the Government inherited. It also inherited \nactive human resources inclined to change, human beings full of potential who \nare endeavouring to follow the models of the new system, people who, for no \nfault of their own, lack experience. These are the people who are working to \nshape the new Albanian society, and to do so they have turned to international \npolitical life to find remedies against impatience. In this context, the \n \n32 \ninvolvement of various United Nations agencies such as the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United \nNations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF), already active in the country, is a valuable contribution \nto democracy in Albania. I would single out in particular the remarkable \ncontribution of the IMF in working out the programme of economic reform that \nis being implemented. \nAlbania is faced with a very challenging economic crisis resulting from \nthe total failure of the centralized economy which it inherited and from the \ninevitable difficulties of transition itself. At present, Albania is living \non the emergency humanitarian aid offered by the European Community and the \nItalian Government on the one hand, and on the modest contribution of the \ngrowing private sector on the other. The Albanian economy, in this initial \nphase of recovery, badly needs financial support, substantial investments and \nraw materials to invigorate industry and employ the large work force, one of \nthe youngest in Europe. Everything cannot of course be done overnight; hence \nthe difficulties of transition. Understanding, support and assistance on the \npart of the international community are the sole guarantees of improvement of \nthe situation in Albania and of the success of the reform. \nIn that process, Albania is trying to develop its economy against a \nbackground of environmental safety. We are fully aware of the possible \nconsequences of neglect, and equally aware of what we have inherited as a \nresult of underdevelopment in this regard. We look forward to benefiting from \nthe relevant experience which the United Nations has to offer. In this \ncontext, we welcome the outcome of the United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development held earlier this year in Rio. \n \n33 \nUnder those conditions, Albanian foreign policy has also acquired a new \ndimension and orientation. Concrete proof of its new orientation is the \nestablishment of diplomatic relations with a number of countries such as \nEstonia, Lithuania, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Croatia, the United Arab Emirates, \nParaguay and Qatar; the active participation of Albanian delegations in \nvarious activities such as the Black Sea initiative and the Conference on \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). In the course of this year, the \nRepublic of Albania has joined the International Fund for Agricultural \nDevelopment and has adhered to the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol on \nthe status of refugees. \nThe situation in my country is unfolding against a very tense and \nperilous background in the Balkans. In some parts of the region, \nunfortunately, the practices being carried out go against the general \npolitical orientation and acceptable norms of behaviour of a civilized \nsociety. All-out war has been going on in the former Yugoslavia for more than \na year now. The persistent efforts of the international community have been \nstubbornly flouted by malicious proponents of Serbian nationalism in its \nunprecedented affront to civilization and the norms of common democratic \nlife. For more than a year now, a number of international organizations have \nbeen directly seized of that crisis, which is ravaging more human lives by the \nday. The United Nations, the CSCE and the European Community, among others, \nhave been forced to consider stern measures to counter that uncivilized \nchallenge. The war, however, is still going on. \nAlbania, a neighbouring country in that region, is suffering the \nconsequences of regional insecurity. Moreover, my country, situated as it is \nbeside that region, is living under the constant threat and real danger of a \n \n34 \nspill-over of the conflict into Kosovo. That threat is even greater if we \ntake into account the continuing repression of the third group of peoples of \nthe former Yugoslavia, the anti-constitutional amendments there, the laws \ngoverning special circumstances, and the complete and total paralysis of \ninstitutional life. The danger becomes alarming if we take into account the \ncruel refusal by the Belgrade authorities to allow the exercise of \ninstitutional power by the Albanians of Kosovo, who are peacefully and \ndemocratically organized, in conformity with all the norms of international \nlaw. \nKosovo is one of the most delicate issues of the Yugoslav crisis. The \nconflict there is a highly political one, a conflict deriving from the \nimpossibility of coexistence with the occupier. It is a conflict between the \npeaceful exercise of the principle of self-determination and blatant \nhegemonistic refusal to allow that exercise. Consequently, the situation \nremains explosive. That is also the conclusion of a number of missions of the \nEuropean Community and the CSCE which have visited Kosovo. The international \ncommunity, fully aware and desirous of avoiding violence, is seized of the \nsituation. \nThe Albanian delegation, however, cannot but notice that preventive \ndiplomacy has not as yet yielded the desired results. The legitimate leaders \nof Kosovo, on their part, although determined to pursue the road of \nunconditional political dialogue to which the CSCE Helsinki summit gave its \nblessing, and which was refused by the authorities in Belgrade, are finding it \nmore and more difficult to keep the agitation of their people under control. \nThe sacred principles of the United Nations Charter, the Helsinki Final \nAct and other fundamental documents of world political life apply equally to \nthe Albanian people of Kosovo. Principles cannot be selectively applicable. \n \n35 \nThe Albanian side has, for a long time now, voiced its concern and called on \nthe international community to concert its efforts towards finding a just and \nlasting solution that would be acceptable to the parties involved. \nThe Yugoslav crisis is a complex one. As such, it has been considered by \na number of international bodies. The London Conference, the most recent \ninitiative, has set itself the task of finding an overall solution. Albania \nappreciates and endorses the praiseworthy contribution rendered by the United \nNations in trying to solve the crisis over the last year, especially now, as \nCo-Chairman of that Conference, which we believe will be able to ensure the \npolitical commitment of all parties. \nAlbania is participating in that Conference in order to make its \ncontribution to its proceedings, particularly as regards the question of \nKosovo. And in those endeavours, it will continue to advocate the finding of \nan acceptable solution. In our view, the Yugoslav crisis is the crisis of \npeoples who cannot live under Serbian hegemony any longer; it is not a \nconstitutional crisis or a crisis among republics only. Accordingly, a \nsolution will entail broader direct participation. It will entail the full \nparticipation of the legitimately mandated representatives of Kosovo when \ntheir future is being discussed. It will entail international mediation. \nThat is the only way to control the various factions which are seeking to \nobstruct the way to peace. The Republic of Albania trusts that the United \nNations, with its valuable contribution, will ensure the triumph of reason \nover passions, and will adopt the measures necessary to enforce the \nimplementation of its decisions and to stand forcefully against the policy of \nfait accompli. \n \n36 \nThe social model to come embodies the loftiest standards of respect for \nthe human being. The new world order, based on security, understanding and \ncooperation, is the guarantee that current structures will be strengthened and \nfurther developed. All of us must contribute to strengthening this edifice. \nThe United Nations will continue to provide us with a framework in which \npeoples can count on good will and mutuality. \n"

        "file_text": "Let me first convey to Mr. Ganev my \ncongratulations on his election as President of this session. His election is \na fitting tribute to his personal and professional qualities, and to his \ncountry, Bulgaria, which is playing an increasingly important role in \ninternational affairs. We wish him success in accomplishing his tasks, and we \npledge to him our support and cooperation. \nI would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the \nSecretary-General, Ambassador Boutros Boutros-Ghali, especially for his \nefforts to help find peaceful solutions to conflicts throughout the world. We \nwish him success and will support him in every way possible in his pursuit of \nimplementing the objectives and principles of the United Nations. \nWe congratulate and look forward to working with all of the States \nrecently admitted to the United Nations. \nToday, Estonia's most vital task is to augment and secure our newly \nrestored independence, including further development of our democratic \ninstitutions, our economy, our national security and our international \nrelations. \nI will begin by addressing accusations made here last week regarding \nalleged human rights abuses in Estonia by Russian Foreign Minister \nAndrei Kozyrev. It is incomprehensible to us that Mr. Kozyrev maintains that \nforeign citizens should be allowed to vote in Estonian parliamentary \nelections. Mr. Kozyrev's suggestions that minorities in some countries should \nbe placed under United Nations trusteeship puzzles us, since Article 78 of the \nsame Charter of the United Nations to which he referred states: \n\n\\\"The trusteeship system shall not apply to ... Members of the United \nNations, relationship among which shall be based on respect for the \nprinciple of sovereign equality.\\\" \nIt should be further noted that, according to United Nations documents, the \nterm \\\"minority\\\" does not apply to foreign nationals, migrant workers and \ncolonists. \nI would like to take this opportunity to inform the Assembly that Estonia \nhas invited a mission from the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \nEurope Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights in Warsaw to \ninvestigate any and all allegations of human rights violations in Estonia. I \ninvite the Russian Federation likewise to invite a similar mission to visit \nand review Russia's recent human rights record, especially with respect to \nminority rights. \nDuring the year since independence was restored, Estonia has made every \neffort to create a State based on equal justice for all. On 21 October 1991, \nEstonia acceded to fundamental international agreements protecting human \nrights, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, \nthe Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political \nRights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural \nRights. Estonia has embarked on the long and arduous process of updating \nlegislation inherited from the Soviet occupation, bringing its laws into \ncompliance with international human rights norms. \nIn a referendum held on 28 June 1992 Estonian citizens approved a new \ndemocratic Constitution. According to its Constitution, Estonia is a \nparliamentary republic that guarantees a division of powers and independent \ncourts. Elections for a new Parliament and President the first free. \n\ndemocratic elections in more than 50 years were held nine days ago, on \n20 September, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the new \nConstitution. All Estonian citizens, defined by the 1938 pre-Soviet \noccupation Law on Citizenship and additional legislation that expanded \nenfranchisement, were entitled to vote. These laws also provide a legal basis \nfor those people who settled in Estonia as a result of Soviet occupation to \napply for Estonian citizenship by naturalization, if they so desire.* \nNumerous international experts have concluded that Estonia's citizenship \nlaw is among the most liberal in the world. \nEstonia has historically acted as a bridge between Western Europe and \nRussia. Relations of good-neighbourliness with Russia, in which both parties \nrespect the other's sovereignty and laws, and strictly adhere to principles \nregarding the inviolability of State borders and non-interference in the \ninternal affairs of another State, will allow Estonia to continue its \nintermediary role to the mutual benefit of both States. \nThe realization of this mediatory role has been complicated by \ndifferences between Estonia's and Russia's interpretation of the legal status \nof the Republic of Estonia. Estonia considers itself to be the same State as \nthe pre-Second World War Republic of Estonia, whose legal de jure continuity \nwas not interrupted by German occupation or Soviet occupation and annexation. \nAll consequences of this annexation are thus ex tunc not valid from their \ninception, a view that is shared by nearly all countries of the world. \nSeveral pre-war agreements concluded with States that recognize the legal \ncontinuity of Estonia have recently re-entered into force. \n\nEstonia also respects the principle of the legal continuity of \ncitizenship. Because Russia is the self-styled successor State to the Soviet \nUnion, Estonia considers citizens of the former Soviet Union who currently \nreside in Estonia as a result of Soviet occupation to be Russian citizens, \nunless they have become citizens of another country. \nRussia, however, believes that Estonia is a new State, created in 1991 as \na result of the disintegration of the Soviet Union, although the \ndisintegration of the Soviet Union occurred after the re-establishment of \nEstonia's independence. \n\nThe development of Estonian-Russian relations must be viewed in the \ncontext of the development of democracy in both countries. The Estonian \nfreedom movement had a positive influence on the democratization of Russia and \nother Central and Eastern European countries. Estonia's declaration of \nsovereignty on 16 November 1988 served as a practical example for other \nfreedom movements. \nIt is interesting to note that Russian democrats, including \nBoris Yeltsin, printed their newspapers in Estonia when printing such papers \nwas forbidden in Russia, helping to spread democratic ideals in Russia. \nA treaty between Estonia and Russia in which both countries recognized \nthe other as independent and sovereign States was signed on 12 January 1991. \nEstonia considers this treaty to be one of the cornerstones of \nEstonian-Russian relations, and places great value on the fact that Russia was \none of the first States to recognize the restoration of Estonian independence. \nUnfortunately, there are Russian politicians who assert that Estonia \nshould not be considered separate from Russia. They hold that Russia has \nhistorical and geopolitical claims to Estonian territory and that Estonia has \nno right to independence. There is a desire to preserve a Russian military \npresence in Estonia at any cost, and to bind Estonia to the Russian Federation \nthrough an international campaign which demands Estonian citizenship for \nRussian citizens while retaining Russia's right to be their guardian and \nprotector. \nHaving been a victim of the Soviet Union's imperialist policies for more \nthan 50 years, Estonia has not only the right under international law, but \nalso the moral obligation to demand that Russia withdraw its military forces \nand refrain from interfering in Estonia's internal affairs. \n\nThe need for a withdrawal of Russian armed forces from Estonia is the \nprimary stumbling block in bilateral relations between Estonia and the Russian \nFederation. While we acknowledge that the leadership of Russia now has a \nbetter appreciation of our demands than at the beginning of our negotiations, \nEstonia still calls for international support to accelerate the unconditional, \nearly, orderly and complete withdrawal of foreign military forces from \nEstonian soil. We also appeal for the ex-Soviet military nuclear reactors in \nEstonia to be placed under international supervision. \nThis is why we are presenting a draft resolution to the General Assembly \non the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Baltic States. A similar \nresolution was adopted by the recently concluded Summit of the Conference on \nSecurity and Co-operation in Europe. This reflects our belief that, although \nregional conflicts and disputes should be resolved on a regional basis, the \nUnited Nations should be ready to act preventively, and should express its \nopinion on matters which may potentially affect the security of a whole \ncontinent. \nNone the less, I must emphasize that throughout history economic, \ncultural and scientific cooperation have played an important, positive role in \nEstonian-Russian relations, and Estonia sincerely hopes this cooperation will \ncontinue. The integration of both Estonia and Russia into a democratic Europe \nwill also help ensure that our relations remain good-neighbourly in the long \nrun. \nEstonians have strong historical, cultural and linguistic ties to the \nNordic countries. These ties, which the Soviet system tried to sever, are now \nactively being restored. As an illustration of how quickly bilateral \nrelations have changed for Estonia, I would mention that Finland recently \n\nsurpassed the Commonwealth of Independent States as Estonia's number one \ntrading partner. \nEstonia embarked on the path of economic reform towards a market economy \nat the same time as it launched its political battle for independence. As a \ncountry in transition, we have progressed to a situation in which the vestiges \nof the command economy have almost been eliminated and the first signs of a \nhealthy market economy have appeared. \nThe monetary reform carried out in Estonia on 20 June this year was an \nimportant step towards a market economy. The sole legal tender in Estonia is \nnow the Estonian kroon. Monetary reform has helped establish conditions which \nare essential for the progress of privatization. Wide-scale privatization \nwill eliminate a situation in which the State helps essentially bankrupt \nenterprises remain in business, and will instead promote the development of \nnew private enterprises. \nWith the close cooperation of international institutions, a great deal of \nwork has been done to ensure that we accurately report and measure our \neconomic performance through reliable statistics. For this reason, we are \nconcerned about how our assessment rate here at the United Nations is \ncalculated through the exclusive use of Soviet statistics. Estonian national \naccounts and foreign exchange statistics are being ignored. The use of \ncurrent methodology means that our assessment is calculated on the basis of \npolitical rather than economic considerations. \nBoth the Stockholm Initiative and the Secretary-General's report entitled \n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277) address the need to prevent conflicts before \nthey arise. During the past year we have seen how difficult it is to solve \n\nconflicts once they escalate to war. Estonia considers preventive diplomacy \nto be of the utmost importance. \nThe United Nations must have the collective will to become actively \ninvolved in the prevention of potential conflicts. This Organization carries \nthe burden of history while facing a future full of hope and possibilities. \nEstonia is determined to perform its role in helping to create a new Europe \nand the new world of tomorrow.

        "file_text": "The General \nAssembly's choice of Mr. Ganev to lead the work of its forty-seventh session \nis a worthy tribute to his outstanding qualities and to the role his country, \nBulgaria, has always played in international relations. I convey the \ncongratulations of the Republic of Madagascar to him, and on behalf of my \ndelegation assure him of our cooperation. \nWe are grateful to his predecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi, for having \naccorded the strengthening of the General Assembly's authority the highest \npriority among his concerns although this did not keep him from discharging \nhis other responsibilities with grace, competence and skill, even in the most \nsensitive of circumstances. \nI turn now to our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, a member \nof our National Academy. He is certainly aware of the great regard in which \nhe is held in Madagascar, and we know that his experience, his sense of duty \nand his humanism are all guarantees of the success of our Organization. In \nthis time of profound change, requiring the involvement of all, we again \nexpress our support for and confidence in him. \nFinally, we address our best wishes to, and welcome, the 13 new Members: \nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, \nKyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan and Uzbekistan. We are pleased to be able to count upon their \ninvaluable cooperation and to offer them our own in return. \n\nWhen I spoke at last year's session, I mentioned the need for a new \ncharter in referring to the prospects of what was being offered us as the \\\"new \nworld order\\\". I will not repeat my conclusion, especially since the \ndeclarations adopted by the recent Summit Conference of the non-aligned \ncountries have reinforced the sense that my suggestion, as daring as it may \nhave been, only reflects the aspirations of a fairly significant sector of \nhumanity. I realize nevertheless, in the light of the events of these past \n12 months, that it might not seem timely not because it in any way disturbs \nthe conservatives, but because we are unfortunately compelled to yield to the \nvagaries of the international situation. \nAnd we ask ourselves: At what point can we truly speak of the new world \norder? Shall we call it the new order, the new world order, or the new \ninternational order? Are we sure of winning consensus around a concept that \ncan only be the fruit of joint efforts? Indeed, before we talk of order, let \nus try to look within ourselves and around us! \nRare are the developments that cause us satisfaction. To be sure, work \non the chemical weapons convention has finally been concluded; the operation \nin Cambodia seems to be supported by the parties; the international peace \nconference on the Middle East has shown signs of rather positive developments, \nin spite of some understandable hesitancy; in South Africa, the recent \nagreement between De Klerk and Mandela should pick up the broken thread of \nnegotiations in the Convention for a Democratic South Africa; the political \nsituation in Angola, Mozambique, and El Salvador is brightening; democracy is \nregaining stature and acceptability everywhere; and the Earth Summit in Rio \nunfolded in the best possible conditions. \nHowever, shadows persist. There are instability, human tragedy, and \npolitical chaos in many countries; the eruption of a nation and the threat of \n \nan entire people's disappearance in Somalia; violence and massacres in the \nBalkans; floods of refugees in Africa, especially, in Asia, and even in \nEurope; deadlock in Cyprus; foot-dragging in Western Sahara; human rights \ntrampled by hatred, intolerance, and xenophobia; monetary and financial crisis \nin the industrialized countries; and mounting poverty in third world countries. \nThis record, though incomplete, is not very encouraging. In any event, \nit hardly lends itself to prognostications on what the new world order is to \nbe. We will indeed be able to discourse validly on the subject once we have \nmastered disorder and political, economic, and social insecurity on the \nnational, regional, and international levels. This finding, whose particular \nbitterness pains us, should not inhibit our ability to reflect and to judge. \nNor can anyone say that we are entitled to hide behind the sense of malaise \nindignation, even in order to refuse to seek joint solutions, however \nimperfect, to the problems that we have often created for ourselves. \nAs a Member of the United Nations, and above and beyond any \nconsiderations of national interest or ideological affinity inasmuch as \nideologies still exist - it is up to us to affirm and constantly reaffirm the \ncentral role of our Organization in establishing peace and security, \nprerequisites for progress and social justice. That is the essence of the \n1945 Charter. These will remain the goals of the charter that will need to \nreplace it. That is why the Non-Aligned Movement again took up this theme \nfrom a fresh but not unprecedented perspective, so as to apply it to the \ndemocratization of international relations and the development of solidarity \nand equality, not forgetting the promotion of legality. \nOne criticism of the 1945 Charter is that it does not take sufficiently \ninto account the desirable balance between the main bodies of the \nOrganization the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and \n \nSocial Council, the Trusteeship Council, the International Court of Justice, \nand the Secretariat. To each body its own responsibilities and attributes! \nEach historical era has its own limitations and its own imperatives. Since \npeople continue to call for a comprehensive approach to problems in order to \nachieve integrated solutions, it is important to take a new, pragmatic look \never respectful of the spirit of the Charter at certain provisions of the \nCharter. \nLet us take the special responsibilities of the permanent members of the \nSecurity Council: Exercised on behalf of the entire Organization, they arose \nin the situation that obtained immediately upon the Second World War. Now, \nthe alliance has not survived the victory over totalitarianism. The cold war, \nwhich in some sense crystallized and distorted the use of the veto, is now \npart of history. The same applies to the concept of \\\"enemy\\\". Meanwhile, \nnewly independent States and new Member States have called for participation \non a more responsible basis and a more equitable allocation of what they see \nas privileges in fact, the implementation of democratic rules within the \nOrganization. It is therefore not astonishing to hear speak at one point of \nexpanding the Security Council, at another of eliminating the veto right, or \nat another still of extending or modifying the exercise of that right. \nOne fact remains: the right of veto, as envisioned in the 1945 Charter, \nis challenged by everyone throughout the world except those who have it. Let \nus apply the rules of the democratic game, and concede at least one point: \nthe 1945 Charter can and must be revised. It will still be necessary for the \nfive permanent members to agree as a whole to renounce their implicit veto \nright when it comes time for ratifying whatever changes the sovereign Assembly \nmay adopt. That is the only way for us to overcome the impasse. \n\nIt is necessary at the same time to define more rigorously the concept of \ninternational security not to abridge the authority of the Security Council \nbut to strengthen that of other bodies. Political or strategic circumstances \nand considerations have given that concept political, economic, social, \nhumanitarian, ecological and even legal ramifications. It is thus possible, \ninvoking jurisprudence, to recommend measures against a State or a regime in \nunexpected spheres, arbitrarily chosen on the basis of defence considerations \nor the promotion of special national or regional interests. \nIn that context, we want to state our appreciation for the \nSecretary-General's report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". Despite the rigid framework \nwithin which that study was carried out, its vision is stimulating, its \nanalyses relevant and its recommendations acceptable. We hope it will help \nshed new light on the concept of responsibility free from hegemony, so that \nthis notion will attract more open, unambiguous support. \nI felt it necessary to stress the democratization of international \nrelations because the strengthening of the Organization depends on it. Only \nan organization whose central role is set out in the documents, practice and \nacceptance of its members can guarantee the establishment and maintenance of \nrelations among nations based on trust, equity and equal participation. \nWe lay stress on the same principles when we address the problems of \ndevelopment, for we are convinced that their solution depends in large part on \nthe status of international peace and security. So long as the international \npolitical situation is under a burden, the search for a solution to the \ndevelopment crisis will be in vain. The Organization indeed, the entire \nUnited Nations system is working along those lines, and we are glad that \ndebate both at the eighth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade \n \nand Development (UNCTAD) and at the United Nations Conference on Environment \nand Development was marked by strengthened international cooperation for \ndevelopment. This theme reappeared at the high-level discussions in the \nEconomic and Social Council. This awareness is reflected also in an \nacknowledgement that stress must be placed on the role of the United Nations \nas the only forum in which we can deal with these problems in an integrated \nmanner. \nWe must draw up universally accepted principles and rules; ensure \ncoordination among the various development forums; harmonize the modalities \nfor action by financial, monetary and trading institutions; and above all be \naware of the political dimension of the decisions we shall have to make at all \nlevels. That is the role of the Economic and Social Council; we must \nstreamline and consolidate its functions in analysis and orientation to make \nit more effective system-wide. \nOn the institutional level, we note a willingness to create controls \nand the beginnings of that process although unequal means do not always \nfavour consensus among the bodies concerned. \nThen there is poverty. It is unbearable for its victims; it is \nunacceptable in a world that espouses solidarity. It has always been the lot \nof Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, where economically \nfragile, poorly integrated, dislocated, marginalized societies barely survive, \nside by side with pockets of prosperity. \nI want to make special reference to my own continent of Africa, where \npoverty and its attendant disease, natural disasters and social conflicts have \ndevastating, degrading effects. How can we ignore the fact that by the end of \nthe century, although we expect 400 million fewer impoverished people in the \nworld as a whole, there will be 100 million more in Africa? \n\nWe are sometimes criticized for self-pity and for not making the efforts \nnecessary to eliminate poverty in our countries. We are not immune to such \ncriticism, but is it not true also that poverty will be eradicated only if the \npace of economic growth is accelerated and if together we can solve the \nproblems that are the underlying causes of underdevelopment? Give us the \ntools for action, quickly and under tolerable terms. \nIn that context, I want to stress the urgency of reconsidering the \nquestion of our external debt; initiatives taken thus far have had no \nsignificant impact, despite the best intentions and despite a number of \ngenerous gestures made. We believe that initiatives must be reviewed and \nexpanded to ensure the resumption of development and growth. To be complete, \nthese initiatives must include additional resources, whether these come from \nofficial aid, the \\\"peace dividend\\\" or transfers in the form of investment. \nIn that context, we hope an international conference on development \nfinancing will take place and will respond to our difficulties in implementing \nthe various programmes and plans of action that have been adopted for the \ndevelopment of the countries of the South. \nEnvironmental protection and the promotion of sustainable development are \nthe great challenges of the 1990s and beyond. We must therefore ensure the \nswift implementation of Agenda 21. Though an ambitious programme, it is \ncommensurate with our respective responsibilities. \n\nMadagascar welcomes the convening in 1993 of the World Conference on \nHuman Rights, in 1994 of the International Conference on Population and \nDevelopment, and in 1995 of the World Summit for Social Development. \nThe holding of those conferences reassures us in our determination to \nestablish a society based upon social justice and true democracy, as reflected \nin the Constitution recently adopted by the people of Madagascar. We wish to \nexpress our gratitude to the Secretary-General and to the institutions and the \nfriendly countries which have supported us in this process. \nNew prospects for action are opening before us in the political, economic \nand social spheres. We have discussed them, reflected on them, and compared \nand contrasted our ideas regarding them. We have not always managed to avoid \nrecrimination and confrontation, but over four decades which will soon be \nfive we have constantly sought the best ways and means of promoting and \nperfecting cooperation between our peoples and between our States. With this \ncooperation we have everything to gain; without it we have everything to lose. \nThis certainty could have been a valid guide for us in our common quest \nfor more peace, more justice and more progress in a word, for bringing about \na more humane world. We could have succeeded long ago had the course of \nevents been more in our favour and had we agreed together to turn our visions \ninto reality. General instability led us to doubt ourselves and also one \nanother. However, the fact that we are gathered here bears witness to our \nreadiness and determination to turn towards the United Nations in order to \ndraw renewed certainty from it. \nThis is not a risk-free undertaking, since it reveals our weaknesses and \nshortcomings. It is, however, worth making the effort in order to enable us \nto adjust our commitment to the challenges that continually assail us. Let us \n\nhope that it will lead to a renewal which is beneficial to the Organization \nand which in the final analysis will help us to keep the promises we have made \nto our peoples. \n"

        "file_text": "May I, at the outset, congratulate you. Sir, \non your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. \nI should also like to express our appreciation for the stewardship of the \nforty-sixth session of the General Assembly by your predecessor. \nAmbassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia. \nThis is the first session of the General Assembly since \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali assumed the office of Secretary-General of the \nUnited Nations, and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to his dynamism, \ndiplomatic skills and zeal for reform. \nI should also like to welcome into our midst the new Members of the \nUnited Nations and wish them success in their multifarious efforts and tasks. \nThere have been dramatic changes world wide since the Assembly last met, \nin 1991. Some of these changes augur well, while others present uncertain \nprospects. While the cold war and the East-West confrontation are now, \nhappily, but aberrations of the past, the shadow of conflict and suffering \nlooms large in Yugoslavia, in Somalia and, indeed, in many other parts of the \nworld. \nWe cannot, therefore, be complacent or euphoric. What should have made \nthe world safer has at the same time unleashed tendencies ethnic, sectarian \nand other - that threaten to keep it unsafe. The efforts of developing \n\ncountries to improve their socio-economic conditions remain hamstrung by the \ninequities of the present international economic order. \nTherefore, what we need to work for is a new international order free \nfrom war, poverty, illiteracy and injustice. In this great endeavour the \nUnited Nations has a central role to play. Some eight and a half months ago, \nin this very city of New York, at the summit of the Security Council, \nPrime Minister Narasimha Rao pointed out that \n\\\"Lasting peace and security necessarily require comparable levels of \nhuman happiness across the globe. It is impossible to think of a United \nNations functioning usefully or harmoniously while humankind continues to \nbe riddled with ever-increasing disparities\\\". (S/PV.3046. p. 96) \nThat is the concern that animates and reinforces our commitment to a United \nNations dedicated as much to peace and stability as to progress and prosperity. \nThe international community's efforts in this direction are none the less \nhaunted by the shadow of continuing violence and conflict around the world. \nIndia has been deeply concerned at the conflict in Yugoslavia. The tragedy of \nBosnia and Herzegovina demands redress. Its people must be given the chance \nto lead their lives in peace. India believes that the good work the United \nNations is doing in that region deserves all our support. We also trust that \ndecisions taken here will not complicate either the search for peace or the \nfunctioning of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in a difficult \nand dangerous situation. \n\nSomalia's tragedy is equally heart-rending. The wretchedness of its \npeople, caught in a seemingly endless cycle of violence and misery, cries out \nfor redress. The United Nations has instituted a valiant and generous \noperation there to provide relief to those affected. India believes that all \nthe Somalian parties should work together to bring the conflict to an end so \nthat tranquillity can be restored and the people of Somalia can be given the \nchance to work out their own destinies in peace. \nAfter years of suffering, the people of Cambodia aspire to build a \nsovereign, independent, non-aligned nation for themselves. The United Nations \ncannot falter in Cambodia, and the parties concerned in that country have a \nresponsibility to ensure the success of the United Nations efforts. \nIndia has consistently supported the sovereignty, territorial integrity \nand non-aligned status of Afghanistan. We hope that all the parties there \nwill work to restore peace and harmony so that the people of Afghanistan can \nhave the opportunity, free of violence and conflict, to work for their own \nwell-being. \nA glimmer of hope is visible on the West Asian horizon, with Israel and \nits Arab neighbours settling down to a dialogue. The numerous resolutions \nadopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly provide the necessary \ngoals for those negotiations. The occupation of Arab lands should be vacated \nand the restitution of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, \nincluding their right to establish an independent State, as well as the \nsecurity of all States in the region, should be assured if a genuine \nsettlement with lasting peace is to be achieved in that part of the world. \nWhat the United Nations was able to do in restoring to Kuwait its \nindependence and sovereignty was a singular achievement. India has \n\ntraditionally enjoyed the warmest of relations with Kuwait, and we trust that \nfollowing the restoration of its sovereignty Kuwait will also be able to \nrecover the prosperity that it formerly enjoyed. \nI should like to add here that India feels sympathy for the civilian \npopulation of Iraq, and we believe that its needs should be looked at with \ngenerosity. Iraq's sovereignty as a State and its territorial integrity \nshould be respected. \nThe recent unfortunate violence in South Africa and the setback to the \nnegotiations there for the elimination of apartheid will, we hope, be \ntemporary. It is encouraging that the parties concerned have welcomed the \ncatalytic role of the United Nations, which is fully committed to the \nobjective of establishing a democratic, non-racial and united South Africa. \nAs the country that first brought the question of apartheid to the United \nNations in 1946, India is hopeful that the presence of United Nations \nobservers will help to end the violence there and to get the negotiating \nprocess going once again. \nIndia has noted the recent changes in Fiji. I hope that the Government \nof Fiji will eschew racial and ethnic discrimination and revert to democratic \ngovernance at an early date. \nThe Secretary-General has been able to record some progress on the issue \nof Cyprus. The acceptance by the parties concerned of the Secretary-General's \n\\\"set of ideas\\\" is significant. We share the Secretary-General's hope that the \nnext round of direct talks in October will be the conclusive one. \nAt this session the Assembly will take up the matter of the recently \nnegotiated chemical-weapons Convention. The Convention opens up possibilities \nfor similar action in other areas of disarmament. In this context, India in \n\n1988 proposed an action plan for nuclear disarmament within a specified \ntime-frame. As an immediate step, the United Nations should envisage the \nfollowing: a convention on the non-use of nuclear weapons, a verifiable \nfreeze on the production of fissionable material for weapons purposes, a \nsuspension of nuclear-weapon tests and negotiations on general and complete \ndisarmament. \nNon-proliferation is a laudable objective, and India's commitment to it \nhas been affirmed time and again. But there should be no distinction between \nnuclear-weapon States and non-nuclear-weapon States when it comes to rights \nand obligations. The geographical spread of nuclear arsenals has, as it were, \nnuclearized the globe. Therefore, the international community's efforts \nshould be directed against that global menace. As part of them, regional \nnon-proliferation should be considered only within the context of a properly \nspecified region, taking into account the security concerns of the countries \nof the region, whose prior agreement should be obtained. \nHuman rights have gained emphasis in recent times, and deservedly so. \nIndia welcomes the changes around the world that have strengthened human \nrights and fundamental freedoms. In line with our democratic traditions, \nindependent judiciary and press and alert public, India has decided to set up \na national human-rights commission further to safeguard and promote \nfundamental human rights in India. \nI should like to point out here that one of the most vicious forms of \nhuman-rights violations today is the violence unleashed by terrorists. And \nterrorism assumes a particularly pernicious character when it is aided, \nabetted and sponsored from abroad. Such sponsorship is against the principles \nof the United Nations Charter, and should be vigorously opposed by all. \n\nThe United Nations recognizes its responsibilities for providing \nhumanitarian assistance to Member States facing grave humanitarian crises. \nThe newly created capacity of the United Nations to deal with such situations \nhas performed creditably. It is important in this context that we mobilize \nthe United Nations to address the root causes of many such disruptions: \npoverty, illiteracy and lack of development. It is equally important for the \nUnited Nations to be seen to be acting correctly and impartially in this field \nand at the request of the country concerned. \nThe report of the Secretary-General entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" \n(A/47/277) articulates the wealth of experience that the United Nations has \ngained in recent years in peacemaking and peace-keeping, and is an important \nand welcome input into our study of how the role of the United Nations in the \nmaintenance of international peace and security can be strengthened. India, \ngiven its traditional and long-standing contribution to United Nations \npeace-keeping forces, takes a special interest in the matter. I trust that we \nshall be able to respond positively and constructively, in keeping with the \nUnited Nations Charter, to the Secretary-General's ideas. It should be \nensured that the measures envisaged do not lead to the abridgement of the \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States. They should also respect the \ncardinal tenet of non-interference in the internal affairs of States. \nJust as international activism should not violate accepted norms of \ninternational relations, the principle of self-determination has to be seen in \nthe context of respect for national sovereignty. Self-determination can apply \nonly to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation, and \nnot to integral parts of sovereign nations. \n\nThe implementation of the proposals made by the Secretary-General will \nmean a more vigorous Security Council. An enhanced mandate for the Council \nrequires matching transparency and democracy in its functioning. This cannot \nbe done without an expansion of the membership of the Council to reflect the \nincreased membership of the United Nations over the past few years, as well as \nthe realities of the many changes in the international situation. And here I \nwould submit that along with economic criteria, other relevant criteria should \nbe given due weight in this context. \nThe expansion in membership that I referred to is all the more essential \nif the Council is to ensure its moral sanction and political effectiveness. \nAs the Secretary-General points out in his report on the work of the \nOrganization \n\\\"Democracy within the family of nations means the application of its \nprinciples within the world Organization itself.\\\" (A/47/1, para. 169) \nSimilarly, the General Assembly has to be made more effective so as to \nrepresent not only the changes in its membership, but also the significant \ncharacter of its universal composition. \nAn agenda for development is as important to the United Nations as an \nagenda for peace. Any effort to assign to the United Nations only a \ncomplementary role in the economic and social field is, in fact, contrary to \nthe letter and spirit of the Charter. The United Nations should continue to \nhave a central role in macroeconomic policy formulation and implementation, \nbecause this is the only forum for reaching an international consensus on \ndevelopment. Developing nations around the globe, including India, are \nengaged in major reforms of their internal economic policies and mechanisms \nwith a view to integrating their economies with the global economy. These \n\nreforms will have very limited meaning unless the external economic \nenvironment becomes conducive to the growth and development of developing \ncountries. \nThe Secretary-General, in his report on the work of the Organization, \nmakes it clear that \n\\\"the Organization's responsibilities and commitments in the political and \nsecurity area should not be carried out at the expense of its \nresponsibilities in the development field ...\\\" (A/47/1, para. 66) \nThis underpins and reinforces the continuing commitment of the United Nations \nin the field of development, particularly of the developing countries. \nThe world economy is integrating both globally and regionally. But in \nthe process, the needs of the developing countries are not finding the \nattention and response that they deserve. Hence, it becomes imperative that \ncertain international events succeed such as the Uruguay Round of \nMultilateral Trade Negotiations, whose early, successful and balanced outcome \nwould inject growth impulses into the world economy as a whole. The \nNorth-South dialogue is languishing and deserves reactivation. There are \nvarious other inequities in global economic interaction - such as poor \ncommodity prices, monetary imbalances and others that call for urgent \nredress. The developing countries look to the United Nations for correctives \nin these fields. Socio-economic progress in developing countries will, in \nturn - I have no doubt about it enrich the prosperity of the developed world \nitself. \nHere, may I mention a disquieting aspect in this field, namely the \ntendency to impose non-economic conditionalities in international development \nassistance. They should be avoided so that the effectiveness of development \nassistance may not be impaired. \n\nMy delegation sees merit in a number of proposals in the area of the \ndevelopmental activities of the United Nations put forward by various groups, \nparticularly the Nordic countries. In our view, one of the principal \nobjectives of the exercise should be to decentralize the operational \nactivities of the United Nations system so that countries and regions with \ntheir special characteristics and levels of development may be able to \nimplement programmes suitable to them. Also, adequate resources should be \nfound to promote development in the developing countries. \nThe process of the restructuring of the United Nations should take into \naccount the additional responsibilities assigned to the United Nations by the \nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) that was held \nthis year. The concept of sustainable development has to be translated into \nworkable strategies and policy measures. In the pursuit of sustainable \ndevelopment, developing countries need resources and, what is more, technical \nassistance, as well as environmentally sound technologies on preferential and \nconcessional terms. I do hope that the establishment of a Commission on \nSustainable Development in the course of the present session will lead to \neffective follow-up of UNCED. The creation of a Planet Protection Fund, which \nplaces on all countries, except the least developed, an obligation to acquire \nand develop environment-friendly technologies, will facilitate universal \nparticipation in the collective effort to attain sustainable development. \nThe non-aligned countries, meeting at the level of Heads of State or \nGovernment in Jakarta earlier this month, issued the Jakarta message, which \nstates: \n\\\"A shift in focus of international relations to strengthen multilateral \ncooperation based on genuine interdependence, mutuality of interests and \nshared responsibility, has become indispensable.\\\" \n\nIf we, in the international community and here at the United Nations, are to \ncooperate to combat global menaces and inequalities, we will need to forge a \nglobal partnership. And here, I am reminded of what the Prime Minister of \nIndia stated at the recent summit of non-aligned countries to which I have \nreferred: \n\\\"We are happy to note that the United Nations, at last, is coming into \nits own in the fifth decade of its existence. While even today there is \na tendency to subordinate the global agenda to narrow national concerns, \nwe are happy to note that the United Nations is more effective than ever \nbefore. The question now is to make it even more effective.\\\" \nLet us also hope that the Assembly as its present session will promote \nthe effectiveness of the United Nations even further by shaping it as an \ninstrument of international consensus and action and of common benefit in all \nmatters of international concern. \n"

        "file_text": "I should \nlike to congratulate the President on his election. I am convinced that his \nwork at this session will be crowned with success, as was that of his \npredecessor. Ambassador Shihabi, to whom we express our gratitude for his \noutstanding work. \nWe have noted with satisfaction how our Organization, in keeping with its \nuniversalist vocation, has increased its membership in the course of the past \nyear. We welcome the delegations of Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and \n \n68 \nHerzegovina, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Moldova, Georgia, \nKazakhstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and San Marino. Their presence \nis perhaps the clearest demonstration of the deep-seated and positive changes \nthat have occurred in important parts of the world since the end of the cold \nwar. \nMoreover, we would like to extend our recognition to the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, for his hard and valuable work in the \ncourse of the first year of his term of office, thereby continuing the \nexcellent job done by his predecessor, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. The \nSecretary-General's stewardship has already had a sizeable impact on the \ncurrent international situation. \nIn our view, the general panorama of international relations, despite \nsome serious regional conflicts, gives rise to promising prospects throughout \nthe world. The end of the cold war and the considerable extension of \ndemocracy and the economic opening-up in many countries encourage that \nperception. This will necessarily lead to a reformulation of the North-South \nrelationship that will replace confrontation with cooperation. That \nperception does not imply ignoring the seriousness of some regional conflicts, \nin particular in the former Yugoslavia or the tragic situation of such \ncountries as Somalia. Neither war, hunger, poverty nor disease has been \neliminated. Far from it: situations persist that evoke horror and concern. \nMoreover, in some regions there are still significant disputes that, \nthough lacking the tragic aspects of the troubles I have mentioned, none the \nless impede the consolidation of stability. The case of the Malvinas Islands, \nto which I shall refer later, is one example. In that regard, the situation \nhas unfortunately been affected recently by unilateral positions taken by the \nBritish Government on the sensitive matters of hydrocarbons. \n \n69-70 \nIn any case, apart from these issues, in recent years the world has taken \nimportant steps towards creating a better framework for solving serious \nproblems. The fundamental change has undoubtedly been the more effective \nfunctioning of the system of collective security established in San Francisco \nin 1945. That major development is the prerequisite for moving towards full \nrespect for the purposes and principles of this Organization. \nThat explains the fundamental role of the Security Council, to which the \nCharter allocated paramount responsibility for the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security, and the necessity for all States firmly to \nsupport that body and implement its decisions. \nConvinced of that, in keeping with Article 25 of the Charter we strongly \nsupport the decisions of the Security Council. We did so with regard to the \nGulf by participating in the coalition to liberate Kuwait, and we continue to \ndo so through our increasingly active presence in the peace-keeping operations \nof the United Nations. \n \n71 \nOur support of the Security Council flows from our deeply-rooted beliefs \nabout the rules of conduct of civilized nations, from an appropriate \nassessment of the world power balance and from our perception of Argentina's \nactual interests. After long years of miscalculations and frustrations, today \nArgentina needs to grow and develop. Our chances of doing so depend to a \ngreat extent on our own efforts, but also on the existence of a world and \nregional context of dialogue and cooperation that will enable us to devote our \nenergy and resources to that task. As a result, we also favour the regional \ndevelopment of more specific formulas for cooperation with the United Nations. \nThere can be no doubt that the United Nations cannot on its own guarantee \nthe climate of detente that we need, which is to say that each region should \ncreate mechanisms of its own. We, therefore, together with other American \ncountries, have supported reforms to the charter of the Organization of \nAmerican States with a view to giving it the power to respond politically to \nbreakdowns in democracy in our hemisphere. The organization is studying \nspecific responses, which we trust will soon be adopted. \nBy the same token, we have contributed, together with our neighbours, to \nconsolidating a promising subregional framework. The climate of harmony and \ncooperation between the countries of the southern cone is a veritable example \nfor the world, and is the result of promising agreements on economic \nintegration, such as the Southern Cone Common Market, and of specific measures \nto build confidence and transparency in the area of security. Our countries \nare firmly united in the struggle against the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Argentina, for its part, has turned this struggle into one of \nthe fundamental axes of its foreign policy. \nThe achievements have been particularly significant in the relationship \nbetween Argentina and Brazil; in a few short months, we have signed a \n \n72 \nbilateral agreement on nuclear safeguards, set up a bilateral agency for \naccounting and control of nuclear materials, signed an agreement on full \nsafeguards with the International Atomic Energy Agency - which has already \nbeen ratified by my country and have successfully pushed for amendments to \nthe Treaty of Tlatelolco to allow it to come fully into force. \nIn this latter effort we have also joined with Chile and, later, with \nMexico. The changes to the Treaty of Tlatelolco are very positive, since they \noffer guarantees that did not exist before on the control system, special \ninspections and the protection of technological secrets. Argentina, Brazil \nand Chile have committed themselves to beginning the process of legislative \napproval of the amendments promptly. We are sure that in a few months all of \nLatin America and the Caribbean will be protected by a nuclear-free zone in \nfull operation. \nIn addition to measures taken in the nuclear area, the southern cone \ncountries have signed the so-called Mendoza Declaration on chemical and \nbacteriological weapons. This model document, which eradicates these weapons \nfrom our region, is in complete conformity with the Convention on Chemical \nWeapons recently negotiated in Geneva; that Convention has Argentina's \nsupport, and is an undeniable triumph in the struggle against the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \nArgentina's firm commitment in this area has also been reflected in \nconcrete form in our domestic legislation. This year the Argentine Government \nissued a decree which regulates sensitive nuclear, chemical, bacteriological \nand missile exports, and incorporates major international agreements, such as \nthe Missile-Technology Control Regime (MTCR) outlines and the so-called \nAustralian \\\"List of chemicals\\\", into Argentina's legal system. It also \nstipulates that Argentina shall coordinate its actions in the area of \n \n73 \nnon-proliferation with other countries that have a similar approach. We plan \nto accept the invitation to join the group of nuclear-exporting countries in \nthe near future. Naturally, if the main elements of the MTCR are incorporated \ninto Argentine legislation, they would expect our country to become a member \nof that system. \nI should like to emphasize that, besides contributing effectively to \nnon-proliferation, the new policy should serve to reopen Argentina's access to \nhigh technology through international cooperation. Its former ambiguous \npolicy in this regard was a major obstacle in this field and was responsible, \nto a great extent, for the technological backwardness of our country, and for \nhindering procurement even of spare parts and minor supplies for our defence. \nAnother important contribution to stability in our part of the world has \nbeen the complete normalization of diplomatic relations between Argentina and \nthe United Kingdom and the development of growing and fruitful economic and \ntrade links between the two. However, the dispute concerning sovereignty over \nthe Malvinas, Georgia and South Sandwich islands still persists. Today I \nreaffirm the sovereign rights of my country over these territories and their \nmaritime areas. The permanent defence and reaffirmation of these inalienable \nrights are at the core of Argentine foreign policy. \nThus, the recent decision of the United Kingdom Government to move \nunilaterally into prospecting for oil in the area in dispute is strongly \nrejected by my country. This rejection has been immediately transmitted to \nthe United Kingdom Government and to the potential prospecting companies. \nThis imprudent step by the United Kingdom stands in the way of the real \nopportunities for cooperation in the South Atlantic and does not strengthen \nthe good bilateral relationship in which both countries are strongly \ninterested. \n \n74 \nThese developments hinder our developing creative and pragmatic formulas \nwhich, without undermining our inalienable rights, would foster cooperation in \nthe South Atlantic. We are convinced that the establishment of a cooperative \nframework rather than of a confrontational one would benefit all those who \nlive in the South Atlantic area, including the inhabitants of the Malvinas. \nIt is the duty of the Argentine and British Governments to do their utmost \ntowards that end by overcoming major problems such as the ones that I have \ndescribed. \nThe Secretary-General is the author of the document entitled \\\"An Agenda \nfor Peace\\\" (A/47/277), which is a fundamental contribution towards outlining \nthe future structure of the United Nations. The document clearly indicates \nwhat road must be taken to strengthen the Organization, particularly in the \narea of preventing and ending conflicts. Argentina supports this document, \nwhich is to a great extent in line with the conclusions of the Rio Group. We \nshare, in particular, the opinion of the Secretary-General that it is \nnecessary to set in motion all the mechanisms of collective security provided \nfor in the Charter, in a framework of strict observance of the areas of \ncompetence established therein. \nPeace-keeping operations have become one of the main instruments of the \ninternational community. This year we have witnessed an unprecedented \nparticipation by the Blue Helmets in four continents. Argentina has decided, \nfor its part, as a major component of its foreign policy, to participate \nactively in this new development by providing military personnel and materiel. \nIn that connection, I wish to point out that the financing of \npeace-keeping operations must be effected in a manner that balances the need \nto ensure the effectiveness of such operations and the financial capabilities \nof Member States. In that connection, we emphasize the special \n \n75 \nresponsibilities of the permanent members of the Security Council in that \nrespect, as well as the greater capability of the more economically developed \ncountries to cope with such expenditures. \nThe Secretary-General's report is at the same time an essential document \nin the development of appropriate responses to current conflicts. Some of \nthese need decisive action on the part of the international community. \nIt is vital for us to continue to exert maximum pressure to put an end to \nthe tragedy in former Yugoslavia. Argentina supports the steps taken by the \nSecurity Council, the Secretary-General and the European Economic Community, \nand joins with those who demand respect for self-determination, for minorities \nand for the boundaries of the republics of former Yugoslavia. \nThe tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with which Argentina is in the \nprocess of establishing diplomatic relations, is a challenge to us all. We \njoin in the appeal to all parties to respect the principles I have mentioned, \nand we demand that Belgrade contribute effectively to putting an end to the \naggression in Bosnia and Herzegovina. \nThe presence of more than a thousand Argentine soldiers in the United \nNations Protection Force bears witness to our interest in a solution that \nrespects both the Charter of the United Nations and international law. \nWe are also following, with concern, the difficulties in Cambodia and the \nlack of progress in Western Sahara, and we are following political \ndevelopments in southern Africa with great attention. Argentina, for its \npart, is paying particular attention to the special situation in South \nAfrica. Argentina and South Africa share the South Atlantic area and have \n \n75(a-z) \ngreat opportunities for future cooperation. That is why we again urge the \nGovernment, the African National Congress of South Africa and all parties \ninvolved in the search for a concerted solution to persevere, through \nnegotiations, in their efforts to find a solution to the serious problem \ncreated by the policy of apartheid. The process of eradicating these terrible \npractices must be completed and, at the same time, the establishment of a \ndemocratic, free and peaceful society must be ensured in that great country. \n \n76 \nI have mentioned the South Atlantic. We are firmly convinced that the \ntime has come for all the countries involved to set up concrete mechanisms of \ncooperation in that important maritime area. The South Atlantic is one of the \nfew areas in the world on which there are no specific agreements. Argentina \nadvocates decisive advancement in that area. \nProgress in the Peace Conference strengthens our hope for a solution to \nthe Arab-Israeli conflict. We feel that the role of the General Assembly at \nthis crucial stage is not so much to ratify well-known positions as it is to \ncontribute decisively to promoting agreement and flexibility among the \nparties. Argentina is prepared to cooperate actively in the efforts to \nachieve that goal. We must say that we feel deep admiration and respect for \nthe Middle Eastern leaders who have had the courage and vision to put aside \nthe rigidity of dialectics and undertake these crucial negotiations with \ndetermination and in a conciliatory spirit. \nWe Argentinians have also suffered the consequences of the irrational \nviolence unleashed everywhere as a result of that serious situation. The \nattack carried out last 17 March against the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, \nwith its heavy toll, was an unmistakable sign of the tragic imprint left by \nthese conflicts at the criminal hands of international terrorism. \nAs regards other regional situations, we are pleased to note the current \nprogress in the high-level talks between the Cypriot leaders and the \nSecretary-General. As a result, we look forward to a prompt agreement in the \nframework of the good-offices mission of the Secretary-General. We wish to \ncommend the parties involved in this conflict, including Greece and Turkey, \nfor their spirit of cooperation, and the permanent members of the Security \nCouncil for their active role in this process. \n \n77 \nWe reiterate our firm support of the Security Council decisions regarding \nthe situation in the Persian Gulf and we insist that Iraq should abide by its \nresolutions and fully respect the human rights of all minorities and of the \npopulation as a whole. \nOne of the essential conditions for peace is the full enjoyment of human \nrights. Argentina reaffirms its active role in the protection and promotion \nof human rights and fundamental liberties in the deliberative international \nbodies on human rights, both at the United Nations and the Organization of \nAmerican States (OAS). \nIt is also fitting to mention some serious problems that the \ninternational community must face, attack and eliminate once and for all. I \nam referring to drug trafficking, terrorism and corruption. \nThe first one drug trafficking - is at present a subject deserving of \nconcerted action by States. This, however, is not enough. We must get to the \ndeepest roots of this scourge at all its stages, from production to \nconsumption, and in particular the movement and laundering of its financial \nresources. In their actions in this area, States must recognize the various \ncharacteristics of the countries that are most involved. Argentina has joined \nand will join any initiative that will allow us to put an end to this malady \nthat affects the whole of the international community, without exception. \nAs for terrorism, there can be no questions, only an answer in the form \nof the strongest, most determined and implacable commitment of each State to \nstruggle against it until it is eradicated. Its activities are always deadly \nand cruel. This year Argentina suffered one of the most savage terrorist \nattacks in the annals of international crime. Our country will support all \nsteps or processes that will strengthen law and the respect for standards of \ncoexistence among nations. \n \n78 \nFinally, the cancer of corruption must be rooted out. It is harmful and \npernicious and undermines the efforts of States and their civilian societies \nfor the healthy development of their political, economic and social \ninstitutions. Corruption knows no borders and coexists, or attempts to do so, \nwith any political or legal system on our planet. Argentina is in the front \nlines of the struggle to combat this crime and to create the mechanisms for \ndoing so. \nAllow me to return to our region and refer to some other facts of great \nsignificance. \nArgentina's foreign policy is geared towards creating an external context \nfavourable to the competitive incorporation of Argentina into the world \neconomy. In that regard, we have made the Southern Cone Common Market \n(MERCOSUR) the axis of our activity in Latin America. The agreement on trade \nand investment with the United States, called \\\"Four plus One\\\", shows that the \nconcepts of MERCOSUR and the Initiative for the Americas are fully \ncompatible. With MERCOSUR we endeavour to create a stable external context \nfor the economic growth of the four countries through the implementation of \ncollective economic discipline freely agreed upon by the parties. The concept \nis characterized by a marked realism as to our potential and limitations. \nMERCOSUR is not, nor could it be, the embryo of a new economic fortress. \nBefore the end of 1994 we will have a common external tariff, but we have \nalready clearly determined that it must allow for the increasing international \ncompetitiveness of our economies. It would make no sense to close at the \nsubregional level the doors that each of our countries is opening at the \nnational level. \nThe reference to MERCOSUR leads me to recall that Argentina expects the \ncreation of great economic blocs to be the forerunner of freer, more efficient \n \n79 \ninternational trade, not of a greater space to make protectionism legal or to \ndisguise clear market reserves. Argentina prefers to believe in the sincerity \nof the purposes stated in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade (GATT) and in the principles outlined to launch the \nInitiative for the Americas, the same ones that form the basis of the Treaty \nof Asuncion, in which MERCOSUR is defined. But my country notes with \njustifiable concern the way in which the most powerful economies on our planet \ninterpret the concept of opening the market, since they promote such opening \nonly for those sectors in which their countries are competitive or where they \nthemselves exert influence on international prices. \nPart of that conception is to be found in the section on agriculture and \nother decisions that have so far stalled the Uruguay Round of GATT. Precisely \nin the agricultural sector, the leaders of those economies do not display \nexcessive courage or desire to put an end to annual subsidies of more than \n$300 billion for production and foreign trade, with which they distort \ninternational markets and, besides, contribute to environmental degradation. \nSome of their decisions reflect a greater interest in solving minor \ndifficulties in domestic policy than in avoiding isolationism and trade wars. \nOnly very rich countries can pursue policies that are so harmful and costly \nthat they undermine the finances of their urban populations and of course do \nconsiderable harm to the developing countries. \nThis is also an apt occasion to confirm our great satisfaction at the \npolitical agreements reached by Canada, the United States and Mexico to create \na free-trade zone. We trust that this achievement will be one of the central \nmodules of the broader zone foreseen when launching the Initiative for the \nAmericas to make of the hemisphere one great market. While this takes shape, \n \n80 \nwe are worried at the many legislative attempts fiat tend to hinder the access \nof developing countries to the various international markets. \nArgentina has started a process of sustained economic stability based on \na market economy in the framework of a democratic system. This has allowed us \nto initiate proceedings for our admission to the Organisation for Economic \nCooperation and Development (OECD), where we hope to take part in the \ndiscussion of global and sectoral economic policies that may contribute to \neconomic growth. \nAt this session, the General Assembly will consider the report of the \nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development held at Rio de \nJaneiro. No previous international event had convened so many Heads of State \nor of government. In the framework of the new international situation, it has \nbeen possible for the first time ever to reach basic agreements on questions \nthat are important for the survival of this planet as we know it. \nThe progress achieved on the American continent does not preclude the \npersistence of some specific problems. At the last two sessions of the United \nNations Commission on Human Rights, Argentina made clear its position \nregarding the situation in Cuba. At all times my country has expressed a \ndesire that Cuba should bring about the necessary reforms to allow its full \nintegration, both political and economic, into the community of democratic, \npluralistic nations. I repeat that it was expressed as a brotherly wish, not \nas interference in the affairs of that country \nArgentina strongly condemned the coup d'etat against the President of \nHaiti and supported the relevant resolutions adopted by the Organization of \nAmerican States (OAS). I myself was part of the delegation that accompanied \nthe Secretary-General of the OAS to Port-au-Prince. We have kept our \n \n80(a-z) \ndiplomatic ties with Haiti, have maintained our embassy there and have spared \nno effort to support an understanding between the parties to the conflict. \nAs regards El Salvador, the signing of the peace agreement is a landmark \nin the process of peace-making in Central America and we hope that the \nunderstanding reached can be extended to the rest of the region. \n \n81 \nPeru, our sister country on the Pacific, continues to face serious \nproblems in its development and progress, suffering the effects of drug \ntrafficking and of bloody nihilistic terrorism. We should, however, note the \nadvances recently made on that front. We also welcome the process which will, \nwe hope, lead to a well-balanced and full return of Peru's representative \ndemocracy. We are awaiting with close attention and a willingness to \ncooperate the constituent elections of 22 November. \nWith regard to Chile, we continue to move slowly and inexorably closer to \na final solution to all of the unresolved border problems, along the world's \nthird longest frontier. Very little still remains to be done before we reach \na full understanding, which is already yielding fruitful results in advance, \nwith greater and very promising economic cooperation. We are replacing a long \nhistory of discord with a full and fraternal relationship. \nI cannot conclude without commenting on the actions of the Rio Group. I \nreaffirm my conviction that it has proved to be a highly effective mechanism \nfor consultations and for reaching political agreements, as was shown in such \nsituations as the one which earlier this year endangered institutional \nstability in Venezuela. The Rio Group has also demonstrated an important \npresence and participation in connection with Peru and Haiti. It has provided \nan excellent tool for communication, information and consultation with, \ninter alia, the European Community, with which, in addition to the enormously \nimportant Santiago Declaration in May of this year, a significant cooperation \nagreement was signed. \nIn 1992 we have been able to confirm that the United Nations, free of the \nshackles imposed on it by the cold war, is now fulfilling the essential role \nentrusted to it by mankind in 1945. Although the sources of distress still \npersist, we can affirm that we are moving towards the consolidation of the \n \n82 \nruling principles that guide the United Nations, and we reiterate our hopeful \nconviction that the closing years of the strife-torn twentieth century will \nenable us to strengthen universal respect for the letter and spirit of the \nCharter, which will mean the triumph of wisdom, solidarity and justice. \n"

        "file_text": "It gives me \ngreat pleasure to extend to you, on behalf of my country. Sir, warm \ncongratulations on your election to the post of President of the forty-seventh \nsession of the General Assembly. You represent a friendly nation with which \nmy country has ties of friendship and cooperation. Your wealth of experience \nand competence will help bring our work to a successful conclusion and achieve \nthe desired results. \n\nIt also gives me great pleasure to extend our thanks and appreciation to \nyour predecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi, who, with his abundant skill, experience \nand patience, was able to conduct the business of our past session with \nparticular success. \nMay I also have the pleasure, at the beginning of my statement, to \nexpress my sincere thanks and deep gratitude to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the \nSecretary-General, for his unremitting efforts to enhance the role of the \nUnited Nations and its Secretariat and make it more effective in the service \nof international peace and security, as well as in facing up to the challenges \nand addressing the issues that have arisen with the end of the cold-war era. I \nwould also like to commend his well thought-out and comprehensive report on \nthe work of the Organization which indicates the new and auspicious direction \nof the United Nations under his guidance. \n\nThe forty-seventh session is convened at a time when several new States \nhave been admitted to membership of the United Nations, thereby enhancing the \nuniversality of this Organization. I welcome all of them and look forward to \ntheir contribution in the pursuit of the objectives and principles of the \nUnited Nations Charter. \nGiven its awareness of the interdependent character of the world we live \nin and its belief in dialogue, diplomacy and negotiations as the ideal and, \nindeed, the only means of resolving international disputes, my country looks \nforward to cooperation with all Members of the United Nations with a view to \nmoving human society to yet higher levels of progress, stability and growth. \nOver the past few years, the world has undergone many historic and \nunprecedented changes which have tended to encourage democratization and the \npromotion of freedoms, the rule of law, respect for human rights and the \npursuit of progress and development. While the end of the ideological \nconfrontation between East and West has brought about a new state of \ninternational harmony at a certain level, yet it seems that the conflict was a \nlid that covered a great deal of smouldering embers under the ashes. The \nconfrontation had hardly ended when certain primitive tendencies reared their \nheads. Some of those tendencies are tribal, some are ethnic and others are \nreligious. None of them augurs well for a very rosy future for many regions \nof the world. This is a situation that calls for collective action under the \nauspices of this Organization to rationalize the transition, and thereby, to \ncontain those tensions, in their various forms, within acceptable humanitarian \ncontexts. \nOur world is now going through a phase of transition from one era to \nanother, where the changes are taking place at an astonishingly rapid pace \nthat has left behind many cultural, social and political principles that many \n\ngroups in human society continue to hang on to as if they were eternal. This \nmakes it imperative that we act to create a mechanism to facilitate and manage \nthe transition, which is, perhaps, the most difficult period in the lives of \ncommunities as well as in the lives of the individuals. \nThere is enough wisdom in this world and in the Secretariat of this \nOrganization in particular, to make us in Jordan look forward to a better \nfuture. Jordan does not accept the argument that modern technology, which has \ncompressed the world into a global village, has led to the opposite of what \nwas expected of it. We do not subscribe to the view of those who maintain \nthat it has led to ideological ossification and has bred an attitude of \nindifference to the pains, hopes and aspirations of others. \nProceeding from this, Jordan, a State that may be small in size but big \nin leadership, wishes to share with you a futuristic vision of a world that \nnow stands at the threshold of the twenty-first century. We feel that we may \nbe justified in this by the fact that we are a State that, since its \ninception, has committed itself to the straight path of justice and pursued a \npolicy that eschewed violence and extremism. It has always maintained a \nrational, moderate, middle-of-the-road approach in dealing with both its \ndomestic and its foreign affairs. Hence, Jordan has in effect become an oasis \nof stability in a turbulent region where emotionalism, extremism and \nideological as well as physical violence are still rampant. Perhaps the most \nsignificant outcome of this policy has been the establishment in my country of \na solid democratic system based on political pluralism. \nJordan, which believes in collective action and in the United Nations \nprinciples, as well as in a world of peace, security and stability, takes \npride in the confidence placed in it in being called upon to contribute troops \nto the peace-keeping forces in a number of areas of tension in the world: in \n \nCroatia and Cambodia, in addition to observers in Angola and Somalia. My \ncountry thus believes in the need to support the United Nations to enable it \nto carry out effectively the essential functions set forth in the Charter, \nnamely, the promotion of peace and security all over the world and the \nprovision of the means for the welfare and progress of its peoples. \nWe stress that the General Assembly, the Security Council and the \nSecretariat under the leadership of the new Secretary-General, who is well \nknown for his patience, vision and extensive knowledge, together with the \npolitical will of Member States and the yearning of peoples for a better \nworld, should combine to form the basis for effective measures in the field of \npreventive diplomacy for peacemaking and peace-keeping and the process of \npost-war peace building. The \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277), prepared by the \nSecretary-General, is indeed a very valuable contribution because of the \nin-depth and comprehensive analysis it offers and the set of scenarios and \nassumptions envisioned for United Nations work with a view to enhancing its \nefficiency and revitalizing its various agencies and organizations with a view \nto forging a new world of peace and prosperity. \nAllow me, in dealing with the most important international issues, to \naddress the dispute in the Middle East region and its core issue, the \nPalestine question. My country, Jordan, has indeed lived the tragedy of the \nPalestinian people from the beginning and, with its limited resources, has \nborne the brunt of its economic, social and political repercussions. \nWe have noticed recently that this problem has had its share of the \neffects of the many political changes and international breakthroughs that \nhave been brought about by the end of the cold war era, in that the \nArab-Israeli conflict and the Palestine question have taken a positive turn in \nline with those changes. This started with the Madrid Peace Conference. \n\nJordan has joined in this peace process because of its firm commitment to \nthe achievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region, and \nbecause of its belief in the justice of the Palestinian cause and in the right \nof the Palestinian people to self-determination, including their right to \nestablish their own independent State on their native soil, as well as in the \nright of every State in the region to live in peace and security within \nrecognized boundaries. Those premises and objectives of the peace process are \nbased on international resolutions, most importantly Security Council \nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which affirm the land-for-peace \nequation of returning the occupied territories, including Jordanian territory \nand the Syrian Golan, in exchange for peace, and which also affirm the \nnecessity of Israeli withdrawal from Arab Al-Quds. \nWe in Jordan believe that peace is an objective that our generation ought \nto pursue. We also believe that in order for peace to be real and lasting, it \nmust be based on international legality and must be just, comprehensive and, \nthereby, acceptable to future generations. The peace we believe in is peace \nthat would be an incentive to all peoples of our region to move ahead on the \nroad of economic, social and cultural development in an atmosphere of \nsecurity, stability, freedom and democracy, and in the context of cooperation \nand understanding, resulting in well-being and prosperity for the peoples of \nthe region as a whole. Justice, comprehensiveness and durability are the \nbases on which peace in the Middle East should be established. These bases \nare organically interrelated and inseparable. \nIt is regrettable, however, that while we are engaged in direct peace \nnegotiations with Israel, it persists in its acts of repression and oppression \nof every type against the Palestinian people under its occupation. It is a \n\nstrange paradox indeed that while the parties to the conflict are negotiating \non the basis of international legality, Israel continues its illegal \npractices, especially the building of new settlements and the beefing up of \nexisting ones. \nIt is true that the new Israeli Government has taken certain seemingly \npositive actions with regard to its policies in the occupied territories. \nThose actions are, however, inadequate. We, and the world as a whole, are \nstill waiting for Israel to translate its words into deeds. The \nclassification of settlements into security and political settlements is a \nploy that aims at breaking up into pieces the principle of legality, which is \nindivisible. The release of some detainees while thousands of others languish \nin jail, will not alter the degree of repression to which the Palestinian \npeople are being subjected. \nIf the Israeli Government truly wishes to be serious in its desire to \nachieve peace and wants to demonstrate good will, it has first to commit \nitself to the application of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the occupied \nterritories and to halt completely the building of settlements - all \nsettlements. \nWith regard to Lebanon, Israel continues to refuse to comply with \nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978), which calls for Israel's withdrawal \nfrom southern Lebanon. Accordingly, we call for unconditional Israeli \nwithdrawal from all Lebanese territory and call for solidarity by the \ninternational community with Lebanon to help the Lebanese Government in \nrebuilding its economic and social structures and enabling its people to \nachieve the security, welfare and prosperity they yearn for. \n\nThe various Security Council resolutions concerning Iraq have placed the \nState of Iraq and its people in a situation different from that they were in \nin 1990 and 1991. The suffering of the Iraqi people, which is known to all, \nand the threat of dismemberment and instability not intended by the Security \nCouncil resolutions make it imperative that we view Iraq in terms of that \nnew situation. Proceeding from this, Jordan which complies with Security \nCouncil resolutions and looks forward to putting an end to the consequences of \nthe Gulf crisis by peaceful means wishes to emphasize its desire for action \nto alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people and to preserve the territorial \nintegrity of Iraq as an integral Gulf entity. It will not be in anyone's \ninterest, regionally or internationally, to partition Iraq or to prolong the \nsuffering of its people. Also, it will not be in anyone's interest that \nsecurity and stability should not prevail in the Gulf region. \nWhile we have great hopes that the consequences of the Gulf crisis will \nbe eliminated, we regret to see the beginnings of a new crisis: the dispute \nthat has erupted recently between the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran. The Islamic Republic of Iran is denying to the United Arab \nEmirates its sovereign rights over the islands of Abu Mousa, Greater Tunb and \nLesser Tunb. Jordan would like to reiterate in this regard its principled \nposition of respect for the principle of the inadmissibility of the \nacquisition of territory by force. We call on the Islamic Republic of Iran \nand the United Arab Emirates to reach a peaceful solution through dialogue, \nbased on the principles of the United Nations Charter, in order to maintain \ngood neighbourliness and consolidate peace and security in the Gulf region. \nThe tragic situation of the Somali people poses a difficult challenge to \nthe United Nations and to the conscience of humanity. This challenge requires \n\nan immediate and effective response. The images of death, starvation and \nhomelessness that fill our television screens cry out to the conscience of the \nworld to help put an end to them. My country's delegation, while appreciating \nand commending the incessant efforts of the new Secretary-General on both the \npolitical and the relief levels, emphasizes the need for prompt and effective \naction by the United Nations and the international community to adopt an \nintegrated plan that would put an end to the tragedy of Somalia. Such a plan \nshould include a cease-fire, the implementation of an integral programme of \naction to ensure the delivery of humanitarian relief supplies to the various \nregions and moves to convene a conference on reconciliation, national unity \nand transition to help rebuild the country's infrastructure. We must also \ndeal with the regional consequences of the crisis: the influx of Somali \nrefugees into neighbouring countries and the resulting instability this has \ncaused in the Horn of Africa. \n \nThe tragic situation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina continues \nto deteriorate and is taking a sinister turn. To do nothing about it would \nundermine the very concepts of democracy, civilized behaviour and collective \nsecurity. Reports continue to pour in, telling of continued violations of \ninternational humanitarian law against the people of this young nation. Its \nterritory continues to be swallowed up bit by bit, and attempts are continuing \nto change its demographic composition through ferocious and atrocious \\\"ethnic \ncleansing\\\" campaigns. It is both painful and dangerous that all this should \ncontinue despite the relevant Security Council resolutions. There is indeed \nan urgent need to find a prompt and peaceful solution to the situation in \nBosnia and Herzegovina in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations \nand the norms of international law. There is nothing that would justify in \nany way failure by the United Nations and the international community to take \nprompt and effective measures to put an end to aggression, to ensure the unity \nand territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to preserve its political \nindependence and full sovereignty over its entire territory, and to annul all \nthe results and consequences of aggression. We trust that the peace process \nled by the European Community and its member States, in cooperation with the \nUnited Nations, to achieve a peaceful settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina, \nwill give all these elements priority in its programme of work. I can only \nexpress, in this regard, my country's high appreciation of the tireless \nefforts made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the \nSecretariat to make the peace process in Bosnia and Herzegovina a success and \nto expand the relief operations which they are undertaking. \nThe principles which my country upholds and which govern its positions on \nall international conflicts are based on the belief in the right of peoples to \nself-determination, in the principle of non-interference in the internal \n\naffairs of States and of rejection of occupation in any shape or form. It was \nin this context that my country welcomed the process of reconciliation in \nCambodia on the basis of the Paris accords which were signed by all the \nCambodian parties. My country attaches great importance to the \nimplementation, by all parties, of those accords and the discharge of all the \ncommitments contained therein as those commitments constitute the guarantee \nand the proper mechanism for a peaceful and comprehensive settlement that will \nrestore peace to this war-torn country within the framework of national \nreconciliation in a united, independent and sovereign Cambodia. \nAs for the question of Korea, my country's delegation would like to voice \nits complete satisfaction in regard to the progress of the dialogue and \nhigh-level talks going on between the two Koreas and the resultant agreements \naimed at building mutual confidence between them and reuniting the Korean \npeninsula in a framework of national unity. \nWith regard to the question of Cyprus, my country values the efforts of \nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations, who has maintained the good \noffices which started in 1975. We follow with close interest and great \nappreciation the ongoing talks under his auspices and with his encouragement \nbetween the leaders of the Greek and Turkish communities with the aim of \nachieving a peaceful settlement of this problem. \nJordan shares with the rest of the world the satisfaction felt at the \nresults of the referendum organized by the Government of South Africa in \nMarch. Those results were a constructive prelude to end the policy of \napartheid in South Africa and augur well for the achievement by the \nconflicting groups of a comprehensive political settlement in a democratic \nsystem, which would put an end to minority rule. The agreement reached a few \ndays ago between Mr. Mandela and President De Klerk on the resumption of talks \n \nfollowing the deplorable violence of last June, renews hope that all parties \nwill cooperate in writing a new constitution and reaching an early political \nsolution, thus putting an end to the policy of apartheid and allowing \ndemocracy to prevail. \nMy Government deplores the bloody events that took place recently in \nAfghanistan and visited yet more suffering on the Afghani people. Therefore \nJordan, while wishing the Afghani Government success in consolidating security \nand stability and in reconstructing the infrastructure devastated by the civil \nwar, supports that Government's request for assistance from the United Nations \nand the international community. \nThe East-West bipolarity of the cold war era has disappeared with the end \nof that war. There has surfaced, however, a new North-South bipolarity that \nwas overshadowed previously by the world's preoccupation with the ideological \nconflict between East and West. We hope that efforts to deal with this \nphenomenon, which is primarily economic and social, will take the form of a \npositive and constructive dialogue for the benefit of all mankind. The \ndeveloping South needs the countries of the North; the industrialized North \ncannot maintain its prosperity and stability without an independent and \ndeveloped South that would be free from hunger, poverty, and disease and \nrelieved of its heavy burden of debt. The planet on which we live, with all \nthe threats of ecological disruption facing it, cannot enjoy security and \nsafety without cooperation between North and South. Such cooperation is in \nthe interest of all humanity. \nIf we were to define the new role of the United Nations, it, undoubtedly/ \nwould be humanitarian in nature and would aim at protecting and preserving \nlife on the planet, and raising the standard of living of all peoples through \n\nthe establishment of a new, balanced and equitable world economic order. Our \nOrganization must act to put an end to the historical contradiction that has \npersisted for centuries between North and South so that the North may \ndischarge the main task of providing new bases and common grounds for a real \ndevelopment of the regions of the South and thus remove the existing \ndistortions and inequalities. \n\nIt has become quite clear that a common effort for development is \nessential to move the world gradually forward, if freedom and democracy are \nreally to gain acceptance and if we really want to respect human dignity and \neradicate underdevelopment and its concomitant social and health evils, which \nhave assumed terrifying proportions and frequency. \nThe environment is the common heritage of mankind. Thus, my country \nbelieves that its preservation is our common responsibility. We also feel \nthat the developed countries, in accordance with the commitments they took \nupon themselves at the Rio de Janeiro Conference, must help the developing \ncountries in solving their relevant problems, especially and principally, the \nproblem of poverty. We therefore support the establishment of the committee \non sustainable development and look forward to participating in it and in \nshaping its structure and terms of reference. \nIf international peace and security are among the main goals the \ninternational community strives to achieve, that makes it all the more \nimperative for us to promote arms limitation, including the elimination of all \nweapons of mass destruction. One must note in this regard the progress \nachieved in the limitation of tactical nuclear weapons and the finalization \nrecently at Geneva of the draft Convention on the prohibition of chemical \nweapons. As for conventional weapons, the General Assembly resolution adopted \nat the forty-sixth session on the establishment of a non-discriminatory \nregister in which to record all international weapon transfers was a positive \nstep on the road to getting rid of armaments, provided it is applied with \ncomplete impartiality and in an equitable manner that takes into consideration \nthe differences in the needs of countries for armaments. A verification \nsystem should be developed, taking into account not only imported weapons but \n\nalso domestically produced weapons, especially in countries that are involved \nin regional conflicts. \nJordan supports the use of science and technology for disarmament, the \ndevelopment of verification systems, the efforts aimed at achieving a \ncomprehensive nuclear-test ban and the establishment of nuclear-free zones, \nincluding the Middle East region. Jordan also calls upon all States that have \nnot done so, including Israel, to accede to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and place all their nuclear facilities \nunder International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. \nIn conclusion, I should like to say that, now that the cold war has \nended, the world undoubtedly stands at the threshold of a new era, as we can \nall see. This fact places on the United Nations the responsibility of \nreinvigorating itself in order to keep pace with the requirements of this new \nera in a fast-changing world, so that our efforts at the United Nations may \nbecome a foundation for a better life. We are quite confident that the Member \nStates are all aware of their problems and the problems of the world and are, \ntherefore, prepared for cooperation and the use of good offices within a \ndemocratic United Nations and the efforts of its evolving organs and agencies \nthat are guided by the vision and dedication of the Secretary-General. \n"

        "file_text": " I should like to offer you hearty \ncongratulations on your election to the presidency. Sir. I am confident that \nthis session of the General Assembly is in good hands. I should also like to \npay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his \nleadership of the United Nations in an era of crucial change. \nIt is a sign of the times that since last year no fewer than 13 new \nMember States have taken their seats in the General Assembly. I should like \nto extend a warm welcome to them all. \nThe world is currently undergoing dramatic changes and facing great \nchallenges. Let us not allow the optimism inspired by the revolution which \nbrought freedom to Eastern Europe to turn into a new pessimism as a result of \nthe problems we are facing today. \nThe end of the cold war has definitely given us a unique opportunity to \nbuild a new world order founded on common values, as originally envisaged in \nthe United Nations Charter. International consensus is emerging, based on the \nprinciples of democracy and a free economy as prerequisites for the prosperity \nof the peoples of the world. \nThe President returned to the Chair. \n\nThe first reason for my optimism is the end of the East-West conflict. \nThe second reason is that experience has shown that no nation is condemned to \na perpetual cycle of poverty, underdevelopment and political violence. \nSeveral developing countries have made remarkable progress from absolute \npoverty to relative prosperity in a very short time. \nIn addition to traditional contributions from the industrial countries, \nwe can observe a tendency for economically successful developing countries to \nshare their know-how and experience with other countries which have not yet \nachieved the same level of growth. New forms of cooperation between nations \nat different stages of development are emerging. \nWe are living in an era when the removal of the risk of a nuclear \nholocaust makes other threats to peace and security stand out all the more \nclearly. This applies to problems of economic development, to the growing \nthreat to the environment, and to ethnic and religious conflicts which have \nbecome severely aggravated in certain areas. Even though security will \ncontinue to have a military dimension, these challenges can be met only by \napplying a broader security concept which takes all aspects into account. \nIn the long term, problems and conflicts of this kind can be solved only \nin an environment where there is a greater focus on cooperation. This can be \nachieved through the free exchange of know-how and goods, through regional \ncooperation and through institution-building: the establishment and \nstrengthening of international structures within and outside the United \nNations system. In the future, the greatness of a nation will be measured not \nby its military potential but by its ability to create a civil society through \npeaceful cooperation. \n\nA world of open, civil societies must also be a world of open markets. \nIn Western Europe, peace and prosperity have been consolidated and secured \nthrough the free flow of goods and services. In the same way, peace and \nprosperity in what is usually termed the third world can be achieved only by \nglobal free trade and more open frontiers. \nWe in the West must do more than merely open up our markets. It is also \nour responsibility to support economic and social progress in the developing \ncountries by giving generous assistance. Assistance is particularly important \nfor the poorest countries which are not yet able to benefit fully from freer \nworld trade. \nSweden considers it essential that the Western industrial countries \nachieve the goal of allocating 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to \ndevelopment assistance. Development assistance must effectively promote \nrespect for human rights, democracy and market-economy solutions. \nUnfortunately, increasing resources are needed also to help people who are \nsuffering from famine, war and other disasters. \nRegional cooperation, which has been given new impetus following the end \nof East-West confrontation, will play an increasingly dynamic role in \ntomorrow's world. And, in its turn, regional cooperation can promote global \ncooperation. If opportunities for regional cooperation are utilized in the \nright manner, this cooperation will provide the bricks for building global \nintegration. But if these opportunities are not handled properly, the result \nwill be narrow-minded nationalism and economic protectionism. \n\nEuropean integration and the reunification of Eastern and Western Europe \non the basis of common values and aims have created new opportunities for \npan-European cooperation. Future stability depends on the success of the \ntransition in Eastern Europe and in the States of the Commonwealth of \nIndependent States, which makes demands on European solidarity. \nA united and successful Europe can play an important and positive role at \nthe international level. It is Sweden's firm intention to become a member of \nthe European Community. As a member, Sweden will continue to work for a \nEurope which is open to the world, economically, culturally and politically. \nIn our view, an introverted Europe is not a viable alternative. \nEnvironmental threats, natural disasters and terrorism will continue to \npresent us with formidable challenges. Mass poverty and accelerating \npopulation growth still trouble many countries. Drug use and drug trafficking \nremain major concerns for the international community. We have seen that \nsocieties can break down both as a result of domestic problems and under \nexternal pressure. \nIt is a fact that the massive flows of refugees which we see today are \njust as likely to be caused by human activities as by natural disasters. In \nEurope, we have been unable so far to stop the tragic developments in the \nformer Yugoslavia. This is the most brutal conflict experienced in our region \nsince the Second World War. Sweden is endeavouring to strengthen regional \nmechanisms and the international framework in order to deal with conflicts of \nthe type we have seen in the Balkans, in Moldavia and in the Caucasus. \n \nIn its own vicinity, Sweden has focused on the risk of conflict inherent \nin the unregulated stationing of former Soviet troops in the sovereign Baltic \nStates. We welcome the recent agreement on troop withdrawal reached by Russia \nand Lithuania and expect that similar agreements will be concluded with \nEstonia and Latvia as well. \nAlthough the end of the cold war has encouraged steps towards peaceful \nsolutions, regional conflicts, often of long standing, continue to claim \nvictims in many parts of the world. In parts of Africa, regional conflicts \nare aggravated by protracted drought, which has contributed to a famine \naffecting millions of people. No one can be indifferent to the situation in \nSomalia, where the civilian population has been hit harder than anywhere else. \nIn other parts of the Horn of Africa as well, the inhabitants are \nsuffering the effects of war. Sweden is participating in the ongoing \ninternational humanitarian relief measures by contributing substantial \nresources. However, humanitarian assistance must be combined with political \nefforts to establish a lasting peace. \nThe positive features of developments in South Africa, where important \nsteps have been taken towards a negotiated settlement, are overshadowed by \npolitical violence which is tending to create a vicious circle. The Swedish \nGovernment supports the efforts of the Secretary-General in contributing to an \nend to the violence and to resumed negotiations leading to the speedy \nabolishment of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic South Africa. \n\nThe historic opportunity to achieve peace which has now opened up in the \nMiddle East must not be lost. However, if peace is to have real content, \nthere must be a comprehensive settlement including all the aspects discussed \nby the multilateral working parties within the framework of the peace \nprocess. The Middle East could greatly benefit from regional cooperation in a \nnumber of areas. \nWhen the parties to a conflict sit down at the negotiating table, a \ndynamic process of confidence-building is often created. We hope that such \ndynamic effects will occur, both in the political process in South Africa and \nin the peace process in the Middle East. \nRecent developments in the disarmament area have been particularly \nhopeful. In the past year, the United States and the members of the \nCommonwealth of Independent States concerned agreed to cut back their \nstrategic nuclear stockpiles by two thirds and to eliminate most of their \ntactical nuclear weapons. \nThe draft convention on a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons \nrepresents a historic achievement in international efforts to prevent the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We hope that growing \ninternational consensus will lead to further effective measures to deal with \nweapons of mass destruction and their proliferation. Sweden pays particular \nattention to the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and to the strengthening \nand indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons as a result of the 1995 Review Conference. \n \nAn important task for this session of the General Assembly is to follow \nup the decisions taken at the United Nations Conference on Environment and \nDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro in June. Industrial and developing countries \nmust work together in a spirit of cooperation and solidarity to deal with \nthreats to our environment and to achieve environmentally sound development. \nA Swedish poet once wrote: \\\"What force may create is uneasy and brief\\\". \nThis is also what history teaches. Lasting solutions to crises and conflicts \ncaused by political and religious antagonisms must be based on the principles \nof democracy and international law. It is therefore in everyone's interest to \nsafeguard the rule of international law, transcending national, ethnic, and \nreligious frontiers. \nIn Europe we have seen a welcome development of the Conference on \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). During the cold war the role of \nthe CSCE was to build bridges. Its central task now is to support the Eastern \nEuropean countries in their transition and to help these new States to find \nforms for peaceful coexistence. When Sweden assumes the chairmanship of the \nCSCE Council of Ministers in December, I intend to work for the further \nenhancement of the capacity of the CSCE to build peace and settle conflicts. \nCoordination between the United Nations and the CSCE was strengthened \nwhen the CSCE, in Helsinki, explicitly pronounced itself a regional \norganization as defined in the United Nations Charter. This is having a \npositive effect, for example on endeavours to solve the conflict in former \nYugoslavia. Different forms of cooperative security between the United \nNations and regional organizations are also being introduced in other conflict \nareas. \n \nHowever, the United Nations has the fundamental responsibility for the \ninterpretation and application of international law. Enforcement measures \nremain the prerogative of the United Nations. But the United Nations must be \nstrengthened in important respects if it is to be able to meet the demands of \ntoday and the expectations of tomorrow. \nSweden wants to contribute to this process. In the first instance, the \npeace-making, peace-keeping and peace-building capacity of the United Nations \nmust be reinforced. This applies to the Security Council, which bears the \nmain responsibility for peace and security under the Charter. It also applies \nto the Secretary-General, who should be given greater possibilities for taking \ninitiatives. \nRegarding the strengthening of the Security Council, I am primarily \nthinking of the Council's possibilities for dealing with threats to \ninternational peace and security at an early stage. However, caution should \nbe exercised in changing the Council's composition and its decision-making \nprocedures, since the Council is now at long last functioning as the Charter \nintended. At the same time, it is important that the decisions of the \nSecurity Council continue to enjoy wide support from Member States. This \nrequires close cooperation between members of the Security Council and other \nMembers of the United Nations. \nSweden welcomes the Secretary-General's report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". \nSeveral of the proposals presented in his report were discussed by the Nordic \ncountries in. an earlier document entitled: \\\"Shaping the Peace the United \nNations in the 1990s\\\". In this document we appealed for, among other things, \nstrengthening the Security Council's and the Secretary-General's capacities to \nundertake preventive diplomacy. It is gratifying to note that this issue has \nnow been given the highest priority. \n \nIt is of the utmost importance that the United Nations be given concrete \npossibilities for anticipating and preventing conflicts. It should be \npossible to deploy peace-keeping forces for preventive purposes. The parties \nto a conflict should be urged to apply to the International Court of Justice \nfor the peaceful settlement of their disputes. Violations of fundamental \nhuman rights can constitute a threat to international peace and security and \nhence be subject to measures by the Security Council. \nAs regards the difficult question of the use of coercive measures to keep \nor build peace under Article 42 of the Charter, and the establishment of \npermanent United Nations forces on a national basis for this purpose, we have \nevery reason carefully to follow and analyse these matters. Any change in \nUnited Nations practice must take place in the broadest possible agreement. \nThe Secretary-General's report also contains proposals for financing \ntraditional peace-keeping missions. The question of financing has become \nincreasingly important as United Nations peace-keeping endeavours have been \nextended. Peace-keeping activities must not be based on the charity of Member \ncountries, as has often been the case in the past. The Nordic countries have \nconcluded that the establishment of a contingency fund for peace-keeping \noperations would constitute an important step towards solving the question of \nfinancing. \nBut peace-keeping operations are only one aspect of the financing \ndifficulties of the United Nations. If the United Nations is to be capable of \nfulfilling its role in the future, now that the political prerequisites exist, \na long-term solution must be found for the Organization's financial crisis. \nFurthermore, all Member States must pay their assessed contributions in \naccordance with their obligations under the Charter. \n \nWe are gratified to note that the broader security concept which Sweden \nadvocates is included in \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". This view should be the basis \nfor the reform of the whole United Nations system. In his report to this \nyear's session of the Economic and Social Council, the Secretary-General has \nfurther developed his thoughts on this issue. His central message is that a \ndistinction cannot and should not be made between United Nations tasks in the \npolitical sphere and those in the economic and social fields. Sweden supports \nthis view. In this context, the proposal to hold a world summit for social \ndevelopment in 1995 takes on particular significance. \nIn the Nordic United Nations project, several concrete proposals are \npresented for making the work of United Nations development assistance more \neffective for example, through a new governance structure and a new \nfinancing system. We welcome the first step taken by the General Assembly in \nstrengthening the capacity of the United Nations to respond to humanitarian \nemergencies. Following the July session of the Economic and Social Council, \nwe hope that it will be possible to proceed successfully with the reform \nmeasures in the economic and social fields during this session of the General \nAssembly. \nThe protection of human rights is also included in the broader security \nconcept. In preparation for next year's United Nations Conference on Human \nRights, Sweden intends to work for measures and procedures which can increase \nrespect for human rights throughout the world, both in developing countries \nand in industrial countries. Let me stress that the Swedish Government \nconsiders that there is a clear connection between respect for fundamental \nhuman rights and economic and social development. Consequently, the question \nof a country's development cannot be divorced from its implementation of \nrespect for human rights. \n \nSweden is presenting its candidature for a seat on the United Nations \nSecurity Council for the 1993-1994 period of office. We are doing so on the \nbasis of the active role we have traditionally played in the United Nations \nsystem. In the election of non-permanent members of the Council, the Charter \nprescribes that due regard be paid to the contribution of Members to the \nmaintenance of international peace and security and to the other purposes of \nthe Organization. \n \nMany Swedes have served the United Nations, both in the Secretariat and \nin the field. Names such as Folke Bernadotte and Dag Hammarskjold are part of \nUnited Nations history. \nSweden has participated in practically all United Nations peace-keeping \noperations. On the basis of our experience in this area, we and the other \nNordic countries can offer advice and training to countries which are now \npreparing for peace-keeping missions. \nSweden placed the problems of the environment on the agenda of the United \nNations. It hosted the first United Nations Conference in this area. \nFor many years, we have been in the vanguard of the United Nations work \nin the economic and social sphere, both as regards planning and financing. \nSweden is a major donor to many of the United Nations development \nagencies and the fourth-largest contributor to the United Nations system as a \nwhole. \nIf Sweden wins support for its candidature for a seat on the United \nNations Security Council, it will entail greater responsibility than was the \ncase when we participated in the work of the Council sixteen years ago. We \nare prepared to shoulder this responsibility. \nIn an international environment which presents new challenges and \nopportunities for cooperation, Sweden's United Nations policy can be \nsummarized in the following three points. \nFirst, we want to contribute to the reinforcement of United Nations \npeacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-building ca\u00ac\u00a3ability. This is a question \nof maintaining the Security Council's effectiveness, which also assumes that \nits decisions enjoy the wide support of Member States. \nThe Secretary-General should be given greater possibilities to take \ninitiatives. It is essential that the financing of peace-keeping operations \n\nbe guaranteed. Sweden supports the proposal for the establishment of a \nspecial contingency fund. \nSecondly, we want to work for an extension of international structures \nfor cooperation to enable us to meet the threats to peace, security and \neconomic development in the 1990s. We attach great importance to the \ninteraction between the United Nations and regional organizations. \nThirdly, we want to promote the application of a broader security concept \nwhich contains not merely a military component but also human rights, \ndemocracy, economic freedom, social justice and environmental responsibility. \nWe support the view that United Nations tasks in the political sphere and in \nthe economic and social field must be considered in the same context. A \ncomprehensive view of this nature, based on the United Nations Charter, should \nform the basis for reform of the United Nations system. \nThe United Nations can establish genuine security in the world. It can \ndo so only by tackling the roots of insecurity. \n"

At the same time, ambitious expectations have been created \nfor the emergence of a new world order based on peaceful coexistence, economic \nequity and social justice. \nThe transition, however, has proved more traumatic and destabilizing than \nthe propitious circumstances would have suggested. The energies for \nrevolutionary change need to be positively directed so that prospects for \ninternational peace are not threatened by the resurgence of ancient ethnic and \ntribal conflicts and the violent clash of nationalistic rivalries. \nRegrettably, there are alarming manifestations of that new threat in \nYugoslavia and Somalia. \nBarbados is appalled at the savagery with which the protagonists of \nethnic strife in what was once Yugoslavia are pursuing their misguided notions \nof nationalism and sovereignty. Such barbarism, including the horrendous \npractice of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", has no place in our modern world. Its \nperpetrators must be made to understand the outrage of the international \ncommunity at their actions. My country fully supports the regime of sanctions \nimposed by the Security Council and the dedicated efforts of the European \nCommunity and the United Nations to create the conditions for a peaceful \nsettlement and to bring relief to the hundreds of thousands of innocent \ncivilian victims. \nEqually disturbing is the desperate situation in Somalia, which, \nregrettably, has only recently attracted the international attention it \ndeserves, and then only at the sharp prodding of the Secretary-General. \nBarbados supports regional and international efforts towards the convening of \no conference on national reconciliation and unity in Somalia and towards \ncreating secure conditions for humanitarian action. \nMy country commends the Secretary General's report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" \nto the Assembly for its careful study. A number of its recommendations are \nconsistent with the views contained in my statement to the General Assembly at \nits forty-sixth session, namely, the need to strengthen the capability of the \nSecretary-General for preventive diplomacy; the need to put into place the \npermanent enforcement tools required under Article 43 of the Charter to deter, \nand in the last resort, counter aggression; and the need to make full use of \nthe appropriate regional and subregional security arrangements under \nChapter VIII of the Charter. We also support his call for greater recourse to \nthe International Court of Justice for the peaceful adjudication of disputes. \nMy delegation supports the view of the Secretary-General that there is an \nurgent necessity to put peace-keeping operations on a sound financial \nfooting. His recommendations and other positive suggestions should be given \nPriority study. \nA number of small countries have been unable to play a part in \ntraditional United Nations peace-keeping simply because they have lacked the \nlogistical military capability for so doing. The expanded dimensions of \npeace-keeping, however, provide the possibility for participation by small \nStates in other fields in which they have expertise, such as electoral \nsupervision, human-rights monitoring and the supply of police and civilian \npersonnel. Such participation should be encouraged and facilitated by the \nOrganization. In this regard, my delegation has noted with interest the \nNorwegian proposal for the establishment of a special United Nations institute \nfor education and training in peace-keeping and related activities as a means \nto respond to these new dimensions. \nWhile we cannot fail to recognize the indispensable nature of United \nNations peace-keeping operations, my country is nevertheless concerned at the \ndramatic escalation in their costs and would wish to see more stringent \ncontrols and oversight in place to ensure efficient use of the billions of \ndollars now involved. \nAn agenda for peace requires a supportive economic environment. A new \nworld order must be developed around the central priority of closing the gap \nbetween North and South, '.'his requires courageous leadership on the part of \nthe North to create the opportunities for sustainable economic and social \ndevelopment in the South through genuine trade liberalization, meaningful \ndebt-relief strategies and positive resource transfers. It also requires \nresponsible management; sound, people-oriented development planning; and the \ncreation of the appropriate environment for development on the part of the \nSouth. \nThe United Nations is a critical forum for the resuscitation of the \ninternational economic dialogue. Barbados welcomes the serious debate now \ntaking place on reforming and strengthening the economic and social mandate of \nthe United Nations. Any such reform must be consistent with the provisions of \nthe Charter and seek to ensure universality and accessibility. Care must be \ntaken not to exclude the small and powerless from the process. Regrettably, \nhowever, the emphasis currently given to developmental issues within the \nadministrative structure of the Organization does not reflect the priority \naccorded to those issues by the majority of Member States. My delegation \naccepts that the maintenance of international peace and security is a major \nresponsibility of the United Nations. We strongly support the view that peace \nand economic and social well-being are indivisible and that issues relating to \ndevelopment must be given emphasis equal to that given to issues relating to \npeace. \nIt is important that the United Nations be a forum for constructive \nconsensus-building, where all points of view no matter the size of their \nproponents or how much influence they wield are given equal attention and \nrespect. A new world order cannot evolve except in an atmosphere of free and \nopen dialogue, consultation and transparency in decision-making. \nThere is considerable merit in the argument that the Security Council in \nthe post-cold-war era should be updated to reflect the new international \npolitical and economic realities, as well as the balance and diversity \nnecessary for its decisions, if it is to command universal acceptance and \nrespect. \nA very topical issue in this forum in recent times has been the dialogue \non what the Secretary-General has termed \\\"the democratization of international \nrelations and the participation of all States in developing new norms of \ninternational life\\\". There have been calls for the redefinition of the \nconcept of State sovereignty in international law, and many States have \naccepted as a matter of policy the notion of the right to intervene on \nhumanitarian grounds and for the protection of human rights, and have \nadvocated the universal application of such a principle. \nMy country has always been outspoken on the universal need to protect and \nstrengthen the principles of democracy and respect for fundamental human \nrights. We have consistently condemned abuses, wherever and whenever they \nhave occurred, and long before the resurgence of democratic values in our \nregion and elsewhere made it popular or safe to do so. Our actions have \nalways been motivated strictly by principle and objectivity, and not by \nideological considerations that have served in the past to politicize the \ndebate. \nThe disappearance of ideological polarization gives the international \ncommunity an unprecedented opportunity to influence the dialogue on this vital \nissue in a balanced and constructive way. There is need to ensure respect for \nfundamental human rights; out there is equal need to take care to promote \nimpartial standards for measuring adherence to, and for guarding scrupulously \nagainst manipulation of, the debate to suit the narrow foreign policy \ninterests of particular States. What is needed in the ensuing dialogue is the \nsensitive and sensible application of universally agreed standards, not the \nimposition of new forms of conditionality devoid of all historical or cultural \ncontext. \nThe World Conference on Human Rights, scheduled to be held in Vienna in \nJune 1993, will present a unique opportunity not only to review the progress \nmade in human rights since 1948, but also to formulate recommendations aimed \nat charting the course of human rights well into the twenty-first century. \nThe tragic situation of the people of Haiti remains a major preoccupation \nof the Government and people of Barbados and of the Caribbean Community \n(CARICOM) as a whole. We have made clear our outright condemnation of the \nusurpation of the authority of the legitimate government of \nPresident Aristide, and have collaborated with our regional partners in \nCARICOM and the Organization of American States (OAS) in the effort to restore \nthat government. We have supported the OAS-imposed embargo and the Protocol \nof Washington. It is clear, however, that no lasting solution can be found, \nexcept in a context that neutralizes the power of a brutal and lawless \nmilitary, which continues with impunity its flagrant abuses of the human \nrights of the Haitian people. The international community has a special \nobligation towards the people of Haiti, whose electoral process was monitored \nand authenticated at every step with direct United Nations involvement. If \nsuch a process can be overturned with impunity, what message are we sending to \nthe world of would-be dictators, and what assurance are we providing for the \nfledgling democracies in our region? It is imperative that the United Nations \ntake action to internationalize the embargo and to contribute, in whatever \nways are considered appropriate and useful, to OAS efforts towards the \nrestoration of the Aristide government. \nBarbados is greatly encouraged by the decision reached by the De Klerk \nGovernment and by Mr. Mandela on 26 September 1992 to resume negotiations with \na view to establishing an interim government and a constituent assembly in \nSouth Africa. The release of 150 political prisoners and the promise by the \nSouth African Government to release the remaining political prisoners by 15 \nNovember 1992 represent a significant development that satisfies an important \ncondition of the United Nations Declaration on southern Africa. \nBarbados deplores the violence that has been a major obstacle to reform \nin South Africa, and holds the De Klerk Government fully responsible for \nfailing to curb it. The role of the United Nations remains critical to reform \nefforts in South Africa. We therefore welcome the deployment of 50 United \nNations observers in South Africa to assist with the implementation of the \nNational Peace Accord, and hope that the size of this contingent will be \nincreased, if necessary. We urge all the parties to collaborate in \nmaintaining an environment free of violence and to participate in peaceful \nnegotiations aimed at achieving a non-racial, democratic South Africa. \nWe are also encouraged by the current dialogue in the Middle East. We \nhope that all parties will make every effort to achieve a just and lasting \npeace. \nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), \nwhich took place in Rio de Janeiro in June this year, was perhaps the most \nambitious and far-reaching United Nations-sponsored gathering ever held. It \nserved a vital purpose in focusing world attention on the interrelationship \nbetween human development and the environment, and in fostering global \nawareness of the importance of the concept of sustainable development to the \nfuture survival of our planet and all its inhabitants. \nBarbados cannot pretend to be fully satisfied with the results of the Rio \nConference. It was, however, an important beginning in the process towards an \ninternational blueprint for sustainable development in the twenty-first \ncentury. The creation of a high-level sustainable development commission is \nan important element in providing serious follow-up to the decisions of \nAgenda 21. Care must be taken to ensure the widest possible access to, and \nparticipation in, the work of the Commission by the full membership of the \nUnited Nations. Barbados has signed the Conventions on Climate Change and on \nBiological Diversity, and is taking the necessary steps at the domestic level \nto ensure their early ratification. We reiterate, however, that there is an \nurgent need to begin work on a protocol to the Framework Convention on Climate \nChange that specifically addresses stabilization and reduction of carbon \ndioxide and other greenhouse gases. \nMy country is heartened that one of the significant achievements at UNCED \nwas the recognition given to the special environmental and development needs \nof small island developing States, leading to the inclusion in Agenda 21 of a \nspecific plan of action for the sustainable development of small island \ndeveloping States. In this regard, my delegation wishes to place on record \nits deep appreciation of the sterling efforts of the Alliance of Small Island \nStates (AOSIS), whose contribution to the success of the Conference cannot be \noverstated. As part of the plan to identify and address the special needs of \nthis category of States, a global conference will be convened in 1993. \nBarbados is honoured to reiterate its offer to host that Conference. \nThe vulnerability of our environment and the fragility of our marine \necosystems require constant vigilance to guard against deliberate or \naccidental degradation. In this connection, we echo the concerns of the Prime \nMinister of Saint Kitts and Nevis about the possible passage through our \nregion of plutonium or other hazardous material. \nThe opportunities provided for shaping a truly harmonious new world order \nare enormous. The danger of failure is, however, equally great, unless the \nredefinition of our future takes place with equal participation by all the \nmembers of the global family. Never before has the power of the few over the \ndestinies of the many been so apparent, and never before has it been so vital \nto the survival of the majority of small and powerless States that make up the \nUnited Nations for that power to be used responsibly.

        "file_text": "In electing you to your high office last week, Mr. President, \nthe General Assembly also identified itself with the victory of freedom and \ndemocracy throughout Europe. I should like to congratulate you on this and \ngreet you as the representative of a country with which we have a close and \nlong-standing friendship. \nFor you, Mr. Secretary-General, this is the first session of the General \nAssembly since you took office. For the determination and energy with which \nyou have set about the huge tasks ahead you deserve the appreciation of us all. \nI extend a special welcome to the representatives of those countries that \nhave been admitted to our Organization since the last session of the General \nAssembly. \nThe world breathed a sigh of relief when the East-West confrontation \nended at long last. There was an almost tangible euphoria of peace. Since \nthen we have come back down to earth. Freedom has opened the door not only to \n\nhistoric opportunities but, unfortunately, to the old demons as well: blind \nnationalism and hegemonic aspirations, xenophobia and religious fanaticism. \nIn this process, the dramatic changes to the political map are far from having \nsettled down. The impact of the quake cannot yet be fully assessed, nor can \nwe rule out further tremors. But despite all our new problems we must not \nforget that hardly any previous generation had such opportunities to live in \npeace, harmony and prosperity with its neighbours. We can therefore look to \nthe future with confidence. \nAnd this opportunity extends beyond Europe. The termination of the \nEast-West conflict has paved the way for the settlement of conflicts in the \nsouthern hemisphere as well, conflicts which for decades seemed insoluble. In \nthe Middle East, in southern Africa and in Cambodia the parties involved are \nmoving towards each other in a manner that would have been inconceivable in \nthe days of the ideological proxy wars. \nThus my message is: let us continue to be guided by the vision of a \nbetter, a more equitable world. With great perseverance, we have ended the \nEast-West confrontation. We now need the same commitment, the same stamina, \nto build a new order. We must keep in mind the new energies that have been \nreleased and harness them for peace and for mankind. \nBy establishing European union, the European Community is trying to seize. \nthe chance of the century for the entire continent. It is the vision of a \ntruly united Europe. The affirmation of this union by our French friends has \nkept alive the chance to make that vision a reality. \n \nHowever, Governments must also take their citizens along with them on \nthis road to Europe. Europe does not grow out of treaties; it grows from the \nhearts of its citizens or it does not grow at all. Strengthening their \nconfidence in Europe's common future remains the principal task of Community \npolicy in the months ahead. Although the dissatisfaction, uncertainty and \nlack of understanding that have become apparent in nearly all countries cannot \nsimply be dismissed, no changes to the Treaty of Maastricht are needed to \ncushion some of the effects. \nThe European Community is not only a model of hope and prosperity for \nEastern Europe; it has also developed new forms of cooperation and partnership \nwith the developing countries. Its path towards integration has inspired many \nregional initiatives in Asia, Africa and Latin America. In the light of this \nglobal responsibility, too, Europe must come to speak with one voice here at \nthe United Nations as well. \nIn these times of change, when so much of what was valid yesterday is \nbeing challenged, when many people in the West see their standard of living, \ntheir personal security and their national and cultural identity threatened, \nwhen even more people in the East and in the South do not know today what they \nare going to live on tomorrow, when an army of refugees from war and poverty \nthreatens to become a new migration, we shall have to find an answer to the \nquestion of whether the international community, through its new spirit of \ncommon endeavour following the cold war, will be capable of mastering the \nchallenges of our time. \nThere is doubt as to the ability of the political establishment as a \nwhole to find solutions, and this applies not only to Europe. There is a huge \ngap between people's expectations and the actual achievements of Governments, \n \nboth internally and externally. Governments are under an obligation to \nachieve again greater consistency between verbal commitment and action. \nThe historic process of European unification is currently being \novershadowed by something that was considered inconceivable only a few years \nago: the return of barbarity to the European house. A war of destruction and \nexpulsion is raging in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a conflict which conjures up a \nterrible past. What is happening there and we cannot be clear enough about \nthis is genocide. \nThe London Conference has underscored the resolve of the community of \nnations to silence the weapons. It has initiated the Geneva negotiating \nprocess as a common, major effort of the United Nations and the European \nCommunity probably one of the last chances to secure a political solution in \nthe foreseeable future. The co-Chairmen of the conference, Cyrus Vance and \nLord Owen, have our full support. Germany will play its part in this peace \nconference. But one thing must remain clear: the community of nations will \nnever recognize borders that have been changed by force. Those who hope to \nreceive assistance from the family of nations later must stop fighting now \nat once. \nDespite cautious signs that the Serbian leaders are perhaps after all \nbecoming aware of the consequences of being outlawed by the international \ncommunity, murder and expulsion continue. We have been shocked by the report \nof the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) mission on the \ncrimes and atrocities perpetrated in the detention camps. We Europeans \nespecially must be honest: each day on which innocent civilians are fired at \nand prisoners tortured undermines the credibility and authority of the new \nEurope we aim to build together. \n \nWar also prevails in Somalia, the Sudan, Liberia, Afghanistan, Georgia \nand Nagorno-Karabakh. Greed, anarchy and human suffering have assumed \nheart-wrenching dimensions, especially in Somalia. The community of nations, \nthough late in doing so, has turned its attention to the starvation, misery \nand want of the people there. It is to be hoped that the efforts of the \nSecretary-General and his Special Representative Mr. Sahnoun will be able to \nrestore peace to this sorely tried country and put it back on a sound economic \nfoundation. \n\nWhat are the conclusions for the international community that must be \ndrawn from this situation? Respect for international law and human rights as \nthe foundation of peace and international order was one of the main lessons of \nthe Second World War. That experience led to the creation of the United \nNations and the European Community. The aim of overcoming nationalistic \nhegemony, the use of force and violations of human rights by means of \ninternational and supranational cooperation is still valid. Even setbacks \nmust not be allowed to divert us from this just path of law and respect for \nhuman dignity. There is no reasonable alternative, unless we want to revert \nto the law of the jungle. \nOnly if the United Nations or the regional organizations prove capable of \nprotecting individual States from external aggression and minorities from \ndomestic persecution will it be possible, now that the East-West conflict is \nover, to make the desired transition from policies of national hegemony and \narmament to the rule of law, collective security and economic and social \ndevelopment. \nWhat will this require? Firstly, the system of collective security of \nthe United Nations, and of regional arrangements such as the CSCE, must be \nmade a powerful instrument of a new world domestic policy. Conflicts are, \nunfortunately, emerging faster than the instruments to contain them. You, \nMr. Secretary-General, have made extensive proposals with the correct aim of \nmaking the United Nations, for the first time in its history, what the Charter \nintended it to be: the world community's chief custodian of peace; and that \naim, I say here, can be achieved. \n\n\\\"Nip it in the bud!\\\" This must be the golden rule of conflict \nprevention. Diplomatic activity must start before an acute threat to security \noccurs. Such activity must, where necessary, be reinforced by the preventive \ndeployment of peace-keeping forces. This proposal has our full support. It \nmust be made absolutely clear to a potential aggressor, right from the start, \nthat he must expect to be confronted with the whole range of political, \neconomic and military sanctions provided for in the United Nations Charter. \nAnyone who holds a protecting hand over the aggressor must expect to be \nisolated, and anyone who breaks sanctions will likewise have sanctions to \ncontend with. \nCrucial for collective security is close cooperation between institutions \nsuch as the United Nations or the CSCE on the one hand and collective defence \nalliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or the Western \nEuropean Union on the other. Initial steps have been taken in this direction \nin recognition of the fact that, even though the East-West conflict has ended, \ndemocracies must, firstly, remain capable of defending themselves and the new \narchitecture must, secondly, become capable of defending itself. What is \nbeyond dispute domestically must also be applied to international security if \nthere is to be real order. If all other means fail, the law must, if \nnecessary, be protected by military force against those who violate it. This \nis also a lesson from a past that was, for us Germans in particular, a \ndisastrous one. This is anchored in the United Nations Charter. \nGermany's contribution to international stability will continue to focus \non peacemaking, through economic cooperation, protection of human rights, \nhumanitarian aid, and international measures to protect the environment. \n\nHowever, we must also establish the constitutional basis to enable us to make \nour armed forces available to the United Nations, with the approval of \nParliament, for peace-keeping and peacemaking assignments. As a reunited and \nsovereign country we must assume all the rights and obligations of a Member of \nthe United Nations to avoid any discrepancy between our verbal commitment to \npeace and human rights and our active involvement in their defence. \nThe Government and the Parliament of my country will not forget that our \nhistory commands us to show particular restraint and judgment; but, while \nremaining aware of the past, we must derive the strength and courage to find a \nbetter future. \nWithin the framework of its constitution Germany has already participated \nin United Nations operations for example, in Namibia, Angola, Central \nAmerica, Cambodia and Iraq by providing logistic and organizational support, \nelection observers, verification teams and medical personnel. Our relief \nflights to Sarajevo and Somalia have broadened the range of our commitment. \nThe reforms you have vigorously initiated, Mr. Secretary General, have \nour full backing. We encourage you to pursue them with determination. The \nappointment of a coordinator for humanitarian assistance has shown, despite \nall the scepticism, that this Organization is capable of change. Further \nreforms should, in our view, focus principally on three areas: \nrationalization of the Secretariat, streamlining its committees and \nprocedures, and strengthening the position of the Secretary-General in \nrelation to the subsidiary bodies and specialized agencies. This is urgently \nneeded, especially in the central area of environment and development. \n\nThe Security Council is the guardian of international peace. Its \nefficiency and credibility are of equal importance. A debate on reforming the \nCouncil is under way. We Germans will not take the initiative in this \nrespect, but if a change in the Council's composition is actually considered \nwe too shall make known our intention to seek a permanent seat. \nSecondly, States and regional organizations must assume greater \nresponsibility. The United Nations must not be overstrained: the idea that \nit can protect and feed all people afflicted by external or internal war is a \nUtopian. \nThirdly, we must further develop the international legal system with the \naim of further protecting mankind and nature. This can now take place in a \nprocess of fair partnership, free from bloc ideology. This too represents a \ngreat opportunity in the wake of the East-West conflict. In this process, we \nmust bring out the special dimension of law: it demands participation and \nconsensus. All are equal before the law. It protects the weak and \nlegitimizes the use of force where force is unavoidable. \nNo cultural region should try to force its own system of values on \nothers. On the other hand, there is a body of human rights universally \nbinding under international law which no one should seek to erode, not even on \ngrounds of differing cultural traditions. This must be the central message of \nthe Conference on Human Rights to be held in Vienna next year. \nUnder the Nazi regime, the gravest crimes against humanity were committed \nin the name of Germany. In 1945, the Germans in the western part of our \ncountry had the good fortune to be able to establish a free, democratic \nsociety based on the rule of law. Those in the other part of Germany had to \n\nbear another totalitarian regime until 1990. So we Germans have well and \ntruly suffered in this respect. We know from our own experience that a life \nof dignity and fulfilment is not possible without respect for human rights. I \ntherefore never tire of repeating my belief that policy, including foreign \npolicy, must focus on the individual. It is he who counts. It is he who must \nbe protected and saved from injustice. The defence of human rights remains a \ncentral aim of German foreign policy. \n\nAn effective international legal system must enable people to exercise \ntheir human rights, afford protection to those whose human rights have been \nviolated, and consistently bring the perpetrators to account. Together with \nour partners in the European Community we call for the appointment of a High \nCommissioner for Human Rights. Those who commit genocide, those who commit \nserious violations of human rights - and this, unfortunately, is happening all \nthe time all over the world - ask Amnesty International must be brought \nbefore an international crimes tribunal. I am gratified to note that \nGermany's proposal for such a tribunal is now receiving broad support. The \nInternational Law Commission should be given a mandate to draw up an \nappropriate statute. \nWe shall strive to ensure that the perpetrators of atrocities, no matter \nwho they are, are brought to justice. No one should be able to rest in the \nassurance that the matter will be forgotten. This is another reason why we \nneed a High Commissioner for Human Rights. His investigations and other \ninformation should be collated in a register to serve as the basis for \nsubsequent criminal proceedings. Our experience with the regime in the former \nGerman Democratic Republic shows that the fear of such misdeeds being recorded \nis not without effect. Violation of human rights is one of mankind's great \nscourges. We should not spare ourselves the effort needed to expose, denounce \nand prevent them. \nAlthough the massive East-West confrontation is a thing of the past, \ndisarmament, confidence-building and the control of arms exports remain \nessential preconditions for enhancing peace. After an arms race spanning \ndecades the new era has made considerable progress in the field of disarmament \nas well. \n\nYet the world is still bristling with weapons. We in Europe are the \nfirst to have begun destroying tanks. The pacification of the North must not \nlead to the South being armed to the hilt. The developing countries do not \nneed more tanks and guns but more schools and hospitals. The United Nations \nRegister of Conventional Arms must be seen as the point of departure for \nreducing the present irresponsible level of international trade in weapons. \nPreventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction is the most urgent \ntask in the field of disarmament today. Germany is determined to play a \npioneering role in this respect. We are the only country in the world to have \nunilaterally and unconditionally renounced nuclear, biological and chemical \nweapons. \nThe Convention imposing a global ban on chemical weapons, which was \nprepared by the Geneva Conference on Disarmament under our chairmanship, is a \nmilestone along this road. I call upon all Members of the United Nations to \nsignal their support of this Convention during the present session of the \nGeneral Assembly and to sign it without delay. \nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons must be extended \nindefinitely in 1995. If we fail to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, \nmankind will become exposed to a nuclear threat no less frightening than that \nof the cold war. We cannot put the nuclear genie back in the bottle, but we \nmust keep it under strict control. This also calls for an international \nconvention for the enhancement of reactor safety. \nAll these are tasks enough, but the biggest of all is that of \nestablishing a new partnership for development and environmental protection \nbetween poor and rich nations which will make the Earth a fit place for the \npresent and future generations to live in. \n\nThe world is grossly unjust. From the day of their birth countless \npeople do not have the slightest chance whatsoever of living in conditions \nthat could even remotely be described as worthy of the human race. About a \nbillion people live in abject poverty and can neither read nor write. Almost \n20 million refugees are trying to escape from want. One fifth of the world's \npopulation consumes four fifths of all resources and earns 60 times as much as \nthe poorest fifth. \nWe in the industrialized countries, on the other hand, concerned with our \nown problems which I do not deny exist - forget that, compared with many \nregions of the third world, we live on an \\\"island of bliss\\\". Many of us think \nonly of our entitlements, about defending our standards of living. As a \nresult, we tend to forget the values of humanity and solidarity. \nOur free system in the West may have won the struggle with \ntotalitarianism, but we must now prove that our economic system, our way of \nlife, is able to secure lasting development in the eastern and southern \nregions of the globe as well. \nIn the third world countries, on the other hand, the recognition must \ncontinue to grow that they cannot simply make demands on others but are \nthemselves primarily responsible for keeping their house in order. The \nJakarta Conference has confirmed the clear change of attitude in this \nrespect. This is an encouraging trend. \nWhat is the essential requirement? It is to develop a global partnership \nand forms of coexistence in the North and the South which will ensure mutual \nsurvival. For this we shall have to find a reasonable middle way between the \ncompletely unrealistic attitude that everything must be achieved at one fell \nswoop and that of resignation, the attitude that it is already too late. \n\nThe North must open its markets to give the weaker economies a genuine \nchance of development. By eliminating protectionism we must strengthen the \neconomic foundations of those countries currently fighting for democracy and \nhuman rights. That is why it is so important to bring the negotiations of the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to a successful conclusion. \nStabilizing the economy of Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of \nIndependent States must not be done at the expense of development aid. \nBringing the new democracies in the East and the developing countries into a \nglobal partnership together was the general objective of the economic summit \nmeeting in Munich. Germany, too, has kept its word in this respect. In spite \nof our exceptional domestic situation and our enormous contribution to the \nprocess of economic recovery in the new democracies between Bug and \nVladivostok, our development aid budget has continued to grow - even since \n1990. And we shall continue to provide substantial support for measures to \nbridge the poverty gap between North and South. Our offer to make Bonn the \nlocation for some United Nations development activities should be understood \nin this sense. \nWhat is required is a radical technological transformation in the fields \nof transport, energy, industrial production, housing and agriculture and a new \ngeneration of environment-friendly technologies. To implement the results of \nthe Rio Conference there will have to be standard reduction levels for carbon \ndioxide emissions as well as effective measures for the protection of forests. \nThe most difficult task is at the same time one of the most important \nthat of implementing a responsible population policy. This calls for changes \nwhich considerably affect the rights of the individual. The first step must be \nto improve the social status of women in the developing countries. People \n\nhave a right to determine the size of their family themselves. Family \nplanning must be given greater prominence in development strategy. The \nimportance of the International Conference on Population and Development \nto be held in 1994 and of the World Conference on Women scheduled for 1995 \ncannot be emphasized enough. \nThe help provided by the industrialized countries can never be more \nthan help towards self-help. One must also draw the necessary conclusion \nfrom the collapse of communist ideology: totalitarianism renders a \ncountry incapable of development. \nIn a nutshell, what is needed is a departure from short-sighted \negoism and over-exploitation of nature towards measures to safeguard the \nfuture, towards more social justice, as well as a balance between ecology \nand economy. In this age of growing individual freedom we must also \nremain capable of demonstrating solidarity and showing consideration for \nthe community as a whole. The responsible use of freedom is the real \nchallenge at the end of this century. In order to meet this challenge, \nand for the sake of our children's future, the world - East and West, \nNorth and South must learn together. We must learn to survive together \nin a new world. \nNo institution is more suited to be the central authority of this \nlearning community than the United Nations. In 1995 it will celebrate its \nfiftieth anniversary. Let us by that date together strengthen this forum \nto make it capable of fulfilling the hopes of people all over the globe. \nLet us not forget: We, the nations, will get the world Organization we \ndeserve! \n\nHardly any country can have been more affected by the dramatic upheavals \nof our time and by the disparity of opportunity and risk, of hope and anxiety \nabout the future, than has Germany. We have been reunited, and for that we \nare grateful very grateful. Our prime task now is to complete the internal \nunification of our nation, and this task pushes us to the limits of our \nresources. None the less, we have contributed more to the economic recovery \nof central and eastern Europe and the members of the Commonwealth of \nIndependent States (CIS) than have all other countries together. \nIn Europe, our liberal legislation on foreigners has enabled us to take \nin by far the largest number of asylum-seekers probably 400,000 this year; \n220,000 refugees from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina have found refuge in \nour country. We are the biggest attraction in Europe and in the world for the \nmassive social migration from East to West and from South to North. In view \nof our still-high level of unemployment and our housing shortage, especially \nin the eastern part of the country, this places an exceptional burden on the \npopulation. This has to be appreciated if one is to make a fair judgement of \nour people's attitude towards foreigners. \nIn emphasizing this point I am not trying to tone it down. The hatred \ndemonstrated and the terror perpetrated by a radical minority against \nasylum-seekers in our country brings disgrace on Germany. This I deeply \nregret, but let me add that this is not the attitude of the great majority of \nGermans towards other nationalities. In my country 6.3 million foreigners \nlive harmoniously with their German neighbours. Year in, year out, the \nGermans demonstrate their solidarity with other nations through extensive \n\nrelief campaigns, through their generous donations for the benefit of people \nin the former Soviet Union, and through their considerable aid for the Kurds \nand the starving people of Somalia. \nGermany owes its unity to the dismantling of confrontation in Europe and \nto the trust we have gained through our European policy and through our not \nhaving pursued a national course. We derive from this a responsibility. We \nshall continue to give our full support to European unification and global \ncooperation based on partnership, especially within the United Nations. We \nshall use all our energy in favour of human rights and against oppression, in \nfavour of global solidarity and against excessive nationalism. This is the \nessence of the foreign policy of the united Germany for which I stand. \n"

        "file_text": "I should \nlike to begin by extending a warm welcome to the new States Members of the \nUnited Nations. Colombia hopes to be allied with all of them as they strive \nto consolidate the growth of democracy. I should also like to congratulate \nthe President on his election to lead this session of the Assembly, and to \nexpress our recognition of the leadership and effectiveness shown by \nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in making the United Nations the home \nof peace, development and progress for humanity. \nI address all gathered here today at the General Assembly with a profound \nfeeling of sorrow, because at this moment thousands of defenceless people are \nvictims of the war against Bosnia and Herzegovina and because in Somalia \nthousands are dying of hunger. I would urge the General Assembly of the \nUnited Nations to take at this session a decisive step forward in resolving \nthese world conflicts. \nAmong the trends that nourish our hopes for the future of mankind, we \nshould highlight the decisive role that the United Nations has undertaken to \nplay as a catalyst of the new global agenda. But the Organization still has \nmany of the features inherited from the cold-war period. Reforms must move \nforward with prudence and patience, but also with the certainty that the \ndecision-making mechanisms of the United Nations will be more democratic, more \nequal, more representative and more effective. Only then will we be able to \nadvance the future role of the United Nations. The \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" \npresented by the Secretary-General is certainly a guideline for our \nachievement of these objectives. \nIn the past, when the world was divided into two- irreconcilable poles, it \nwas almost impossible to reach agreement even on the simplest of ideas. But \nnow conditions exist for multilateral organizations to become the principal \nactors of the new world order. But here too we must call for caution. The \nkey problems of the new world agenda cannot be resolved without the active \nparticipation of developing nations. This new principal role in the \nmanagement of the international agenda must be recognized by the \nindustrialized countries if we are to make truly viable a multilateral \napproach based on mutual cooperation. \nAt the same time, the industrialized nations cannot continue using \nmultilaterism selectively. Also, the developed countries will have to abandon \nthe practice of using multilateral organizations as mere instruments to \nlegitimize their unilateral decisions. This is a double standard that puts at \nrisk the success of multilateral solutions. \nFive hundred years ago, thanks to the courage of Columbus, the meeting of \ntwo worlds that were separated by fear and ignorance became possible. Because \nof his accomplishment the planet became one, awakening mankind to undreamt of \nhorizons of progress and well-being. \nOnly a few decades ago the cold war separated the world into two once \nagain. During that time people were not separated into isolated continents \nbut into opposing blocs divided by an immense ocean of distrust and hate. \nNow, as the world celebrates the five hundredth anniversary of the discovery, \nhumanity once again has an opportunity to forge a truly global community. \nThe joy of liberated peoples dancing on top of crumbling walls is, alas, \nfleeting. Democracy in Europe and America has shown that it is not enough to \ndefeat dictatorship in order to achieve true freedom. The tyranny of poverty, \ndrugs, terrorism, fratricidal war, stagnation and paper democracies continues \nto be an unavoidable threat to peace, security and well-being. Perhaps things \ndid seem easier in the past when we believed we had just one enemy communism \nor militarism. Now we can see more clearly the real evils afflicting mankind. \nEven though there are powerful reasons for optimism about the future, we \ncannot give up our enthusiasm thinking these difficulties have now all been \novercome. We have a new agenda which we must begin to undertake with the same \neffort and dedication with which the cold war was fought. \nThe road to a new international order is plagued by paradoxes. While the \ndeveloping nations are embracing the benefits of free trade, the \nindustrialized nations are sticking to protectionist barriers and creating new \nrestrictive trade procedures. At the very moment these trends are occurring \nthe industrialized nations are cheerfully proclaiming to the four winds the \ntriumph of the free market. \nIf the world economy continues along the road of protectionism the \npossibilities of creating a new international order based politically on \ndemocratic principles and economically on individual freedoms will continue to \nrecede. Without access to markets we will not be able to achieve the levels \nof economic development necessary to defeat poverty and to promote a climate \nof world peace. Confronting this return to protectionism must be one of the \nprincipal contributions to peace and the progress of mankind. \nIt is equally paradoxical that, when events signal a new era of \ninternational solidarity, symptoms of growing isolationism exist. The \nindustrialized countries are focusing increasingly on their internal affairs, \nsidestepping their obligation to contribute to peace and progress in the \nglobal community. \nA world in which hundreds of millions live in poverty without any hope of \na better life cannot afford the luxury of egoism. The wealthier countries \ncannot turn their backs on these multitudes by proclaiming that all of \nmankind's problems will be resolved by the invisible hand of the \nmarket-place. Now more than ever solidarity is essential. \nWhen East and West extended their confrontation to the furthest corners \nof the planet the developing countries enjoyed the most perverse dividend of \nthe conflict. There was never a lack of external resources to feed the \neuphoria of war. Now that the guns have been silenced, international \nassistance for democracy and for alleviating poverty is elusive. Now that \nthere is a need for generosity, and solidarity is the only argument put \nforward in support of it, the helping hand is withdrawn and the back is turned. \nThe Earth Summit was certainly a milestone in the history of mankind. \nRio de Janeiro is the beginning of a long road that must be travelled to \nreconcile man with nature. Unfortunately there are dangerous trends in the \nindustrialized countries threatening international cooperation on \nenvironmental problems. \nFor example, there is the unilateral imposition of barriers and \nenvironmental conditions for our countries. This is not good policy. It \ncould lead to an unacceptable situation in which the North continues to \nadvance and pollute and the South remains poor in order to reduce the global \nenvironmental degradation caused by the industrialized nations. This new form \nof environmental protectionism is a source of conflict that must be dealt with. \nI know all too well that when Colombia's name is mentioned in the great \ncapitals of the world people inevitably think of drug-trafficking. \nUnfortunately this has been so because my people, armed only with their \nstrength and their courage, have had to take on an unequal and heroic lone \nbattle against the most powerful and most perverse criminals known to mankind. \nColombia is a victim of the uncontrollable appetite for drugs throughout \nthe world. Three days ago the bullets that killed a valiant Colombian judge, \nMyriam Rocio Velez, were bought with money from cocaine consumers. The bribes \nthat corrupt the law enforcement and prison authorities in our country come \nout of the pockets of drug addicts in the major capitals of the world. The \ndynamite used in car bombs that assassinate innocent citizens in the streets \nof Colombia is paid for with the money of those who consider their insatiable \nvice as harmless and innocent. \nIt hurts us even more that those who point an accusing finger at a \ncourageous people who have endured so many sacrifices are precisely those who \nhave no problem ignoring a neighbour who uses drugs, launders money, traffics \nin arms, illegally exports precursor chemicals or runs drug distribution \nnetworks in streets and cities. \nThere is no doubt that in Colombia we have lost some battles and have \nsuffered severe setbacks, including the recent and widely publicized escape \nfrom prison of a group of well-known drug-traffickers. In spite of that \nbitter medicine we can say with pride that no other country in the world has \nfought the scourge of drugs with such resolve and success. \nThe treason of some corrupt officials who gave up their dignity for a \nhandful of dollars does not negate the sacrifices of the thousands of \nColombians who are fighting in defence of democracy and mankind. Hear me \nwell: it is true that Pablo Escobar escaped from jail but he will not escape \nfrom the firm resolve of Colombians to see justice done. \nI am convinced that by keeping to our legendary firmness, Colombia will \nsoon be liberated forever from violence and crime. But, unfortunately, \ndrug-trafficking is an international crime that threatens mankind in every \ncorner of the planet. It is not enough for only the Colombians to be valiant \nand victorious. \nToday in Colombia we have drug-traffickers, tomorrow they will be in \nsister nations. Today their enterprise is cocaine; tomorrow they will be \nlooking for other new, lucrative products such as heroin. Today they are \nmaking millions from the demand in the United States; tomorrow they will be \ngetting even richer with money from Europe and Japan. We are already seeing \nthese changes and these adaptations. \nDrug-trafficking is a hydra-headed monster; it is not enough to cut off \njust one head or only a few heads. To eradicate this scourge once and for all \nwe need to take decisive, collective action, international and multilateral \naction, against this evil on all fronts. \nTwo years ago I stood before the Assembly and called on all Members to \nwork together against drug-trafficking. Now we must ask the question: what \nhave we achieved since then? \nTwo years ago the drug cartels looked invincible, were even threatening \nto destroy democracy in Colombia and impose a reign of terror and violence. \nToday most of those enemies of society are dead or in jail. \nTwo years ago the industrialized world, with an accusing gesture, held \nresponsible for the problem those very countries that are in fact victims of \nthe production and processing of drugs. Today we know that the consumers of \ndrugs, are the source of the problem and cannot evade their responsibilities. \nTwo years ago international financial centres were accepting funds from \nthe most dubious sources without regard as to the propriety of their actions. \nToday we have started to see a change in attitude. \nTwo years ago, drug trafficking was growing out of control. Today, from \none end to the other of the western hemisphere, we have achieved unprecedented \nlevels of drug interdiction. \nTwo years ago, the epidemic of drug use looked uncontainable. Today, we \nare certain that the demand for drugs can be controlled if the necessary \neconomic resources are made available. \nTwo years ago, no one recognized the close ties between poverty, the \nabsence of economic opportunity and the emergence of drug trafficking. Today, \nwe know that alternative development, trade opportunities and economic aid are \nneeded to overcome the drug problem. \nBut all this progress real progress is not enough. Drug trafficking \nadapts itself easily to the efforts of society to stamp it out. Criminal \norganizations, now not only in Colombia but practically all over the world, \nhave entered into this illegal business. While consumption is dropping in the \nUnited States, it is growing in Europe and Asia. \nToday, more than ever before, we must strengthen international \ncooperation in the struggle against this enemy of humanity. Today, more than \never, we need a vision of the future to guide our efforts and guarantee our \npeople that the problem can be overcome. That is why I want to challenge the \ninternational community today. I invite you join me in establishing clear \ngoals and measurable commitments so that all of us will know where we want to \ngo and when we hope to get there. In this way, we will be able to guide \npolitical decisions to generate the necessary resources. \nThat is also why I propose that the United Nations define global, \nregional and country targets for controlling the problem of drugs. We must \ncommit ourselves to reducing the supply of drugs and the demand for them by at \nleast 50 per cent by the year 2000, by 70 per cent by the year 2005, and free \nhumanity for ever from the scourge of drugs by the year 2010. \nAs of now, before the international community, Colombia assumes the \nresponsibility of complying with these objectives in its territory. We intend \nto enter the next century with sales of arms, the sale and diversion of \nprecursor chemicals and money-laundering activities under control. \nThe need to free humanity from the scourge of drugs requires a plan for \nglobal action. This is why I call on the General Assembly to hold a United \nNations conference on the problem of illicit drugs where the necessary \ncommitments and programmes would emerge to make it possible for drug \ntrafficking to be defeated completely in the next decade and a half. \nIt is beyond doubt that international criminal organizations have \nconsolidated their extensive network of ties and contacts much faster than the \njudicial system is capable of investigating and prosecuting those \nresponsible. The Italian judges Giovanna Falcone and Paolo Borsellino and the \nColombian judge Myriam Rocio Velez, along with very many others who have \nfallen in the fight against international organized crime, were facing \npowerful enemies; the existing laws and the mechanisms were not enough. \nThe individual courage of these heroes of justice is also not enough. \nThere must be no borders or barriers if those who have decided to unite in \nevil are to be prosecuted effectively everywhere on Earth. We need justice to \nbe universal, and for it to work in as coordinated a manner in all countries \nas the international criminal organizations do. The Mafia, cartels, camorra, \nand yakuza are just different names for the same thing. The time has come to \ntreat organized crime as an international crime. \nAs I said in my inaugural address, it is vital to develop an \ninternational criminal jurisdiction against drug trafficking, money laundering \nand the illegal export of precursor chemicals. Wherever the guilty live or \nserve their sentences, it must be possible for the courts in all countries to \nbe able, voluntarily, to have recourse to international courts where, in a \nsecure manner and with all the evidence available world wide, these many and \nserious crimes can be tried. Now is the time for the United Nations to tackle \nthis question in a serious, dedicated way. \nAlso, we must improve the machinery at our disposal for judicial \ncooperation between countries. That is why we would like to see a United \nNations convention for judicial cooperation on felonies that would facilitate \nthe flow of evidence, the standardization of testimony and supporting \ndocumentation, and reduce the bureaucratic procedures and legal obstacles to \ncoordinated action by the criminal legal systems of different countries. \nWe would also like to see real involvement by the European Community and \nby Japan and other countries in Asia in the Cartagena and San Antonio \nagreements and commitments. In Cartagena and San Antonio, the participating \ncountries agreed a set of strategies at all levels in the fight against drug \ntrafficking. This effort has already yielded results, but the moment has come \nto extend this cooperation to the rest of the world community. \nLastly, let me say that I believe that the experience acquired through \nall these years of the difficult fight against drug trafficking has given our \nauthorities some knowledge which, beyond a doubt, is of great value to many \nother countries which are starting to experience the consequences of the \nglobal spread of drug trafficking. This is why Colombia has decided to \nestablish an international centre for the fight against drug trafficking; this \nwill allow us to make available to the global community what we have learned \nthrough so much sacrifice. I invite the United Nations and all Member States \nto contribute to, and participate in, this initiative. \nI know that in a short time, supported by my compatriots' courage and \nresolve to fight, by the valour of the judges of Colombia, by the greatness of \nthe people of my country, we shall not have to talk about violence and drug \ntrafficking here within the walls of the United Nations. Wars do not go on \nfor ever, and I do not recall a single criminal who has resisted the pressure \nof the will of an entire people; and, if my call today has been heard, those \ncriminal organizations will be even less able to resist the united will of the \ninternational community. \nPerhaps then, soon, when we leave behind the dark night of drug \ntrafficking, the world will see the other, friendlier face of my country, and \ndiscover what we really are: we are the strongest and oldest democracy in the \nregion. We are the most dynamic economy in Latin America. Our country has \ngrown at a sustained rate of nearly 4 per cent per year for the last three \ndecades. Our management of the economy has been prudent and thoughtful, and \nhas kept us clear of the problems associated with indebtedness, \nhyperinflation, stagnation and unemployment. \nWhen someone comes to my country and meets my people, and does not \nencounter all the horrors that have sometimes been painted in the press, he \nbecomes our compatriot, and he learns that to be Colombian is a form of pride, \nof hidden tenacity and sharp wit. He also knows that you do not have to be \nborn in our country to be a Colombian for ever. "

        "file_text": "In our \ntimes, a unique advance has been made in the search for peace, understanding \nand cooperation among peoples. Mankind is progressively becoming more and \nmore aware of this new reality. \nAccordingly, the present juncture is an appropriate one for reflection \nand dialogue within the framework of the United Nations, for a review of our \nachievements as well as of our shortcomings, and for a serious, in-depth study \nof the role we assign to the Organization and the hopes we seek to fulfil, \nhopefully in the near future. \nI wish to reiterate here the conviction of President Aylwin's Government \nregarding the moral, political and social imperative of placing the needs of \npeople at the heart of United Nations activities. Reducing poverty. \nincreasing employment and promoting social cohesion are needs shared by the \nentire international community. \nFor these reasons, the importance of this forty-seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly is inarguable. \nWe welcome the new Member States that have joined the United Nations and \nthat will take part with us in its endeavours. \nWe welcome your election, Mr. President, since it will permit an \nexperienced figure in world politics to guide our deliberations and lead them \nto an outcome which is satisfactory to all. At the same time we appreciate \nthe judicious administration of your illustrious predecessor, \nAmbassador Shihabi.* \nThe world is on the threshold of the twenty-first century. We have left \nbehind us the senseless ideological confrontations between the super-Powers \nand the danger of nuclear holocaust. \nBut there is no guarantee of peace. There are still old tensions and new \nones the result of racism, religious fanaticism and extreme nationalism; there \nremains the historic challenge of development for all; and there is still a \nterrible social debt which cannot be rescheduled to the most \ndisenfranchised members of all our societies. \nOur Organization is still faced with many challenges calling for more \neffective action. The war in Bosnia and the grave reports of massive \nviolations of human rights, reaching the point of genocide, in the territories \ndevastated by the conflict in the former Yugoslavia demand concerted and \nvigorous action. \nThe auspicious but still uncertain process launched in South Africa poses \nnew challenges for our Organization. \nThe ongoing negotiations on the Middle East augur well for the future, \nbut other situations in the world still pose a threat to peace. \nSocial confrontation, the outcome of the growing gap between well-being \nand poverty, has become a source of global instability. Today more than ever, \ndevelopment with equity is the new requirement for peace, a common task we are \ncalled upon to join together and undertake. \nNow that the cold war is over, the role of the United Nations has taken \non more relevance than ever before. The Organization has a central role to \nplay in building a new international order which will make it possible to face \nthe crises that constitute serious threats to peace in many parts of the world. \nThese crises, and a whole series of economic, social and environmental \nchallenges, can be overcome only if the Organization is strengthened, commands \nmore respect and becomes more efficient in the pursuit of its lofty goals. \nOf course, it is essential that this enormous task we are calling on the \nworld Organization to perform be complemented by the preventive activities \ncarried out by regional organizations. Our own regional organization, the \nOrganization of American States, is carrying out that mission by engaging in a \nrealistic and tenacious effort to forestall or resolve the region's varied and \ndifficult problems. \nBut it is in the United Nations that we must develop the concepts, \nprinciples and agreements which will make the security of individuals a \npriority objective of international cooperation. This, in turn, will enhance \ncoexistence among States. \nWe must search together for new political directions that allow us to \nstrengthen the role of the Organization in the maintenance of peace and \nsecurity, in the defence of human rights, in the protection of the \nenvironment, in the struggle against drug trafficking and terrorism and in \nclosing the gap between North and South. \nThe starting-point must be the values that inspire our action. Chile \nproclaims before this worldwide forum its unswerving dedication to peace and \nrespect for the dignity of the individual, its conviction that justice is the \nfoundation of any truly stable society, its belief in the universal value of \nhuman rights, its respect for individual creativity and democracy as an ideal \nform of government its commitment, in short, to the needs of the most humble \nin all our societies and its recognition of the validity of law and of the \nsearch for consensus as a foundation for major national and international \nagreements. \nChile firmly believes in the Charter of the United Nations. There is no \nsubstitute for this Organization as a world parliament, as a forum for \ninternational debates and agreements, as a source of innovative technical \nanalysis and as a multilateral body responsible for peace, security and \ndevelopment. \nJust as we back the role of the United Nations without reservation, we \nlikewise set no limits on our demand that it should be efficient and \ndemocratic in the attainment of its objectives. Certainly, that depends on \nthe will of Governments, as well as on the strengthening of the competence and \nautonomy of the Secretariat. \nAbove all, a balance needs to be struck between the General Assembly as \nthe principal political organ, the Security Council as the organ responsible \nfor dealing with the traditional problems of peace and security, and the \nEconomic and Social Council as the primary body for promoting sustainable and \nequitable development. \nMutually respectful interaction among these three levels should permit \nthe United Nations to take the lead in creating an international order of \npeace in which the interests and problems of all countries are adequately \nrepresented. \nIn this new world order which is taking shape and which all members of \nthe Organization must contribute to designing, a vitally important place is \noccupied by the Secretary-General's report, entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" \n(A/47/277), which contains ideas and suggestions regarding preventive \ndiplomacy and peacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-building. \nChile agrees that the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security should be strengthened. \nWhile preventive diplomacy is playing an increasingly significant role on \nthe international scene, the concept of peace-building, in the sense of \ncreating a new climate and strengthening security through economic, social and \ncultural development, is a fundamental issue. \nOur country is collaborating with the United Nations and is prepared to \nincrease its participation in the future, should that prove necessary. \nChile's readiness in this regard has been expressed in its support for the \nSecurity Council in the decisions that have been adopted. Likewise, it has in \nrecent years placed at the service of the United Nations the knowledge and \nprofessional experience of its armed forces and forces of public order. \nChilean soldiers have traditionally been among the members of the United \nNations observer forces in the Middle East and the Asian subcontinent. Our \nmarines are initiating their activities in Cambodia, our pilots have been \nactive in Kuwait, and our police are collaborating with the peace force in El \nSalvador. \nIn this spirit of service to the cause of peace, Chile is a constant \nparticipant in the debates in multilateral forums on disarmament on a global \nscale, without prejudice to our active involvement on the regional level. \nWe support the Convention on chemical weapons and reiterate our \nlegitimate desire to become a full member of the Conference on Disarmament \nonce the issue of its enlargement becomes the subject of real discussion. \nIn the regional sphere, we see as important the initiative we have taken, \ntogether with Argentina and Brazil, that is designed to give full effect to \nthe Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the \nCaribbean through a set of amendments intended to strengthen its monitoring \nsystem and which the conference of signatories has approved by acclamation. \nIn the context of the positive spirit that has succeeded the cold-war \nperiod and is characterized by the search for agreements and a climate of \nfriendship and collaboration between the Powers, my country considers that the \ntime has come to undertake, on a carefully thought-out time scale, the total \nelimination of nuclear weapons, and to put a definitive end right now to the \ntesting of such weapons. \nI join my voice with those of the Ministers of the Nordic Group who, \nmeeting at Svalbard, welcome the efforts being made, particularly the halting \nof the French tests in the Pacific, and expressed their wish that the \nvoluntary moratorium on all nuclear explosions should become a permanent one, \nremoving from the world once and for all these practices which threaten our \nsecurity, coexistence and environment. \nIn the years to come, we shall have to take up the issue of the \ncomposition of the Security Council. We believe that this important body \nshould reflect new international realities, and we are accordingly ready to \nconsider with interest and sympathy new formulas that would appropriately \nreflect the aspirations of new world Powers which are seeking to become \nregular members of the Council. \nIt is also essential to strengthen the presence in that body of the \nvarious developing regions. Inevitably, this will entail greater \nparticipation numerically, as well as new forms of regional representation. \nWith improvements over time, this practice could become a mechanism for \nrepresentation of the regional groups which would combine freedom of action \nfor the country elected with the expression of the will of the countries of \nits region. This system, if effectively operated, could ensure that all \nMembers of the Organization feel that they are participating to the proper \nextent in the decisions of the Security Council. \nChile is also interested in strengthening the Economic and Social \nCouncil. According to the Charter of the United Nations, this is the \nprincipal specialized body of the system for analysing in an integrated way \nthe political, technical and operational dimensions of current economic and \nsocial problems. The Council should be strengthened and renewed in order to \nbecome a true council for development, capable of guiding high-level dialogue, \nformulating development policies and providing proper guidance for the \noperational activities of the system. \nWe shall be participating actively in discussions under way on these \nissues on the basis of the interesting proposals submitted by the Nordic \ncountries and the Group of 77, and of the resolutions of the most recent \nsession of the Council. \nA factor that will contribute to the reform of the\\\" Economic and Social \nCouncil will be the establishment, under it, of the commission for sustainable \ndevelopment, which is called upon to become the body for monitoring \nenvironment. problems. The link between the commission on sustainable \ndevelopment and the world environment fund is also the key to the success of \nAgenda 21, the ambitious programme of action approved by the United Nations \nConference on Environment and Development. \nThe practical results of the Conference, which were characterized by the \ngreat effort made to reach agreement, are being carefully watched by the \npublic at large, which is participating in ever-greater numbers in this \nprocess. \nThe signing of the Conventions on biological diversity and climate \nchange, the convening of the world conferences on desertification a subject \nof great interest to many countries, but of vital importance to the African \nnations and the conference on fishing on the high seas are milestones in the \ninternational effort to preserve the environment. \nWe cannot enter a new era of world peace although it is potentially \nwithin our grasp if we forget the human being. In the final analysis, our \ncapacity to lead and the raison d'\u221a\u2122tre of the United Nations will be measured \nby the success we achieve in the field of social development. \nWithout greater well-being for all our citizens, there will be no peace, \nsecurity or lasting stability at either the national or the international \nlevel. That is why we put forward the initiative for a world summit for \nsocial development. This proposal was recently endorsed unanimously in the \nEconomic and Social Council, which approved a positive recommendation to the \nGeneral Assembly that it convene the summit at the beginning of 1995 at the \nlevel of Heads of State and Heads of Government. \nI should like to take this occasion to thank all the Member States which \nparticipated in that consensus, and in particular the 121 countries that \nsponsored the relevant resolution. I should also like to thank the \nSecretary-General for having assigned to our representative to the United \nNations, Ambassador Juan Somavia, the task of bringing to a successful \nconclusion the consultations required to put this initiative into effect. \nThe first step has now been taken. Much remains to be done. There is no \ndoubt that the primary responsibility for resolving this situation is borne at \nthe domestic level. Each country must take steps to stabilize the functioning \nof its political system, encourage investment, trade and technological \ndevelopment and ensure equitable distribution of income. \nChile has accepted that challenge. It is growing today at an annual rate \nof 7 per cent and has reduced unemployment to about 5 per cent and inflation \nto 13 per cent a year. In addition, under President Aylwin's Government, the \nprocess of solving the problem of external debt has been concluded, the real \nincome of salaried workers has increased by 15 per cent and policies designed \nto alleviate the poverty of the most disenfranchised sectors of the population \nhave been implemented. This has been done on the basis of an open economy \nwhich has concentrated on both economic and social efficiency against a \nbackground of personal freedom and political democracy. \nAlthough the success of these programmes has been recognized by the \nvarious sectors in our national life, we are aware that much more still needs \nto be done with our resources. But we are equally aware that the benefits for \nour country would be significantly greater if the ground rules of the \ninternational economy were more equitable. \nEven while most of the world is calling, with growing clarity and force, \nfor the abolition of protectionism and the formulation of stable and \nnon-discriminatory rules to govern international trade, unilateral measures \nare reversing this world-wide trend and giving rise to direct forms of \nprotectionism in the main world markets, in a departure from the principles \nand regulatory framework established under the General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade. \nI now wish to say a few words on the Secretariat. \nFirst, we welcome the election of the distinguished scholar, diplomat and \npolitician Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali as Secretary-General. The Members of the \nUnited Nations are witnesses to Chile's consistent support for the African \ncontinent's aspiration to see one of its own in that high post. We have \nalready expressed our opinion publicly at the bilateral level, within the \nNon-Aligned Movement and in the General Assembly last year. We already have \nevidence of the Secretary-General's character and decision-making ability. We \nsupport him in his task. \nThe Secretariat is of course a vital organ under the Charter and in the \nUnited Nations system. In order to meet the challenges that lie ahead, it \nmust act with the maximum efficiency and autonomy. \nThe Secretariat is at the service of all countries, and accordingly all \nof them must be properly represented at its various levels. The efficiency of \nthe Organization depends to a large extent on the confidence Governments have \nin the technical ability, experience and impartiality of its staff. \nAt a time when we are asking the Organization to perform all the tasks \nthat arise in this era, its constant financial insecurity is absurd. It is \nessential to enhance the fluidity and automaticity of countries' payment of \ntheir assessments. This is doubtless a responsibility that is shared by all, \nbut to the greatest extent by the main contributors. We cannot have a strong \nOrganization with a weak financial base. \nThe specialized agencies and regional commissions are called upon to \ncontinue playing a vital role in such fields as cooperation for development, \nprotection of the environment and economic and social analysis. The \ncontributions they have made, to the benefit above all of the developing \nworld, must be assessed at their true value.* \nThe support of the United Nations for the second Space Conference of the \nAmericas, to be held shortly in Santiago, is another example that regional and \nglobal efforts are complementary. \nChile has long had the privilege of being the site of important regional \noffices of the world Organization. Their presence in our country is proof of \nChile's commitment to the activities of the United Nations, which we shall \nalways be prepared to support. \nThe subject of the United Nations, which is certainly what has brought us \ntogether, is an exciting one for the international community. Indeed, \nfulfilment of the purposes and principles of its Charter has been a constant \nconcern of our country. Likewise, failure to respect them arouses a sense of \nfrustration. \nThe duties and rights of each Member State vis-a-vis the Organization can \nin no way be reduced to a matter of legalities or to simple mechanical \naction. We recognize a real commitment to the United Nations system, and \nconsequently we discharge each of our duties responsibly. \nThe nations assembled here and indeed the world have before them the best \npossible opportunity of firmly guaranteeing the future of coming generations, \na substantial improvement in the quality of life, the elimination of the \ndevelopment gap and the attainment of peace in short, the opportunity of \nbuilding a better world for all and with all. Let us all take up that \nchallenge. "

        "file_text": "We \nshould first like to congratulate Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency \nof the General Assembly at this session. \nBarely a year ago, the representatives of the United Nations, meeting in \nthis same Hall, ventured to believe that a new era of peace, cooperation and \nunderstanding was being established. We glimpsed on the horizon a new order \nin which each would be recognized, in which all nations, large and small, \nwould have equal responsibilities and obligations in mutual respect. \nWe believed that. We really believed that, because the mood was one of \noptimism. After all, the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait had marked \nthe triumph of legitimacy. Then, bloc confrontation being over, it was time \nfor dialogue, since ideological antagonism had been overcome. \nToday, the world is again experiencing upheavals and disruption. We are \nseeing States imploding. Peoples are plagued by hunger, destitution and \npoverty. We are powerless witnesses to this grim spectacle, whereas we should \nbe the artisans of change. \nWho can deny the seriousness of all this? Noble ideas, lofty sentiments \nand good intentions are not enough for the well-being of humankind. Perhaps I \nshould add: \\\"are no longer enough\\\". \nThis is an obvious fact and should provide a basic tenet for our work. \nWe must all show our interest in it, so that our destiny might express our \ndetermination. The world is changing, and in order to control these changes, \nwe are building the new order. This is a voluntary endeavour, based on the \nrespect of nations, on partnership, on interdependence. But who would deny \n\nthat the new world order has something of a colossus with feet of clay? On \nwhat kind of world will this system be modelled? \nMore than 4 billion human beings live in poor countries. Whereas the \nrich nations, with about 15 per cent of the world's population, control more \nthan 80 per cent of the world's income, about 60 per cent of humankind live in \nlow-income countries, and more than 3 billion people possess only 5 per cent \nof the total income. With a population of more than 450 million, sub-Saharan \nAfrica has less than 1 per cent of the world's income. \nCan we accept the exclusion of these millions of human beings? It is as \nif history had speeded up, had shaken up our ways of thinking, leaving our \nminds all confused. It is as if fragility had become the watchword of human \nadventure. \nNo! At a time when we are all committed to building this new world \norder, stronger solidarity is needed more than ever, because poverty is not \ninevitable, nor is it a genetic defect. \nThe challenge is daunting. Short-term, stopgap solutions are not \nenough. We simply must radically change the attitude and behaviour of the \nindustrialized world to the chronic plight of many countries in the South. In \norder to do this, there can be no double standards, tacit tolerance for some \nand vague promises for others. Have we the right today to denounce the \ncorruption, abuse and lapses that are widespread in many developing countries, \nconsidering that these same practices were not so long ago tolerated and even \nencouraged by some? Can we welcome the changes that have occurred and I am \nreferring to the democratization of institutions even though in many cases \nthey are accompanied by chaos and suffering? \nNevertheless, we must not underestimate the contribution that the \ninternational community is entitled to expect from each country, considered as \n\nit is to be an artisan of its own development. Each must, in particular, \nestablish institutions and procedures compatible with the rights and \nobligations that all must now shoulder, regardless of level of development. \nBut what are we to think, what are we to say about the increasing \ntensions between the industrialized North, certain that it is in the right, \nand the South, which gets poorer all the time, plagued by contradiction and \nseeking, sometimes clumsily, fresh sources of relief? \nHow sincere is the wealth of advice given in the options suggested, the \nguidelines prescribed? Are we not in a diktat situation when we hear the \nfollowing: \\\"Adopt reforms, democratize your institutions, go ahead and \nliberalize your economies. Then, and only then, will we help you.\\\" \nWhat developing country seeking an evolutive process has not been on the \nreceiving end of this kind of message? How few, without adapting, have \nmanaged to adopt new, realistic and productive policies? \nThere is no single model exportable to all. There is no absolute model \nthat works for everyone. It is in the name of principles and experiments, all \ntoo often garbled within the framework of open-economy programmes and \ndemocratization, that crushing failures have occurred. Has the debt burden \nbeen eased? Have commodity export earnings in the third world increased? \nClearly, one figure speaks for all the others: that of the aid given by \nrich countries to the poorer ones. Logically, it shows the importance \nattached by the donors to the development projects they are supposed to \nsupport. But the figures are rarely commensurate with their lofty ambitions; \nthat we must admit. \n \nCan it be expected by any chance of the smaller countries in \nparticular that they should use other means to generate the resources \nnecessary for their own development? This would be to ignore the economic \nfact of interaction and interdependence, which are difficult to manage and \ncannot really be the sole responsibility of these small countries. \nIn seeking financial assistance, expertise and transfers of technology, \nwe are trying first to encourage international solidarity, without excluding \nanyone and within as broad a context as possible. Was not that the great \nlesson of Rio, despite the flaws and imperfections of political dialogue, in \nthat it reminded those who had been tempted to forget that everything is global \nnowadays for better or for worse, as in marriage where reason prevails \nover emotion? \nHowever, despite the urgent need for proper solutions, four months after \nthe Rio Conference we are once again deploring the inertia of political \ndialogue, the complaisance of declarations of intent and the lack of \nperseverance in following up decisions. \nThe right to make a mistake is not enshrined in any constitution, and yet \nare not famine, war and environmental disasters to name just three of the \nworst scourges monumental mistakes? Silence denotes guilt. We must not \nquibble or condemn here. We must agree on what we can do - together.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to express to you, Mr. President, and to the \nfree people of Bulgaria my sincere congratulations on behalf of Lithuania on \nyour election to such an eminent post. It is fitting that you, an active \nparticipant in the creation of a new Europe, should preside over the \ndeliberations of this Assembly as it seeks to establish the foundations for a \nrevitalized United Nations. The task that confronts us is a result of the \nmany significant changes in the world. \nExactly four years ago in Lithuania, in the Cathedral Square of Vilnius, \npeople were beaten because they sought freedom. They had gathered to \ncommemorate the day in 1939 when, the Second World War having already begun, \nHitler sold to Stalin the as yet unconquered land of Lithuania with all its \npeople and all their rights. Almost half a century later, in 1988, no more \nrights had been secured. So on that day, 28 September 1988, in Cathedral \nSquare, some staged hunger strikes for the release of political prisoners and \nothers sang songs and demanded freedom for their homeland, while still others \nattacked with shields and rubber truncheons, beating those that sang. \n \nSuch was the struggle for rights and ideas a struggle that needed to be \nunderstood and appreciated. And in the international commentary and portrayal \nof this struggle, there also ensued a battle of ideas for right and truth. \nSuch was the non-violent struggle for liberation waged by Lithuania in the \nname of independence and universally acknowledged Christian principles \nunifying the ideas of truth and freedom. \nA year has passed since that day in September when the Lithuanian flag \nwas raised at United Nations Headquarters. In that year we watched as the \nSoviet Union - that great totalitarian empire stretching from the Baltic to \nthe Sea of Japan flickered and disappeared, and how that country was \nreplaced in its seat here at the United Nations by a new democratic Russia \nassuming its predecessor's rights and obligations. \nWe also watched as parallel movements for national independence brought \ndown a small communist empire in the south of Central Europe on the Adriatic \ncoast. And we watched as both of these processes were accompanied by the \nrather ambivalent sentiments and positions of the Western States that is, of \ntheir leaders. The world order is moving in a positive direction we will \nsee less evil yet these changes seem to bring about a nostalgia for the old \norder to which so many had grown accustomed. \nLithuania's position was not one of ambivalence. We supported \npolitically Armenia, Georgia and Moldova and the Muslim nations of the former \nSoviet Union, proposing peaceful solutions to their problems. We were the \nfirst to recognize the independence of Slovenia and Croatia in 1991, and this \nyear we recognized the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia. \nAlthough this may not have been much, these policies nevertheless reflected a \nposition arising from our own experience and the principles we cherish. \n\nAnd what is that experience? \nThe campaign against us was waged by magical means that perhaps can be \nbest described as communist voodoo politics, in which nothing is called by its \nproper name. So we learned how to identify these phantoms and shadows and we \nfound that such ghosts, when called by their proper names, soon begin to fade. \nThe evil empire continues to fade away, but it has not vanished \naltogether. Sometimes quite the opposite appears to be true its spirit is \nso lively that it just may rise again among us and above us. For this reason, \nwhen we call for the condemnation and trial of Soviet communism, when we see \nand expose attempts to restore the USSR, we are in effect supporting \ndemocratic Russia and international peace. Democratic Russia, which condemned \nthe 1940 Soviet annexation of Lithuania and recognized our independence, \nre-established in 1990, should not refer to the Baltic countries as \\\"newly \nemerged\\\" States. Those officials who continue to promulgate this misnomer do \na disservice to the truth and to their country, which is struggling to renew \nitself, to rise above the lies of the past. This applies also to some other \nlabels and intentions. \nWe do not think, for example, that the Serbian army, operating in \nneighbouring countries, could be called a \\\"peace-keeping force\\\", even if the \ntroops painted their helmets blue. We do not think that such forces, \nauthorized to act both on their own and on neighbouring territory, should \nunilaterally establish their outposts wherever they please, without the \nneighbouring country's consent. \nWe think that States and their armies should be called by their proper \nnames. \\\"Serbia\\\" and \\\"Montenegro\\\" are fine names, appropriate enough for a \nfederation title, so let old ghosts fade away. Defending one State's actions \nagainst another under the guise of ethnic protection is dangerous. \n \nspecifically if the goal is to politicize what is clearly a legal matter. It \nis even more dangerous to hide in this way the true nature of military \nactions. When an assault is called by a more neutral term, such as \n\\\"conflict\\\", this third-party position benefits the aggressor and that position \nbecomes neither objective nor neutral. \n \nLithuania has experienced this and I think that Lithuania's experience of \ndefending itself with the truth, and by avoiding political entrapments, can be \na useful example to others, including the Organization. \nLithuania, Latvia and Estonia have a big neighbour where a variety of \npolitical forces are vying for power in sectors of society and government. \nSome elements are democratic, some less so, and others not at all. Those \nmedia circles in neighbouring Russia that inherited the characteristic \nmind-set of the old empire are at present promoting aggressive anti-Baltic \nsentiments, a substitute \\\"cold-war\\\" policy which surfaces in the statements of \nits officials time and time again. \nAllow me to share some concepts and statements, emanating from the \nconservative elements of the Russian Parliament and the Foreign Ministry, \nwhich alarm Russia's smaller neighbours. Foreign countries are there divided \ninto two categories: the inner sphere and the outer sphere. \nSimilarly, Lithuanian composer Bronius Kutavicius's musical score for \nfour of the instruments used have the designations of near violin, distant \nviolin, near piano and distant piano. The stage violin is the one that the \nlistener can reach from the front row and thus may feel the inclination to \ngrab as his \\\"vital interest\\\". Universal musical harmony is of less concern to \nhim. The 30 June 1992 document of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the \nRussian Parliament recommends this position. The concept is not new; it has \nbeen around since the time of Ivan the Terrible. It was used by other States \nless successfully. \nThe \\\"inner sphere\\\" is designated as an extraordinary or special-interest \nzone. This concept having been defined - and, if necessary a \nMolotov-Ribbentrop-type pact may be signed military force may be used and \nthe former inner sphere is no longer a foreign land. Then the outer sphere \n\nbecomes the inner sphere and subsequently a special-interest zone. \nTerritorial expansion continues, and will continue, if resources permit, until \nno foreign countries at all remain. \nFor those who believe this process of territorial expansionism to be \nnatural the opposite process is quite painful. For this reason attempts are \nmade to block it, to stop the withdrawal of troops from the neighbour's \nterritory; for this reason one must find someone to protect with this army as \na pretext not to remove troops. Those politicians like President Yeltsin who \nthink democratically and have a broader perspective, who want to withdraw the \narmy and to normalize relations, are called traitors who do not defend the \nState's imperial interests. \\\"Your interests are our interests\\\", and \\\"Your \nrights are our rights\\\", is said to fellow nationals abroad, especially to \nthose who think that their prime interest and right is the restoration of the \norder and traditions of the former empire. \nI take a different view. For example, in my opinion the best interest \nand natural right of the Russian community in Estonia is to learn a little of \nthe Estonian language and after a few months to acquire Estonian citizenship, \naccording to the law about which there is so much outcry at present. We hear \nno protest from Lithuanians living in Estonia, and Lithuania does not plan any \nsanctions against that country. We will not suspend any of our treaties with \nEstonia and we will not ask the United Nations to impose any sanctions against \nit. I have not heard that similar actions have been demanded by Israel or \nUkraine, although the Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation in his \nstatement to the Assembly at this session was also concerned about other \nnationalities residing in Estonia. \n \nWe disagree with the opinion expressed in the Russian periodical \nDiplomatic Bulletin that a referendum or other type of vote in one State may \nbe regarded as an act of force against another State, with a presumed right of \nthat State to resort to \n\\\"reactive measures, and not necessarily ones of an equivalent character\\\". \nSuch diplomacy is based on the hope that: \n\\\"Russia will not be condemned, at least by those nations which at that \nmoment will be directing their planes towards a Libya or an Iraq\\\". \nThese are words uttered in August 1992, but they sound as if they were uttered \nin January 1991. \nWhen we hear from this very rostrum that it is necessary to use force to \nprotect human rights we immediately begin asking ourselves who is this \npoliceman-defender who comes, let us say, from Russia to Moldova or from \nSerbia to Bosnia. In Dubrovnik and in Sarajevo he defends his minority rights \nin very strange ways. It reminds me of an old and macabre dissident joke from \nthe days of Stalin. The first man asks \\\"Will there be a third world war?\\\" \nThe second answers \\\"No, there will not, but there will be such a battle for \npeace that not one stone will be left on another.\\\" \nFor this reason we would not want to see Russian peace-keeping forces \ntransforming themselves into forces that would impose a Russian peace, a \\\"Pax \nRuthenia\\\", in the inner sphere of foreign countries. We wish that somebody \nwould remember the human rights of the hundreds of thousands of people \ndeported from the Baltic countries, including the right to compensation, and \nthat someone, possibly the United Nations, would help to raise from the bottom \nof the Baltic Sea the poisons of the Second World War that were dropped off \nour shores by the Soviet army. The right of anyone to live on the shores of \nthe Baltic Sea is now in danger. \n\nWe would like to see the world community help all nations rising from the \nRed plague and to see the family of nations assist Russia economically and \nalso in its search for democracy and justice. It should be a matter of \nuniversal concern that the dead hand of communism should not drag down into \nits marble mausoleum the entire nation and possibly all mankind. We should \nresist this danger by upholding other values, not those from the realm of \nghosts of the past. \nLithuania and the other Baltic States again present a challenge to \nRussia, and the world will see how it responds. Maybe the economic pressure \nand measures of an undeclared blockade directed against us are not direct \npunishment for destruction of the empire or help to our leftist opposition in \nLithuania. Maybe these are just the difficulties of Russia itself, although \nprobably not exclusively of an economic nature. We also have these \ndifficulties and thus we know them well. \nRecently signed bilateral agreements on the withdrawal of the Russian \narmed forces from Lithuania give us hope. These agreements were welcomed by \nthe democratic world and a multitude of people of good will. I do not doubt \nthat the United Nations will urge that such agreements should also be signed \nbetween Latvia and Russia as well as between Russia and Estonia. Moreover, \nthe process of withdrawal of the armed forces should be carefully monitored in \norder that the four States may as soon as possible achieve normalization of \ntheir relations under conditions of security, prosperity and friendship \nbetween all the nations of the region. \n\nI thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to express that hope. \nIn conclusion, I should like to say a few words about United Nations \nstructural reforms. These reforms are also tied to our experience. \nWhen a large State pressures and accuses a small neighbour, the latter \nshould find support here, at the United Nations, which is duty-bound to defend \nsmall States. Changes in representation could be made, such as establishing a \nGroup of Small European States at the United Nations with its specific vision \nof global problems and shared concern for preserving national identity. \nPerhaps that \\\"Little Europe\\\" could initiate a solidarity movement in behalf of \nsmall States around the globe. \nThe Security Council could be expanded to include three new permanent \nmembers - Japan, Germany and India and the exercise of the right to veto \nfrom that day forward could require not one but at least two permanent \nmembers' invoking that right at the same time. \nI respectfully request that these ideas be included in the ongoing debate \nof ideas being considered at the United Nations. \n"

The CSCE was \nconstructed and developed on the basic principles enshrined in the United \nNations Charter and which constitute a vital precondition for the security, \npeace, welfare and progress of all. All CSCE participating States were \ntherefore expected to agree voluntarily to those principles in their own \ninterest. However, the CSCE was left without suitable means to respond to \nsituations in which a State violated and did not respect those principles and \nnorms. \nThe war in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and all the horrors \nwhich, thanks to the media, are known to the whole world, as well as the \nBalkan crisis, in which we were also involved, are an important experience for \nthe CSCE, for the United Nations and for the world at large. \nIt teaches us that it is relatively simple to plead for peace. It is \nmuch more difficult to guarantee security and to create the stable conditions \nthat would allow urgent and peaceful changes in accordance with the principles \nupholding peace, security and prosperity. This is the most important function \nof the United Nations and of all regional organizations and is the basis of \nour support for the proposal that the United Nations should rapidly create \nmechanisms for adjusting to emerging changes in the world. \nIn his report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", the Secretary-General has made an \nexceptionally cogent contribution to efforts to ensure the gradual \nestablishment of security machinery that will enable the peaceful settlement \nof all disputes, primarily through an insight into the circumstances and the \n \ntimely mobilization of international institutions, to prevent or quickly cut \nshort armed conflicts between States Members of the United Nations and between \nsovereign States. It is in the interest of the international community that a \nwar, if it occurs, does not spread to new regions and countries. The report \ncontains many useful ideas about the building of peace after the conflict has \nbeen brought to an end and about when it becomes possible and necessary to \ncreate conditions for long-term security and stability in relations between \nthe participants in the conflict. \nThe United Nations may establish machinery which will enable it to \nintervene speedily to help the democratization of international and internal \nrelations and implementation of self-determination and thus prevent lapsing \ninto the kind of violence that is now tragically escalating in the Balkans. \nThe United Nations has in the past been a forum for achieving the \nself-determination of many peoples. As such it was supported by Slovenia \nwhich, through its active role in the Allied anti-fascist coalition as part of \nformer Yugoslavia, was among the Founding Members of the Organization. It is \ntherefore understandable that we expect the United Nations to continue in this \nrole the future. \nThe world Organization has ever more Members. This is not the result or \nexpression of some incomprehensible process of fragmentation: it is an \nexpression of democratization of relations within those non-traditional States \nwhich were built not on the principle of national equality and the real common \ninterest of their nations but on ideologies, on fear of bloc threats. In \nthese multi-national States the levers of integration were not economic \nsuccess and respect for the welfare and dignity of man, but rather \n \nmonopolistic ideologies and a unitary party and army. In these States the \ninterests and dignity of people and nations were mainly subordinated to the \ninterests of the State and party or its apparatus. \nStates such as Yugoslavia which, from a historical point of view, were \nartificial creations should have constantly re-examined and demonstrated their \nraison d'\u221a\u2122tre in the light of changing historical circumstances. Their \ndisintegration is not a priori in contradiction with the logic and needs of \nintegration. It is part of the same process. Individual nations enter the \nprocess of integration at different points. With the formation of their own \nStates, they create the conditions necessary in order to enter the process of \ntheir own free will. \nWe cannot exclude the possibility that new links and cooperation among \nStates will emerge. It is essential that such links must first conform to the \nprinciples of international law, democracy, and respect for universally \nrecognized standards for the protection of human rights and the rights of \nminorities and nations. \nThe trend of the pre-modern world was towards the concentration of power \nthrough the conquest of territory and war. The trend of the modern world is \nincreasingly economic through cooperation and association, through improvement \nof the quality of life and respect for natural limitations trends which \nwere at least partly defined at the recent world ecological summit. Slovenia \nis situated in an area where the pre-modern and modern worlds meet in both \nperception and in practice. It is in the interest of the United Nations and \nof all nations of the modern world, so that the modern world will border only \non the modern world. \n \nAllow me to suggest that after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the \ndemocratization of Eastern Europe, the democratic world did not respond with \nas much commitment as it did, justifiably, in the introduction of the values \nof democracy and the market economy. The world was insufficiently prepared \nfor this epochal event. It is only now seeking and implementing models and \nmechanisms for overcoming and preventing the deterioration of relations \nbetween some of the new States. The London Conference, which tried to pave \nthe way towards a political solution of the Balkan crisis, was a successful \nexpression of this common search. \nThe denial to the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Serbia and \nMontenegro - of participation in the General Assembly of the United Nations, a \nmove that was supported by Slovenia, is convincing proof that the United \nNations is capable of showing the necessary decisiveness in order to condemn \nthe States that flagrantly violate the United Nations Charter and, above all, \npeace, security and human rights. \nAfter the final defeat and withdrawal of the Yugoslav army from Slovenia \na year ago, armed conflicts flared up ever further from Slovenia. In the \nprocess of seeking a solution, Slovenia has worked as a constructive and \nobjective participant in the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia, unselfishly \npresided over by Lord Carrington, and now the London Conference, to which it \nis currently committed. Our most immediate and most direct interest is in the \nsolution of humanitarian problems and, in particular, the situation of the \nmore than 70,000 refugees in our country. Our other basic interest relates to \nthe settlement of all issues of State succession of the former Socialist \nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia. It goes without saying that our ultimate \nobjective is the establishment of a durable peace in the Balkans. \n \nSlovenia is not in dispute with any of the nations of the former \nYugoslavia. In accordance with the decisions of the London Conference, we \nsupport measures against the policies of Serbia and Montenegro and we oppose \ntheir attempt to usurp the succession of the Socialist Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia. It is not hard to see that it was the recent policies of these \ntwo republics, which today go by the name of the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia, that caused the disintegration of Yugoslavia, by enforced \ndomination over the others, by a reinforcement of a centralist and \nundemocratic political system, and by force and seizure; later by war, \nterritorial conquest, \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", concentration camps and other crimes \nwhich must be the subject of judicial investigation and trial; and finally by \ncontempt for all the civilized values that form the basis of the Charter of \nthe United Nations and key documents of the Conference on Security and \nCooperation in Europe (CSCE). \nThe Helsinki Final Act is undoubtedly one of those invaluable codes of \nbehaviour a guide to the development of human rights, respect for borders \nand their openness and the protection of minorities which, through general \nrespect, regulate the process of the democratization of relations between \nnations and States in a peaceful framework. \nThe authorities of the former Yugoslavia did not really accept the \nHelsinki principles. They did not believe that signing the document bound \nthem to respect them. The tragedy in the Balkans would not have occurred had \nthe Helsinki principles been respected and implemented in the former \nYugoslavia. It could have been avoided. Even once it had started, it could \nhave been resolved peacefully precisely by respecting the Helsinki \nprinciples with the understanding that this might affect the political map \nof Europe. Such understanding would have prevented the damage, as well as the \n \nsimplifications and justifications that frequently attribute the crisis in the \nBalkans, and similar situations elsewhere, to irrational nationalist passion, \nnationalist animosities, tribalism and the like. \nSlovenia chose independence with its implementation of the right to \nself-determination. Slovenia proposed the peaceful dissolution of Yugoslavia \nin the manner advocated by Russia at the time of the dissolution of the Soviet \nUnion, when Russia supported the independence of all the republics of the \nformer Soviet Union. \nSlovenia does not oppose modern movements towards integration. It \nsupports them provided they are based, like the European Community, on respect \nfor the interests of all those involved, and on equal cooperation and \nagreement. Slovenia wishes to join the European Community and is prepared \nvoluntarily to surrender such parts of its sovereignty as all members of the \nEuropean Community must surrender. Slovenia does not wish this only because \nof its need for economic integration, but also because of its historical \naffiliation with that culture, which was interrupted by catastrophic \nideological, political and economic divisions after the Second World War. \nEnsuring durable international peace and security requires the fulfilment \nof certain conditions, among which respect for human rights is of critical \nsignificance. Those States that do not respect human dignity and human rights \nat home will not respect the dignity and sovereignty of other nations and \nother States. It is evident that threats to international peace very often \nstart with violations of human rights within the boundaries of countries which \nlater disturb the peace. \nThe Republic of Slovenia attaches great importance to concern for the \nimplementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms. As a new, sovereign \nState, it is strongly committed to the view that in our times State \n \nsovereignty is primarily defined by criteria of the legitimacy of State \nauthority and respect for human rights. This is due above all to the \npractical importance of human rights as a guarantee of social stability and \npeace and thus as an important constituent of international peace and security. \nAt a time when the setting of international standards in the field of \nhuman rights is being completed, concern for the effectiveness of their \nimplementation and of international supervision is of high priority. \nExperience has shown that assuring respect for human rights, including \nespecially the rights of persons belonging to national, ethnic, religious and \nlinguistic minorities, is of critical importance for extinguishing crises and \nestablishing peace. Efforts at post-conflict peace-building will be \nprecarious and incomplete if that condition for stabilization is not fulfilled \nand supervised. The Secretary-General also fully stresses this in his \nimportant report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277). \nThere is one further question which highlights the need to review the \nsuitability of institutional arrangements. This is the problem of refugees, \nas demonstrated in the war against Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is clear that \nan arrangement meeting the need to protect the personal status and integrity \nof an individual forced to abandon his country through fear of political and \nphysical violence is inadequate for a mass exodus of entire nations fleeing \nthreatened genocide as a result of a war of conquest and the \\\"ethnic \ncleansing\\\" of territory conquered by an aggressor. \nA million Muslim refugees from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina are \nwithout adequate protection and without an internationally guaranteed status. \nThey are ever more widely scattered throughout Europe. There are close to \n100,000 in my own country, which is, with great difficulty, providing them \nwith food and shelter. The Bosnian Muslims are becoming a nation without a \n \nland, without a State, with all the attendant tragic consequences, including \nrepercussions for the protection of Europe against terrorism. It is of such \nhopelessness that terrorism is born. It is tragic that in this war against a \nState Member of the United Nations, composed of three nations, Croats, Muslims \nand Serbs, the Muslims should remain almost unprotected. That is why they \nseek refuge throughout Europe. \nAt a number of international conferences we have proposed that United \nNations peace-keeping forces create a safe haven in Bosnia and Herzegovina \nitself, where the relative safety of refugees would be assured, since, after \nthe war, when decisions are made on the fate of that State, the Muslims must \nbe present and active, physically and politically. The division of the State \nwould otherwise become a reality. It would also be a reality that aggression \nhad been rewarded by the allocation of conquered territory and that the world \nhad recognized the policy of fait accompli and shut its eyes to violations of \nthe principles of humanitarian rights, and to the perpetration of genocide. \nOf equal importance is an effective mechanism for prompt action in the \nresolution of humanitarian problems created by armed conflict. It is \nparticularly important that the humanitarian assistance - in which the High \nCommissioner for Refugees, Mrs. Sadako Ogata, the United Nations Children's \nFund (UNICEF) and its Executive Director, Mr. James Grant, and \nUnder-Secretary-General Jan Eliasson have invested so much effort - be \nprovided in a timely manner. The importance of humanitarian measures, even if \nthey require overcoming resistance and military protection, has been \ndemonstrated recently in some of the armed conflicts of the past year, \nincluding the conflicts in the Gulf and in the Balkans. Inability to \nguarantee humanitarian assistance is inexcusable and compromises the \ninternational community and, unfortunately, the United Nations. \n \nIn a period of eased international relations and a search for new \norientations for development, there is an important way in which the potential \nrole of the United Nations has been extended: in preventive diplomacy and the \ncreation of measures which are a real contribution to defusing conflicts, \ndealing with their underlying causes and overcoming their consequences. \nPreventive diplomacy is a task for the future; it will require supplementing \nand reinforcing the work of the United Nations. It presupposes a knowledge of \nhistory and respect for the principles of the equality and self-determination \nof all peoples, and for other principles contained in the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. In their own interests and in the common interest, the \nMembers of the United Nations will have to fulfill those principles. Only \n\nthus will the authority of the United Nations be enhanced and protected, and \nthe hope which people, including the people of Slovenia, have invested in it \nbe justified. \nThe United Nations has alleviated, as far as it could, the negative \neffects of bloc rivalries and the bipolar division of the world. Now, the \nworld needs a United Nations which is capable of guiding, harmonizing and \nassisting change. This can be achieved only if the Organization can \nrevitalize, restructure and democratize its own system. We are firmly \nconvinced that the United Nations, as a universal forum of multilateralism, \nwill successfully take this unique opportunity to lay the foundations for a \nnew and more just world, in building which the entire international community \nshares a common interest. \n \nI have devoted a great deal of attention to the crisis in the Balkans. I \nshould like, however, to stress that the Republic of Slovenia is also well \naware of other problems that beset the world, and that it has a constructive \napproach to the important aspects of an international world order that will \nnot be burdened by war, poverty, illiteracy, intolerance, and injustice; of an \norder in which the Declaration of the World Summit on Children and the \nachievements of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro will be implemented in \nfull; and of an order in which human rights will everywhere be the standard of \nbehaviour respected by States. Constructive and successful dialogue among \ndeveloped and developing countries - as well as peace, international security, \nand disarmament - are among our priority tasks. I wish the the United Nations \nevery success - success the world badly needs. \n"

        "file_text": " Permit me to \ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election, which symbolizes the spirit \nof renewal of the present period in international relations. Many of our \ncountries aspire to emulate your country's efforts to overcome obstacles and \nspread political and economic freedom and become a productive part of the world \nsystem. \nThe Government of Peru shares those same objectives, and is seeking to \nrestore the legitimacy and trustworthiness that have been lacking in the \npast. To that end, we are seeking to modernize, to consolidate democracy and \neconomic competitiveness and, above all, to base our actions on the interests \nof the majority. In a word, we are attempting to engage in a true process of \nredefinition and national reconstruction. \nThe majority of the Members of the United Nations face similar problems, \nbut nothing can be done if the Organization cannot begin to function as a \ngenuinely multilateral association of sovereign nations with equal rights and \nduties as provided for in the Charter. To that end we must reform the United \nNations and make it more effective, with the same perseverance and \ndetermination our Governments have shown in their national reconstruction \nefforts. \nDemocratization through decision-making by consensus; administrative \nreform; a balance among the various bodies of the Organization; and improved \ncooperation for development: these are among the crucial factors for the \nfuture of the United Nations and for its prestige and authority. The \ndeveloping countries have the ongoing task of ensuring respect for the \nprinciples of the Charter. On the basis of those same principles, the major \nPowers must redefine their real national priorities. It would then be \n\npossible to decide on a mandate agreeable to both sides that would orient the \nrebirth of the United Nations and prevent erratic extremism. \nThe collapse of communism did not mean the automatic disappearance of the \nworld's problems, but it has given the world community its first opportunity \nin 50 years to reorient international relations towards peace and well-being. \nWe face an unprecedented, formidable effort that can now begin in propitious \ncircumstances. The bases of this common effort are: development; the \nsolution of disputes by diplomatic means; respect for law; and the application \nof fundamental economic and political freedoms. The United Nations system is \nthe only mechanism creative enough to put this into effect. Only though \nmultilateral cooperation will it be possible to conflate collective action and \nrespect for national sovereignty without manoeuvring to preserve or increase \ninternational influence which would be even worse in a world free of \nideological motivations or the imperatives of the cold war. \nFor our countries as a group, it is vitally important to resume the \nNorth-South dialogue on a constructive and realistic basis. None of the \nglobal problems threatening the survival of mankind can be dealt with \nadequately without the active participation of the developing countries. The \neconomic and social aspects of multilateral policy are in the interests of all \nMember States. United Nations action in this realm has been notoriously \ninadequate. \nWith the ideological confrontation of the post-War period overcome, the \nmost urgent problem today is the world recession and the consequent risk of \nregional isolationism. Undue concern for political and security matters or a \nnarrow view of world problems can cloak conservative impulses and new \nprotectionist tendencies, which would pose the threat of undue interference. \n\nThe threat of this new world division can be dispelled only if we all agree \nthat the various aspects of North-South relations together constitute the most \nurgent, critical factor of international security. \nNone the less, Peru recognizes the importance and urgency of maintaining \npeace and preventing conflicts. We are prepared to expand our traditional \nparticipation in peace-keeping operations. The Secretary-General's Agenda for \nPeace sets out many innovative ideas for the future of United Nations action \nin this sphere, and we firmly support them. \nThe situation of Peru exemplifies the unyielding relationship among \nnational, regional and world bodies. In our case, this relationship, \nfrequently addressed by the theoreticians of international relations, becomes \nsomething of a paradigm, because my country has worked to promote its national \ninterests, respect for national sovereignty and multilateral action. In other \nwords, Peru seeks to reconcile a political programme dealing both with the \nviability of its internal plans and with foreign affairs through a consistent \neconomic and financial programme. At this point in international relations, \nwe cannot imagine that a State like Peru can exist without coherence among \nthose three factors. Without this, we would be under constant threat from \nfragmentation of sovereignty which has already done damage in other parts of \nthe world or from harsh limitations of sovereignty resulting from the \ninterventionist nature of the new global challenges and the consequences of \nhasty multilateralism. \nWe view regional action as relevant, because we consider that the future \nof the multilateral system is based on the development of trustworthy regional \norganizations. These must play a growing role in the promotion of democracy, \n fostering development, in overcoming conflicts, in supplying humanitarian \nassistance and in maintaining peace. \n\nIn our region, Peru is working to ensure that the Organization of \nAmerican States will play its new role and go beyond the rituals of rhetoric \nand ostracism. We cannot continue to hold back a hemispheric organization \nwhose work must be based on solidarity and must be effective to address the \nfundamental issues that threaten democracy and development. \n\nThe democratization of international relations can be achieved in a \nnumber of ways. Peru believes that one of the most effective of these is the \nstrengthening of regional organizations, which are ideal forums for dealing \nwith any substantive issue. All the situations that now call for speedy and \neffective action are the legacy of the dynamics of the cold war. Today we \nneed imaginative solutions that combine the global vision of the United \nNations with contributions by regional bodies. This is no easy task, because \nboth approaches require the political will of Member States; but given the \nuncertainty of international relations, that will must consistently be made \nmanifest in all bodies where States come together, as is obviously the case \nwith the wide range of neighbourly relations we enjoy within our Organization. \nThe Government of Peru shares the desire of the Government of Ecuador, \nexpressed by the President of that country, Mr. Duran Ballen, in his statement \nlast Friday. He spoke about the need to promote joint development between the \ntwo countries. In this context, and bearing in mind the fact that Peru gives \npriority to the strengthening of its fraternal bonds with Ecuador, \nPresident Alberto Fujimori in November 1991 put forward a proposal for \nfriendship, cooperation and integration. This proposal was aimed at \nreorienting bilateral relations to reflect the desires of our peoples to \nstrengthen good-neighbourly relations and development. \nPeru is convinced that the common will for understanding expressed during \nthe State visit by President Fujimori of Ecuador in January 1992, as well as \nin the interview with President Duran Ballen in Quito last August, when he \nassumed the presidency of Ecuador, will continue in further meetings between \nthe two Heads of State, making it possible gradually to harmonize our \nrespective positions and to deepen our relations. \n \nAs is well known, the crisis in Peru has reached an extreme because of \nthe actions of terrorist groups and as a result of our dire economic \nsituation. But we must avoid simplistic interpretations which maintain, for \nexample, that ours is an ethnic problem pitting an indigenous population, the \ndescendants of defeated Incas, against a political class descended from the \nSpanish conquistadors. This interpretation is thought-provoking and linear \nbut inaccurate. Exploitation of man by man is a historic fact which many \ngenerations of Peruvians have striven to cancel out. But it is also a \nstruggle to reconcile characteristics of an idiosyncrasy rooted in a profound \nand extensive mixing of races - characteristics that at times may clash but \nthat at others can mesh fraternally throughout the breadth of Peru, fragmented \nas it is by its topography, and to the depth of the baroque culture of this \nthe oldest nation State of South America. \nThe cumulative ancestral problems of five centuries have given rise to a \nsocial breakdown which may now be called historical. To this unstable legacy \nare now added new challenges, including a quarter of a century of economic \nstagnation and internal migration, with its accompanying demographic explosion \nand mushrooming slums, and culminating during the past decade in \nnarco-terrorism. Quite naturally, this has produced a tacit alienation \nbetween the State and society and as a result rightly or wrongly people \nhave perceived the State as an obstacle or impediment instead of as a \nguarantee of meeting the basic needs of society. \nIn the face of these challenges, an ambitious and difficult programme to \nput the country's economy and finances on a healthier footing was begun in \n1990; it is now on the verge of bringing economic recovery and renewal of the \nState apparatus. An anti-terrorist strategy culminated a few days ago in the \ncapture of the founder of the terrorist group Shining Path. \n \nThe conciliation Peru now seeks between its ancestral culture and the \nmodern-day exigencies of competition is not impossible. It can be achieved by \nmodernizing the economy and public institutions and by eliminating insecurity \nthrough joint efforts of the State and society against terrorism. What is \nneeded is a representative democracy that is more attentive to the real \nimmediate interests of the people, along with institutions that can guarantee \nan efficient dialogue between the State and society. This civic progress can \nbe successfully made through a modern parliament, through integrity and \nefficiency in the administration of justice, and through the constant efforts \nof the political classes, both new and traditional, in order to surmount the \ncountry's problems in light of reality rather than of doctrine. \nAt this complicated juncture Peru does not stand alone. It has enjoyed \nthe understanding of other countries in the hemisphere and the thoughtful \nsupport of countries in other parts of the world. The understanding reached \nwith regard to Peru's problems in the Organization of American States \nrepresents a historic landmark in the work of that organization and augurs \nwell for its intelligent and dynamic responses to future challenges. \nThe decision to respond positively to Peru's request for technical \nsupport and to send observers to the elections to be held in November is the \nexpression of a joint effort to interpret, in a definite and transparent \nmanner, the desires of the people and the Government of Peru to elect a \nconstituent congress which will lead to new institutional viability for our \ndemocracy. \nThe Shining Path obsession has not only divided the country but created \nantagonisms between the State and society, destroying both and creating \ninstead a totalitarian response to the national crisis. The various stages \n\nof the Shining Path, stripped of anecdote and rhetorical effect, began with \nthe exploitation of a short-lived and fairly confined Andean uprising, \nfollowed by coercive recruitment, employing intimidation and violence against \npeasants. In this context, given the movement's tenuous strength in the rural \nareas, it launched an assault on the cities, carrying out fierce \nassassinations of true urban leaders and bombing civil targets. \nDuring recent stages, the Shining Path had already established an \nunnatural alliance with Peru's most powerful and illegitimate transnational \nforce, drug trafficking. It had filled the growing popular vacuum with its \nradicalized violence, taking new terrorist forms to extremes and moving from \nthe countryside, where it had never taken root, to the city in a so-called \n\\\"strategic step\\\" which only the narcissistic cult of its leadership could \nsustain. This final stage of self-intoxicated obstinacy was the beginning of \nthe end. \nSociety reacted. From apprehension and despair, we moved silently to \nindignation and took the offensive, making it possible to create an atmosphere \npropitious to the recent capture of the founder of this Utopian movement that \nPeru considers to be the antithesis of its nationality. While it would be \noverly optimistic to say that we are approaching the light at the end of the \ntunnel, we can indeed perceive the fresh air of a new era of hope. \nThe Peruvian people have overcome their paralysis and are now taking \naction against terrorism. Now that its genocidal practices have been \nuncovered and the Shining Path is being stymied by the renewed thrust of \ndemocracy in Peru, the efforts of the hemisphere must lead to international \ncooperation. In essence what we are trying to do is to promote the most \neffective integration of Peru into the world economy; at the same time, we \n\nmust contribute to the country's internal security and cooperate in the \ndismantling of external agents who are still promoting terrorism in this \nnation. Here, in a word, lies the solidarity demanded by Peru and which the \nCharter requires of us, the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "First, I should \nlike to express our profound satisfaction. Sir, at your election to your high \npost, and we wish you every success in carrying out your duties as President \nof the United Nations General Assembly at its current session. \nAt the preceding session the Republic of Kazakhstan was unanimously \nadmitted as a Member of the United Nations. On behalf of the people of \nKazakhstan, I have the honour to express our deep gratitude for that step and \nto declare that the Republic of Kazakhstan, as a peace-loving State, is fully \ncapable of fulfilling its obligations, as defined in the Charter of the United \nNations, and of making a constructive contribution in all the spheres of \nactivity of this authoritative international Organization. \nThe current session is no less important for us, since during this \nsession the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan has for the first time, \nbeen given the opportunity to speak from this rostrum. I take this \nopportunity to extend cordial greetings to all the States Members of the \nUnited Nations. It would be difficult by now to conceive of the present world \norder without the United Nations. The world community places many hopes in \n \nthis unique international organization, chief among them being the formation \nof a reliable machinery, reliable stability and security. \nThe world has now come close to the threshold beyond which the visible \ndisturbing challenges of the future compel us to adopt a new quality of \ncoordination, a new way to organize our joint efforts. \nWe must clarify what is the essence of this new and as yet unknown \nprocess, and we must master it within the context of our whole community, our \ncontinent, our region and our own country. These are the aspects on which I \nshould like to focus Members' attention. \n\nThe first aspect relates to the world community itself and the role of \nthe United Nations in the world. At this session there has already emerged an \nunderstanding of the new realities, which must be defined in a new agenda for \nthe entire world. It is no accident that this is the title of \nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's well-known report. We believe that \nhis concept of preventive diplomacy is an extremely timely, politically \nrational initiative, in the realization of which all members of the world \ncommunity should become involved. \nIn this connection I regard preventive diplomacy as a system of political \nand socio-economic measures designed to prevent hotbeds of potential tension \nfrom bursting into flame. An important place in it is occupied by the \nconditions which are needed for maintaining social and political stability and \nare visible on the surface and by those problems the detection of whose very \nexistence requires prognosticatory analysis in depth. \nIt is not difficult to understand that the question of borders is a \npowder-keg that could explode at any moment, and the explosion usually hurts \nnot only those who are playing with fire but also many others who have only a \nvery remote connection with the fuse-lighters. In my view, it is obvious that \neven one precedent in the revision of currently existing borders would cause a \nchain reaction of geopolitical disintegration with unforeseeable consequences. \nIn referring to the importance of the principle of the inviolability of \nState territory-, I should like to emphasize that the rights of national \nminorities today are often thought to be identical with the rights of nations \nto self-determination, extending even to the establishment of independent \nStates. If we were to hold to such an approach, then, hypothetically \nspeaking, thousands of economically weak sovereign States might arise all over \n \nthe world. Such a situation would be a striking demonstration of turning a \nprinciple into a fetish, carrying it to the ultimate absurdity. \nI am convinced that the world community, which today quite rightly gives \nso much attention to the rights of national minorities, should define clearly \nthe criteria for such rights, in order to ensure that human rights and the \nrights of nations will triumph on the basis of the triumph of democracy and \npeace. Otherwise, under cover of a nation's right to self-determination, the \nintegrity of any national State will be called into question, and the \ncorrosive principle of separatism will go on without end. \nAt the same time, taking a look forward from the present day to the \ntwenty-first century in a search for hotbeds of potential tension, I wish to \ndraw the world community's attention, among other questions that give cause \nfor great concern, to the problem of water in the Central Asian region, which \nin time might become a source of dangerous disputes in the very heart of the \noldest continent. I am convinced that we need to speed up work now, not \nlater, on the preparation of special United Nations projects that would \nprovide for a gradual and effective solution to the problem of furnishing \nwater resources to Central Asia. \nI must point out that the decrease in geopolitical tension along \nEast-West lines and the increasingly dangerous confrontation between North and \nSouth is a universally recognized fact. However, the emergence and \nexacerbation of the second confrontation do not decrease the timeliness of the \nfirst. The long-standing complexity of relations between East and West cannot \nhe dissipated with the breakup of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. \nAccordingly, I believe that the proposed efforts for preventive diplomacy \nin establishing, keeping and enhancing the peace should be exerted equally \n\nalong all the lines of global interaction. I stress this because some \ndistortions have already become visible in this connection. United Nations \nefforts, to judge from the events of recent months, are predominantly \npolitical and military-political in nature. We see more use being made of \nprohibitions than of encouragement and incentives. These measures are aimed \nat reducing the tensions, visible on the surface, but so far they have not had \nany influence on the roots of the conflicts that have arisen and grown. The \nreal cause of these conflicts was recently pointed out from this rostrum. The \nrichest 20 per cent of the world's people, in the Northern and Western \ncountries, consume 83 per cent of the world's gross product, and the poorest \n20 per cent of the world's people, in the countries of the South and the East, \nonly 1.4 per cent. As we can see, the income of the richest 20 per cent is \n60 times that of the poorest 20 per cent. I would call this 60 to 1 ratio the \nformula for world inequality. Until this gap begins to narrow, we shall not \nhave a real basis for the comprehensive prevention of conflicts. \nI emphasize that, in the final analysis, we are not talking about \nredistributing the income of the wealthiest 20 per cent for the benefit of the \npoor. The world inequality formula should be changed not by reducing the \nincome of the wealthiest 20 per cent but by increasing that of the poorest \nthrough organized assistance to help their countries develop. It may be \nworthwhile to think about redirecting United Nations efforts towards genuine \nconflict prevention and finding the root causes of conflicts. What practical \nsteps can be taken in this regard? \nI can understand the Secretary-General's concern over the main problem \nthat impedes United Nations peace-keeping efforts the shortage of financial \n\nresources. It is obvious that United Nations expenditures for the \nestablishment, maintenance and enhancement of peace must be increased each \nyear. But how can this be done? \nAs is well known, until 1992, United Nations expenditures on \npeace-keeping totalled approximately US$8.3 billion, not even 1 per cent of \ntotal annual defence expenditures in all countries at the end of the last \ndecade, which was approximately 1 trillion dollars. \nI propose that all countries should, as a demonstration of their good \nwill, begin to set up a fund for United Nations peacemaking efforts on the \nbasis of the \\\"one plus one\\\" formula. This means that each State would begin \nto transfer 1 per cent of its defence budget to the fund and would increase \nits transfers by the same 1 per cent each year. Thus the amount allocated to \npeacemaking in 10 years would increase tenfold. \nI think that the national security of every member of the world community \nwould be by no means harmed but, on the contrary, actually strengthened by \nsuch an action. It is appropriate to recall here the Eastern story which \ntells of some people who held a contest of strength. One showed the power of \nhis muscles and fists, another found strength in the hardness of his skull, \nthe third in his fleetness of foot, the fourth in the sharpness of his \ntongue. But a wise man, remembering the heart, without which no strength is \npossible, suggested that they should compete in generosity. The generosity of \neach country will be what determines the degree to which my proposal is \nimplemented a sort of competition for the benefit of the whole world. The \nRepublic of Kazakhstan is ready to begin this process immediately. There are. \n\nof course, also other ways that can be provided for States to contribute to \nthe fund for United Nations peacemaking efforts. \nThe second aspect on which I should like to dwell is the problem of peace \nand security in our continent of Asia or, more broadly, in Eurasia. I am \nreferring to the initiative put forward by the Republic of Kazakhstan to hold \na conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia (CICMA). \nThe idea of establishing structures for security and cooperation in Asia of \nthe same type as the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) \nhas long been in the air but has not yet gained wide support. \nThe useful experience of the activities of continental organizations in \nthe Americas, in Africa and in Europe should, it would seem, impel Asia as \nwell to establish unified bodies for interaction and cooperation. But this is \nnot happening, and there are quite a few real reasons for that fact. \nPoliticians and analysts critical of the idea of setting up structures for \nsecurity and cooperation in Asia often advance the weighty argument that the \nlevel of geographical, historical, economic, political social and cultural \nheterogeneity among Asian countries is much higher than that among the \ncountries of Europe, the Americas, or Africa. Such heterogeneity in economic \nand political matters naturally interferes with the action of continental \nstructures for collective security. \n\nThis can be countered with a well-known piece of Oriental wisdom: A \njourney of a thousand steps starts with the first step. It is by no means \nnecessary to move towards a unified Asian structure and collective security in \nall these types of interaction at once. It is sufficient to start levelling \nout the heterogeneity in one area - for instance, in the military-political or \neconomic sphere - and then look for joint approaches in other fields of \ncooperation. The move towards such a continental structure could take place \nin many steps and on a stage-by-stage basis. For example, it could go from \nbilateral relations through regional and continental structures and coalitions \nin particular types of cooperation, through the elaboration of \nconfidence-building measures and collective security, as well as humanitarian, \neconomic and cultural interaction, to common continental bodies for \ncooperation on a broad spectrum of problems. \nProspects for this process and its main stages might be as follows: \nThe first stage would consist of preparatory work to organize and conduct \nthe Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia \n(CICMA). The approximate time-frame would be 1992 to 1994. \nThe second stage would involve accelerating the work of CICMA, increasing \nthe number of its members, adapting it to the framework of a Conference on \nSecurity and Cooperation in Asia (CSCA) and forming pan-Asian structures of \nthe CSCE type. The approximate time-frame could be 1994 to 1998. \nThe third stage would include defining the development of CSCA, \nstrengthening its permanent structures, interaction between CSCE and CSCA and \nthe creation of transcontinental bodies in particular areas of cooperation. \nThe approximate time-frame would be 1998 to 2000. \n\nThe fourth stage would consist in forming a unified transcontinental \nconference on security and cooperation in Eurasia and creating machinery for \npermanent interaction between the continental systems of collective security \nin Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas, with the further prospect of setting \nup a unified global system of collective security and cooperation. The \napproximate time-frame would be 2000 to 2005. \nWe in Asia live in a remarkable land. All the major religions of the \nworld Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam were born in the sacred \nsoil of our continent. All the spiritual teachers of mankind, ranging from \nLao-tse and Gautama Buddha, Jesus Christ and Muhammad to the greatest of \ncontemporary thinkers, of the calibre of Mahatma Gandhi, were born in our part \nof the world. Is it not possible for Asia to absorb everything that has been \naccumulated over the ages and synthesize a new concept of continental \ncooperation and collective security? \nThis position by no means presupposes any regional autarky. We are not \ngoing to lock ourselves within continental borders. On the contrary, in the \ninterests of Asian countries and peoples, we shall collect the best of what \nwas born in other parts of the world. \nI am convinced that we must make a collective search for the best way to \nmeet the challenges of the future and lay new foundations for mankind's \nexistence in a world more integrated than ever before. Accordingly, I suggest \nthat we should convene a special session or a United Nations conference to \ndiscuss the problems of the post-confrontation era, for it is the mission of \nthe United Nations to play a decisive role in confirming new levels of \norganization in the international community. The United Nations itself should \n\nprobably be reorganized to a certain extent, and this includes the question of \nthe membership of the Security Council. \nThe third aspect, which we cannot fail to mention, concerns the events \nthat are taking place in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). \nThe fragile structure of our Commonwealth, set up at the end of last \nyear, does not yet fully take into account the age-old traditions of \ninteraction between States and peoples in this part of Eurasia. As a result, \nthe processes of transition to free-market economics and democracy in the CIS \nare accompanied by increasing socio-economic and political instability, the \nexacerbation of existing conflicts and the emergence of new ones. \nKazakhstan is making every possible effort to re-establish a common \ncustoms and economic area in a new capacity within the framework of a unified \nfree-trade zone. \nRealists in the CIS have no illusions as far as the $24 billion of \nassistance promised to Russia is concerned. We take a calm view of the \nneo-isolationist policy that some of the world's countries are pursuing \ntowards the CIS. We realize that only we ourselves, through our own efforts, \ncan stop industrial decline, the severing of economic ties, hyperinflation and \nother destructive processes. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that \ndespite efforts to strengthen the principles of coordination and the process \nof integration, contradictory trends may prevail in the CIS in the immediate \nfuture, so that the entire territory of the Commonwealth could turn into an \narea of instability and disintegration. I am certain that such a tragic \noutcome would not be in the interest of anyone in the world. \nIn this connection, I believe that the concept of early conflict \ndetection and preventive diplomacy might find direct practical implementation \n\nin the former Soviet federation. I am referring primarily to strengthening \nthe areas of stability that exist in the CIS and then gradually expanding \ntheir borders by reducing tensions in the areas of conflict. To that end, I \npropose setting up a regional centre, or a United Nations commission, on \npreventive diplomacy in Central Asia. The headquarters of the centre could be \nlocated at Alma-Ata, the capital of our State. \nLastly, I should like to discuss the vitally important issues of ecology \nand environmental protection. For Kazakhstan, these issues are embodied in at \nleast two areas, the Aral Sea and Semipalatinsk. \nThe Aral Sea drying up; it is a zone of ecological catastrophe that \ndemands large-scale international emergency assistance. The desertification \nof its basin, accompanied by the dissemination of 150 million tons of salty \ndust, is causing drastic deterioration of the environment and increasing the \nnegative effects on the economy and the health of a vast region with a \npopulation of more than 300 million inhabitants. If today this means tragedy \nfor tens of thousands of people, tomorrow, without emergency intervention by \nthe United Nations, it could mean tragedy for millions. \nKazakhstan is grateful for the decision by the leadership of the United \nNations Environment Programme (UNEP) to set up an assistance project for \ndeveloping a plan to save the Aral Sea and also grateful for the suggestion by \na group of UNEP experts that the Aral Sea basin should be declared a zone of \nglobal ecological disaster. \nThe other severe ecological problem we are suffering from involves the \nSemipalatinsk nuclear test site, which was built on Kazakh land against the \nwill of our people. The total power of the nuclear warheads that were set off \n\nhere in the atmosphere, on the ground and underground brought suffering to \nmore than half a million people; it is hundreds of times as large as the power \nof the devices that brought tragedy to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. \nBy a decision of our Government, we have closed down this source of \ndeath, but tremendous amounts of resources will be needed to clean up this \nregion, to cure those who have suffered and to ensure the safety of the \nchildren who will again be born here. The people of Kazakhstan will therefore \nneed active international assistance. \nToday, on 5 October, we celebrate the anniversary of the creation of the \nUnited Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat). Recognizing its \nunquestionable importance, Kazakhstan hopes for effective technical and \nadvisory assistance from the Centre to our programmes of governmental \ndevelopment for urban and rural construction. \nThe Kazakh people has a proverb, \\\"Elu zhylda el zhana,\\\" which literally \nmeans, \\\"The world becomes new every 50 years\\\". The first half-century of the \nexistence of the United Nations has been marked by confrontation between \nsuper-Powers and the burden of opposing military blocs. Now the world \ncommunity has a historic opportunity to find in the form of the United Nations \nthe means to bring about effective cooperation in the name of peace and \nprogress. We must do our utmost to take full advantage of it. \n"

        "file_text": "I wish to begin by congratulating my \ncolleague Mr. Stoyan Ganev on his election to the high office of President of \nthe General Assembly. He can rest assured that the delegation of Finland will \nrender him its full support in his challenging task. \nOn behalf of my Government I wish also to extend a warm welcome to the 13 \nnew Members amongst us. Their participation in the work of the United Nations \nwill further strengthen the Organization. \nSince the beginning of this year the United Nations has had a new \nSecretary-General. Faced with many difficult challenges, \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has already shown, in word and in deed, that he is \nfirmly in charge. We wish him all success in his work. \n\nThe United Nations Charter was drafted under dramatic circumstances \nduring the final stages of the Second World War. After two world wars, the \nUnited Nations was given the responsibility for maintaining peace and security \nfor future generations. Now, decades later, the Organization also faces a \nmultitude of other major challenges: those of development, protection of the \nenvironment and promotion of democracy and human rights. Courageous and \nvisionary leadership is now called for to create a new United Nations for a \nnew international era. \nThe Security Council demonstrated such leadership at its historic summit \nmeeting held in January. After decades of cold war, the summit set new \npriorities for the United Nations in the promotion of peace and security \nworldwide, and provided guidelines for a more active United Nations \ninvolvement in the maintenance of peace. \nIn response to the initiative taken by the Security Council summit the \nSecretary-General has submitted an excellent report under the title \\\"An Agenda \nfor Peace\\\". In it he has innovatively addressed the question of how the full \npotential of the United Nations can be most effectively used in the service of \npeace and international security. The report is a comprehensive effort by the \nSecretary-General to relate preventive diplomacy, peace-making and \npeace-keeping, as well as peace-building, to the changing political and \nsecurity requirements of the world today. \n\nI am especially pleased to note that the Secretary-General's thinking and \nmany of his recommendations are well in line with what Finland, often together \nwith the other Nordic countries, has itself long advocated. \nAs expressed so clearly in the Secretary-General's report, it is not \nsufficient that the United Nations should succeed in putting an end to \nconflicts. The best way to deal with conflicts is to prevent them. This is a \ncomplicated but vital task, where the capacity of the United Nations should be \nconsiderably strengthened. \nDifferent methods could come into question, depending on the specific \ncircumstances of each case. But the necessary basis for any prevention is \ncontinuous information-gathering and monitoring exercised both by the \nSecretary-General and by the Security Council. Early deployment of monitors \nor peace-keepers should be considered whenever necessary for effective \nprevention. \nMay I add that we are also grateful to the Secretary-General for the \ninnovative treatment of post-conflict, comprehensive peace-building in his \nreport. \nWhen the capacity of the United Nations to keep peace and prevent \nconflicts has been stretched to its limit, it is natural that other \nmeans should be taken under consideration. Here regional organizations and \nagencies can play a significant role. The Secretary-General's repeated calls \nfor closer cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and \nregional organizations are well-founded. \nAt its Helsinki Summit in July, the Conference on Security and \nCooperation in Europe (CSCE) responded constructively. CSCE has strengthened \nits capacity for conflict management and peace-keeping. \nWe also support the Secretary-General's idea of periodic consultations \nbetween the United Nations and regional arrangements on confidence-building \nmeasures. \nThe tragic situation in former Yugoslavia shows clearly how a complex \nproblem requires an innovative approach. Under the joint leadership of the \nUnited Nations and the European Community, the Conference, with its six \nworking groups, is seeking solutions to the multitude of political, ethnic, \nhumanitarian and other problems in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. \nCSCE is also actively engaged in supporting the settlement of the conflict. \n \nIn this context, let me say that Finland supports the Security Council \nrecommendation to the General Assembly that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \nshould apply for membership in the United Nations and should not participate \nin the work of the General Assembly in the meantime. \nWhile regional organizations should play a greater role in dealing with \nthreats to security in their respective regions, the United Nations, through \nits Security Council, retains, of course, its unique and primary role and \nspecial instruments in maintaining international peace and security. \nThe Secretary-General reminds us of the most potent instrument available \nto the Security Council, Article 42 of the Charter. We agree with him that \nthe last-resort option of taking military action is essential to the \ncredibility of the United Nations as a guarantor of international security. \nWhile not underestimating the problems involved, we believe that the Security \nCouncil and all Members of the Organization should seriously consider the \nproposals of the Secretary-General concerning peace-enforcement units, as well \nas the negotiation of agreements in accordance with Article 43 of the Charter. \nProliferation of all weapons of mass destruction constitutes a major \nthreat to international peace and security. International norms of \nnon-proliferation should be strengthened through universal and credible \nadherence to them. \nFinland welcomes the recently concluded chemical-weapons convention. It \nis a vital and long-awaited part of the international non-proliferation regime \nand should attract as many original signatories as possible. Finland, for its \npart, will be among the first States to sign and ratify the convention. \nUnrestrained accumulation of conventional arms can lead to regional \ninstability. It is therefore essential that especially the major \n\narms-exporting countries should exercise restraint individually and \ncollectively. It is also necessary that all relevant transfers should be \nfully reported to the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms. \nThe Security Council summit represented a firm recommitment to the \npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The \nSecretary-General, for his part, has seized the momentum and turned this new \ncommitment into a programme for concrete action. In the promotion of peace \nand security, this is indeed the beginning of a new era in the history of the \nUnited Nations. \nOn the same positive note, I should like to turn to another summit, the \nEarth Summit, held at Rio de Janeiro. Alongside the task of maintaining peace \nand security, a new equally courageous and visionary leadership is called for \non sustainable development. At Rio a remarkable number of Heads of State and \nGovernment responded to that call and drew guidelines for world-wide \nsustainable development. Although our expectations could not all be \nfulfilled, the Earth Summit showed that the United Nations and the \ninternational community can achieve remarkable results when minds meet. \nYet Rio was only the beginning of a long process towards sustainable \ndevelopment. In that process, a fundamental change is needed first and \nforemost in attitudes a change in our own life-styles. And we need a strong \npolitical will to direct that change. A sustainable future can be brought \nabout only by putting the treaties agreed upon at Rio into force and by \ntranslating the principles of the Declaration and Agenda 21 into action. In \nthis the Commission on Sustainable Development will have an essential role to \nplay. \n \nThe conventions signed at Rio are just an initial core for a \ncomprehensive legal framework, which should guide mankind in the right \ndirection. What we do need is a full set of internationally binding \nagreements which redirects production and consumption patterns in each and \nevery country. We also need effective conventions covering natural \nresources. Here instruments on desertification and sustainable forestry are \nthe most urgent ones. \nThe future of mankind requires sustainable development, management and \nconservation of forests of all types of forests everywhere. Forests have \nboth an important national dimension and an important global dimension. \nForests are a valuable national resource which must be utilized for the \nbenefit of the local population. Sustainable forestry is also economically \nbeneficial. While the sovereignty of nations over their forest resources \nshould be respected, that sovereignty should not be misused. \nFinland, for its part, is prepared to participate actively in launching \nthe negotiations on the global forest convention on the basis of the forest \nprinciples agreed upon at Rio. Here we have to build a better understanding \nof the need for such an international instrument. We also have to build \nmutual confidence founded on the unique role of forests in the global \necosystem. \nTo implement what was agreed at Rio is a tall order for any country, and \nparticularly for developing countries. Many of them will need the assistance \nof the international community and the United Nations. New and additional \nresources required by developing countries must be provided in a timely \nmanner. That is a heavy task for the donor community, as it has to shoulder \nthe responsibility of also assisting the new democracies in transition. \n\nThe results of the Earth Summit do indeed underline the unique and \nindispensable role of the United Nations in promoting development. They will \nhave a crucial impact on the entire economic and social sector of the United \nNations and on the work of the Economic and Social Council. Development \ndeserves the same priority and attention as peace and security. \nDevelopment is not only economic and social progress; it is also \npromotion of democracy and human rights. No longer do questions of violations \nof human rights belong exclusively to the sovereign domain of States. On the \ncontrary, respect for human rights and democracy is an integral part of \ninternational relations. It is therefore one of the main responsibilities of \nthe United Nations to see to it that they are respected world wide. \nThe Economic and Social Council is the principal organ of the United \nNations for development. It is important and urgently necessary that the \nEconomic and Social Council be strengthened so that it can gain the true \nleadership role for sustainable development and promotion of human rights and \ndemocracy. \nThe demands put on the United Nations today are unprecedented. New \nchallenges have to be met and financed. Finland shares the \nSecretary-General's concerns regarding the Organization's ability to function \nin the present financial crisis. We are therefore willing to consider \nconstructively any of his proposals. Finland is particularly anxious to see \nthe General Assembly take the first step recommended by the Secretary-General: \nthe establishment of a peace-keeping reserve fund to meet the initial expenses \nof peace-keeping operations pending receipt of assessed contributions. The \nNordic countries have long advocated this step. With the recent expansion of \noperations, the need for such a fund is acute. \n\nIt is not in keeping with the honour, interests or legal obligations of \nthe Member States for the United Nations to exist in \\\"its present mendicancy\\\", \nto use the words of the Secretary-General. For members of any club, paying \ndues is <\u00ac\u00aa duty, not an option. While exceptional measures may be needed to \nguarantee the uninterrupted functioning of the United Nations in the present \ncrisis, the overall funding of the Organization must be built on the \ncollective responsibility of the entire membership. We have a common interest \nto invest in improved security and development towards a more prosperous and \ndemocratic world. \nThe United Nations Charter remains fully valid today as regards the \nmaintenance of international peace and security and, by and large, also as \nregards the promotion of international cooperation in the economic, social, \nand human rights sectors. In facing the new challenges, especially in the \npromotion of sustainable development and democracy, the primary issue is how \nwe can best build on the Charter and even amend it, where necessary. \nAs it approaches the end of the second millennium, humanity is faced with \nformidable challenges. Meeting them will not be easy; I have no illusions \nabout that. Yet the United Nations now has a. better chance than ever to use \nits full potential and show leadership for the sake of a better future. \n"

        "file_text": "\nI would like to begin by expressing to you, Mr. President, our sincere \ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh \nsession of the General Assembly. The trust and confidence bestowed upon you \nreflects appreciation for you personally as well as recognition of the \npositive role played by your country, Bulgaria, in international affairs. I \nwish you success in the pursuit of your mission. \nOn this occasion, I would like to congratulate your predecessor. \nAmbassador Samir Shihabi, for his effective conduct of the affairs of the \nGeneral Assembly during its previous session. \nI also would like to acknowledge the continued sincere efforts by the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to enhance the prospects for \npeace and reduce the elements of tension which prevail in many parts of the \nworld. These efforts and pursuits represent a continuation of the efforts of \nhis predecessor, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. \nI am pleased to join with the other heads of delegations in welcoming all \nthe States which have joined the United Nations this year so that they may \nparticipate, along with all other Member States, in realizing the noble \nobjectives of this Organization. It is my hope that these States will be able \nto play an effective role in the Organization, and contribute positively to \nthe realization of peace, security, stability, and development for the benefit \nof the international community as a whole. \nWe are assembled here in this international forum in which nations, small \nand large, powerful and weak, meet on the basis of equality and work together \nfor the establishment of right and justice, order and security, prosperity and \npeace. We learn from the lessons of the past, to chart a course for the \nfuture in an environment of fast-changing global conditions and \n\ncircumstances. We follow, with great interest, the general trends of what has \ncome to be known as the new world order, an order founded upon the principles \nof the United Nations and on the tenets of international legality. This order \nrejects the use of force in the settlement of disputes. We must understand \nthat this order cannot evolve by itself, but requires us to change our \nperception of the role of the United Nations. We must develop our methods and \npractices in harmony with the basic principles of the Organization, whose \npurpose is to replace war ind destruction with cooperation between nations and \npeoples and thereby lead to development, respect for the dignity of man, \nsecurity, peace and prosperity for our world. \nTherefore, it is incumbent upon us to bring about a fundamental change in \nour understanding of the role of the United Nations from one of crisis \nmanagement and the preservation of peace to one of active participation in \npeacemaking. \nIn this context, I would like to express appreciation for the proposals \npresented by the Secretary-General for enhancing the role and effectiveness of \nthe United Nations. His Agenda for Peace which contained those proposals, \ndeserves prompt attention, objective consideration and thorough study in order \nfor us to arrive at an appropriate formula for the functioning of the \nOrganization that would be compatible with its desired more effective role. \nSubsequently, attention could be given to the introduction of basic structural \nand institutional changes, if required. \nEven a cursory review of the current international situation would reveal \nthat there still remain hotbeds of tension which threaten security and \nstability in many regions of the world. It would show too that the role of \nthe United Nations becomes increasingly more important concomitantly with the \n \nincrease in the possibilities and opportunities for cooperation among nations \nin enhancing and supporting the Organization so that no nation may commit \naggression against or threaten the security, sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of any other nation. \nThe United Nations has clearly demonstrated that it is capable of playing \nsuch a role when it firmly faced up to the Iraqi aggression against its \nneighbour, Kuwait, a peaceful nation that may be small in size but which plays \na major role and makes major contributions to the family of nations. By so \ndoing, the United Nations was able to liberate Kuwait from a blatant \naggression and restore legality to its territory. The image of this noble \nstand still remains before us and is indelibly etched in our minds. \nOn this occasion, it behoves us to express our appreciation and \nadmiration for this role and to emphasize now, more than ever, the need for it \nto continue and be promoted, for we have noticed recently the return of the \nIraqi regime to the pattern of threats and false claims regarding Kuwait in a \nmanner that is reminiscent of that regime's declarations on the eve of its \naggression against Kuwait. In so doing, it makes a mockery of its obligations \nunder international treaties and resolutions. It also continues to \nprocrastinate in implementing the resolutions of the Security Council and \nfails to comply with their stipulations. It has given itself the right, on \nthe basis of sovereignty, to starve and humiliate the Iraqi people and subject \nIraq to dangers that threaten its unity and security while it goes on \nclaiming, falsely and slanderously, that it is the international community \nthat is responsible for the dangers that beset Iraq and the miseries of its \npeople. \n\nWe are totally convinced that the only means of averting instability in \nthe region and dealing with the suffering of the people of Iraq lies, first \nand foremost in ensuring the complete and comprehensive implementation of the \nresolution of the Security Council which reflect the collective will of the \ninternational community. \n\nWe have heard, with great concern, the declaration by the United Arab \nEmirates that its efforts have failed to achieve a peaceful and amicable \nsolution with the Islamic Republic of Iran in relation to the complete \nsovereignty of the United Arab Emirates over the three islands of Abu Mousa, \nTun the Greater and Tun the Smaller. We express our support for the position \ntaken by the United Arab Emirates on this issue and for its demand that Iran \nreverse its unilateral actions and that the problem be settled through \nnegotiations on the basis of international law and international legality. \nThe Middle East is among the regions which attract a great deal of the \ninternational community's attention and is the focus of its efforts. It is \ntime that this region enjoyed its rightful share of peace, security and \nstability so that all its energies may be directed towards development and all \nits resources may be devoted to ensuring the prosperity of its peoples. The \nMiddle East is capable of providing a decent standard of living for all its \ninhabitants and has the potential to become a peaceful oasis of stability, \nprosperity and creativity. \nTo achieve the objectives we desire, it is our vital duty to strive to \neliminate the threat posed by the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction \nin the Middle East. We therefore welcome the conclusion of negotiations on \nthe non-proliferation convention banning chemical weapons. The draft \nconvention resulting from those negotiations is before the General Assembly at \nits current session. We affirm our support for the objectives of the draft \nconvention. This support derives from the great concern of the Kingdom of \nSaudi Arabia to make the Middle East a region free from weapons of mass \ndestruction of all kinds whether nuclear, chemical or biological. However, \n\nthat goal can be reached only when all States in the region without exception \nrefrain from the production, stockpiling or possession of weapons of mass \ndestruction of any kinds. \nIt should be noted that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has adhered, both in \nword and in deed, to the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons, and the Arab States have demonstrated the collective will to \nadhere to that Treaty as well. It has therefore become imperative that all \nStates in the region, including Israel, abide by both the chemical-weapons \nconvention and the non-proliferation Treaty, so as to achieve the desired \nbalance necessary for peace, security and stability for all States in the \nregion. \nThe Arab States have expressed a sincere, genuine desire to establish a \npermanent, just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. This has been \ndemonstrated by their participation in the peace negotiations sponsored by the \nUnited States and the Russian Federation. Their positive position in those \nnegotiations has proved to be a serious orientation towards ending the \nArab-Israeli conflict and towards achieving a just settlement of the \nPalestinian question that would ensure the restoration of the legitimate \nrights of the Palestinian people on the basis of Security Council resolutions \n242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and other relevant resolutions of international \nlegality. \nIn that context, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has lent its full support to \nthe current Middle East peace process. Saudi Arabia believes that no genuine \npeace can be achieved in the Middle East unless a permanent, just solution to \nthe Palestinian question is reached and unless Israel withdraws from all the \noccupied Arab territories, including Al-Quds which is an integral part of the \n\noccupied Arab territories. The question of Al-Quds has a focal place in the \npolicy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and is one of its constant concerns, \nwithin the context of the relevant United Nations resolutions and of the \nresolutions of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. \nThe success of the current Middle East peace process clearly depends on a \nserious, genuine commitment by Israel to implement the resolutions of \ninternational legality and on Israel's withdrawal from all the occupied Arab \nterritories, including Al-Quds Al-Sharif. \nThe Lebanese Government has made considerable progress in the \nimplementation of the Taef accords and has adopted the necessary political and \nconstitutional measures in that context. We must continue to support the \nefforts of the legitimate authorities in Lebanon and contribute to the process \nof reconstruction in Lebanon. In that regard, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \nappeals to the international community to help facilitate the establishment of \nan international fund to assist Lebanon. We must also reiterate the need for \nan Israeli commitment fully and unconditionally to implement Security Council \nresolution 425 (1978), which calls on Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon \nto enable the Lebanese Government to extend legitimate authority over the \nentire territory of Lebanon. \nThe General Assembly was right in deciding to deny the legality of the \nsuccession of the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the seat held by \nthe former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. We view this as a step \nin the right direction and hope that other steps will follow with a view to \nrestoring peace and stability to that part of the Balkans. \n\nThe people of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina are falling victim \nto a genocidal war waged by Serbian forces with the support of Serbia and \nMontenegro. That genocidal war has claimed thousands of innocent victims and \nhas resulted in the displacement of a large portion of the population away \nfrom their homes and possessions. My country has already declared its full \nsupport for the decisions and resolutions adopted with the consent of all \nparties concerned at the recent London Conference on the situation in the \nformer Yugoslavia. \n\nWe hope that concerted efforts will be made to ensure the full and \nserious implementation of those resolutions. So far, however, we regret that \nnone of them has been implemented. We refer to resolutions such as those \nconcerned with the placement of heavy weapons and artillery under \ninternational supervision; declaring the airspace of the Republic of Bosnia \nand Herzegovina a no-fly zone for the operations of military aircraft; the \nrelease of all prisoners-of-war and detainees; the dismantling of detention \ncamps; and the termination of the policy of ethnic cleansing. \nOn this issue, the Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques \ndoes not believe that ensuring the delivery of humanitarian assistance through \nthe United Nations to the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina is sufficient. \nRather, we believe that all necessary measures should be adopted to stop all \nthe acts of genocide and displacement that are being perpetrated by the \nSerbian forces with the support of the Belgrade regime. That requires the \nintensification of pressure on the Serbs and their supporters to force them to \nabide by the commitments they took upon themselves at the London Conference. \nThe creation of a permanent mechanism to monitor the implementation of those \ncommitments is very necessary. \nWe note with grave concern that there is some hesitation in declaring the \nairspace of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina a no-fly zone for the \nmilitary aircraft of Serbia and Montenegro. The hesitation ostensibly stems \nfrom a concern that such a step would lead to an aggravation of the \nsituation. But the situation is extremely grave as it is and cannot get much \nworse. The real dangers to be taken into consideration are those which the \ncitizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina face, namely, genocide, displacement and \n\ntorture. All of those constitute the most flagrant violations of the United \nNations Charter, the principles and tenets of international law, and the \nFourth Geneva Convention. The war that rages there is not even a civil war \nbut a war of extermination waged openly on the people of a sovereign, \nindependent State whose territory has been occupied by the perpetrators of \nthat brutal and savage aggression. \nAccordingly, we call upon the Security Council of the United Nations to \ntake all necessary measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, \nincluding Article 42; starting with the declaring of the airspace of the \nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina a no-fly zone for the air forces of Serbia \nand Montenegro and ensuring the withdrawal of all regular and irregular \nSerbian forces from the territories of the Republic of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. At the same time, we urge the international community to make \navailable all possible material, military and moral support to enable the \nGovernment of Bosnia and Herzegovina to exercise fully the legitimate right of \nself-defence. In the absence of an effective collective security mechanism, \nthe arms embargo on the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina should be lifted. \nWe are also of the view that those responsible for grave violations of \nthe Fourth Geneva Convention should be apprehended and placed on trial \naccording to the principles and provisions of international law. We also \nsupport the right of the people and Government of the Republic of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina to just compensation from Serbia and Montenegro for the loss of \nlife and property they have suffered. \nSomalia is currently a nation plagued by disasters and tragedies as a \nresult of a destructive civil war which has brought upon its people death and \n\ndisplacement and undermined its unity and territorial integrity. The \nGovernment of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques have endeavoured from the \noutset of the conflict in sisterly Somalia to contain that conflict invited \nall the parties to the conflict to meet on Saudi soil for the purpose of \nachieving national reconciliation. Saudi Arabia still exerts all possible \nefforts to put an end to that fratricidal conflict. Saudi Arabia also \nprovides assistance and relief to Somalia and unequivocally supports the role \nof the United Nations in delivering assistance to those who deserve it. It \nhas welcomed the dispatch of international forces to supervise operations that \nprovide humanitarian assistance to all regions of Somalia. The Kingdom of \nSaudi Arabia hopes that concerted international efforts will be made to \nprovide all possible assistance and relief to this afflicted nation and \nsupports the effort to put an end to the bloodshed. We urge all Somali \nfactions to work together towards making their national interest and human \nvalues their overriding objective so as to eliminate the causes of conflict \nand disunity among them. \nAfter 13 years of successful jihad the Afghani people were able to \ntriumph over injustice and regain their national identity. On this occasion \nwe look forward to the joining of all constructive and sincere efforts to \nenable the Afghani people to achieve security and stability in their nation. \nWe also look forward to the return of normal conditions throughout \nAfghanistan, to make possible the rebuilding of what has been destroyed and \nthus to enable the people of Afghanistan to work towards achieving a national \nunity that would bring together the various groups and organizations and \nprovide a climate conducive to national unity and the deployment of concerted \n\nefforts in pooling all energies and resources for the well-being and in the \ninterests of that country's people. \nWe also need to point out that that part of the world is still suffering \nfrom the continuation of the Jamu-Kashmir problem, which continues to be an \nelement of instability in the region. The Government of the Custodian of the \nTwo Holy Mosques believe that a solution must be found on the basis of United \nNations resolutions to put an end to this long-standing conflict which has \ncast its shadow over relations between the two neighbours, India and Pakistan. \n \nWhile voicing its regrets at the violence South Africa has been \nexperiencing over the past few months and the serious setbacks it has caused \nto the efforts aiming at ending the apartheid system, the Kingdom of Saudi \nArabia welcomes the recent developments in that country, which revive our hope \nfor progress towards the dismantling of that abhorrent system. The Kingdom of \nSaudi Arabia supports a major role for the United Nations in offering \nappropriate solutions and in working towards the establishment of a society \ngoverned by equality and justice. \nThe positive changes that have taken place in the international political \nsituation are bound to pave the way for addressing the issues of development \nand for the creation of an international economic environment that would help \nthe developing nations to achieve the sort of economic and social development \nthat would enable them to realize the ambitions and aspirations of their \npeoples after a better life of peace and prosperity. The developed \nindustrialized nations can cooperate in making this possible by opening their \nmarkets to the products of the developing nations, ending all protectionist \nmeasures, bringing about at an early date a successful outcome to the Uruguay \nRound of multilateral trade talks and by finding an urgent solution to the \ndebt problem. Economic cooperation between the developing countries \nthemselves is also necessary as it would constitute a fundamental tool for the \npromotion of international economic growth. \nQuestions pertaining to the situation of the world economy are of great \nimportance and interest to us in Saudi Arabia, for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \nhas a stake in ensuring the stability and soundness of the world economy and \nin avoiding the hurdles and pitfalls that may affect its growth. \n \nProceeding from this, it has responded positively to the ongoing \ndiscussions on the environment and development and has shouldered its \nresponsibility in this respect by participating in the international \ndeliberations aimed at finding well-balanced and practicable solutions to the \nquestions of climatic change on a sound scientific basis. \nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is convinced that the future of the world and \nthe prosperity of all its inhabitants depend on a clear understanding of the \nenvironmental problems that face the planet, full understanding of the \nconsequences that may result from the policies adopted in dealing with those \nproblems, careful weighing of the burdens and commitments taken by the \ncountries of the world upon themselves in addressing those problems, special \nattention to the situation of the developing energy producers and consumers \nalike and careful examination of the effects the policies adopted in dealing \nwith the problems may have on the growth of the economies of those countries. \nThis would constitute a valuable contribution to the achievement of \ncomprehensive development and the raising of the standard of living of our \npeoples so that they may enjoy prosperity, peace, security and stability. The \ncurrent international situation that has developed from the ending of the cold \nwar and the progress achieved in the areas of disarmament and reductions in \nconventional weapons, is a rare opportunity indeed for channelling resultant \nwindfalls towards solving the problems of development and underdevelopment. \nThe international community is on the threshold of a historic new era \nwhose challenges and promises are unfolding under our eyes. We are duty-bound \nto lay solid and equitable foundations that define the parameters of the \nfuture that humanity has always aspired after, a future in which no one would \nawaken to the expectation of war or goes to bed haunted by the nightmarish \n\nprospects of destruction, a future that would melt down the weapons of \ndestruction in order to forge the tools of prosperity for all, a future in \nwhich the dangers of pollution, the effects of underdevelopment and the pains \nof displacement would vanish. We shall never attain such a future unless we \nlay the foundations of peace on right and justice. And peace is the essence \nof our Islamic faith. As the Holy Koran says: \n0 ye who believe! \nEnter into Islam \nWhole-heartedly; \nAnd follow not \nThe footsteps \nOf the Evil One; \nFor he is to you \nAn avowed enemy. \n"

        "file_text": "One does not \nusually say anything personal from this podium. I would submit, however, that \nmy position does allow me to depart from this role. Exactly two years ago, I \nfinished my address here and left this very podium for what I thought was the \nlast time. Yes, I foresaw my resignation from the post of Foreign Minister of \nthe Soviet Union, as I also foresaw menacing changes coming. \nBefore coming here again I reread that address. The ideas that inspired \nit are, I think, still valid today. They helped me make a forecast that has \nbeen borne out by current events. I said then that all the peoples of the \nSoviet Union were entering the political arena and reassuming their age-old \nnational names. \n \nAll of them, including my country, are being dogged by the merciless \nonslaught of the economic crisis, which I also spoke about in my appeal to the \ninternational community to set up an international mechanism capable of \nmitigating its adverse effects. \nI said then that after the end of the cold war new and sinister figures \nwould appear on the world political scene, and that the breakdown of attempts \nto take the road to democracy would give rise to chaos and new dictatorial \nregimes. I followed my prediction about the threat of new armed conflicts \nemerging, of mass hostage-taking and the spread of terrorism with the \nconclusion that regional structures security structures - operating under \nUnited Nations auspices must be set up. \nEven that long ago, two years, I keenly felt the need to really think in \nterms of doctrine about the new realities of the contemporary world, to \nre-examine the old principles of our interrelationships, in both the inter-\nand intra-State areas, and to work out new ones. \nWhen I spoke then I was speaking as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of a \ngreat Power. Now I am speaking as the representative of a country that is \nmicroscopic in comparison. However, the dramatic change in scale does not \nreduce the size of the problems. In that tiny part of Earth called Georgia, \nwhich history has nailed to the geopolitical cross, have converged, in a \nmanner that passes understanding, all the woes and contradictions that the \nEmpire fed into its genetic code and constantly generated, and which continue \nto rack us even now that the Empire is dead. Everything I thought and spoke \nof, foresaw and predicted has befallen Georgia, my country. And there was no \nneed for clairvoyance, either; all you needed was to know the system you were \n\ndealing with. One of the greats once said that predicting important events in \nthe future was no more difficult than successfully guessing the past: if past \nevents leave traces, then, logically, future events must have roots. \nThe system was doomed. In August 1991, there was an attempt to save it \nusing its own typical methods: conspiracy, flouted laws, the use of force. I \nhad on many occasions warned about the possibility of a coup and totalitarian \nrevanchism. If the necessary conclusions had been drawn from these words of \nwarning, then we would have been dealing not with the chaotic collapse of a \nhuge Power, but with relatively painless and controllable transitions to a new \nstatus quo and to the formation of new States. The swiftness of the death \nthroes and the speed of the disintegration took the world community by \nsurprise. It was caught off guard, and is now seeing how new offshoots of \nviolence, new offshoots of catastrophe, are sprouting from the exposed \nrootstock. \nGeorgia will serve as a typical example. Here we have deep \nsocio-economic crisis. Here the fall of the Empire was attended by the rise \nof a dictatorial regime. Here several internal conflicts were provoked, and \nseparatism threatens to break up a small country and splinter its historic \nterritory into dwarf States. Here subversion, terrorism and mass \nhostage-taking rule. And, finally, here as nowhere else is the danger so \ngreat that the existing internal conflicts will merge with the ones in \nneighbouring States and grow into regional or even continental wars fought \nalong national or religious lines. \n\nI would recall that, like some other countries, Georgia was incorporated \ninto the Soviet Union by military force. That force was inspired by an \nideology that placed the interests of the class struggle far above common \nhuman goals and national values. In the light of this ideology, the integrity \nof territories and borders that had been shaped over time was of no \nsignificance: they were redrawn and parcelled out again to follow the lines \non the battlefield of proletarian internationalism. The State, political, \nadministrative and territorial structure so formed was such that it contained \nwithin itself the germs of dissatisfaction, smouldering enmity and potential \nconflict within republics and between them. \nTime bombs were planted for our futures. While the power of ideology and \nrepressive compulsion kept this heterogeneous community together, the bombs \nlay idle. As soon as that power was removed, they went off, and today a blast \nfront of enormous power is destroying whole States. \nGeorgia too is threatened. The history of Georgia's struggle for \nstatehood spans many centuries. For many centuries, this struggle went \ntogether with the formation of a distinctive national culture and the defence \nof its faith and language. In the year 337 AD, Christianity, as the State \nreligion, blessed the country's impulse towards unity within its own common \nborders. Having become a powerful State in Western Asia by the eleventh and \ntwelfth centuries, Georgia established cultural centres both within its own \nborders and in various other States beyond. \nMy portrait of Georgia would not be complete if I missed out one very \nimportant feature: from time immemorial, as part of the flow of peoples, \nideas and cultures, Georgia has upheld racial and religious tolerance as a \n\nbasic tenet of its way of life. Forced to do battle with the most powerful \nforeign adversaries, Georgia did not suffer from either xenophobia or \nreligious fanaticism. In its capital city, Tbilisi, within an area of one \nsquare kilometre, one can see a Georgian Orthodox church, an Armenian \nGregorian cathedral, a mosque, a synagogue and a Lutheran church. Christian \nfrom the fourth century on, Georgia has also seen Islam take root in some of \nits historically important provinces. And never was there enmity or discord \nbetween them, nor was anyone denied the right to live according to his or her \nown beliefs or traditions. \nUnfortunately for all of us, the slings and arrows of history brought \ndown this unity, from within as well as from outside, and something similar is \nhappening now. I consider it my duty to draw your attention to the Caucasus \nregion, as, here and now, a new and serious hotbed of interethnic, regional \nand international tension is emerging. \nThis new source of Shockwaves is within the mainstream of contemporary \ngeopolitical trends: the displacement of a global confrontation onto regional \nlevels. This displacement has taken the form of large-scale armed conflicts, \nsuch as the ones we are seeing in some countries of Europe, around the \nDniestr, at home in Georgia and in Transcaucasia, and in Central Asia. \nThis vacuum of ideas abhors its own emptiness. We should have started \nthinking about events in the huge expanse from Bosnia to Tajikistan, including \nthe Caucasus, and studying them, long ago, to find out the whys and \nwherefores. Sound politicians and statesmen as well as ordinary people, \nwhether Christian or Muslim, who live in this vast area or elsewhere have a \nduty to halt this most dangerous process. The threat of large-scale conflicts \nkindled and enflamed by fundamentalism of whatever kind is too \n\nserious to be ignored. And the danger is that much greater when fanaticism is \nexploited by fundamentalists of a Bolshevist stripe. \nAlthough they have various causes, the new conflicts do have some \nfeatures in common, particularly the following: they all began and are \ndeveloping against a background in which a number of factors are operating \neither simultaneously or partially. These are an ethnic patchwork; a variety \nof religions and denominations; socio-economic inequality; and a troubled \nhistorical and political past. \nIn the case of the Caucasus, these factors which are common to all the \nregions in question must be added to the specificity of its geopolitical \nsituation. At the meeting point of powerful geopolitical forces, it has from \ntime immemorial served as a buffer zone between South and North, Christianity \nand Islam, as an arena in which they played out their aspirations and \ninterests. \nThe disintegration of the Soviet Union has left an opening for new \nrivalries to appear. Because of their political, economic and military \nweakness, the new States of the Caucasus are not able to fill this vacuum and \nestablish reliable safeguards for their own security. External forces apart, \nvarious internal groupings are trying to turn the vacuum to their own \nadvantage under the cover of nationalistic, pseudopatriotic, separatist, and, \nmost recently, even religious guises with their own, self-serving political \nagendas. \nThe activities of the so-called Confederation of the Mountain Peoples of \nthe Caucasus, which has flouted the sovereignty, the territorial integrity and \nthe borders of the Republic of Georgia, have made this clear in one way or \nanother. Against the will of the people of the northern Caucasus and their \nlegally elected governments, this illegal, in essence openly terrorist, \n \nmilitarized organization, serving no State, has called for any means to be \nused, including mass terror; has declared our country, and its capital city, a \ndisaster zone; and has been sending mercenaries and terrorist killers, in the \nguise of volunteers, across our frontiers. Under our very eyes, the flames of \nwar are rising, and are even now threatening to engulf not only Georgia alone. \nRight before our eyes a new war is blazing up, threatening not just \nGeorgia. There is only one conclusion to be drawn: in comparison with the \nother \\\"hot spots\\\" of the post-communist world, the risk of conflict in the \nCaucasus is higher, and the Caucasus therefore endangers international peace \nand security more. \nGeorgia is at the very centre of where the problems of the Caucasus \nmeet. Yet again, as so often before in our history, Georgia's fate, its \nstatehood and its very existence are marked on the map. Faced with the \ncomplex interactions of internal and external forces, we are striving to \nimplement an active, balanced policy. Within the country, our policy is one \nof democratic transformation, national reconciliation and peaceful settlement \nof conflicts, while externally it is one of the development of friendly \nrelationships with all the countries in the region and cooperation with the \nworld community. \nWe are grateful to our neighbours through history: to Turkey, with which \nwe have concluded a friendship treaty; and to Iran, with which we are \ndeveloping friendly contacts, to the mutual benefit of both countries. Our \ncenturies-long links with the peoples of Transcaucasia, Armenia and \nAzerbaijan, and with the republics of the Northern Caucasus and with Ukraine, \ngive us an excellent foundation for close cooperation in the interest of our \ncountries. \n\nOf particular importance to us and not to us alone are our relations \nwith Russia. Russia has assisted us in setting up machinery to settle the \nGeorgian-Ossetian conflict. Twice now Russia has borne witness to the \nprinciple of the territorial integrity and inviolability of the borders of our \nState, and has joined in the process of achieving a peaceful settlement in \nanother conflict, in Abkhazia. \nA stable, prosperous and democratic Russia is a factor on a global scale \nand global in significance. A threat to Russia from the forces of \ntotalitarian revanchism is a threat to us all. In the conspiracy against \nGeorgia which is now coming out into the open, Russia's red-brown \nreactionaries are standing shoulder to shoulder with the extreme \nfundamentalists, home-grown fascists and separatists. The world must know \nabout this, and the world has a duty to help reinforce a stable, democratic \nRussia and, by so doing, help both us and its own self. \nThose are the facts of our political life today. Those facts are why we \nkeep trying to achieve the establishment of a Transcaucasian mechanism for \nconsultation and agreement. We propose that we should begin to establish a \nsystem of collective security in the Black Sea-Caucasus region, and, in this \nregard, we very much appreciate Turkey's initiatives. We support the new \ninstitutions of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), \nwhose goal is conflict prevention and the protection of the rights of national \nminorities. Our doors are wide open to fact-finding missions from European or \nworld organizations. \n \nHowever, today this is not enough. The end of the cold war has put the \nneed to develop a more effective system of global security on the agenda. The \npace of events is outstripping us; the European process is falling behind, and \nhas been very late with its response to the challenges of a time of \ntransformations. There has been a significant lag too in the United Nations \nreaction to the major changes in various regions of the world, with the \nchanges in the former Soviet Union in the forefront. \nWe welcome the bold initiatives of the Secretary-General aimed at making \nthe Organization more dynamic and capable of responding quickly to the needs \nof the day. His report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277) quite rightly raises \nthe question of the United Nations taking a multi-tiered approach to the \nproblems of the modern world. It is a good thing that an authoritative, \nindependent commission has been set up to examine the role of the Organization \nunder current conditions. \nThere is no need to fear reforms when reforms are so necessary, \nespecially, in our view, in the two interrelated fields of peace-keeping and \nnation-building in the newly independent States. I have a number of \nsuggestions to make about these two fields. \nMy first suggestion concerns the establishment of a global monitoring \nnetwork for the monitoring, prevention and settlement of internal conflicts. \nSpecial United Nations observers at \\\"hot spots\\\" and regional bureaux, missions \nand information centres would help us obtain a clear picture of events and \ndevelop specific responses. The machinery for doing this should be based \nright in the regions where conflict is occurring; in our example, in the \nCaucasus it could be based on the United Nations office in Tbilisi. We would \nalso suggest expanding the mandate of the CSCE High Commissioner for national \n\nminorities so that, if required, he could inform the Secretary-General and our \nOrganization's Commission on Human Rights. The most important thing is that \nthis should be got off the ground as quickly as possible. Similar \ninstitutions with the same mandates could be established within other regional \norganizations too. \nThe United Nations needs a special body to collect and process \ninformation on potential ethnic conflicts and to draw conclusions and issue \nrecommendations based upon it. Another of its functions would be to forecast \nconflict situations at an early stage in their gestation. \nThe International Court too could be brought in to consider conflicts. \nThe role and the capabilities of the Security Council must be looked at \nanew. We have more than once raised the issue of whether the Military Staff \nCommittee should not become more actively involved. Now that the cold war is \nover but the number of \\\"hot spots\\\" is burgeoning, the Security Council cannot \ndo without this, or another similar structure, if it is to carry out its \nfunction under the Charter in full measure. \nIt must be made binding on the States Members of the United Nations to \ninform the Security Council of imminent conflicts. Failure to comply must \ncall down sanctions. We commit ourselves to sending the United Nations and \nits Security Council annual reports on the state of affairs in the areas of \nthe protection of human rights and national minorities, and on crisis \nsituations which could lead to serious complications within the country or the \nregion. \nThis problem has yet another facet: information. Rivalry spills over \ninto the newspapers and on the airwaves, and the side with the best \ntechnology, the most money and the widest access to the media and to media \n \npeople wins. Public opinion becomes one-sided and unfounded, but this again \nis half the battle. The worst thing is that this guerrilla warfare in the \nmedia nourishes the soil of conflicts and makes them more difficult to \nsettle. We see a possible way out of this by establishing centres to \ndisseminate objective information under the auspices of the international \norganizations. \nMy second suggestion concerns the problem of refugees. Ethnic conflicts \nhave increased their number manyfold: no one now knows exactly how many there \nare. No one knows what resources are needed to help them and what we should \nstart doing first to rule out the possibility of fresh conflicts after they \nreturn home. Here too a system of observers is needed, as is an aid \norganization larger in scale than what we have now and capable not only of \nproviding material support but of making the whole process more manageable. \nIn our view, the work of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees \nneeds root-and-branch reform. \nMy third suggestion is that there should be general and comprehensive \ncontrol over the proliferation of arms. The clans of ethnic mafiosi spawned \nunder the totalitarian system are accumulating the colossal sums needed to \nacquire weapons and to suborn soldiers into taking part in hostilities and \npassing out materiel to the irregulars on the quiet. The national security \nforces and law-enforcement agencies in the young independent States are being \noverwhelmed by this epidemic of out-of-control arms races. What we need are \ninternational rapid deployment forces a sort of Interpol of Blue Helmets -\nan independent disarmament monitoring agency and the introduction of regional \narms registers. \n\nMy fourth suggestion is for United Nations rapid deployment forces in the \nfield of international legal thought and theoretical and doctrinal \ndevelopments. The traditional system of legal guidelines is lagging \nhopelessly far behind the onrush of geopolitical changes. The world is facing \narbitrary and one-sided interpretations of a whole range of internationally \nrecognized principles. Arbitrary, wild-cat declarations of sovereignty have \nled in practice to encroachments on the territorial integrity of States and on \nthe inviolability of their borders, and to large population groups being \nturned into second-class citizens; it has also caused and will cause many \nbloody conflicts. \nUnfortunately, separatism and extremism, when combined, are the ruin not \njust of States but of legal systems too. The top dogs of the separatist \nmovements are bending the rules so far they are turning them into \ncaricatures. If extremist separatism is not stopped, what awaits is a world \nsplintered and in collapse, with the anarchy and chaos lasting into the \ntwenty-first century. \nOn no account can some principles be made absolute at the expense of \nothers. It is morally wrong for one group to go for self-determination as if \nthey do not notice that for centuries, side-by-side with them, on the same \nland, there have been peoples living, peoples that cannot physically be \nremoved. This is the problem to beat all problems of today's world. \nEvery aspiration, every claim, every norm and category should be measured \nin terms of the human scale of politics, whose priorities are the equality of \nthe rights of each citizen, of everybody, regardless of nationality, \nethnicity, language or religion. In the light of this approach, we see that \n\nnot only do national minorities need to have their rights protected, but so do \nthe citizens of the majority, however paradoxical that may sound. Otherwise, \nwe may face an updated form of apartheid and ethnic dictatorship, like we have \nin the conflict zone of Abkhazia, where the minority has managed to impose its \nwill on the majority. \nHow could this have come about? What we have here is a classic example \nof self-interested bending of the law. Thanks to a discriminatory electoral \nlaw, electors of a single nationality, comprising no more than 18 per cent of \nthe population, send more deputies to the parliament of the Abkhazian \nAutonomous Republic than the electors in another that makes up more than half \nthe population there, and the rights of the other national groups are being \ntrampled on too: it takes only a third as many votes to elect one Abkhazi \ndeputy as it does to elect a Georgian, a Russian, an Armenian and so on. \nAt the end of the day, this kind of legal extremism leads to bitter \nconfrontation. The governing elite, reflecting as it does the mood of the \nextremist wing of the minority, is ruling by Draconian diktat and is going so \nfar as to wrest territory that has been Georgia's from time immemorial away \nfrom it. \n\nSeparatism is immune to dialogue and compromise: this we know from our \nown experience. Separatism does not want talks, rejects the methods of \nrational politics and even balks at implementing what it has agreed. It \nswitches meanings, calling aggression and occupation \\\"movement of military \nsub-units within our own territory\\\". How can this be? And in Georgia, on \nGeorgian soil, where Georgians and Abkhazis have lived, still live and will go \non living together? \nIn the near future the General Assembly will consider a draft declaration \non the rights of national minorities. We are going to support it, as we \nsupported the corresponding resolutions of the CSCE. However, I wish to say \nonce again that any instrument of this kind must also contain an article on \nminorities' share of the responsibility for maintaining stability and peace in \nthe territory where they live. \nIt is also time to develop more precise criteria for which legal subjects \nare entitled to self-determination, and to introduce a practice of \nindependent, expert examination of the facts involved in the arbitrary \ninterpretation and exercise of this right. \nMy fifth suggestion concerns the fact that none of the above will work \nproperly unless more effective machinery for supporting the new democracies \neconomically is set up. My saying so does not detract from our gratitude to \nthe European and world financial institutions; it is thanks to them that we \nare still alive. However, facts are facts: the economies of the republics of \nthe former Union, are on the brink of catastrophe. The drop in production by \nalmost a third, in Georgia's case, the lack of fuel and raw materials and the \ncatastrophic increases in prices for them, the loss of traditional suppliers \nand markets and imminent mass unemployment set a limit to democratic \ntransformations. \n\nI say to you most emphatically: the appalling economic crisis in the \nrepublics of the former Union will send shock waves throughout the world. If \nthis goes on, a social explosion of enormous force is inevitable. A change in \nvalues away from democracy to those of the power of the firm hand is \ninevitable. And for this the world will have a higher price to pay than it \nwould have to pay now. Let us think how we can prevent this, let us think \nwhat sort of system of reliable international economic insurance we can try to \nset up. \nIt is quite clear that this point must be taken into account in the \ninternational organizations, particularly the United Nations: it is difficult \nto talk about world economic stability and a single world zone of security if \nthe world's leading Powers do not take part. The Security Council absolutely \nmust exert real influence on the state of affairs. I used to come out against \nincreasing the number of permanent members. Now that the Soviet Union has \nfallen apart and the balance of power has shifted, we need to concern \nourselves with finding the best composition of permanent members to increase \nthe degree of effect that the Security Council can have on the world economic \nprocess, and not just on the economic process. The role of economic giants \nsuch as Germany and Japan will have to be rethought. \nI would mention in passing that the forecasts concerning certain \npretensions on the part of the United States of America to some kind of \nspecial role in the new circumstances that would allow it to impose its will \non the world have not proved to be accurate what I have in mind here is the \nprincipal, fundamental trend. The balanced foreign policy of this great \ncountry has not run counter to the interests of other States and, in the final \nanalysis, has helped maintain the balance in the interests of peace and \n\nstability. We would like to hope that the United States will go on being a \nguarantee of peace, order and equilibrium in the new, extremely complex \nconditions and in the process of building the new world order. \nThe United Nations cannot stand idly by when it comes to material support \nfor the new democracies. Here too we need rapid deployment forces, economic \nones this time. The United Nations is quite within its powers to coordinate \nthe activities of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other \nregional and international institutions more effectively and on a new basis in \norder to give fuller support for the success of the economic reforms in the \nnew States that have begun that most important process, the building of \ndemocratic societies. \nMy sixth suggestion is that we are quite simply obliged to introduce into \nthe body of international law an instrument concerning the personal \nresponsibility of individuals who incite mass disorders, political brutality, \nhostage-taking, terrorist acts or any kind of blockade, whether economic or \npolitical. Our troubled times have brought these people forth. The pygmies \nare in revolt against humankind. This has all happened before, but the world \nhas never before had to face a wave of \\\"Messiahs\\\" wanting to consolidate their \npower on the back of the sufferings of their own people on the scale it is \nfacing them now. Lilliputians tying down Gullivers that is the reality in \nmany countries, including my own. \nI now come to my seventh and last suggestion. Everything I have said so \nfar attests to the fact that our common responsibility for peace and security \nrequires us to harmonize and coordinate our common efforts in the political, \neconomic, military, financial and ecological fields. These fields should be \nmanaged on four interdependent and interrelated levels: the intra-State, \n\nthe regional, the supraregional and the worldwide. The first level will not \nbecome established unless our Organization manages to find ways to support the \nmaking of the new democratic States. The second will be possible if there is \nagreement on an identity or a proximity of interests on the part of the States \ninvolved in regional cooperation. Organizations such as the CSCE, the \nOrganization of African Unity, the Organization of American States and an \nalliance of the countries of the Black Sea basin could form the basis for the \nthird level. The fourth level involves establishing a coordinating system for \ninteractions on a world scale, in which the principal coordinator would be the \nUnited Nations and its institutions. \nThis rostrum has always seemed very high to me. I used to feel how high \nit was even when the the world was ready to hang on the every word of the \nrepresentative of a huge and mighty Power, whatever that word might be. That \nis the privilege of the powerful, but I did use to try to make our words sound \nlike a message of good will rather than of malign force. Now that I am \nspeaking on behalf of a small and weak country, I feel how much higher this \nrostrum has grown and what a lifeline it is for my homeland. \nThere was a considerable element of risk involved in my present ascent of \nthis rostrum: things are very bad indeed back home. The bombshells of hatred \nare exploding all too often there. Those shells are aimed to destroy our \npolicy of democratically establishing and constructing an honest, just State \nopen to the world. Such explosions are all the more likely today, in the \nrun-up to parliamentary elections in which the people of the Republic of \nGeorgia must either endorse or reject our policy of democracy and freedom. \nNevertheless, I have come so that Georgia does not lose what is now its \nonly chance to tell the world about its hopes and aspirations, to confirm the \n\ntruth and refute the lie. I have come so that I can once again reaffirm my \ncommitment to the word we gave the world community. What of it that the scale \nhas diminished and the horizons have closed in? I am thinking, speaking and \nacting in accordance with the same principles and norms I have stood up for \nhere for all these years past. \nFinally and this will be my last personal confession I have missed \nyour company very, very much. \nI have gone over the time-limit, but the way things are is that the \nsmaller the size and scale of a State, the more time it needs. \nI thank you for hearing me out. \n"

        "file_text": "I should \nlike my first words in this great forum of the world Organization to be an \nexpression of our great pleasure at the unanimous decision of the Assembly \nthat you. Sir, should be the one to guide and direct its important work at the \nforty-seventh session. Your brilliant record, your undeniable personal \nprestige, your dedication to the ideals that inspire our Organization and the \nfact that you come from a part of the world where impressive positive changes \nare taking place are all signs that the United Nations, with determination and \nenthusiasm, is in step with the great phenomenon of our era: the \nreaffirmation of freedom as the driving force of history. \nWe also recognize the splendid job done by your predecessor. \nAmbassador Samir Shihabi, who carried out his delicate task during a period of \nimportant national challenges which our Organization met with determination \nand with a sense of service. \nThe presence of a new Secretary-General has given the period since the \nlast session of the General Assembly a very special significance. This is an \nexcellent opportunity to express again to the world our profound appreciation \n\nto the former Secretary-General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, not only because of \nthe fine overall task he accomplished but more specifically because of his \nselflessness and his effective participation in achieving the final peace \nagreement in El Salvador, which he, his representatives and associates worked \ntowards with such effort and conviction. We are also moved when we recall how \nthat agreement was reached at the last minute of the Secretary-General's \nmandate, and therewith the peace of El Salvador was linked with the name of an \nillustrious Latin American of universal stature. \nWhen the new Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, assumed his \nfunctions, we immediately realized that his unequivocal intention would be to \ncontinue to support, with his characteristic wisdom and experience, the \ndifficult and exemplary process in which we Salvadorans are involved. This \nencourages us to remain faithful to past commitments and to believe that the \nnew dynamics in El Salvador are irreversible, provided that we have the \nsupport of the international community. \nOn a number of occasions, and specifically in our message of \n16 January 1992 during the signing ceremony in Chapultepec, Mexico, we have \nsaid that peace in El Salvador is not just a matter of restoring normal \nconditions - those that prevailed before the conflict but of establishing \npeace of a new kind, unprecedented in our country. Besides being a civilized \nway of ending armed confrontation, peace is a complex series of commitments \naimed at consolidating democracy in El Salvador. It is a means of providing \nmore opportunities for pluralist participation, a way to create \nsocio-political conditions for stability based on democratic legality among \nall existing sectors and groups of society. \n \nThis agreement, termed by the United Nations a unique agreement, is being \nimplemented with the close cooperation of El Salvador and the international \ncommunity. Conditions specific to that country, together with world events \nand in particular the end of the cold war, made it possible to conclude the \nconflict in El Salvador in a satisfactory manner. And at this point we should \nlike to stress an issue that is of supreme importance: the subject of \ndemocracy. \nWe have no doubt whatsoever that it has been the existence of the \ndemocratic process in our country that has made it possible for the war to \ngradually lose its historic vigour. It also made it possible to arrive at a \nkind of solution that appears to be permanent, one that will permit the \nbuilding of peace, which is of course a long-term effort. The peace agreement \nis sound and convincing to the Salvadorian people and to the entire world as \nwell, because it empowers and expands democracy. We would repeat here in this \ngreat forum, as we have done on the three earlier occasions on which we had \nthe privilege of speaking the truth as we see it from this rostrum, that our \nmain challenge and our most significant task is to serve the gradual \ndemocratization of El Salvador. In this manner we hope to contribute to \nsecurity, internal progress and the stability of Central America. \nOur country has made major sacrifices and efforts to establish and \nsafeguard the democratic process. Our Government - and we say this with \nlegitimate satisfaction - has contributed boldly and relentlessly to the \nconsolidation of democracy in El Salvador. We will not waver even for a \nmoment, as we have recently demonstrated, in ensuring that this process moves \nforward in the future for the benefit of an entire population that has, as a \n\nresult of great suffering, earned a stable peace, secure development and a \nbetter future. \nOur country's institutions have contributed greatly to all of these \nefforts, but we should like to emphasize that two in particular have given us \ntheir determined support: our political institution, the Nationalist \nRepublican Alliance, and the armed forces of El Salvador. They have given us, \nand continue to do so, fundamental support in ensuring that democracy in El \nSalvador becomes a reality and peace a concrete fact. We shall not tire of \nsaying that the people of El Salvador are the major protagonists in this new \nand historic stage. All of us are involved in building an integrated society, \none that can jointly settle its differences and realize its aspirations. In \norder to achieve this, peace must be the first priority. Without a stable \npeace, freedoms could become fragile and progress uncertain. \nWe consider it essential that this process be carried out in accordance \nwith the terms of the peace agreement. Significant progress has been made in \nimplementing the corresponding commitments, starting on 16 January. Many \ndifficulties have arisen technical, logistical, financial and \npolitical but, with the efficient support of the United Nations, we are now \nin a position to conclude the crucial stage of the cessation of armed \nconfrontation on 31 October as scheduled. \nOn this solemn occasion we appeal to the international community \nrepresented here, hoping that they will support our decision and our \ndetermination to scrupulously respect this deadline. At that point, the \nmilitary structure of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) \nwill come to an end, because the Government has been fulfilling its various \n\npolitical and constitutional commitments and will continue to do so in a \nserious and responsible manner. We should like to move to another important \nstage of the process, in which political freedom will determine the rate of \nprogress in our country, in all walks of life. \n\nOur peace process, because of it\u00ac\u00b4 characteristics and its potential, \nstands as an example for others to follow. We are extremely pleased that in \nEl Salvador unprecedented events of great importance are taking place. The \nrole and performance of the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador \n(ONUSAL) is one of those phenomena, and it is in keeping with the new role \nthat falls to the United Nations in the post-cold-war period. \nIn this connection, we fully support the concepts contained in the report \nof the Secretary-General prepared in keeping with the statement agreed upon on \n31 January of this year at the summit meeting of the Security Council. That \ndocument, entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", reflects the experience accumulated \nby the Organization in the area of preventive diplomacy and the establishment, \nmaintenance and consolidation of peace. That experience is now guiding the \nOrganization. The case of El Salvador is one of the clearest and most \npersuasive examples of the fact that our Organization is fulfilling the \nresponsibilities required of it by the events and dynamics of the times, and \nit is doing so efficiently and opportunely within this new, increasingly \ninterlinked world where there is a growing sense of globalism. \nIn this connection, we emphasize that there is a strong trend not only \ntowards economic globalism but also towards democratization and the \nsafeguarding of peace throughout the world. Today no one is immune to the \nconflicts that used to be called peripheral. The distortions that existed \nuntil not so long ago, due to the permanent tension reigning in an \nideologically bipolar world, have given way to a much more realistic, \nhumanitarian approach to the world's problems: understanding the world as an \nintegrated zone of peace where even the most local conflict is now a concern \nof the international community, which is speedily developing the ways and \n\nmeans of creating effective cooperation in peacemaking efforts, without \nresorting to the barbarism of intervention or the arrogance of unilateral \noperations. The concept of the international policeman is, fortunately, being \nreplaced by something much more modern and constructive: joint agreement to \nface acute crises that jeopardize international peace and stability. \nThis brings us back to the concept of democracy, which is the key topic \nof our time. In this regard, we fully associate ourselves with the remarks of \nthe Secretary-General in his aforementioned report: \n\\\"Democracy within the family of nations means the application of its \nprinciples within the world Organization itself. This requires the \nfullest consultation, participation and engagement of all States, large \nand small, in the work of the Organization. All organs of the United \nNations must be accorded, and play, their full and proper role so that \nthe trust of all nations and peoples will be retained and deserved. The \nprinciples of the Charter must be applied consistently, not selectively, \nfor if the perception should be of the latter, trust will wane and with \nit the moral authority which is the greatest and most unique quality of \nthat instrument. Democracy at all levels is essential to attain peace \nfor a new era of prosperity and justice.\\\" (A/47/277, para. 82) \nWe Salvadorians, immersed as we are in a process of radical, conscious \ntransformation of our society, make an unequivocal declaration of trust in the \nUnited Nations by placing in its hands the vital task of verifying all peace \nagreements. It is no exaggeration to say that few countries have placed such \nconfidence in the Organization. This shows our great desire for peace and \ndemocracy, and at the same time it makes both us and the Organization \nresponsible. In other words, in the process in El Salvador we are all gaining \n\nvaluable experience, and we have no doubt that our original approach to \novercoming conflict and seeing to it that the solution serves as a political \nand social platform for the future makes this one of the most important \nlandmarks in the process of transition that is taking place in the \ninternational community today. \nSalvadorians cannot afford to vacillate, nor can we be found wanting in \nthis great effort to heal our country of the deep-rooted bad habits of the \npast and of the ravages of war. This commitment to our own history is also in \nkeeping with the spirit of our times, to which we feel so closely linked. The \nfact that we are so involved in building a new national reality that goes much \ndeeper than an ideological revolution for it pragmatically recognizes change \nand dynamism as the driving force behind social and political life - does not \ninhibit us but, on the contrary, connects us to a world that is in a \nsurprising process of renewal. We are only now emerging from a paralysing \nperiod of confrontation, so we do not yet know what policies and doctrines \nwill prevail in the future. But we do know that concepts such as political \nfreedom, social pluralism, market economics and international cooperation are \nall in the forefront of people's thinking and action throughout most of the \nworld. After so many years of rhetorical preaching, today there are for the \nfirst time sound indications that a genuine international community is being \nforged - and this fills us with optimism and a sense of security. \nThat optimism and security do not prevent us from expressing our concerns \nregarding the problems remaining with us, perhaps even more dramatically than \nbefore, such as the deterioration of economic and social conditions which \ncontinue to exist in the developing countries and the catastrophic situation \nas regards the environment, which is threatening the very survival of mankind \n\non Earth. The existence of such problems is not limited to just a few \ncountries or just one region rather than others. As in the case of peace and \ndemocracy, these are global issues, and for that reason this forum must deal \nwith them as matters of priority. It is no longer the nuclear nightmare that \nfrightens us, but rather the dying of nature, which we have mercilessly \nabused, even to the point of endangering our own species. No longer is it the \npower of the super-Powers that is such a threat to mankind's survival; it is \nthe ancient scourge of poverty that continues to erode the foundations of our \ncivilization, whose great and unshirkable task is now to protect the dignity \nof all human beings without distinction as to race, culture or geographic \nlocation. \nThe United Nations today, thanks to the emerging new world order, has a \nresponsibility to integrate the world, something that was unimaginable only a \nshort time ago. We believe that at this session, which is the first one truly \ntaking place in a post-cold-war atmosphere, the Assembly must make renewed, \nimaginative efforts to overcome existing stereotypes in a world that became \naccustomed to functioning as a kind of battlefield. If we could graphically \ndescribe the international reality that should prevail in our day, we would \nimagine all the nations of the world sitting around a table discussing, on an \nequal footing, the problems that inevitably affect us all. The era of trench \nwarfare and walls is now behind us, much to the dismay of the skeptics and to \nthe delight of those who never really ceased to believe in the possibility of \na better world with freedom and democracy. Incredible though it may seem, we \nare entering an era in which peace is no longer just a fine word with no real \nmeaning. \n\nEl Salvador is a small country, but it is a small, great country that \ndoes not want to deprive itself of the great opportunity provided by peace. \nThat applies to ourselves, to our neighbours, to our natural cultural \ncommunity and to the world. Thus, we give priority to respect for human \nrights; we are trying to organize our economy; we have definitively renounced \nwar as a means of dealing with internal or international problems. For that \nreason, we are here, calling on the economically most powerful nations to \nrenew with actions their generous commitment to collaborate in the costly \nprocess of peace in El Salvador so that it will not be thwarted by lack of \nfinancial resources. The flow of external assistance to carry out the \nconcrete agenda of bringing about peace is at a critical stage. That is why, \nfrom this rostrum, we renew our appeal for international solidarity to \ncontribute to consolidating peace without obstacles in El Salvador. \n\nWhile the process is moving ahead in our country, and we are committed to \nits doing so fully and consistently, regional developments are no less \npromising. As a result of a decision of the International Court of Justice, \nwe have just settled an old dispute with the fraternal Republic of Honduras, \nand we renew our unequivocal commitment to abide in good faith by that \ndecision. At the same time, we continue striving to promote regional \nintegration, especially with our Central American brothers. We believe in the \ncommon destiny of Central America, and for that reason we are working in a \ncoordinated way to see to it that our region will be a zone of lasting \ndemocracy, progress and stability. We believe more and more in the real \npossibility of achieving a united Central America in which every country, \nwithout losing its identity, develops its own potential. It is a great task \nof the present with tremendous implications for the future. \nWe feel that we are members of the Iberian-American community of nations, \nwhich, though it does not yet exist officially, is becoming a reality in \nspirit and in the common aim of giving it shape. We have felt the beneficial \neffects of solidarity among nations that share the same language and culture. \nWe have received and continue to receive enormous support from countries such \nas Mexico, Spain, Venezuela and Colombia, the \\\"Group of Four Friends\\\", whose \ncontribution to achieving and consolidating peace is a shining page in our \nhistory. We reiterate our appreciation to them and to other friendly \ncountries that have helped us in the great task of making El Salvador a new \ncountry. \nWe express once again our conviction that the United Nations, now more \nthan ever, has a mission for the future. On its agenda two matters are at the \nforefront: global peace and sustainable international development. We are \n\nconvinced that the United Nations, faced with those issues, will prove to be \nwhat President Bush said two days ago in this forum it would be: an \nOrganization of truly united nations, for the first time since it was founded. \nWe are especially pleased to welcome the new States that have joined this \ngreat family of the United Nations. Their presence, which enhances the status \nof the Organization, is due largely to the great freedom movement that has \nmarked our time. We favour the principle of universality, meaning that all \nthe countries of the world, without exception, must be present in our \nOrganization and must contribute. Thus we offer our support to help ensure \nthat all pending cases and those that might emerge in the future will be \nresolved positively. \nEl Salvador has devoted all its energies to the peace process, towards \nwhose success the United Nations is making such a decisive, efficient \ncontribution. We will not waver for a moment in promoting that process, which \nis a matter of rebuilding the country and setting an example to the rest of \nthe world. Those of us who have been on the side of freedom and democracy all \nalong have been proved right by time. But that triumph is not ours; it \nbelongs to the peoples of the world who have already suffered too much not to \nsee, and soon, the fruits of progress, which are the only guarantees of \ninternal stability and peace among nations. \n"

        "file_text": "The forty-seventh session of the General Assembly \nis being held at a particularly crucial moment, when our Organization will be \ncalled upon to demonstrate innovative thinking and flexibility in the face of \nthe emerging challenges. \nAgainst the background of the very important agenda that is before us, \nlet me congratulate Mr. Ganev on his unanimous election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its forty-seventh session. I am confident that his \nprofessional competence and dynamism make him uniquely qualified to preside \nover the Assembly. I wish to assure him of my delegation's full support in \ncarrying out his formidable task to a successful completion. \nLet me also extend our heartfelt appreciation to his predecessor. \nAmbassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, for the exemplary manner in which he \nconducted the deliberations of the forty-sixth session. \nPermit me, on behalf of the Government of the Gambia and on my own \nbehalf, to express our heartfelt congratulations to the new Secretary-General, \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whom I have had the honour and privilege of knowing \nfor many years. As a distinguished scholar, an outstanding diplomat and a \nperson of exceptional character, Mr. Boutros Boutro-Ghali has in him those \nvery fine qualities of leadership that our Organization needs at this very \ncrucial period of its history. We in Africa are indeed honoured to have one \nof our illustrious sons serve in this highly prestigious and important \n \nposition. I am confident, and I am sure I am speaking for Africa and for all \nthose who know Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, that he will live up to the very \nhigh expectations we all have of him. His long and distinguished career in \nthe service of his country gives us reason for this trust. \nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to \nhis worthy predecessor, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who during his tenure of \noffice contributed greatly to the strengthening of the United Nations, \nallowing it to assume a lead role in promoting world peace and security. His \nindefatigable efforts in pursuit of an atmosphere of understanding for the \nsolution of problems in different parts of the world are exemplary and deserve \nour very deep appreciation. I wish him a happy retirement. \nThe Gambia notes with great pleasure the admission of the Republics of \nBelarus, San Marino, Croatia, Slovenia, Uzbekistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \nKyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan as new Members of the United Nations. I should \nlike to welcome them and congratulate them on their accession to full \nmembership of the United Nations. As they take their place in this comity of \nnations, it behoves each of us to extend to them the hand of friendship and \nsupport that characterizes this great Organization. \nAs we reflect on the activities of our Organization during the past \n12 months, we are encouraged by the numerous actions and decisions that have \nbeen taken in support of world peace and progress. Certainly, problems \ncontinue to exist, and in some cases have increased in intensity and \ncomplexity, but the full commitment of our Organization to resolving them \nremains ever strong. \nOther less conflictual but none the less important issues of concern to \nhumanity have also received attention. I would like, in this respect, to \nrefer to the historic Earth Summit, convened in Rio de Janeiro in June this \n\nyear. This meeting, which brought together leaders from all over the world, \nmarks the first major step taken by humanity to reflect upon and map out a \nstrategy for the survival of all species on Earth. It marks the beginning of \na more responsible attitude to the Earth and its resources. The Rio \nDeclaration, the Agenda 21 programmes and the Conventions on climate change \nand bio-diversity all combine to lay the basis for a sustainable development. \nWe fully support the recommendations of the Conference and do hope that \nthe various programmes of Agenda 21 will receive adequate support and \nfinancing to ensure their successful implementation. Of special interest to \nour countries is the recommendation to set up an intergovernmental negotiating \ncommittee to negotiate a convention on drought and desertification. We \nstrongly urge the Assembly at this session to take the appropriate measures to \nallow the committee to commence its work as soon as possible. \nThis century has witnessed two world wars, which brought untold hardship \nand suffering to mankind. The creation of the United Nations immediately \nafter the Second World War reflected the determination of the founding fathers \nto spare future generations the scourge of war. We all know the story of what \nfollowed. The cold war, with its debilitating effects on the capacity of the \nUnited Nations, as well as the consequences of the destructive conflicts it \nengendered, demonstrated the extent to which our dreams and hopes became a \nnightmare. Today, mankind has been given an opportunity again to develop and \nanchor peace and stability in this world. The current entente in the \ninternational scene and the positive disposition of all nations vis-a-vis the \nUnited Nations provide a valuable opportunity for our Organization to assume a \nmore forceful role in pursuit of world peace and stability. For it is only in \npeace and stability that human development can progress satisfactorily. We \n\nare very much encouraged by the important role the United Nations has recently \nassumed, and would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the \nSecretary-General for convening the Security Council summit meeting, which \nsought, among other things to promote greater understanding and cooperation \nin the world. We are in full support of the new approach to conflict \nresolution referred to as preventive diplomacy. \nPeace and security in the world will remain elusive as long as we \ncontinue to have centres of armed conflict that risk degenerating into \nregional conflicts that threaten world peace and stability. The situation in \nSomalia, the former Yugoslavia and other trouble spots around the world \nconstitute an important threat to world peace and stability. We will need the \ncollective resources and determination of the United Nations and all its \nMember States to resolve these conflicts. \n\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina has deteriorated very seriously. \nThe summary execution of civilian members of the non-Serbian population and \nthe internment in concentration camps of thousands of people testify to gross \nhuman-rights abuses. The Gambia joins other nations in strongly condemning \nthe perpetrators of these acts. We also condemn in no uncertain terms the \nconcept of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", which in every respect is reminiscent of Nazi \npractices. It is totally unacceptable in this day and age to torture, kill or \nsend into exile innocent men, women and children because of their religious \nbeliefs. We will all be guilty if we stand by and see these atrocities being \nperpetrated with impunity. \nWe fully appreciate and commend the bold efforts of the United Nations \nand the European Community in their search for peace in the former \nYugoslavia. We salute the courage of all those taking part in humanitarian \nrelief missions, particularly the soldiers who risk their lives to ensure that \nfood and other relief items reach Bosnia and Herzegovina. We strongly believe \nthat unless the fundamental cause of the conflict is addressed, the tragedy \nwill continue. Serbian aggression against Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina \nmust be stopped. \nWe join the international community in calling on the United Nations to \nact firmly by implementing effectively the relevant Security Council \nresolutions on Yugoslavia, particularly resolution 757 (1992). The decision \nof the General Assembly to deny Serbia and Montenegro the seat of the former \nYugoslavia, as contained in resolution 47/1 of 22 September 1992, is a step in \nthe right direction. We believe the United Nations should not hesitate to use \nforce to stop Serbian aggression, in conformity with the provisions of \nArticle 42 of the United Nations Charter. In the meantime, the creation of an \n\nair corridor to protect relief supplies and innocent civilians from aerial \nbombardment would provide a useful respite in a desperate situation. \nThe Gambia shares the concern of the international community over the \nlack of progress in finding a lasting solution to the conflict in Somalia. \nThe scale of human tragedy remains a constant reminder of the horrors and \nabsurdities of war. We fully endorse the urgent and effective implementation \nof Security Council resolution 767 (1992), which calls for the cessation of \nhostilities, national reconciliation and unity in Somalia and the opening up \nof the country to humanitarian assistance. \nMy delegation praises the laudable efforts of the United Nations, the \nUnited States of America and relief agencies for the assistance they are \nproviding to the starving population of Somalia. We want to appeal to all \nthose who exercise some influence over the various warring factions to use \ntheir influence now in support of Security Council resolution 767 (1992). \nWithout peace the humanitarian assistance will continue but so will the human \ntragedy. \nOn the question of Liberia, the Economic Community of West African States \n(ECOWAS) continues to grapple with the problem of effective implementation of \nthe Yamoussoukro IV accord in order to bring about lasting peace in Liberia \nand to arrest the growth of destabilizing forces in the subregion. We \ncontinue to appeal to all the parties concerned, in particular the leadership \nof the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, to adhere to the provisions of the \nYamoussoukro IV accord as further elaborated at Geneva in April this year. We \nmake a strong appeal to the United Nations and the international community to \ngive full support to the efforts of ECOWAS to bring about peace and stability \nin Liberia. \n \nWith reference to South Africa, it is disappointing to note that the \neuphoria and optimism that greeted the release of Nelson Mandela and other \nprisoners have failed to materialize into a free, democratic and non-racial \nSouth Africa. The suspension of the talks in the framework of the Convention \nfor a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) and the continued acts of violence and \nsenseless killings, as highlighted in Boipatong township in June and in Ciskei \nin September, call into question the commitment of the South African \nGovernment. We would like to state again that the South African Government \nbears a major responsibility for these acts of lawlessness. It will have to \ndemonstrate greater responsibility in ensuring the security of all South \nAfricans. It is time to turn this tragic page and allow discussions that will \nbring peace, stability and progress to South Africa. We appeal to all the \nparties to assist in this process. \nWe are following with keen interest the developments in the Middle East \npeace process which started in Madrid almost a year ago. We sincerely hope \nthat the opportunity provided by that process will be taken up by all the \nparties to ensure that the region, which has been denied peace for so long, \nwill ultimately enjoy a comprehensive and lasting peace on the basis of \nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). \nThe world has yet to become the haven of peace and stability we so \nearnestly work for. The conflicts in Cambodia, Afghanistan and some of the \nrecently independent republics of the former Soviet Union reflect the very \ndifficult moments of transition. We are confident that with the full support \nof the international community these difficulties will be overcome. \nAnother danger to world stability is poverty and lack of economic \ndevelopment. The developing countries continue to be saddled with overriding \n \ndebt, low commodity prices and sluggish if not stagnant economies. Nowhere is \nthe situation more bleak and desperate as in Africa, where the cumulative debt \nstands at around $27 2 billion, the approximate equivalent of 90 per cent of \nthe continent's gross national product. Debt-service obligations require \nabout $25 billion annually, representing 30 per cent of the continent's export \nearnings. Failure to effect timely payments has led to increases in interest \npayments, at the rate of over $1 billion a year. \nI believe those figures are an eloquent testimony to the plight of Africa \ntoday. The rest of the world must not remain insensitive to that plight. The \nadoption at the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly of a new agenda \nfor the development of Africa in the 1990s has helped focus attention once \nagain on Africa's critical economic situation. We will need, however, to go \nbeyond words. In this connection I wish to echo the Secretary-General's \nproposals for the cancellation of all official bilateral debts, the \ncancellation of other semi-official debts such as export credits, and the \nsubstantial reduction of debts owed to multilateral financial institutions, \nwhich now account for 40 per cent of sub-Saharan debt servicing. \nIt is regrettable to note that these proposals, considered more \nfavourable to Africa than the Trinidad terms, have not yet received positive \nand widespread acceptance from Africa's development partners. Africa, like \nother developing regions, will require a substantial inflow of capital and \ntechnology and access to international markets if the global partnership is to \nhave any meaning for us. \n\nThe Gambia shares with the rest of Africa this very heavy financial \nburden, in spite of her efforts at economic recovery. In fact, the Gambia has \nsuccessfully undertaken an economic recovery programme, and has since \n1991 started a programme for sustained development. The main policy \norientation of the programme for sustained development is the pursuit of \ncontinuous adjustment with growth, with the objective of achieving economic \ndevelopment in a liberalized market environment. This will allow mobilization \nof the resources of the private sector to provide the investment that will \ngenerate sustained economic growth and expansion. By expanding the productive \ncapacity of the economy, we hope to be able to support a significant \nimprovement in the living standards of Gambians. \nThe attainment of economic growth requires a favourable external \nenvironment. Secondly, a conducive international economic and financial \nenvironment will help resolve the international debt crisis, restore adequate \ncapital flows and create a more open world trading system, which will result \nin sustained economic expansion and enhance private and public spending on \nhuman development. We fully appreciate the very valuable assistance being \ngiven by the United Nations, the international financial institutions and \nfriendly countries. However, there is a need for continued external \nassistance in support of our development efforts. In this regard, we \nfervently hope that the donors' conference for the Gambia, to be held in \nGeneva on 13 and 14 October 1992, will be as successful as previous ones. \nToday we are witnessing the emergence of a new world order grounded in \nthe principles of respect for human rights, political pluralism and \nself-determination. This new world order, which is still unfolding, marks the \nend of the cold war and the beginning of a strengthened role for the United \nNations. \n\nIn Africa, marching side by side with the economic problems has been the \ndesire for greater democratization and liberalization of political attitudes, \nsystems and dogmas. In the face of this new socio-political revolution, the \nGambia has consistently maintained its practice of the rule of law, and \nadherence to parliamentary democracy, as exemplified by its successful and \nregular conduct of free and fair elections since the attainment of \nindependence in 1965. \nUnder the wise and distinguished leadership of \nAlhaji Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara, the Gambia continues to advocate the \npromotion of, and adherence to human rights practices all over the world. The \nGambia therefore welcomes the holding of the World Conference on Human Rights \nin 1993. That Conference will not only afford all peace-loving people, \nnations and institutions the opportunity to express their concern on human \nrights issues, but will also serve as a means for the objective evaluation of \nthe world's human rights records and practices and an opportunity for us to \nrededicate ourselves to the achievement of higher standards of human rights \npractices throughout the world. \nIn full recognition of the universal application of human rights and \ndemocracy, my delegation is pleased to note the implementation of General \nAssembly resolution 45/164, which proclaimed 1993 the International Year for \nthe World's Indigenous People. This proclamation will further strengthen \ninternational cooperation in seeking solutions to the problems confronting \nindigenous communities in the areas of human rights, the environment, \ndevelopment, education, and health, and we regard it as a first step towards \nmobilizing greater international support and assistance for the \nself-development of indigenous peoples and their communities. \n \nThe United Nations is particularly well placed to focus attention on \nmajor issues of concern to humankind. Of special interest to us today is the \nwelfare of children, which was brought to the forefront by the World Summit \nfor Children. The Gambia pledges to continue to formulate plans, programmes \nand laws to safeguard the rights and interests of children and women, who, \neffectively, constitute the most important and productive category of our \npopulation. \nThe Government of the Gambia fully supports the convening of the \nforthcoming international conference on assistance to African children, \nscheduled to take place in Dakar, Senegal from 25 to 27 November 1992. We \nstrongly urge the international community to lend support to that conference. \nMobilizing African and international support for the global goals for children \nin the 1990s is one of the biggest challenges we now face as a world \ncommunity. Together we can make the conference a significant step in the \nprocess towards achieving the goals of the World Summit. \nAnother major issue of global concern today is the question of AIDS and \nHIV infections, which, in the last few years, have grown into a global \npandemic with no effective cure as yet. It has been estimated that, by the \nend of this century, 40 million people will have been affected by the virus \nand more than 10 million children will have become orphans. This is indeed a \ngloomy prediction. The situation therefore calls for greater and more \nsustained efforts in combating the AIDS pandemic. It calls for collective \nglobal responsibility based on learning from, sharing with, and giving \nassistance to each other. \nMy delegation realizes that the United Nations will be increasingly \ncalled upon to undertake many more responsibilities in a world that is rapidly \n\nchanging. If it is to succeed in handling the growing complexities of today, \nthen it must be adequately structured to respond to the emerging challenges. \nThe Gambia has followed with keen interest the deliberations of the \nsubstantive session of the Economic and Social Council in July 1992, and the \nefforts to restructure the Council. Indeed, these efforts are part of the \nlarger and wider process of restructuring the United Nations system initiated \nby the Secretary-General. \nThe Gambia welcomes the creation of the Department of Humanitarian \nAffairs under the dynamic leadership of Jan Eliasson as \nUnder-Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator. The creation of \nthis Department is not only timely but crucial, given its role of providing \nrelief and solace to the millions of needy people all over the world, \nespecially in areas suffering from armed conflict, poverty, population \npressures, environmental degradation and human rights violations, in keeping \nwith the provisions and spirit of General Assembly resolution 46/182. \nIt is also gratifying to note that some of the recommendations of the \nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development on the establishment \nof a Commission for Sustainable Development and issues relating to the global \nenvironment facility were considered and approved by the Economic and Social \nCouncil. The addition of the high-level-segment debate in the plenary session \nof the Council and the dialogue between participants that accompanied it is \nalso welcome. \n\nWe in Africa continue to support General Assembly resolution 32/197, \nwhich calls for structural, administrative and financial reforms of the United \nNations system, particularly the strengthening of policy-making at the level \nof the General Assembly in the economic, social and other related fields. As \nwe begin the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly, our minds are \nstill fresh with some of the relevant and important recommendations of the \nEconomic and Social Council on the economic and social issues which affect the \nworld and demand urgent attention. \nWe are at an exciting junction of history. The positive changes we have \nwitnessed in global political and economic trends are a clear manifestation of \nmankind's desire for a progressive world and a better future. However, the \ngoals of global peace, security and progress will continue to elude us if \npoverty, human rights violations and economic disparity, which are at the root \nof many conflicts, continue to characterize our world. The United Nations has \na special role to play in combatting these evils. The Gambia remains fully \ncommitted to joining hands with all nations to support the United Nations in \nits crusade for a happier, more stable and prosperous world. \n"

        "file_text": "I wish \nto congratulate Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at this session. He can be sure of the cooperation of the Cuban \ndelegation. \nWe shall soon be commemorating the five hundredth anniversary of the clash \nbetween two worlds and the beginning of an era that was to transform radically \nrelations between nations. That dramatic and as yet unfinished piece of \nhistory started in the Caribbean Sea and forever left its mark upon the fate \nof the peoples of the area. \nOur deepest root, which gave us life as a nation and a place in history, \nis our rebelliousness. For centuries the Caribbean was the victim of the \nbrutal greed of all sorts of intruders, the crossroads of slave-traders and \npirates, of traffickers and invaders; violence and cruelty were its constant \nscourges. But it was also witness to the heroic resistance of its peoples, \nwhich time and again rose up, pushed by the powerful and anonymous force of \nthe Caribbean winds, in their eagerness to achieve their freedom. While the \nplundering of its resources and the iniquitous exploitation of its people led \nthe Caribbean to its encounter with the rest of the world, it was the struggle \nto abolish all kinds of servitude and to have no master other than our own \nconscience, which shaped our profound and irreducible identity and allowed us \nto discover ourselves. \nThe Assembly is meeting at a crucial moment of definition. Today, as \nfive centuries ago, we are faced with attempts to reshape the world and \nreorder relations between nations. Today, as in the past, the idea is to \ndetermine whether the future will allow human solidarity to flourish or \nwhether it will still be weighed down by selfishness; whether it will one day \nlead to the emancipation of the dispossessed, or whether it will for ever \nperpetuate their tragedy; whether we are on the verge of a new colonizing \nadventure, or whether, at long last, hope will begin to emerge for the poor of \nthis Earth. \nIn recent years humanity has been surprised by a series of developments \nwhich have radically changed important elements of international relations and \nhave led to an avalanche of hasty interpretations and conclusions promoted by \nthe unrestrained haste of the privileged and the naive optimism of many others. \nThe end of the cold war, and with it the lessening of the danger of a \nnuclear holocaust, should not be used to attempt to conceal what everyone \nknows. It is true that military confrontation between the super-Powers \nwhich threatened mankind with extermination never happened, and that the \nrancorous antagonism of yesteryear was transformed through the unilateral \nincantation of a baffling kind of alchemy into complacent subordination and a \nshow of fondness. That that war never occurred is of course salutary and \ndeserving of praise, but to identify with that fact the emergence of universal \npeace is an absurdity which can make sense only from the profoundly racist \nperspective of the new conquerors. \nThe period which now seems to be coming to an end was for the third world \na period of hard-fought struggles for independence and freedom. While \nthreatening with a battle which never occurred, imperialists used \nall their means and resources to invade, attack, repress and oppress the \npeoples of the South; many of their sons and daughters fell in confrontations \nwhich had nothing to do with the rivalries between the powerful, and they died \nwithout knowing how that antagonism was to be transmuted into a bizarre \nconvergence. \nJust as the existence of the cold war did not alter the fate of the \nthird world, its disappearance does not, so far, seem to be benefiting its \npeoples. The previous balance of power that contained the opposing blocs and \navoided a direct military conflict between them did not prevent the practice \nof war, aggression and intervention against the third world. \nWe have no reason to imagine that the effects of the present conditions \nof unipolarity and hegemonism will be more favourable to our peoples. On the \ncontrary, dangers are greater than ever in the face of a triumphant ecstasy on \nthe part of those who are in possession not only of the largest military power \nbut also of an insurmountable historical ignorance and the most gross moral \ncallousness. \nThe cold war is disappearing, but the arms race is not being reduced in \nparallel, nor are militarism and bellicose mentalities being abandoned. If \nthe danger of war has been reduced, why does the United States aspire to \ncontinue developing its military superiority, as was recently announced by the \noccupant of the White House? Against whom will the empire now direct its \nweapons? \nWe hear unending rhetoric about the end of confrontation and the \nbeginning of a new era of international cooperation, but it seems to exist \nonly in the imagination of those so gullible as to believe it. If a spirit of \ninternational cooperation does really exist and if the cold war has ended, why \nare the military expenditures of the big Powers not being drastically reduced \nand why are the resources thus released not being channelled to the promotion \nof development in underdeveloped countries? How can it be explained that \nnow precisely now attempts are being made to reduce international \ncooperation for development to an even more subordinate and hypothetical role, \nfurther to diminish the already limited presence of the United Nations in that \nfield and also to introduce unacceptable conditionalities and restrictions? \nThe changes that have occurred between the countries of the North have \nno meaning for the majority of the inhabitants of the planet. If those \nchanges are to make some sense for them, it is necessary to undertake decisive \nand effective action against the hunger and poverty which affect hundreds of \nmillions of people in the third world; and against infant malnutrition and \nincurable diseases which are daily taking the lives of thousands of children \nin an ongoing and silent war that some choose to ignore. \nThe economic crisis, the external debt of the third world, which has \nrisen to the figure of $1.50 trillion, unequal exchange, and increased hunger \nand poverty have never been greater amongst the immense majority of mankind. \nTheir effects are staggering even for the most solid economies of the world. \nOpen subsidies and other selfish policies threaten to impede the conclusion of \nagreements which have been in course of negotiation for years to regulate \ninternational trade and which may provoke disastrous confrontations between \nthe large economic Powers. This clearly demonstrates that the history of \ncapitalism cannot escape its terrible and self-destructive laws. \nThere is meagre cause for optimism at present, when many cannot even \ndefy the consequences of recalling the principles of the new international \neconomic order solemnly proclaimed by the Assembly in times that were \nsupposedly less favourable for international cooperation. \nTrue, universal and durable peace will be possible only in a world full \nof hegemony, based on the rights, interests and aspirations of all peoples, in \na world in which the purposes and principles of the San Francisco Charter will \nbecome a reality and, in particular, in a world which pays full respect to the \nsovereign equality of States, non-intervention and non-interference in the \ninternal affairs of States, self-determination of peoples, and the right to \ndevelopment. \nBut to achieve this, it is indispensable to democratize international \nrelations and the United Nations, providing the Organization with the \nconditions necessary for it to fulfil the mission for which it should exist. \nThe United Nations cannot be reduced to a simple instrument of \ndomination by the powerful. Member States must prevent that; if they do not \nthey would in practice be permitting its termination and the elimination of \nall possibility of achieving an equitable and peaceful world. \nWe must not accept the Security Council's operating as a secret society, \nturning its back on the Organization which created it and in whose name it \nshould be acting; we must not accept its assuming functions which it does not \nhave and which no one has conferred upon it. The Security Council's \ncomposition, functions and modus operandi must be urgently examined in depth \nso that it can become a truly representative body, so that the anachronistic \nand anti-democratic veto privilege can be eliminated and transparency can be \nintroduced into its activities, while limiting them strictly to those set down \nin the Charter, and so that it will fully respect the obligation enshrined in \nthe Charter to be accountable to the General Assembly, which, in turn, should \nstrictly fulfil its responsibility to exercise control over the Council. \nThe Security Council has no authority whatsoever to interpret the Charter \nor to broaden the scope of its powers, or to carry out all the orders coming \nfrom its surreptitious informal gatherings. We must not tolerate the use of \nthe Council by those who so frequently defile the ideals of democracy as an \ninstrument for carrying out a virtual coup d'etat in the United Nations. Nor \ncan we we allow ideas to take hold that would introduce the concept of limited \nsovereignty and promote the creation of mechanisms that would result in \nconverting the Organization into a permanent source of intrusion, interference \nand intervention, to the benefit of the interests of the powerful. \nThe Organization must be democratized in order to strengthen its role and \nenhance its efficiency. To that end, it is indispensable to reinforce, not to \nweaken, the responsibilities of the General Assembly as the sole body in which \nall of us have equal responsibilities and which therefore has the capacity to \nrepresent the international community as a whole. \nDuring the tenth summit conference that we held at Jakarta early this \nmonth, the non-aligned countries adopted a common platform to face the present \ninternational situation and to ensure concerted action in the United Nations. \nThe Jakarta Message, the Final Document and the resolutions that were adopted \nshould become our tools to mobilize the third world in defence of its rights \nand to organize our resistance to those who are attempting to impose a \nself-styled new world order, which was conceived against, and without taking \ninto account the interests of, the peoples of the South and which would \nconstitute nothing but the installation on a global scale of the kind of \nhegemonistic delusions upon the cinders of which this Organization was created. \nThe aims of those who are concocting the reorganization of the world, \nwith a view to dominating it, are becoming increasingly obvious. \nUnderdevelopment and poverty would be permanently reserved for the peoples of \nthe South, which constitute three quarters of humankind, and they would \ncontinue to be the providers of wealth for the affluent minorities of the \nNorth. International bodies would be converted into mechanisms for domination \nand intervention to guarantee a world system where the powerful would impose \ntheir corrupted ideas and values. The new conquerors are not bearers of the \ncross; rather, they brandish the sword and the moneybag, and the only gospel \nthey preach is profits. \nCynically they proclaim themselves the representatives of a superior \nsociety and they go so far as to attempt to present themselves as the very \nimage of democracy, freedom and human rights. With the same arrogance shown \nby their colonialist ancestors, with the same haughtiness shown by their \nfascist inspirers, today's hegemonists boast about the alleged superiority of \ntheir societies, their way of life, their ideas, beliefs and values, and use \nevery means in attempting to impose them upon other peoples. \nThey are attempting to impose not only their ideas, but also their \n\\\"justice\\\", which lacks the slightest equity and which, even within the \nterritory of the United States, and with an openly racist point of view, \npronounces the harshest sentences, including the death penalty, on, almost \nexclusively, blacks and hispanics. What is the sense of, and how can we \ncondone, the decision of that country's Supreme Court which legalized the \nright to kidnap anyone of any nationality in any part of the world? Has \nmankind ever seen such an abuse of power and high-handedness at any other \nstage in its history? \nAt the same time, encouraged by the setbacks of European socialism, they \nare trying to decree the end of socialist ideals and to impose capitalism, in \nits most uncontrolled fashion, as the sole, definitive and permanent model to \nbe applied around the world. They proclaim the so-called neo-liberal formulas \nas dogma which everyone must observe and they do not even blush when they \nportray themselves as having the exclusive recipe for mankind's prosperity and \nhappiness. \nMillions of dollars that could be devoted to more noble purposes are \nbeing spent today in selling those ideas. But the peoples of the third world \nhave not forgotten that it was the unrestrained voraciousness of capitalism \nthat compelled them to endure the long and harsh experience of colonialism, \nthat crushed them with racism and discrimination, that subjected them to the \nbackwardness and poverty still besetting them. Capitalism was and is the \nessential cause of the evils afflicting our peoples; it can never be their \nsolution. \nThe euphoric promoters of so-called neo-liberalism are overcome with joy \nwhen they see the bankruptcy of a number of socialist projects which, as is \nwell known, lasted barely a few decades and were tested in adverse conditions \nand in comparatively less developed countries. \nThose who exult over the failure of some socialist societies should be \ncapable of demonstrating that capitalism is solving the problems of mankind or \nat least that it is doing so somewhere. After all, capitalism has been the \npredominant system in the world for centuries and has come to full development \nin some of the more wealthy countries. But, after more than 200 years of \ncapitalism in a rich, developed and powerful country such as the United \nStates, the population as a whole still lacks a health system; millions are \ncalling for employment, housing, education and protection in their old age or \nare suffering the consequences of drug addiction, violence and other social \nevils; and tens of millions are victims of the worst expressions of racism and \nracial discrimination. The most powerful country has not been able in two \ncenturies to solve any of those problems through capitalism, although it not \nonly has been able to rely on its own wealth but also has been pitilessly \nexploiting other peoples during that lengthy period. \nCertain turncoats may kneel before that deceptive golden calf, but to \nunderstand the failure of capitalism as a social project it is not necessary \nto read Karl Marx one need only take stroll through the New York or Los \nAngeles inner city. The American dream may dazzle some weak minds, but for \nbroad, and growing, sectors in this country and, above all, for tens of \nmillions of Afro-Americans, Latinos, native Americans and Asians, the \nunemployed, the poor and the destitute - that dream has been, and is, a \nbitter, sad and perpetual nightmare. \nOn what moral grounds can profoundly unjust societies present themselves \nas a universal archetype when the inordinate consumption patterns and the \nextravagance of their insolent minorities mock the plight of countless others \nin their midst who are suffering a life as miserable as that of the poorest in \nthe third world? In terms of human solidarity they have nothing to teach us; \non the contrary, they have much to learn from us. \nIn truth, not only is the type of society that would be imposed upon us \nintrinsically unjust and inhuman: it threatens the survival of the human \nspecies - indeed, life itself on our planet. The irrational consumption \npatterns of the wealthy exhaust non-renewable resources, poison oceans and \nrivers, make the air in our cities unbreathable, adversely change the climate, \ndangerously raise the sea level, irreparably damage the soil, destroy forests, \nenlarge deserts and deepen the poverty of hundreds of millions of human \nbeings. The environment is also the victim of a relentless war that has \nalready caused the death of numerous species and is putting many others in \ndanger of extinction. \nWhen will it be man's turn to fall victim to his own folly? For how long \nwill a lifestyle that condemns each and every one of us to death continue to \nbe worshipped? \nI address this Assembly at what is, for Cuba, a particularly difficult \ntime. The economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United \nStates against the Cuban people has been in force for more than 30 years, but \nit is now being intensified and extended. While talking hypocritically of \npeace and international cooperation, the Government in Washington forbids \nforeign vessels involved in any business with Cuba to enter United States \nports and tries to compel corporations based in other countries to follow its \nanti-Cuban policy. Thus it is grossly violating not only the most basic \nrights of my people but also the sovereignty of other countries and the \nfundamental principles and norms of international law. \nWhile former adversaries become partners, and while the number of \ncountries to which Washington applies economic restrictions diminishes, the \nbudget and resources of the Government office entrusted with enforcement of \nthose restrictions have been increased, and it is publicly acknowledged that \nthose actions are geared towards reinforcement of the blockade against Cuba. \nThe United States obstructs Cuban economic and commercial activities world \nwide. It strives to prevent us from purchasing oil, foodstuffs and medicines; \nputs pressure on investors and businessmen; and, more than once, has been able \nto intimidate others, and thus frustrate entirely legitimate operations, by \nits stubborn and criminal attempts to starve our people into surrender. \nNever before, other than in the course of war, has a people been \nsubjected to such rigorous, prolonged and total attack. This aggression is \nbeing carried out against a small and poor country - a country with very few \nnatural resources, and no substantial sources of energy; a country whose \ndevelopment prospects are totally dependent on foreign trade; a country that \nreceives no credit or finance from international organizations; a country to \nwhich even various types of humanitarian aid are restricted. And now attempts \nare being made even to prevent us from trading. \nThe blockade is being intensified at a time when Cuba is suffering an \nextremely trying situation arising from the dissolution of the Socialist bloc, \nthe disintegration of the Soviet Union and the sudden and radical change in \nrelations with the countries with which we conducted 80 per cent of our trade, \nas well as from the abrupt disappearance of the fair and equitable prices that \ngoverned those relations. This has meant the loss of 70 per cent of Cuba's \npurchasing power the figure having fallen from $8,139 million in 1989 to \n$2.2 million this year. In truth, Cuba is confronted by a double blockade \nthat is becoming harsher and more implacable every day. \nIndeed, the enormous damage to our economy has had inevitable \nrepercussions for the living standards and consumption levels of the \npopulation, as well as for the country's production and development \nprogrammes. In these grave circumstances the imperialists nurture the hope \nthat, by making their blockade tougher and more oppressive, they will be able \nto create conditions of poverty and hunger and, thus, make our people \nsurrender. However, that is nothing but a foolish hope. Those who seek to \nannihilate us are ignoring the fact that Cuba's main resource - its only true \nwealth is its people. \nOnly a united, informed and resolute people, a people prepared to fight \nfor what it wants to achieve, a people whose social relations are governed by \nequity and solidarity, can confront and overcome such adversity. Only in a \nsociety such as that of Cuba could such disastrous conditions have occurred \nwithout leading to the closure of a single school, to neglect of the health of \na single child or elderly man or woman, or to the abandonment of a single \ncitizen. Can the same be said of our rabid enemies or our hypocritical \ncritics? \nThere is no greater proof of the strength of our social system or of the \nimplacable resolve and unity of the Cuban people in defence of its revolution \nthan the heroic popular resistance to this imperialist onslaught. How many \ncountries have endured such a trial? \nBut this large-scale economic warfare is not the only action being taken \nagainst Cuba. Part of our territory continues to be illegally occupied by a \nUnited States military base, which is the source of frequent provocation; the \nair above and the sea around the country are constantly being used for \nmanoeuvres by the mighty who assault us; more than 1,500 hours of aggressive \nradio broadcasts are transmitted to Cuba weekly, and there have been \nunsuccessful attempts to invade our television spectrum; the territory of the \nUnited States is used openly and shamelessly, and with the apparent complicity \nof the authorities of that country, for the purpose of carrying out terrorist \nattacks against us; and Cuba is being subjected to a systematic campaign of \nslander to distort the image of a country which the United States has not been \nable to defeat and which refuses to renounce its independence. \nAs it has not been able to bend us to its will, imperialism threatens us \nwith extermination and endeavours to compel the rest of the world to acquiesce \nto its genocidal infamy. The Yankee blockade is a brutal violation of the \nrights of all the Cuban people and of international norms and the sovereignty \nof other countries. It is, above all, a moral disgrace. \nThose who think they can bring Cuba to its knees are mistaken. Our \npeople has travelled a long road to achieve its full emancipation. It started \nits trek, totally alone, more than 120 years ago. Within its limited island \nspace, without allies, without the material support of any Government, it \nstruggled for three decades against a better and larger military force than \nthe total of the forces which Spain had used to combat rebellion in all its \nother colonies. Attempts were made even then to isolate our people from the \nrest of the world; even then the oppressor found accomplices; even then \nattempts were made to compel our people to surrender because of hunger, and a \nsubstantial part of our population was annihilated. \nThe Puerto Rican patriot, Eugenio Maria de Hostos, described those \npainful times for Cuba in the following words: \n\\\"It is necessary to imagine oneself in that terrifying situation, \nthe most tragic ever faced by any people: deprived of everything itself, \nwhile its enemy possesses all the power and resources of civilization; \nabandoned, while its enemy is abetted; disdained, while its enemy is \nflattered by the complicity of all. It is necessary to be able to feel \nall the torments of the agony of many years to understand how long a \nrevolution lasts, to realize how much time passes, to understand the \nprodigious resistance of the combatants, to appreciate their heroism, to \nbe worthy of admiring those admirable men ... \n\\\"It is necessary to live in such infamous times, stumbling through \nthe darkness of injustice, to feel for those men, elevated by their own \nefforts to the dignity of complete men, all the enthusiastic reverence, \nall the impulsive admiration, inspired by those capable of heroically \nrepresenting the highest virtues of mankind.\\\" \nThose times referred to by Hostos were certainly even more difficult for \nour people. Today we are facing an enemy more powerful than Spain was then, \nbut we have a united, brave people, worthy heirs of those combatants who never \nretreated despite the greatest misfortunes. We will never betray their \nmemory; we will never renounce a fatherland which we liberated with rivers of \nblood and sacrifice. \nWe also rely on the solidarity of peoples. We know that the oppressed, \nthe exploited and the victims of discrimination on this Earth who place their \nhopes in Cuba's survival are many. \nFor our dead, and for those who hope for a worthy life, we will continue \nresisting. We will not betray the mandate of our ancestors and the confidence \nof peoples. We will prove ourselves capable of resisting and we will know how \nto resist. \nWe will continue to pursue our most sacred duty: to save the fatherland, \nthe revolution and socialism. For their sake, we shall continue our struggle, \nwithout hesitating, despite all obstacles, hard and difficult though \ncircumstances may be; ever onward to victory. "

        "file_text": " I join in \nthe congratulations extended to you. Sir, on your election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its forty-seventh session. Your election symbolizes the \ngreat changes taking place throughout the world, and is a tribute to your \ncountry and to your people, as well as to you yourself. \n\nI should also like to pay a special tribute to you your predecessor, \nMr. Samir Shihabi, the former Permanent Representative of Saudi Arabia, for \nthe manner in which he presided over the affairs of the General Assembly \nduring its forty-sixth session. \nThere can be no doubt that there has been no period in our lifetime when \nthe world has enjoyed greater hope for a lasting international peace than it \ndoes now. The gradual reduction of tension and the eventual elimination of \nantagonisms between the world's two foremost military Powers have had dramatic \nresults in nuclear disarmament, and ultimately contributed to the end of the \ncold war. Today, the widening circle of democracy holds out the promise of an \ninternational environment that could become even more conducive to the \nattainment of international peace and security. \nNone the less, many problems persist and plague the Earth, threatening \nour never-ending search for justice, equality and peace. Democracy, so \ncherished and championed, within certain national borders, is often less \ncherished, if not disregarded, when it comes to the interests of the large and \npowerful countries, on the one hand, and those of the smaller and economically \nweaker States, on the other. \nMoreover, nationalism, which could, and should, be a progressive vehicle \nfor unifying peoples, rather than dividing them, has on occasion been \nencouraged to manifest its narrowest and most intolerant forms. In too many \nparts of the world, old ethnic antagonisms have been reawakened and are being \nexploited by demagogues who are very adept at using these antagonisms to serve \ntheir selfish and short-sighted ambitions. Unfortunately, far too often the \nvictims of this demagoguery have no recourse to any legal mechanism that might \nspare their lives and end their suffering. \n\nTragically, we have seen certain scenarios played out far too often. At \nfirst, the world sits idly by and barely notices the insulting words and the \noffensive speeches that are made. Then, even more inflammatory rhetoric is \nspouted, and eventually stones are hurled. Next, individuals are assaulted in \nthe streets and their homes are invaded and vandalized. Before too long, \nconditions deteriorate irreparably. \nFor some, that constitutes a point of no return. Ignorance, which breeds \nhatred, accelerates and races forward unchecked, building its own momentum \nwith ever-increasing destructive force. Entire neighbourhoods or villages are \nplaced under siege. The demagogues, by now totally intoxicated by the false \npower of the forces they have unleashed, will always try to claim to be \ndefending the loftiest ideals. In fact, they are simply following their \nbasest instincts. \nVanuatu has long been disturbed by the hesitancy and reluctance of some \nmembers of the international community to address this very troublesome \nissue. In the past we have warned that failure to examine the causes of \nethnic antagonisms or intercommunal conflicts, failure to devise peaceful ways \nto resolve them, could only lead to a situation in which, one day, \ninternational peace and security would be quite seriously threatened by such \ndevelopments. Regrettably, that day has now arrived. Thus, while some of us \nhave never had more reason to rejoice and others have never had more reason to \nmourn, still others have never faced a less certain future. \nWhat possible joy can a mother in the Balkans feel when she buries her \nyoung son whose life was ended by an unknown sniper's bullet? What possible \n\njoy can a father in Somalia feel when he watches his daughter die a slow and \npainful death from starvation? What can possibly ease the terror that fills \nthe hearts of defenceless and innocent refugees who find themselves caught in \nthe vice of political and social indifference or who behold the chaos in \nnative lands they had always considered havens of justice and equality. \nWhile some rightly rejoice over the end of the cold war and the spread of \ndemocracy, others are homeless and continue to suffer the pangs of hunger \noften the result of economic deprivation. Still others mourn the sudden and \nviolent end of the lives of their loved ones and wonder anxiously whether they \nthemselves will survive to see the next sunrise. While some are able to \napplaud what has been achieved, others can only contemplate the long road \nstill to be travelled. \n\nFrom South Africa to Afghanistan, from Cambodia to Haiti, from Bosnia and \nHerzegovina to East Timor, from the heart of Europe all the way to the sunny \nSouth Pacific, people are suffering some for a long time now because of \nthe difficulties of all kinds that they face, and the international community \nmust still shoulder the major responsibility. \nAll these ideas are emphasized in the Secretary-General's remarkable \nreport entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". He has made a thought-provoking \nanalysis, and we find this document to be a very good starting-point for \nmuch-needed discussions as we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the United \nNations and as mankind prepares to enter the twenty-first century. \nThe international political environment is not the only environment that \nconcerns us. Much has been written and much has been said about the Earth \nSummit held this past June in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It remains to be seen \nwhat will be done as a follow-up to that very important meeting. \nWe are pleased to note that some very positive measures have already been \ntaken. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is to be commended for \nhaving made a significant financial contribution to Capacity 21. Canada has \nindicated that it will follow suit. We trust that others also will do so very \nsoon. This important initiative will help the developing countries formulate \nnational policies and legislation in support of the environment and \nsustainable development. It will focus on the technical training of human \nresources and the strengthening of regional and national institutions. More \nimportantly, it will show how serious the developed countries of the North are \nabout the extensive multilateral commitments necessary to breathe life into \nour post-Rio journey. \n\nAt this session of the General Assembly a number of important measures \nshould be taken as follow-ups to the Earth Summit. Among these, of course, is \nthe establishment of a high-level commission on sustainable development. It \nis our hope that the commission's secretariat will be situated at United \nNations Headquarters here in New York and that the commission will meet in New \nYork so that all countries will have an opportunity to participate in, and \ncontribute to, the commission's important work. Situating the commission's \nsecretariat elsewhere and holding its meetings outside New York would without \nany doubt result in sharply reduced participation by a large number of \ndeveloping countries and would limit the commission's effectiveness. \nFurthermore, we feel that situating the commission in New York would be most \ncost-effective for the United Nations and would stimulate the very necessary \ninteraction between the commission, UNDP, the United Nations Population Fund \n(UNFPA), the World Bank and the other multilateral agencies that are so \nessential to making the follow-up to Rio meaningful and effective. \nWe strongly believe, as do our colleagues in the Alliance of Small Island \nStates (AOSIS), that the decisions made with respect to the site of the \ncommission's secretariat, the venue of its meetings, its size and its \ncomposition will be critical in determining whether there will be universal \nparticipation and transparency in the work of the commission. Our major \nconcern is that this matter not be decided on any ground except what is likely \nto lead to the most effective functioning of the commission and its productive \ninteraction with other agencies. \n\nDuring the current session of the General Assembly, an intergovernmental \ncommittee to negotiate a convention on drought and desertification will also \nbe established. Vanuatu intends to participate actively in that committee's \nwork and to lend its support to those countries most immediately threatened by \ndrought and desertification. We feel that addressing this problem is one of \nthe greatest challenges facing the international community. \nAnother of the very important measures the General Assembly will consider \nas a follow-up to the Earth Summit is the proposal to hold a world conference \non the sustainable development of the small island States. Such a meeting is \nlong overdue. We hope a resolution on convening the conference will be \nadopted by consensus and that the essential objective of the conference, which \nAOSIS is proposing be held in Barbados, will be to ensure concrete and \nmeaningful action by the international community to assist the world's most \nvulnerable, yet very frequently overlooked, countries. We appeal to all \ncountries to lend their support to this conference and to join us in the warm \nand friendly atmosphere of Barbados next June in order to continue our journey \ntogether on the road charted by the Rio Conference. \nVanuatu is not only a small island State but also a least developed \ncountry. We therefore have a real concern for our economy as well as for \npolitical democracy. Thus, we aspire also to economic development. \nTherefore, we join in the appeals for measures to correct the trade \nimbalances, to reduce the debt burden, and to establish fair prices for our \ncommodities. We believe that measures must be taken to overcome these \nscourges of underdevelopment. \n\nThis subject is of such great importance that we approach the question of \nthe reform and restructuring of the United Nations development system with a \ngreat deal of hope that creative approaches will be devised and effectively \nutilized in the post-cold-war period. \nWe are pleased and proud to report that next month our Parliament in \nVanuatu will act on legislation required for the ratification of the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the Convention on \nBiological Diversity. We strongly feel it is essential that these conventions \nbe ratified, enter into force and be strictly adhered to at the earliest \npossible moment. \nWe are also pleased that there is finally a convention banning chemical \nweapons. We pray that those who possess such weapons and those who would \npossess them will see the wisdom of becoming parties to that legal \ninstrument and forever banning those horrible tools of death. \n\nEnvironmental disasters that have recently struck countries as diverse \nand geographically distant from each other as the Bahamas, France, Nicaragua, \nPakistan and the United States suggest that the world has not a moment to \nspare if we are to avoid the potential global calamity that could result from \nmankind's long-term abuse of the environment. Precautionary, preventive \nmeasures should be taken now; otherwise it will most assuredly be too late. \nFor decades, the peoples of the South Pacific have seen their region \nutilized for the testing of nuclear weapons, for the dumping of radioactive \nwastes and, most recently, for the destruction of chemical weapons. Our \nregion paid high and unwanted costs for technologies from which we received \ncomparatively little benefit. Today, we South Pacific leaders are very \nconcerned about plans to ship plutonium through our waters. We trust that \nthose who are involved in these plans will heed our voices while we still have \nvoices to be heard. \nI conclude by joining in the welcome that has been expressed to all of \nour new Members. Theirs has not been an easy path to statehood, international \nrecognition and membership of the United Nations. We salute their \nperseverance and their vision of their own futures. We stand ready to join \nhands with them in forging a more effective, more representative and more \nresponsive United Nations. In that way we shall help to create a more \ndemocratic international order a world order that is democratic in fact as \nwell as in word; a world order that respects all countries, whether large and \npowerful or small and vulnerable."

        "file_text": "I bring heartfelt greetings \nfrom the Government and friendly people of Saint Kitts and Nevis, and I am \nparticularly pleased and, indeed, honoured to be called upon to address the \nforty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. \nLet me first join those speakers who have preceded me in congratulating \nthe former President, Mr. Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, on his efficient and \nproficient handling of our past deliberations. Then I must hasten to welcome \nour new President, assuring you, Sir, of my country's active support and \ncooperation. Clearly, Mr. President, the very skilful and methodical manner \nin which you have been guiding and conducting our work augurs well for a \nproductive session. \nNext I wish to commend most highly our Secretary-General, \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has been serving the cause of our Organization \nwith diligence, dignity and dexterity in the face of challenging times. The \nGovernment and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis welcome you, \nMr. Secretary-General, to this, your first session of the General Assembly as \nSecretary-General, and we have every confidence in your commitment to \ninternational peace and security as the bases for democracy and development. \nWhen we met last year for the Assembly's forty-sixth session it was in an \natmosphere of great optimism. The cold war was over, Kuwait was liberated, \nfreedom and democracy were breaking out all over Europe and in the former \nSoviet States, positive steps for the reduction of nuclear arms were taking \nplace. The world waited with anticipation to reap the benefits of the \nall-embracing peace dividend. In my address then I said: \n\\\"The enhancement of education, the eradication of poverty, the \nreduction of unemployment, the maintenance of good health, the provision \nof affordable housing, the adapting of science and technology to \n\nsocio-economic development these must be the dividends that flow from \ndiverting global financial resources away from the amassing of armaments, \nto be invested in human development. This is the challenge we face. \nThis is the new battle we must join and we must not fail.\\\" \n(A/46/PV.25. p. 6) \nIt is perhaps too soon to say that we have failed, but we have certainly not \nsucceeded. Once again, the attention of the international community has been \ndistracted by fierce and despicable atrocities in far-flung theatres of \nregional conflict. \nOn the one hand, we are shocked by the gruesome and intense savagery of \nthe fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The reports of detention camp \natrocities, indiscriminate killings, starvation and torture, seem like a \nreincarnation of less civilized times, and it is difficult to accept them as \npart of the twentieth century. \n\nOn the other hand, the scenes of human degradation, suffering and death \nfrom starvation and disease emanating from Somalia appear at last to have \njolted the conscience of the international community and stimulated a \nhumanitarian response to the crisis. \nIn these theatres of civil strife, our relief efforts are disrupted by \nthose who are seemingly untouched by human suffering. Relief convoys come \nunder fire, and food intended for the victims of war is hijacked and ends up \nin the coffers of those whose very actions are perpetuating the crisis. \nI am aware of the outstanding efforts of the Secretary-General to ensure \nthat the United Nations has responded to these crises with urgency and in \npositive and practical ways. We must however do more. We must mobilize the \nresources, diplomatic and other, of the Member States to bring an end to the \nfighting and, secondly, we must continue to intensify the relief effort for \nthose in need of the basic necessities of food, shelter and medicines. \nIt is serious cause for concern that countries in which the economy is in \nshambles, and in which production of goods and services is practically at a \nstandstill, can still find the means to procure massive amounts of arms and \nammunition and sustain armed conflicts for many months and even years. Here \nagain we see resources that should be channelled to address issues of human \ndevelopment being diverted into weapons of destruction for the perpetration of \nviolence. \nIt is therefore clear that there is also an urgent need for a reduction \nin both conventional and non-conventional weapons and I call upon the Assembly \nto pursue this objective. \n\nWhile much of our attention seems to be directed towards Eastern Europe \nlet us be reminded that peace and development continue to elude the people of \nHaiti and South Africa. \nThe people of Haiti still cannot breathe the pure air of freedom; they \nstill suffer under an oppressive illegal regime which blatantly and \nmonstrously repudiated the will of the people, which was so freely and \noverwhelmingly expressed in the elections of December 1990. \nSaint Kitts and Nevis, and indeed the entire Caribbean community, \ncontinue to condemn this dastardly assault upon the democratic process in \nHaiti, and we maintain our call for the restoration of constitutional \ndemocracy in Haiti. I call on the Member States of the United Nations to \nostracize the illegal regime in Haiti and to take all appropriate measures to \nrestore democracy and the constitutionally elected government in Haiti. \nIn the meantime we must continue and increase humanitarian assistance to \nthe people of Haiti through international relief organizations, and ensure \nthat our assistance reaches those who need it most. We must also be prepared \nto mobilize significant development assistance to Haiti when democracy is \nrestored. \nIn relation to South Africa, we in the Caribbean have been strong in our \ncondemnation of apartheid. I have no doubt that our principled stand, along \nwith that of other countries has contributed to the eventual dismantling of \nthe main pillars of apartheid. Encouraged by the African National Congress, \nand as a means of encouraging further progress, we relaxed some of the \nsanctions that we had imposed. The recent upsurge in violence, which appears \nto enjoy tacit support from elements within the ruling regime itself, must \n\ncause us to doubt the sincerity of the De Klerk administration to lay \napartheid in its final resting place. \nThe Government and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis call upon the General \nAssembly at this forty-seventh session to condemn the wanton killings in South \nAfrica and to appeal to all parties to resume talks in good faith, for the \nsake of democracy and good government. We call for an end to the violence in \nSouth Africa. We urge the immediate resumption of the negotiating process \ntowards a free and democratic South Africa. We re-emphasize our unshakable \nsolidarity with the anti-apartheid struggle and we appeal to the South African \nregime to exercise more effective control over its security forces. The \nclimate for negotiation has to be restored in order to facilitate the \nemergence and subsequent establishment of a democratic and non-racial South \nAfrica. We seize this opportunity to invite the international community, if \nnecessary, to remobilize its forces in the struggle against apartheid, in the \nstruggle for freedom, peace and democracy in South Africa. \nLet us not abandon the oppressed people in South Africa. Let us stand \nfirm instead until justice, equality and freedom become realities. The \nprimary objective must be \\\"one person, one vote\\\". This is the only brand of \ndemocracy we in the Caribbean understand. This is the only brand of democracy \nwe want for ourselves and for our brothers and sisters in South Africa. \nWe commend the role the United Nations has played and continues to play \nin respect of Arab-Israeli relations. We regard the peace talks that have \nstarted as a positive development and we urge that they be continued in good \nfaith by all parties concerned, so that a just and lasting solution which \naddresses all of the issues of fundamental rights, security and economic and \nsocial development can be achieved. \n\nThe people in developing countries are still anxiously awaiting the \n\\\"peace dividend\\\". This body of nations must work assiduously at bringing an \nend to conflicts, at ending hunger and starvation. We must, in short, strive \nto move beyond a mere crisis-response modality and shift into a posture to \neffect just and sustainable development throughout the world. It is a \nmonumental task, which will require massive mobilization of resources, \nsensible and sensitive application of those resources, and an unprecedented \nlevel of cooperation between developed and developing countries. \nThere must be a major emphasis on human resource development so that the \npeople may be empowered to drive the development process. In this decade of \nthe disabled, and beyond, they too must be involved. My Government is making \nevery effort to ensure that the disabled of our country are involved in the \ntotal process of mobilization. In order to increase public awareness and to \nassist in the development of the disabled, my Government has spearheaded a \nmajor fund-raising effort through the annual walkathon undertaken by Ministers \nof Government as part of our celebration of independence. We also support \ntraining programmes through our own school for the deaf and private sector \nsupport institutions. \n \nThe people must be given the tools education, basic infrastructure, \nappropriate technology transfer and the life-quality-enhancing support of \naffordable housing, good health care and facilities for recreation. \nInstead of a massive mobilization of financial resources for developing \ncountries, however, we are faced with reductions in concessional financing and \nacross-the-board cuts in aid. These will hit the poorest and smallest \ncountries hardest and undermine our efforts to reduce poverty, stimulate \ngrowth and protect the environment. \nFree trade is being touted as the new panacea for all our ills. There \nis, however, no single prescription for the economic ailments of all \ncountries. There is no one solution for the rich and the poor, for the \nindustrialized and the non-industrialized, for the developed and the \ndeveloping. Even within the category of developing countries, there are \nstructural differences between small island developing countries and others. \nSpecial consideration must therefore be given to small island developing \ncountries. \nIn matters of trade we cannot be equal partners. How can we, when large \ncountries, having the benefit of economies of scale, highly developed \ninfrastructure and modern technology, can swamp our markets with virtually any \nproduct? On the other hand, the per capita cost to us of providing the \ninfrastructure to support an export-oriented development is higher than it is \nin developed countries. \nIn the Caribbean we recognize that we must accept the principal \nresponsibility for progress in our own development. We have demonstrated a \ncommitment to reform and diversification, we have taken bold initiatives \n\ninvolving greater fiscal and economic discipline, and we are willing to do \nmore. But we cannot do the job alone. \nWe have made significant progress in regional cooperation and are now \npoised to take further initiatives to strengthen our functional, economic and \npolitical cooperation. We know that we can do more for ourselves through more \neffective regional integration. \nAs a Caribbean people, we have to be realistic in assessing the potential \nimpact of our regional integration process. The members of the international \ncommunity too must be realistic in designing their policies for interacting \nwith us in the Caribbean community. The fact is that, as developing \ncountries most of us being island developing countries in the Caribbean \ncommunity we are individually small. When taken together and looked at in \nthe international context, we are still small, and the basic problems, \ninequities and vulnerabilities of small developing countries still afflict us. \nWe want to play an effective part in the international economic system; \nwe want to be equal partners in the evolving global trading arrangements. In \nour case, however, equal does not mean identical, because we do not start from \nthe same premise. The basic conditions and inequities which necessitated \nspecial arrangements under agreements such as the Lome Convention, the \nCaribbean Basin Initiative and CARIBCAN are still present. Therefore, while \nwe support the call for an early and successful conclusion to the Uruguay \nRound of trade negotiations, we urge that as we, the small island developing \ncountries of the Caribbean, work assiduously to transform our economies, \nearnest consideration should be given to the continuation of preferential \ntrading arrangements to small countries such as ours. In particular, special \n\ntreatment of the sensitive commodities, sugar and bananas, is vital to our \nstable adjustment to the changing global economic environment. \nThe other area for urgent action is the maintenance of concessional flows \nof aid to developing countries. I am aware that global recession and the \nrecent uncertainties reflected in the financial system in Europe will put \nsevere pressures on donor budgets and will thus encourage the trend towards \nthe reduction of official development assistance. I must, in spite of the \ndifficulties, renew the call for developed countries to recommit themselves to \nreaching the United Nations target for official development assistance \namounting to 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product. \nA reduction in aid would undermine our efforts to promote sustainable \ndevelopment and protect the environment. Yet those objectives were the very \nheart of the consensus reached at the historic United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development the Earth Summit held at Rio de Janeiro in \nJune of this year. \nThat conference provided us with a rare, almost unique, opportunity for \nglobal cooperation and partnership. We paused there to chart afresh the \ncourse for improving the quality of life for all peoples in our time and for \nfuture generations, through an integrated, caring and people-oriented approach \nto sustainable development. We left there with a clear commitment to balance \nthe urgency of environmental preservation with the imperatives of human \ndevelopment. \nWe signed the Convention on biological diversity to encourage the \nrational management of natural resources, to ensure that the people of \ndeveloping countries will justly gain the benefits associated with the use of \ntheir resources. We also signed the Convention on climate change, because \n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, and indeed the entire Caribbean region, are susceptible \nto the ravages of hurricanes, and, as island States, we are certainly \nvulnerable to the effects of global warming and a rise in sea level. \nThe execution of those Conventions must have special meaning to our women \nand children. The United Nations has already committed itself to devoting \nspecial attention to them. Saint Kitts and Nevis fully acknowledges the \nimportance and contribution of our women to sustainable development. Women in \nmy country are fully involved as equal partners in the decision-making and \ndevelopment processes. The rights of women and the entitlement to such rights \nhave been integrated into my country's development policies and programmes, \nwhich are implemented by a Ministry of Women's Affairs. We recognize the \nstrong correlation between environmentally sound development and population \ngrowth, and we provide family-planning programmes involving education, \ninformation and accessible services. \nWe maintain our commitment to our children through the provision of \nimproved educational facilities and appropriate curricula, a variety of \ntraining opportunities, recreational facilities, improved housing and a strong \nprogramme of primary health care in which we maintain our standard of \n100 per cent immunization against the common communicable diseases. \nThe importance of our marine environment to the health, welfare and total \ndevelopment of our Caribbean people cannot be overemphasized. Consequently \nreports of the impending shipment of a large quantity of plutonium through the \nCaribbean Sea later this month are a matter of the gravest concern to us in \nSaint Kitts and Nevis. This is a matter which must and will be addressed by \nthe Caribbean community. \n\nI call on the international community to support us in our efforts to \nprotect our marine environment and to prohibit the movement of hazardous waste \nthrough our region. \nWe in Saint Kitts and Nevis will continue to play our part in preserving \nour planet by implementing national policies and programmes based on domestic \nsocial and economic realities, including solid waste management, water quality \nimprovement, control of soil and coastal erosion, forestry management, \nagricultural and fisheries development and preservation of our marine \nenvironment. In Rio, we endorsed an implementation programme known as \nAgenda 21. It addresses the major issues related to sustainable development. \nIt charts the way to improved living standards in developing countries. We \nmust now translate this blueprint into tangible action by providing the \nfinancial resources for its implementation. Within the programme, access to \nthe resources must not be tied to conditions that would impose further burdens \non the people of developing countries. Such resources must be made available \non preferential terms, with special concessions for small island developing \ncountries. I can stress the urgency of this requirement in no better way than \nto repeat what I said to the historic assembly in Rio: \n\\\"We cannot aspire to save the planet for future generations, while \nconsigning the poor, the underprivileged, the underdeveloped of this \ngeneration to a life of persistent misery and deprivation.\\\" \nThe task *is enormous, the challenge is monumental, but within the \ninternational community we have the tools. All that is left is for us to \nsummon the commitment to preserve, develop and manage our combined heritage \nwith the objective of guaranteeing a better quality of life for all people, \neverywhere.

        "file_text": "Let me begin by congratulating you, Sir, and \nthe nation of Bulgaria, on your assumption of the presidency of the United \nNations General Assembly. May I also congratulate the Secretary-General, \nMr. Boutros-Ghali, on his leadership in the struggle for peace. I wish him \nsuccess in his endeavours. \nToday I speak for an Israel that has chosen to step out of the shadows of \nthe past to prepare for the invitation of a new future. The world is alive \nwith the impulse for change. The end of conflict is no longer a Utopian \n\nfantasy. It is the dictate of realism and of universal self-interest. We \nlook to the future in a world that wants peace. \nLike a hidden Samson, the forces of change have pushed aside the pillars \nof conventional wisdom, which proclaimed that military power is the source of \nnational strength and prestige. This is no longer true. The cost of \nmaintaining a significantly large army can deplete the resources of the \nrichest countries, even if the weaponry remains unused. Around our changing \nworld, the flow of knowledge has superseded military might as the source of \nreal strength and social stability. \n\nThe flow of knowledge no longer stops at national frontiers. It is not \npossible in the age of modern communications to shield peoples from truth and \nreality. Eventually, even dictators must face the fact that the best censors \ncannot block the free flow of ideas. But knowledge cannot be acquired without \nthe right to doubt, the readiness to change. Knowledge is not available \nwithout freedom, and so democracy is prevailing throughout the world. \nIn this new era, the era of knowledge, the governing principles are those \nof democratic structures, market-based economies, open borders, demilitarized \ninternational and regional relations, and respect for human rights. But while \nall nations should embrace these new principles, national traditions and \nidentities retain their power. Nation-States will remain the focus of \nallegiance and social pride. \nTo reconcile national identity, regional cooperation and universal \nsolidarities is the central issue of contemporary life. \nThe United Nations was established in an era that no longer exists. Yet \nits ideals and structures can meet the challenges and dangers of this new \nage. We support the \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" offered by the Secretary-General. We \nsupport and will participate in the attempt to build a global protection \nsystem. \nThe United Nations must be the headquarters for an all-embracing struggle \nto safeguard the environment against new threats. It must be a powerhouse to \narrest starvation. It must develop the institutions and the ability to \nintervene when necessary to stop otherwise insoluble civil wars. The United \nNations must reorganize to face these problems in a global capacity. \nIn our own region, we must understand that even if our geography and \npeople have not changed, the world has changed. No longer can we live on \n\ndisappearing premises. For generations, the conflicts in the Middle East were \nnurtured by global conflicts by the cold war and hot competition. Within \nthe context of super-Power rivalry, the belligerents in the Middle East were \ngenerously supplied with shining armour. But where there were once evil \nempires, we now see only the desire for a peaceful world. Russia has \nchanged. The United States has emerged from the cold war with renewed respect \nfrom the world for its democratic drive for peace. The third world is \nchanging, with many nations ending old hostilities and building new \neconomies. In Africa, the forces of racism are being gradually driven out. \nIn the Middle East itself let's face it the peace between Israel and Egypt \nis attaining the respect of age. There is a fresh atmosphere in our time. \nThe time is now upon us for the nations of the Middle East to come to \nterms with the new realities, to make a living on their own. We can learn to \nbenefit from peaceful coexistence. If we are to survive, we must understand \nthat the dangers and opportunities we face are regional rather than national. \nIn an age of long-range missiles, national defence must be a collective \neffort. To provide our people with modern standards of living we must have \nopen borders and mutually beneficial exchanges. \nFor too long the Middle East has been caught up in national conflicts and \nnational rivalries for the glorification of national leaders. We need to \nbuild a new Middle East of, by and for the people. In our effort to build \nthis new future for the Middle East, Israel does not ignore its still existing \ndisagreements with our neighbours. The record shows that we are working to \nsolve them humanely, honourably and, wherever possible, permanently. We are \ncurrently engaged in bilateral negotiations to bring an end to the conflicts \nof the past and multilateral negotiations to lay the foundation for the future. \n\nIn the bilateral negotiations, we are negotiating with the Jordanians, \nthe Palestinians, the Syrians and the Lebanese. The committed leadership of \nthe United States has played a central role in bringing all the parties into \nface-to-face negotiations. \nWith the Jordanians, the solutions are awaiting the parties. We face \ncommon problems we must confront together, including the possible Jordanian \nconnection to Palestinian self-government and beyond. Our relations with the \nHashemite Kingdom have seen open hostilities but also tacit efforts to \novercome these hostilities. We look forward to a complete peace with the \nKingdom of Jordan in the near future. \nWith the Palestinian people, our conflict has been long and painful. We \nseek to end this conflict. We are looking for a bridge to cross the gulf of \nbitter memories, painful hatreds and emotion-laden suspicions. We have \noffered to negotiate an interim or transitional goal. There is no difference \nbetween the two. In fact, one can note with satisfaction that the \nPalestinians have agreed to this gradual approach. The direction is clear, \neven if the bridge will be built slowly. \nThe suggested path is an interim self-government arrangement, as \nconceived at Camp David. We know that this proposal is imperfect in some \nrespects. Self-government is less than independence. But it offers the \nflexibility of an arrangement that will last no more than five years. During \nthis limited period of time, Palestinians in the territories will enjoy \nself-government. The opportunity to select, through democratic political \nelections, a Palestinian administrative council will enable the Palestinian \npeople to exercise a double measure of freedom: the freedom to govern their \nown lives and to do so politically and democratically. \n\nBut instead of attempting to draw a map of a self-governing territory \nand it is doubtful that this could be achieved now we have suggested a \ndefinite timetable. So, while this proposal lacks the clarity of a map, it \nprovides the commitment of a calendar. This proposal is clearly a departure \nfrom the present situation. It has the dynamics of a voyage to a new destiny, \na bridge which begins at one shore and reaches another. \nI know it will not be an easy choice for either side. But neither the \nexisting situation nor the foreseeable future contains a more promising \nalternative. I am speaking for an Israeli Government that has firmly made up \nits mind and seeks the expeditious implementation of this proposal. \nIn negotiations, the parties tend to scrutinize every letter, every dot. \nI hope that the Palestinians will also perceive the spirit of our intent, \nwhich is to extricate ourselves from the position of domination over another \npeople. We have never in our history as a people sought domination over \nothers. We wholeheartedly seek a future where the children of both peoples \nwill escape the agonies of a distorted past and live under a clear sky of \nsecurity and hope. \n\nWith the Syrians, we have begun a dialogue in full daylight for the first \ntime in 44 years. It is necessary now to translate the change in the mood \nbetween our two nations into viable and carefully constructed accords \nexpressing a mutual interest in security and cooperation. \nWe call for a departure from old dogmas and all-embracing dictates, and \nwe hope the Syrians will adopt the same approach. We understand the need to \nsafeguard the security and freedom of both nations, theirs and ours. It is \nour responsibility to ensure that those who have survived the wars of the past \nwill have the opportunity to open a new peaceful chapter in the history of the \ntwo peoples. \nThe leaders of both countries should be directly involved in these \nnegotiations, which are in need of a new approach and creative thinking. I \ncall on the President of Syria to set aside his reservations and meet with the \nPrime Minister of Israel. \nWe have made clear to the Syrians that Security Council resolutions \n242 (1967) and 338 (1973) contain a territorial dimension, combined with other \ncomponents of peace and security which must be equally respected. \nWe believe in a comprehensive solution involving all issues and all \nparties. Yet we do not consider it wise to link one negotiation to another, \nor to postpone an agreement with one country because of delays elsewhere. One \nnegotiating process should not be handcuffed to another. \nWith respect to Lebanon, Israel holds no territorial claims; nor does it \nseek to influence the political destiny of that country. We recall peaceful \nrelations with Lebanon at a time when it was internally balanced and \ntranquil. We hope that such a time will return again. The moment Lebanon \nfinds peace within itself and independence from outside intervention, Lebanon \nand Israel will live in peace again. \n\nLooking at the bilateral negotiations, we recall that the success of our \nnegotiations with Egypt stemmed from dialogue at many levels of society: \ndecision makers, leaders, businessmen, academicians. We appeal to all our \nArab neighbours to establish the same dialogue today. There is no room for \ntimidity, reluctance or boycotts in a peace process. Peacemaking should not \nbe a hideaway operation. \nI hope our neighbours realize that Israel has implemented unilateral \nconfidence-building measures. We have drastically changed our settlement \npolicies, altered our policies towards the Palestinian people, offered new \nproposals for self-government and suggested target dates for the \nimplementation of this process. We have done these things unconditionally. \nYet confidence-building measures call for reciprocity. We seek an end to the \nunjustified economic boycott and the cessation of terror. \nWe shall not allow ourselves or our adversaries to escape this chance for \npeace. Yet we cannot turn our region into a new Middle East by just \nnegotiating old disputes. Our new challenges are on our horizons, not only in \nour frontiers. \nWe say to our Arab neighbours: the real danger is not Israel. The real \ndanger is poverty. The real danger is poverty that creates protest, even if \nit is occasionally cloaked in a religious mantle. Poverty and protest \nendanger both the Arab nations and Israel. Israel does not want to become an \nisolated island in an ocean of resentment. \nTwo hundred forty million people live today in the Middle East. The \nmajority of them live in a state of want. In 30 years, there will be \n500 million people in the region, two thirds residing in Africa, one third in \nAsia. \n \nThe poverty of the Middle East has nothing to do with geography. It has \nto do with the use and misuse of available and potential resources in the \nregion. The gap between wealthy and poor nations is wide: the more \nprosperous nations enjoy a per capita income 10 times greater than their \npoorer neighbours. The earth beneath us will continue to tremble if the \nwealthy remain oblivious to the needy, both within and beyond national borders. \nThe multilateral negotiations are composed of five areas: economics, \narms control, refugees, ecology and water. Progress in these areas will more \nlikely be attained if we can restructure the multilateral talks, which \ninitially created two advantages: the cluster of issues and the participation \nof many Arab countries. But the talks suffer as well from loose organization, \nwhich has resulted in seminars rather than negotiations, and from the lack of \na concentrated thrust to coordinate their work. We suggest the following \nchanges. \nFirst, the separate negotiations should be conducted in a coordinated \nmanner. \nSecondly, participation in the steering committee should be raised to the \nministerial level. \nThirdly, the multilateral negotiations should be intensified through more \nfrequent meetings for longer periods of time. \nFourthly, the Syrians and the Lebanese should participate. \nFifthly, discussion of human rights and pluralistic values should be made \npart of the talks so as to combine the discussion of well-defined practical \nissues with the pursuit of common values very much akin to the Helsinki \naccords. \n\nAnd finally, the parties should agree not to postpone progress in the \nmultilateral talks until the conclusion of the bilateral negotiations. Early \nplanning can save crucial time for all parties without forcing irreversible \ncommitments. And lost time cannot be regained. \nThe bilateral negotiations are essentially political. The multilateral \nnegotiations are essentially economic. We live in an age when financial \nassistance in itself is no longer the answer to the economic needs of the \nMiddle East. In the past, belligerency created dependence upon the financial \nassistance of other nations. By diminishing the need for arms and building \nthe right economic structure, we will be able create wealth of our own. There \nis no need to impoverish the wealthy in order to enrich the poor. Opening \nborders, paving roads, introducing modern communications, and exchanging \ntechnology will generate economic growth in the Middle East. \nTrade across borders is essential for economic growth. Markets transcend \nnational boundaries. Water, tourism and commerce do not subjugate themselves \nto political maps. The Middle East should follow the example of the \\\"seven \ntigers\\\" in Asia, the European Common Market and the North American Free Trade \nAgreement. Let us understand: these regions are our competitors and they are \nfar ahead of the Middle East in facing the new realities of the international \neconomy. We have to build an open regional economy, for the same reasons and \nwith the same promise that led others to do so. We have to build a common \nmarket in the Middle East. \n \nWe have to set out upon the long and complicated road to arms control. \nThat we can learn from the East-West negotiations and other attempts at arms \ncontrol. We have to follow the patient path of confidence-building measures \nin the geographical and technical domains until we are able to rid the Middle \nEast of the terror presented by weapons of mass destruction, both conventional \nand non-conventional. Israel has proposed the creation of a nuclear-free zone \nin the Middle East numerous times, and we stand ready to pursue this goal \ntoday. \nWe should address the problems of refugees, not by threatening to destroy \nthe existing demographic balance, but by exploring a range of possibilities \nfor restoring the dignity of refugees and offering them a new life. \nWe should act to save our fresh air and historic landscape. Ecological \npollution does not respect borders, and so we have to marshal forces to save \nour region from the danger of uncontrolled deterioration. \nFinally, the Middle East possesses vast desert land but meagre water \nresources. The land is static, the population is increasing and water \nresources are declining. Available water should be reused, and new fresh \nwater produced from the sea. Either the land will be salinized by the sea or \nthe sea water will be desalinized through available technology. The \ntechnology is available, and the necessary credit is attainable. We can \nsatisfy the needs of man and land. The Middle East can be made green. It \ndepends upon us. \nHere, I believe, are the pillars of wisdom for a new Middle East: \neconomic growth, arms control, dignity for the refugees, environmental \nprotection and water resources, coupled with religious freedom, pluralistic \nvalues and human rights. The nations of the Middle East must work \nindividually and collectively to meet these challenges of a changed world. \n\nThe agenda is ambitious. Is it merely a dream? No. It is a blueprint, \nand the necessary elements are within our grasp. Will these goals be achieved \nin our lifetime? We dare not hesitate, because the world will not wait for \nthe Middle East. We are tragically late in making peace. If we do not face \nour economic challenges, we will be left hopelessly far behind. \nThe agenda is new. The vision was already mentioned in Proverbs: \n\\\"Wisdom builds the house. \n\\\"Good judgment makes it secure.\\\" (The Holy Bible. Proverbs 24:3) \n\\\"Wisdom prevails over strength; knowledge over brute force.\\\" (The Holy \nBible. Proverbs 24:5) \nWe have to go to work. For us, the Jewish people, this is Rosh Hashanah, \nthe New Year. We pray that the year to come will bring peace, freedom and \nprosperity to build a new Middle East for all of its people Muslim, \nChristian, Jewish, Arab, Israeli for us, and for our children. \n"

        "file_text": "In 1989, the year in which the Berlin Wall \nfell and the cold war came to an end, there were 159 Member States represented \nin this Hall. Today, three years later, there are 179, an increase of 20. \nWill this trend continue? If so, there could be 200 Member States represented \nin this Hall when we meet here again in 1995. Will these new countries come \nfrom Africa, Asia, Europe or the Americas? And will the birth pangs of these \nnew States be as traumatic as those of some our newer Members, like Croatia, \nSlovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova and Georgia? Or will they emerge \npeacefully? \nI begin my statement with these questions because I believe that our \nfirst task at this session is to rid ourselves of the euphoria that many of us \nhere experienced when the cold war ended. From the tragic experience of \nKuwait to the continuing anguish of the former Yugoslavs, we are seeing the \nre-emergence of forces that we thought had been swept away by forces of \nmodernization. Ghosts which had been sleeping for decades have awakened to \nhaunt us. How many more will awaken in the years to come? \nThis session clearly needs to be one of sober reflection. In this regard \nI am pleased that we have elected Ambassador Ganev of Bulgaria to guide our \ndeliberations. This reflects the confidence of Member States in his \nleadership abilities. Bulgaria's geographical location gives it a unique \ninsight into the problems that we are facing. \nI should also like to place on record our appreciation of the wise \nleadership and guidance provided by our President's predecessor, \nAmbassador Samir Shihabi. In addition, we wish to place on record our \nappreciation to Mr. Perez de Cuellar for his 10 years of dedicated and \nexemplary service as Secretary-General. Let me also congratulate \n\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali on his wise and dynamic stewardship of the United \nNations in his first year in office. \nThere can no longer be any doubt that the cold war, even though it \nterrified many of us in this Hall, effectively froze or suppressed many \ntribal, religious, ethnic and cultural divisions. The thawing of the cold war \nhas led to their re-emergence. I need only to cite some obvious recent \nexamples. Even as we speak, conflicts are raging between Armenia and \nAzerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, and there are conflicts in Moldova, Georgia \nand Afghanistan. Somalia is splintering; the former Yugoslavia has descended \ninto tribal warfare. The world has still not recovered from the shock of the \natrocities and the blatant disregard of basic humanitarian principles in \nBosnia and Herzegovina in the name of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", which we condemn as \nan abhorrent practice. \nIn this setting it is appropriate and timely that the Secretary-General \nhas produced his report \\\"An Agenda for Peace: Preventive diplomacy, \npeacemaking and peace-keeping\\\" (A/47/277). Not every United Nations Member \nwill agree with its analysis. Nor will all the recommendations be universally \nendorsed. But it is a far-reaching document with concrete proposals for the \nmaintenance of international peace and security. \n\nIt also contains the Secretary-General's recommendations on ways to strengthen \nand make more efficient the capacity of the United Nations for preventive \ndiplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-building. We should \ncongratulate the Secretary-General and his staff on putting together a \ncomprehensive and thoughtful paper that raises the issues that Member States \nneed to address. \nThere is much in there for us to ruminate on but there is also room for \nus to add ideas to it. For example, the report, for obvious reasons, refrains \nfrom trying to apportion blame or investigate the causes of the recent \nconflicts. This should be the job of Member States. We need to be clear in \nour minds whether the explosion of new States in recent years is a natural and \nwelcome development, something akin to what we saw in the era of \ndecolonization, or whether it is a reflection of a state of disorder in the \nstructures of human society that we have created in the twentieth century. Or \nis it the case, as the \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" suggests, that the \\\"deepest causes \nof conflict\\\" are: \\\"economic despair, social injustice and political \noppression\\\" (A/47/277, para. 15)? We need to be clear in our minds about what \nis happening because this will in turn define the mission that we will entrust \nto the United Nations: when a conflict breaks out within a State should the \nmission of the United Nations be to resolve the conflict and peacefully \nreunite the factions as in Angola and El Salvador or should the mission of \nthe United Nations be to facilitate a peaceful division of the country as in \nYugoslavia? These are not theoretical questions. These are practical \nquestions that United Nations peace-keepers confront on a day-to-day basis in \nthe former Yugoslavia and in Somalia. \n \nLest I be misunderstood, let me stress that I welcome the new Member \nStates that have joined the United Nations this year: Armenia, Azerbaijan, \nBosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic \nof Moldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. I \nbelieve that they would agree with me that if more new Member States are going \nto join us we should ensure that they emerge peacefully and not through war \nand conflict. \nThe \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" also makes it clear that the functions of United \nNations peace-keepers have gone far beyond their usual mandate. In the past \nUnited Nations peace-keepers were traditionally sent in after a peace \nagreement had been worked out between the warring parties. Today United \nNations forces are involved in a variety of tasks ranging from \nelection-monitoring to inspection of nuclear installations. The range of \nfunctions is expected to increase. As the \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" points out, \nthese will include preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and \npeace-building. \nLet me also state the points of agreement that I have with the report. \nFirst, I agree that the United Nations should play a more proactive role in \npreventive diplomacy. As the report states: \n\\\"... preventive diplomacy requires measures to create confidence; it \nneeds early warning based on information gathering and informal or formal \nfact-finding; it may also involve preventive deployment and, in some \nsituations, demilitarized zones.\\\" (A/47/277, para. 23) \nSecondly, I also agree that the Security Council can now play a more active \nrole because, as the report states: \n\\\"With greater unity has come leverage and persuasive power to lead \nhostile parties towards negotiations.\\\" (A/47/277, para. 35) \n\nThirdly, I agree that the United Nations should work in concert with regional \ngroupings. I believe that the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nwould be happy to do so. The endorsement by the United Nations of the Treaty \nof Amity and Cooperation, signed in Bali, Indonesia, in 1976 and recently \nacceded to by Laos and Viet Nam, could make it a model for other regions to \nemulate. \nHaving imposed these significant new burdens on the United Nations it is \nabsurd that Member States, especially the permanent members of the United \nNations Security Council, are depriving the United Nations of the funds needed \nto carry out these operations. Unpaid arrears for United Nations \npeace-keeping operations now amount to $800 million. They are likely to rise \nas the cost of peace-keeping operations for this year alone is likely to reach \n$3 billion. \nSome of the biggest debtors of the United Nations come from countries of \nthe North. It would be tragic for countries of the North to assume that they \nare immune from the political and economic travails of the South. Yugoslavia \nhas demonstrated that these problems can explode at their doorsteps. The \nmodern technology spun by the developed countries has made our world into a \nglobal village in the truest sense of the word. No villager can ignore a fire \nin the home of his fellow villager, for if he does his own home could be burnt. \nWe saw this clearly at the Rio de Janeiro Summit earlier this year. The \ncountries of the North called upon the countries of the South to restrain \ntheir deforestation, their production of chloro-fluorocarbons (CFCs) and their \npollutive development, for they were concerned that the effects of these \nactivities in the South would wander into their homes. Yet while they expect \nthe relatively impoverished countries of the South to make valiant sacrifices, \n\nthey are not prepared to make equal sacrifices in their relatively affluent \nlifestyles. Given these difficulties, it is remarkable that the Rio Summit \nreached a consensus on Agenda 21. We in the General Assembly should endorse \nthe Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 and adopt a good decision to establish a \nhigh-level commission on sustainable development. The momentum achieved in \nRio de Janeiro has to be maintained and followed up. \nTo address these environmental questions squarely, the world also needs \nto reinvigorate the global economy. We must convince the countries of the \nNorth that if they want the South to pay greater heed to their concerns on the \nglobal environment, they must in turn push the global economy forward by \nsuccessfully completing the Uruguay Round as soon as possible. Instead of \ndoing this, the countries of the North are concentrating on regional \nintegration. Whatever the fate of the Maastricht Treaty, an integrated single \nEuropean market will be in place by January 1993, bolstered by an expanded \nagreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries that would \nbring about greater European Community-EFTA economic co-operation known as the \nEuropean Economic Area (EEA). The North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) is \nabout to be formed. If these arrangements benefit only the countries of the \nNorth, with no perceived benefits to the South, the South is unlikely to \ncooperate with the North on environmental issues. \nFortunately, the South has not been standing still. A major economic \nrevolution is also taking place there, affecting the lives of billions of \npeople, especially in large nations such as China, India, Pakistan and \nIndonesia. If present trends continue, by the year 2000 the ASEAN countries \nand the Asian newly industrializing economies will have a gross domestic \n\nproduct (GDP) of $3.3 trillion, two thirds of the United States 1990 GDP or \nhalf of the European Community 1990 GDP. China could double its gross \nnational product (GNP) within this decade. Clearly, some parts of the South \nare going to experience explosive economic growth. \nExcept for a few which still cling to the virtues of the command economy, \npractically every country in the world now realizes that it has to introduce \neconomic reforms. The old economic systems with their manifest inefficiencies \nand inadequacies that hindered economic growth had to be discarded. Except \nfor a few, all States are working to introduce the market-economy system. But \nsuch adjustment to open economic competition is not without sacrifices and \ngreat political costs. The transitional economies have experienced great \neconomic difficulties and dislocations in their initial periods of \nadjustment. The North should see that it is in its interest to help these \ncountries by fighting protectionism. With such support, the developing \ncountries should be able to pull off this economic transition successfully. \n\nIf this massive economic revolution in the South succeeds, the world will \nexperience a rising tide that will lift all of humankind those in the South \nand those in the North. It is also likely that this rising tide would help \nextinguish the flames of tribal and ethnic discord that have erupted around \nthe globe. \nSouth-East Asia has sometimes been called \\\"the Balkans of Asia\\\". Despite \nthis, the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nhave already experienced two decades of peace and economic development. \nThrough regional cooperation in ASEAN and the concentration of national \nenergies on economic development, the ASEAN region has become the most \npeaceful and prosperous part of the third world. There is no reason why this \nASEAN experience cannot be duplicated in the rest of the world. I hope that \nthis session of the General Assembly will give some thought to this as it \nsearches for solutions to the ongoing tragedies we are now witnessing. \n"

        "file_text": "I should like to extend my congratulations to you. Sir, on your \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh \nsession. I am confident that under your able leadership the Assembly will be \nhighly productive. I pay my respects also to the Secretary-General for his \ndedicated efforts to promote world peace - the primary objective of this \nbody. His experience and sagacity have so strengthened the Organization that \nit has been able to meet effectively the new and varied challenges of this \nrapidly changing world. I take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to \nthose nations that became Members of the United Nations since the last session \nof the General Assembly. \nToday the world is beginning a new chapter in history. As I stand at \nthis rostrum for the third time since 1988, I cannot but recall the profound \nand comprehensive transformations the world has undergone over the past four \nyears. The global confrontation over ideologies is rapidly disappearing as \ndictatorial and authoritarian Governments crumble in succession. Instead, we \nare witnessing the birth of freedom, equality and respect for human dignity \nand individual creativity. This epic transformation is neither a victory for \nany one country nor a triumph of any group of nations; it is a victory for all \n\nof us living in this historic era. Peace and prosperity are no longer distant \ndreams; they now stand as realistic goals within our reach, for magnificent \nand inexorable waves of freedom and openness are sweeping across the world. \nHuman endeavour towards peace and prosperity continues today. From \nEastern Europe to the Cape of Good Hope, and from the Atlantic Ocean to the \nPacific shores, we witness solid progress towards a more harmonious and \nprosperous world. Not only have the United States and Russia begun all-out \nreductions of nuclear weapons, but regional disputes too are being resolved, \none after another. Through the efforts of the United Nations, the 12 years of \ninternecine strife in El Salvador have ended, and Cambodia is in the process \nof regaining peace and stability. Today United Nations peace-keeping efforts \nare becoming more effective everywhere. \nHowever, violence and the illegal use of force persist, even in this age \nof reconciliation and cooperation. The situation in Iraq, the dispute in \nSouth Africa, the famine in Somalia - these and other problems are evidence \nthat before we celebrate the arrival of an age of peace we must marshall \ngreater efforts to prevent undue suffering and misery. \nWatching the tragic bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia, I could not but \nfeel that a long and tortuous road remained before we could secure lasting \npeace in our world. The Republic of Korea extends encouragement and support \nto the United Nations Protection Force for its courageous activities, under \nextremely adverse conditions, to maintain peace and provide humanitarian \nrelief and assistance in the former Yugoslav region. We also strongly support \nthe diplomatic efforts of the United Nations and the European Community \ntowards an early resolution of this dispute. \n\nWe are well aware of the many invaluable contributions the United Nations \nhas made in the fields of peace-keeping, refugee relief and related \nhumanitarian causes. I sincerely hope that the tragic situation in that \nregion will be resolved quickly and that the role of the United Nations will \nbe further strengthened. \nToday the world is becoming a larger whole capable of transcending \nconfrontations and rivalries. A new world order is emerging on the basis of \nlaw and morality rather than in terms of power. The United Nations has worked \nfor half a century, and the time is now opportune, to foster harmony and \ncooperation between nations. We must seize this moment to forge a new \ninternational order so that a permanent peace structure may be secured. The \nUnited Nations should play a central role in our efforts to attain this \ncherished goal, because this body is the one just arbiter and the forum where \ndisputes may be resolved through dialogue and compromise. \nSpeaking from this rostrum last year, I emphasized that the United \nNations should redouble its efforts to prevent regional disputes and to \nstrengthen further the collective security measures to prevent the illegal use \nof force. For these reasons I believe that the \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" recently \nsubmitted by the Secretary-General is very timely and meaningful in promoting \nour common cause. This Agenda is a very forward-looking and substantive \nproposition, which will definitely strengthen the role of the United Nations \nin all areas of world peace and security, including preventive diplomacy, \npeacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-building. I sincerely hope that the \nmembers of this body at the General Assembly during the course of this \nsession and in related organs - will seriously consider the proposals \ncontained in the Agenda so that consensus may emerge within the international \n\ncommunity. The Republic of Korea will faithfully and actively participate in \nall United Nations endeavours to maintain world peace and security and to \nsafeguard the future of mankind. \nA new international order demands a new concept of international \nsecurity. The era in which security was based on military power and on \nweapons of mass destruction has passed. Recently the United States and Russia \nagreed to destroy all ground-launched ballistic missiles within the next 10 \nyears and to reduce drastically the number of nuclear warheads. \n \nI wholeheartedly welcome this decision and hope that it will serve as the \nimpetus for accelerated reduction of nuclear arsenals throughout the world. \nToday one of the most destabilizing trends in the field of international \nsecurity is the rapid spread of nuclear and sophisticated conventional weapons \nto existing areas of dispute and potential regions of conflict. \nMy Government places great importance on the nuclear non-proliferation \nTreaty and fully endorses the strengthening of the proposed nuclear safeguard \nmeasures by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Furthermore, we will \nwholeheartedly support the extension of the Treaty in 1995. \nMy Government welcomes the draft Convention on the prohibition of \nchemical weapons, which the Geneva Conference on Disarmament successfully \nnegotiated. I hope Member States will unanimously approve this important \ntreaty at this session; my Government will accede to the Convention without \ndelay. \nAs the Secretary-General pointed out in his report, we face a number of \ncritical challenges, such as the eradication of starvation and world poverty, \nthe plight of refugees, respect for human rights and the protection of the \nenvironment. \nEmancipation from the yoke of poverty and underdevelopment is an urgent \nissue that we must resolve for the lasting peace and prosperity of mankind. \nWe can speak of peace and prosperity only after we successfully eliminate such \nfundamental threats to human life as poverty, hunger, disease and \nunderdevelopment. To the starved and wretched, justice sounds hollow. To the \nsick and disaffected, peace is meaningless. \nJust as ardent aspirations to freedom and prosperity ended the cold war, \nwe must now combine our efforts to eradicate poverty and underdevelopment. \n \nToday, although the East-West confrontation has ended, the gap between \nNorth and South is widening by the day. What is most needed to mitigate this \ndisparity is a concerted effort between the advanced and developing \ncountries. For their part, developing countries should concentrate greater \nefforts on economic development and the improvement of their standards of \nliving. In efforts to eliminate poverty from underdeveloped regions and to \nimprove living standards there, advanced countries should provide succour in \nthe forms of economic aid, investment and the transfer of technology on an \nactive and continuing basis. \nWe can surmount these challenges if we all agree that there is but one \nworld community, of which all of us are a part. \nThe Korean people inherited generations of chronic poverty. What little \nremained on their land was reduced to ashes in the course of the Korean War, \nthe most violent conflagration of the post-war period. Rising from the \ndestruction of war, we have built within a generation an economy that ranks \namong the dozen largest trading nations in the world. Our country is not \nendowed with rich natural resources, and we have carried a heavy defence \nburden. We stand prepared to share this experience with the developing world \nand those countries under fundamental reforms. \nWe distinctly remember the miseries of poverty and underdevelopment and \nthe generous assistance and cooperation we received from advanced countries. \nWe will act as a bridge between North and South by sharing information and \nknow-how and by promoting exchange and cooperation. Korea will actively \nparticipate in, and make contributions commensurate with its ability to, the \neffective resolution of the North-South problem. \n\nThe natural environment is not ours to abuse. It not only represents our \npast, but also foreshadows our future. The United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development last June will be recognized as a new beginning in \nthe preservation of our environment. Having reconfirmed the fact that our \nPlanet Earth is the very source of life not only for our generation but for \nposterity as well, the world community agreed on a plan of action to protect \nour environment at the global level. \nI sincerely hope that all countries will take the necessary steps \ndomestically and cooperate in implementing measures internationally in the \nspirit of the Rio Declaration and the Rio Conference. \nEnvironmental preservation and economic development should no longer be \ntreated as mutually exclusive goals, but as complementary objectives. \nHowever, it would not be fair to impose unreasonable environmental \nrestrictions on those developing countries that began industrialization \nbelatedly due to chronic poverty, underdevelopment and the lack of sufficient \nresources. A new path toward a century of peace and prosperity should not be \ndesigned at the expense of the developing world. \nEnvironmental protection has now become a national objective of my \ncountry. Last June Korea adopted for the first time a National Charter for \nthe Environment, and we set up a special intragovernmental coordinating body \nto oversee environmental policy implementation. \nThe United Nations is a most effective organization for solving such \nglobal issues as environmental protection. Korea will actively participate \nand undertake appropriate roles in all United Nations efforts toward this end. \nSystematic human-rights violations persist even as the waves of freedom \nand the rights of individuals sweep across the world. The violation of \n\nfundamental human rights cannot be justified under any pretext. The \nprotection of these rights is our collective responsibility. International \nrelief and assistance efforts should be strengthened to protect refugees from \nwar and internecine strife as well as from poverty. \nThe protection of minorities is a human-rights issue directly linked not \nonly to the stability of the countries concerned, but also to world peace. \nConsequently, all Member States must observe their obligations faithfully. \nThe Republic of Korea extends full support to the 1993 World Conference \non Human Rights. I hope it will serve as a momentous occasion for \nstrengthening an international system for the protection of human rights. \nThe winds of reconciliation and cooperation that swept across the \nEurasian continent are now blowing over North-East Asia. I am pleased to \nreport that the Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China \nnormalized relations last month. As a result, the cold-war rigidities that \nkept North-East Asia frozen for the past 47 years have finally begun to melt \naway. This is a significant step towards alleviating the agony of the tragic \nfratricidal war in Korea. The vigorous pursuit of a Northern Policy to bring \nlasting peace to the Korean peninsula has returned a favorable response. \nDuring the past four and a half years Korea established diplomatic \nrelations with 39 countries, for a total of 165 countries. Diplomatic \nrelations between Korea and China and my official visit to Beijing next week \nare expected to contribute to reduced tensions on the Korean peninsula and to \npeace-making efforts in North-East Asia. North-East Asia has thus begun the \nmarch towards a new era of lasting peace and common prosperity. \nSpeaking to the Assembly from this very rostrum four years ago, I \nmentioned the desirability of a consultative conference for peace in \n\nNorth-East Asia. I note that many hurdles still stand in the way of the \nrealization of such a proposal. Times are changing, however. Depending on \nour determination, we can turn such ideas into reality. \nIn the highly sensitive region of North-East Asia, which has seen five \nmajor wars in the past 100 years, efforts to build a structure of lasting \npeace are very desirable for both regional stability and world peace. \nTherefore, I hope an opportunity for dialogue between all interested parties \nwill be found for the purposes of building trust and promoting mutual \nunderstanding, confidence and common prosperity. \nOnce mutual understanding and a forum of cooperation are established, I \nbelieve that we can realistically expect the emergence of a new order of peace \nin North-East Asia. \n\nTwo years ago dialogue between the Prime Ministers of the two Koreas was \ninitiated. Thus far, eight rounds of meetings have been held alternately in \nSeoul and Pyongyang, and a number of issues have been discussed. Late last \nyear, the two Koreas adopted an \\\"Agreement on Reconciliation, Non-aggression, \nand Exchanges and Cooperation between the South and the North\\\" and a \\\"Joint \nDeclaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\\\" Both documents \ncame into effect in February of this year. \nWe were filled with a sense of anticipation. For an ethnically \nhomogeneous people that has spent the past 47 years in confrontation, this was \na dramatic achievement. However, we have yet to see the implementation of the \nspecific measures agreed upon by the two sides. The reality on the Korean \nPeninsula is that humanitarian projects, including the exchange of visits by \nseparated family members, remain unrealized. The terms of the \\\"Joint \nDeclaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\\\" called for the \ntwo Koreas to conduct mutual nuclear inspections by last June. But this \nmeasure also has yet to be carried out. \nI must point out that mutual nuclear inspections are the most serious \nobstacle on the path towards further progress in inter-Korean relations. \nNorth Korea's suspected nuclear development is casting dark clouds over the \nfuture of the Korean Peninsula. It is becoming a new factor threatening peace \nin North-East Asia and the world at large. \nAs members are well aware, reconciliation, cooperation, openness and the \ncreation of a new order of peace are clearly the current global trends. I \nsincerely hope that North Korea will be able to improve its relations with \nother countries. Participation in all regional cooperative bodies and a \n\n\npartnership with their southern brethren towards a new order of peace and \ncommon prosperity are what all my countrymen wish for North Korea. \nWhere there is suspicion, however, there can hardly be true friendship. \nAs a Member of the United Nations, North Korea is responsible for allaying all \nsuspicions surrounding its nuclear development and thereby being accepted by \nthe community of nations. At this very hour some 1.7 million heavily armed \nsoldiers stand alert along a line dividing the Korean Peninsula. I find it \ndifficult to explain why brothers should aim rifles at each other day and \nnight in an atmosphere of anxiety and tension. But I have faith faith that \nour people will be reunited. \nThe 47 painful years we have lived apart is but a brief moment for a \npeople that has lived together as one nation for over five millennia. We will \nnot be impetuous, nor will we be frustrated. With patience, we will continue \nto foster dialogue, exchange, and cooperation with North Korea. On our own, \nwe can and will open a wide avenue of exchange and join hands in cooperation. \nAnd in the near future we should recover mutual trust on the basis of our \ncommon heritage and achieve the historic task of peaceful reunification. \nThe Korean people is confident that it has transformed yesterday's \ndespair into tomorrow's hope. In this endeavour we acknowledge the friendly \nsupport and cooperation offered by the United Nations and the international \ncommunity, for which we shall be forever grateful. If Korea has achieved any \nmiracle in recent years, that miracle belongs not only to the Korean people, \nbut also to the community of nations represented in this Hall. This \nexperience has nurtured our confidence that we can meet the challenges ahead. \nThe task now before the Korean people is peaceful national unification. \nRecent history dictates that freedom and independence await the subjugated and \n\nthat reunification awaits the divided. Only when the last scar of the cold \nwar that which divides the Korean peninsula - disappears from the map will \nthe world be able to close the historic chapter of the cold-war era. \nLast year I concluded my address with the following commitment: \n\\\"Henceforth, the Republic of Korea will play a leading role in building a \nworld that will be a blessing to our posterity a world that will be \nfreer, safer and happier; above all, a world of peace.\\\" (A/46/PV.6. \npp. 39-40) \nToday I reconfirm my resolve. Just as the divided Korean Peninsula was a \nfocal point of tension and confrontation in North-East Asia, a unified Korea \nwill serve as a fountainhead of peace and prosperity for that region. \nToday we have a most propitious opportunity to realize the founding \nideals of the United Nations envisaged half a century ago. What is needed is \na united will to cooperate and make the necessary sacrifices. This is \nposterity's demand upon our generation and history's command to our era. To \nbuild a more peaceful and prosperous twenty-first century is to realize the \nideals of the United Nations and the security and well-being of all mankind. \nAs I leave this rostrum, I foresee that a reunified Korea will usher in a \npeaceful and prosperous twenty-first century and that, when the first Head of \nState of a unified Korea finally stands before the General Assembly, its \nmembers will join as one with the Korean people in applauding that momentous \noccasion. \n"

We \nhope that Serbia and Montenegro will best achieve those objectives by meeting \nthe legitimate expectations of the international community that an end will be \nput to the war, persecution and intolerance in the countries of former \nYugoslavia, and that they will be able to become Members of this great family \nof nations. \nMoreover, in a world of changing realities, one which is none the less \nmarked by its attachment to universality and peaceful coexistence, my \nGovernment, like other Central American countries, believes that we should \nopen the way for the Republic of China, with more than 20 million inhabitants \nand authorities established in Taipei, to participate in the work of our \nOrganization and its specialized agencies as that country does in various \nregional forums and international mechanisms. Membership in the United \nNations does not constitute diplomatic recognition of sovereignty, and there \nhave been and are precedents in the history of the United Nations for the \nsimultaneous presence of countries which are in search of their historical \n \nunity but which, while they remain separated, have not been denied the \nopportunity to make their contribution to the complex fabric of international \nrelations and obligations which bring together the peoples of the Earth \nthrough the United Nations. \nWe are beginning a new era in the life of this Organization. For us, the \n\\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" of our distinguished Secretary-General is a noteworthy \neffort embodying both vision and realism that will enable us to make progress \nin forging a more secure and prosperous world. The Government of Honduras \nwarmly supports the proposals on preventive diplomacy and on strengthening the \nlogistical and financial capacity of the United Nations for peace-keeping and \nfor peace-building when peace is threatened, when peace has been breached, or \nwhen the persistence of situations of confrontation make peace vulnerable. \nIn accordance with those aims, Honduras also urges greater support for \nand use of the international organs for the legal settlement of disputes such \nas the International Court of Justice, which has only recently handed down a \njudgment providing a definitive solution to a long-standing border dispute \nbetween El Salvador and Honduras. The peoples and Governments of both \ncountries intend to comply in good faith with this judgement. \nHonduras has also decided to lend its armed forces and police for \npeace-keeping missions and is at present satisfactorily participating in the \nconciliation mission in Western Sahara of the United Nations Mission for the \nReferendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). \nWith the end of a bipolar world and of the cold war, the terrible threat \nof a nuclear holocaust has dissipated. However, atomic weapons and other \npowerful weapons of mass destruction continue to overfill the arsenals of \nlarge and medium-sized Powers. My country therefore urges those who possess \nnuclear weapons to pursue, and as appropriate to initiate, serious and \n\nverifiable programmes for the reduction and destruction of such weapons, and \nthe dismantling of possible vehicles for them. We also urge that the \nnon-proliferation Treaty system be made more general and strengthened, with \nguarantees of verification; this applies also to the regional systems such as \nthe Treaty of Tlatelolco. We shall also join in the broad movement that is \nbeing generated at this session towards seeking and achieving the prohibition \nof the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. \nIn the Persian Gulf, the reasons for the vigorous response by the \ninternational community in defence of the sovereignty and legitimate rights of \nKuwait still exist in several respects. More than ever before, the United \nNations should redouble its efforts to bring about faithful compliance with \nthe relevant resolutions of the Security Council ensuring an end to threats of \naggression and guaranteeing for the countries of the Gulf an environment of \npeace and a future free of coercion and uncertainty. \nIn the Middle East, in southern Africa and in Cambodia, processes of \npeace and reconciliation continue to move forward. Candidly acknowledging \npast injustices, trusting in the mediating efforts of the United Nations, and \nconvinced that the fruits of peace are beneficial to their populations, the \nleaders of all the parties involved in these conflicts should now more than \never before strive to bring about equitable solutions to the differences that \nseparate them, in order to guarantee a speedy restoration in their respective \nregions of stable and secure conditions of good neighbourliness. \nThe signing of the Chapultepec Peace Agreements in January this year \nbetween the Government of El Salvador and representatives from the insurgent \nThe President returned to the Chair. \n\nmovement has brought an end to armed confrontation in our neighbouring country \nand has opened the way for a complete reconciliation in the spirit of freedom \nand democracy for the Salvadorian people. Honduras associated itself in the \nwell-deserved tribute paid to former Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar \nfor his mediating efforts. We have given and shall continue to give our full \nsupport to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in the fulfilment of the \nvarious stages of the peace agreement, including demobilization of formerly \nopposed forces and integration into civil and political life of the insurgents \nin a framework of complete legality. \nWith peace in El Salvador, Central America, under the sign of democracy, \nis returning to the path of integration and development. Our countries are \naware of the countless challenges posed by the insufficiency of our productive \ninfrastructure, poverty and inequalities. But we also know that with \ndedication and vision, and especially with unity, we shall be able to overcome \nthem. \nThat is why the Tegucigalpa Protocol (A/46/829, annex III) of \n13 December 1991 has entered into force, establishing a system for Central \nAmerica integration which, working in the summit meetings of Presidents of the \nCentral American isthmus, will impart force and impetus to a broad movement \ntowards integration. Honduras hopes that the ever-stronger voice of Central \nAmerica will be heard and that our region, a region of peace, democracy, \nfreedom and development, will join and participate actively in the new forms \nof global interdependence that are taking shape on the eve of a new millennium. \n \nFor Honduras, an essential part of this integrated vision is the \nformation and implementation of national, regional and international \nstrategies to fight poverty and to overcome long-standing problems that strike \nhardest at children, women and the elderly. \nIf we justly aspire to economic development, and to growing expansion of \ntrade in goods and services originating from all continents, we should \nlikewise aspire to, and indeed make possible, real improvement in the quality \nof life of the inhabitants of our countries. Enhanced social well being \nshould not be conceived of as a generous remedy that may prove insufficient to \nthe communities receiving it, but rather as a joint undertaking to facilitate, \nthrough international cooperation, conditions for vocational training and \nbetter access to the opportunities that can be provided by open and growing \neconomies. \nOn 12 December 1991, in Central America, the Heads of State and \nGovernment of the seven countries of the isthmus assumed that very commitment, \nand, in the presence of various distinguished figures and executives of the \nUnited Nations and regional organizations, initiated a coordinated programme \nof human development with goals, objectives and resources defined for the \npresent decade to culminate in the year 2000. \nThose initiatives of our subregion are universal in conception. That is \nwhy Honduras, like Chile and other friendly countries, will continue to give \nimpetus to, and participate in, the appropriate preparations for and holding \nof a world conference on social and human development that may serve as a \nforum for reflection and initiatives to effectively set in motion \ninternational measures and policies in this respect. \nIn an ever more integrated world, our countries, which share not only a \nrich cultural heritage exemplified by the common use of a single language, but \n\nalso a democratic and modern vision of international relations, are naturally \nseeking to strengthen our links of fraternal friendship and our presence in \nthe world. Those are the fundamental reasons that led us to constitute the \nIbero-American Conference, which, following its founding declaration in \nGuadalajara, signed in July 1991 by the Heads of State and Government of the \nHispanic-American countries, Brazil, Spain and Portugal, has now formally been \nconstituted. \nWithin the Ibero-American Conference, as a mechanism for interaction and \ncooperation, we have been designing programmes of mutual benefit primarily in \nthe fields of education, exchanges of programmes via satellite, the creation \nof an indigenous fund and the launching of a broad programme of exchanges of \nscholars and researchers. \nThe Summit of Heads of State and Government held in Madrid this year also \ngave support to growing and leading involvement by our countries in a world \nprogramme of human development. \nMaintenance of an open multilateral trading system is of vital importance \nto the expansion of world trade and the economic development of all \ncountries. For that reason we must join our efforts to bring about the speedy \nculmination, on satisfactory terms, of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade \nNegotiations. Stagnation of the negotiating process would have very serious \nconsequences for world trade and would affect prospects and the structural \nprogrammes that many developing countries have undertaken at the cost of great \nsacrifice to find our proper place in the trend towards large trading blocs. \nThis year there has been a dramatic fall in the prices of commodities \nessential to our economies. This leads us to stress the need to bring about \nbetter regulation of conditions of access guaranteeing the growth of sales of \nour competitive products at fair prices. \n\nIn this context we must also, in our judgement, strengthen the transfer \nof technology for industrial development and more flexible terms in financing \nthe modernization of industrial plant in developing countries. \nThe urgent need to share responsibilities and to act together to \nguarantee global economic stability independently of the economic and \npolitical power of each nation, together with the growing convergence of views \nas to global priorities, were clearly and positively demonstrated at the Earth \nSummit held in Rio de Janeiro. \nThe Government of Honduras takes great satisfaction from the common \nreflection on urgent environmental problems initiated at that conference, and \nwe reiterate our support for the principles adopted by it and for Agenda 21, \nwhich comprehensively encompasses a whole programme of action in the \nenvironmental sphere and for sustainable development. \nWe must persevere in this direction. The deterioration of nature must be \nhalted. Together we can design conservation strategies that allow for the \nrational use of natural resources to meet the needs of employment and the \neconomic growth of our populations. \nThe new strategy of peace is also necessarily a new strategy of \ndevelopment. Only by growing together can we survive; only by pooling our \nefforts can we secure for future generations a better world in harmony and \nconcord. \n"

        "file_text": "We grieved \nto learn of the aviation disaster yesterday in Lagos, which caused the death \nof 163 members of the Nigerian military. On this sad occasion I should like \nto convey to the people and the Government of Nigeria our most sincere \ncondolences. \nFirst Sir, on behalf of the delegation of Cote d'Ivoire I congratulate \nyou on your election as President of the current session of the General \nAssembly. The confidence expressed in you by the Assembly is recognition both \nof you personally and your professionalism and of the important role played by \nyour country in the achievement of the noble objectives of our Organization. \nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to your \npredecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi, who discharged his responsibilities as \nPresident of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly with such talent \nand dignity. \nFinally, I should not forget our Secretary-General, \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to whom I should like to address our most sincere \ncongratulations on the vitality and ability he has demonstrated in the \nmanagement of our Organization. His report, which provides an exhaustive view \nof the activities of the Organization, enables us to take up our debate with \nspecific, current information. \nWe most warmly welcome all those States that have just joined the \nOrganization, thus highlighting its universality. \nEvents in recent years have caused serious upheavals in international \nrelations. The division of the world into two rival blocs is a thing of the \npast. The trend towards negotiation and emerging cooperation is the prelude \nto a new world order that has yet to take shape. Situations and certainties, \nwhich had in the past seemed immutable are changing, slowly but surely. We \nare currently witnessing political, economic, social and cultural \ntransformations. We hope these developments, which seem to augur new \ninternational relations, will make it possible to meet the challenges of today. \nThe have-nots of the world greeted with great hope the end of the cold \nwar, and with the end of the arms race looked to the future sure that the \nworld was moving towards peace, justice and solidarity. \nUnfortunately, while solidarity should have been strengthened, \nselfishness and the defence of short-term interests have intensified, to the \ndetriment of cooperation for the mutual benefit of the various partners in \ninternational relations. \nToday the developed countries and the major economic, monetary and \nfinancial institutions have found it necessary to link their assistance to the \nestablishment of what they consider to be democracy in the recipient \ncountries, for which it is now a matter of linking the grant of external \nfinancial resources not merely to an economic reform programme based on the \nrules of the market, but also to respect for political pluralism. \nRegrettably, on the world scale, there is no longer a strategic or \neconomic alternative that might counter this approach. \nIf democracy is taken to mean more justice and increased popular \nparticipation in the management of a country's affairs, the Ivorian Government \ncan be proud of its record. \nIndeed, the first version of the Constitution of Cote d'Ivoire, which has \nbeen in effect since independence, provides for a multiparty system, in its \narticles 6 and 7. \nIn Cote d'Ivoire, the idea of democracy has always been part and parcel \nof the political process. Democracy and human rights have no borders. They \nare universal values, which should nevertheless have national roots. They \ncannot be imported, sold or bought, neither can they be imposed from outside. \nIn international terms, this democratic process should logically entail \ngreater involvement by States, be they large, small or medium-sized, in the \nconsideration and solving of international problems of common interest. \nTherefore, it is not enough that the United Nations should become more \nuniversal merely within the General Assembly. This trend must also be \nreflected in the other principal organs if the Organization's democratic \nnature is to be enhanced. \nIn spite of the progress achieved in various fields, an overview of the \nmap of the world indicates that the international landscape is still covered \nby large grey areas of real and potential conflict. The stability of States \nis shaken by violent religious, social, cultural and linguistic struggles, as \nwell as by unusually grave economic problems. \nThe countries of the South in general, and African countries in \nparticular, with their scores of refugees, are still prey to conflicts that \nseriously jeopardize the peace and security that are essential for their \ndevelopment. \nIn South Africa, while we welcome the considerable progress achieved in \ndismantling apartheid, we are saddened by the escalation of violence. In this \nregard, we must appeal most urgently to all our South African brothers to put \nan end to the violence, massacres and abuses of all types that continue to \ncast a pall over the country and further to complicate the already difficult \nand complex task of those who are striving to build in South Africa a \ndemocratic, non-racial system through dialogue and negotiation. We welcome \nthe forthcoming meeting between Mr. Nelson Mandela and Mr. Frederik de Klerk, \nand we hope that the negotiations under way will lead to a resumption of the \nnegotiations within the Convention for a Democratic South Africa. \nElsewhere in Africa internal conflicts with tragic consequences are still \ncausing upheavals in Somalia, Rwanda and Liberia, to name but a few countries. \nWith regard to a country on our borders Liberia the Committee of \nFive, chaired by President Houphouet-Boigny and set up by the fourteenth \nsession of the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Economic \nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), held in Abuja on 6 July 1991, met \nfour times in Yamoussoukro and once in Geneva, in April 1992. The agreement \nthat emerged from these many meetings, commonly called the Yamoussoukro IV \nAgreement, was endorsed by summit meetings of ECOWAS, the Organization of \nAfrican Unity and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries as the best framework \nfor finding a just and lasting solution to the Liberian crisis. \nNevertheless, military aspects of the implementation of the Agreement \nhave caused difficulties, with regard to the billeting and disarming of the \nbelligerents, essential steps for the holding of free, fair and democratic \nelections. \nThe appearance of a new faction, the United Liberation Movement for \nDemocracy in Liberia (ULIMO), on the scene of the Liberian conflict, has \ncreated a new situation of insecurity, increasing the existing distrust \nbetween the parties to the conflict. \nWe hope that the new consultations under way, initiated by the President \nof ECOWAS and the Chairman of the Committee of the Five, will make possible \nreconsideration of the problems of Liberia as a whole in order more \neffectively to focus on the factors that will enable all the armed factions to \napply in good faith the provisions of the Yamoussoukro IV Agreement. \nWe urgently appeal to all Liberians to go a step further and to begin a \nconstructive dialogue that alone can effectively help the international \ncommunity to enable them to find a lasting solution to their problems and to \nthe future of their country. For his part. President Houphouet-Boigny, who has been working tirelessly \nfor peace in Africa and throughout the world, will fully support the process \nbegun in order to solve the Liberian crisis so that the fraternal people of \nLiberia, to which we are linked by so many bonds, might finally have peace. \nIn Angola, after 14 years of liberation struggle against the colonizing \nPower followed by 16 years of fratricidal struggle. Cote d'Ivoire commends the \nsigning of the peace agreements which occurred in Lisbon in May 1991. \nCote d'Ivoire most earnestly hopes that the multipartite elections that are to \nbe held on 29 and 30 September will take place under the best possible \ncircumstances so as to enable the fraternal people of Angola freely to choose \ntheir officials and fully to concentrate on the enormous task of \nreconstruction and development that lies ahead. \nIn the Middle East, the Israeli-Arab conflict remains a major and \nconstant source of concern despite the new peace initiatives that emerged from \nthe historic Madrid meeting. \nHope, however, has been renewed owing to the recent negotiations during \nwhich we noted with satisfaction an encouraging attitude on the part of the \nparties to the conflict, which seem determined to move forward with the peace \nprocess. \nThe situation in the Persian Gulf still remains alarming, and the \npossibility of the conflict resuming cannot be ruled out. Hence we shall \ncontinue fully to support, as we did last year during our mandate in the \nSecurity Council, the complete implementation of all resolutions linked to the \nGulf Crisis, especially Security Council resolution 687 (1991), of \n3 April 1991, which lays down the conditions for a permanent cease-fire in the \nGulf governing post-war relations between Iraq and Kuwait. \n\nFurthermore, the quest for increased stability in some States is \naccompanied by the troubling phenomenon of sometimes violent disintegration in \nother States, in Europe and in various areas of the developing world. The \nsituation in the Balkans and the tragedy of the people of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina are a perfect illustration of this. \nConfronted with these various situations, we must seek a new approach to \nsettling conflicts. Quite rightly, we are now stressing once again the need \nfor preventive diplomacy, which would have the effect of identifying areas of \npotential conflict and stemming crises before they degenerate into armed \nconfrontation. \nThat is why my country. Cote d'Ivoire, supports the report of the \nSecretary-General on strengthening the capacity of the United Nations for \npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping. This report has the same \nobjective as that of the Secretary-General of the Organization of African \nUnity (OAU), that is, to create mechanisms for the prevention, management and \nsettlement of conflicts, the principle of which was adopted during the \ntwenty-eighth regular session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government \nof the OAU, which met in Dakar last July. \nThe concerns and the worries that we reiterated last year from this very \nrostrum, which pertained to signs of a slowdown in world economic activity, \nhave unfortunately become reality, to the extent that we have seen a real \ndecline in the growth rate of global production of the world economy in 1991, \naccompanied by a concomitant drop in the volume of world trade. \nIn this regard, we should emphasize the substantial drop in the growth \nlevel of imports of industrialized countries, the major export markets for raw \nmaterials produced by developing countries. \n\nThe impact of such a situation on African countries has been \ncatastrophic, since the recession in the industrialized countries has not only \nkept raw-materials prices at very low levels, but has also had the consequence \nof reducing the quantities exported, thereby causing a very substantial drop \nin the export earnings of African countries. \nNevertheless, in spite of the unfavourable economic environment, African \ncountries including my own. Cote d'Ivoire, in particular have courageously \ncontinued to pursue efforts undertaken as part of the structural adjustment \nprocess and drastic economic reform, with all that this entails in terms of \nthe risk of social unrest. \nAs regards my country, those measures have none the less allowed for the \nestablishment of macro-economic balances, which means that we might achieve a \n5 per cent growth rate by 1995. \nHowever, in order to reduce as soon as possible the social cost of \nstructural adjustment measures, we must resume the still-unfinished debate on \nNorth-South relations between rich and poor countries, between industrialized \ncountries and those that do not have the means of paying their debts nor of \nrelaunching their stricken economies. \nIn this regard, we should, in the financial sphere, come up with a final \nsolution to external debt problems that takes into account debtor countries' \nactual repayment abilities. This restructuring of external debt should be \nsupplemented by the granting of substantial financial assistance, on \nconcessional terms, as was the case with Eastern Europe. \nWhile we are asking developing countries to make ever-greater efforts and \nsacrifices, we see from the analysis of recent statements by International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank heads, Messrs. Michel Camdessus and Lewis Preston, that rich countries are the ones setting a bad example in \nmanaging the world economy. These countries, they say, are not conforming to \nany budgetary discipline, which ends up costing developing countries dearly. \nThose officials also pointed out that only 5 of the 20 richest countries \nin the world have devoted 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to \ndevelopment assistance, in accordance with the objectives set by the United \nNations. Even the International Development Association (IDA) today appears \nto be imperilled in that it is not sure that it will be able to obtain the $18 \nbillion considered absolutely necessary for its functioning. \nContrary to this trend, we welcome Japan's decision to hold, in 1993, a \nconference on development in Africa. \nAs President Houphouet-Boigny has often said: \\\"The real problem of \nAfrica today is above all economic and financial\\\". He also stated, recently \nat the OAU Summit in Dakar, that the only difference between developed and \ndeveloping countries is that the former have the technological capacity to \nprocess our raw materials into finished products for their own consumption \nand to use any surplus for export, while the latter can only export their raw \nmaterials, be they agricultural, mining or mineral products. \nSuch a situation must change, and to this end, the assistance and \ncooperation of our northern partners should no longer restrict us indefinitely \nto the role of providers of raw materials but rather enable us, thanks to the \nprocessing of part or all of our raw materials, to also become consumer \ncountries. \nBut pending this development, which should not be delayed, we producers \nof raw materials, be they agricultural, mining or mineral products, fervently \nhope that the markets for the majority of our commodities will be organized \n \nwithin the framework of appropriate international agreements that would take \ninto account the best interests of both consumers and producers. \nThat is why I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to appeal \nmost earnestly to the States members of the European Economic Community (EEC), \nwhose constant support for developing countries has been unfailing, to take \ndetermined action, individually and collectively, in order to foster the \nforthcoming conclusion of new international agreements, particularly those \nrelating to coffee and cocoa, negotiations on which are currently under way. \n \nThis is also the place to affirm that, contrary to commonly-held views, \nwe remain convinced, as far as we are concerned, of the ability of \nwell-written international agreements on commodities to stabilize markets and \nthereby to foster the economic growth of countries that produce raw \nmaterials. Indeed, taking into account the overall importance of raw \nmaterials in the economies of developing countries, and in particular the \nextreme dependence of some of them on a single product or small number of \nproducts from which they draw their main source of revenue, we think it \nperfectly logical to acknowledge that these markets should be organized in \nsuch a way that, while guaranteeing regular supply for industries using these \nproducts, the prices remain stable so as not only to allow for decent earnings \nfor the processing industries but also to ensure remunerative prices and \npredictable earnings for producer countries. \nFurthermore, mutatis mutandis, such thinking underlay the idea of the \ncommon agricultural policy of the European Economic Community (EEC), the major \naim of which was to ensure the security of food supplies within the boundaries \nof the community at prices that were reasonable for the consumer and both \nstable and remunerative for the rural population. \nIndeed, no country in the world can remain indifferent to the drop in \nincome of its peasants. The United States of America and the member States of \nthe EEC have understood this so well that they spare no subsidy in helping \ntheir farmers keep their purchasing power on a par with their efforts. It is \ntherefore difficult for us to understand why the same machinery that has \nfunctioned so well internally and regionally in the Western countries cannot \nbe usefully adapted internationally within the framework of raw materials in \nthe relationship between North and South. \n\nTaking all this into consideration, it is perfectly obvious that only the \nconclusion of international agreements aimed at promoting stability in the \nrates of raw materials at remunerative prices would foster the implementation \nof production policies guaranteeing the preservation of the environment. In \nthis context, it is good that the Rio Conference emphasized the close link \nthat exists between the deterioration of the environment, indebtedness, and \nthe deterioration in the terms of trade. Indeed, Cote d'Ivoire, like many \nother countries, has had to intensify the exploitation of its natural \nresources in order to honour its international financial obligations. \nThis situation is not in the interests of sustainable development. For \nthat, as agreed in Rio, the industrialized countries must, as a matter of \nurgency, take the necessary steps to help in the transition of our economies \ntowards sustainable development, especially in implementing decisions aimed at \nthe elimination of obstacles in the trade of raw or processed goods and the \ntransfer of new and additional financial resources to developing countries. \nIn this regard. Agenda 21 has highlighted several ways to achieve the \nobjectives with regard to the transfer of resources through the following \nmachinery: through the special increase of resources in the form of the \n\\\"Earth Increment\\\" in the World Bank; through the global environmental facility \nthat will meet next December in Abidjan and whose objective is to increase its \nresources from $1.1 billion to $4.5 billion; and through debt alleviation, \nespecially for middle-income countries. \nIt is also worth noting that in Rio, several countries promised to \nincrease their transfer of resources to developing countries, committing \nthemselves to achieve 1 per cent of their gross national product to official \ndevelopment assistance by the year 2000. Some of them have announced special \ncontributions. By way of example, I cite the EEC, which hopes to reach \n \n$4 billion, and Japan, which hopes to reach $8 billion in three years. We can \nonly express our sincere gratitude for these fortunate initiatives, just as we \ncommend those countries that have committed themselves to making contributions \nduring the current session of the General Assembly. \nOur hopes are placed in the Commission on Sustainable Development that is \nto meet at the ministerial level; its work will be decisive in following up on \nthe implementation of Agenda 21 programmes and their integration. In this \ncontext, and on behalf of my delegation, I would like to offer my sincere \ncongratulations to Mr. Maurice Strong for his magnificent work and to ask him \nto be kind enough to guide the first steps of the secretariat of that \nCommission, because in our view that is essential in order to guarantee the \neffective implementation and proficient and speedy follow-up of the \ncommitments made in Rio. \nAs regards the critical economic situation in Africa, we remain confident \nof the ability of the international community to mobilize itself in the \neffective support of the efforts of the African countries to realize the aims \nof the new United Nations agenda for the development of Africa for the 1990s \nadopted by the General Assembly in December 1991. The elements of this new \nagenda, dealing with the last decade of the twentieth century, constitute a \nmajor challenge that Africa must meet with success if it is not to be \nirredeemably marginalized at the dawn of the twenty-first century, so full of \npromise for humanity. \nThat is why the African countries, aware of the importance of the current \nand future stakes, as well as of their primary responsibility in achieving \ngrowth and sustainable development, have firmly committed themselves to \nregional integration and to accelerating the democratization process of their \ninternal institutions. \n\nThat is why is it is important that conditions for growth and development \nin Africa be achieved as soon as possible, because they are quite obviously \nthe sine qua non for the true and realistic exercise of the democracy that \ncements peace within African States, peace among African States, and peace \nbetween Africa and the rest of the world. \nAs President Houphouet-Boigny often says: \\\"Peace and poverty make poor \nbedfellows.\\\" That is why we exhort the international community to show more \nunderstanding for the question of remunerative prices for raw materials, upon \nwhich many developing countries depend, especially in Africa. Africa needs to \nbe considered by the rest of the world as a partner rather than a burden. The \npartnership it seeks implies dignity rather than dependency, mutual interests \nrather than charity. \nThe bipolar world that has held sway in the international order since \n1945 has crumbled. Since the time of Alexander of Macedonia, great empires \nhave arisen only to collapse in a process that has been broadly described by \nProfessor Paul Kennedy in his Rise and Fall of the Great Powers. \nEvery century brings its share of innovations and surprises. The \ntwentieth century which is now drawing to a close has brought great changes to \nhuman existence. It has seen people invent all sorts of instruments to \nadvance thought, to cure as well as to kill. Today's world seems to have \nfound unity through a certain number of values, among which is the primacy of \nlaw in international relations. Such a development can only strengthen the \nrole of the United Nations in the maintenance of peace. \nIt is thus up to every State to support the activity of our Organization \nin order to enable it to carry out its difficult task effectively. My  \ncountry, which has always made a determined search for peace the cornerstone \nof its foreign policy, will not fail to make its contribution to the building \nof this noble enterprise and to the shaping of the new world order which is \nemerging and which, to be solid and lasting, must be linked to the search for \na world of peace, justice, and shared well-being.

        "file_text": "First of all, let me join the other \nrepresentatives who have spoken before me in congratulating you warmly. Sir, \non your unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of \nthe United Nations General Assembly. Your election to this high office is not \nonly proof of the confidence which the Assembly has in you, but a great honour \n\nas well to your country, Bulgaria. We are confident that, under your able \nleadership, our deliberations will be steered to a successful conclusion. \nI also wish to pay a tribute to your predecessor. Ambassador Samir \nShihabi of Saudi Arabia, for the great diplomatic skills with which he \nsuccessfully led the forty-sixth session. \nWe are happy to welcome the several Members that joined our Organization \nin the past year. With their admission, the United Nations has moved once \nagain closer to the realization of the principle of universality of \nmembership. We are encouraged by their commitment to the principles and \nobjectives of the Charter and we look forward to working closely with them in \nthe days ahead in creating a better world for mankind through this \nOrganization. Their admission comes at a very significant moment in the \nhistory of the United Nations, a time when our Organization is undergoing \nrevitalization and reorganization and is poised to meet the new challenges in \nthe rapidly changing international scene.* \nThe successes of the United Nations and the important contribution that \nit is expected to make towards the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity will in no small measure depend on the efforts of our new \nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. We commend him for his timely \nreport, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", in which he analyses and offers pragmatic \nrecommendations on ways of strengthening and making more efficient the \ncapacity of the United Nations for preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and \npeace-keeping. \nSecurity based on the old theory of deterrence has failed to guarantee \nmankind a world without the threat of war and nuclear holocaust. Kenya \n\nbelieves that peace is not merely the absence of war but the absence of the \nthreat of war or of the use of force in international relations and in all \nspheres of life as well. The end of super-Power rivalry and the demise of the \ncold-war era offer the world a rare opportunity not only to reorganize \ninternational relations but also to create a peaceful atmosphere devoid of \nnuclear threat. Positive steps have been taken in Geneva in the Conference on \nDisarmament through the successful conclusion of the negotiations on the \nchemical weapons Convention. Kenya is happy to be among the many States which \nhave sponsored a draft resolution, to be placed before this Assembly at the \ncurrent session, on chemical and bacteriological weapons under the Convention \non the prohibition of the development, production, stockpiling and use of \nchemical weapons. \nAs important as all these developments are, Kenya still holds to the view \nthat a comprehensive test ban is the only viable way of stopping the momentum \nof the nuclear arms race. It is the most appropriate tool for practical arms \ncontrol policies geared towards preventing further arms escalation. In this \nregard, the accession by China and France to the non-proliferation Treaty is a \nwelcome step in the right direction. \nKenya welcomed without reservation the collapse of the bipolar structure \nof the cold war. However, the consequences of the change have been \ndevastating to some and catastrophic to others. One thing is clear. The \nchanges, although desired and necessary, have come in too rapidly for most. \nConsequently, instead of being a triumph for democracy, the changes now \npresent a serious challenge, not only for democracy and the survival of the \ndemocratic institutions they were meant to strengthen, but also a severe test \nof the will and the capacity of the United Nations and its institutions to \nrespond effectively to the resultant crises. \n\nSomalia is a particularly distressing example. In the words of our \nSecretary-General, as contained in his report of 11 September 1992 on the work \nof this Organization: \n\\\"Somalia poses a particularly difficult challenge to the United \nNations. A means must be found of responding to the urgent and \noverwhelming needs of a population increasingly desperate in the face of \nwidespread hunger, the absence of national administration, almost \ncomplete destruction of basic infrastructure and acute insecurity.\\\" \n(A/47/1, para. 145) \nAs a neighbour to Somalia, Kenya has had to bear more than its fair share \nof Somali refugees, now standing at well over half a million people. Close to \n6 million out of Somali's population of 7 million people are in serious \ndistress, with some 2 million condemned to certain death before this human \ntragedy is eventually brought to a conclusion. \n \nWe thank the Secretary-General and his team for their tireless efforts in \nputting together a comprehensive and multifaceted programme of action covering \nhumanitarian relief, the consolidation of a cease-fire, the reduction of \norganized violence and national reconciliation. The United Nations \nUnder-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Ambassador Jan Eliasson, has \nalso done commendably well in coordinating United Nations assistance to \nSomalia. Kenya still remains ready to offer the necessary facilities to \nUnited Nations agencies, and inter-governmental and non-governmental \norganizations to assist Somalia. \nWhile humanitarian assistance is of the utmost priority in the present \ncircumstances, we in Kenya have not lost sight of the paramount importance of \nthe need for a round table. There is absolutely no alternative to dialogue. \nMy President, His Excellency Daniel Arap Moi, has constantly reminded the \nSomali leaders that they must put the interests of the Somali people before \ntheir own narrow and personal interests. Kenya will do whatever it can, along \nwith its neighbours, to assist all Somali factions, without exclusion, to come \ntogether and discuss a durable solution to this tragedy. \nElsewhere in Africa there have been encouraging trends of reconciliation \nand amicable solutions to ethnic or ideological conflicts, which have retarded \nprogress for decades. We salute the people of Mozambique and Angola for \nopting for dialogue to solve their differences. \nWe also look forward to a peaceful solution, at long last, to the \nproblems of Cambodia and divided Korea, and support the initiatives in Central \nAmerica to solve their problems through the regional approach, as provided for \nin the Charter. \n\nThe situation in the Middle East is still far from settled. However we \nexpress cautious optimism at the current rounds of talks initiated by \nSecretary of State James Baker, involving the most important protagonists in \nthe Middle East conflict, the Palestinians. \nThe developments in South Africa are also of great encouragement to us. \nWe look forward to the resumption of the Convention for a Democratic South \nAfrica (CODESA) talks in order to accelerate movement towards genuine \ndemocracy in that country. \nThis session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time of \nincreased globalization of the world economy with promising opportunities for \nall countries, rich and poor. Unfortunately the benefits accruing from this \nglobalization are not being uniformly distributed. The economies of the \ndeveloping countries are characterized by a mounting debt burden, negative \nbalance-of-payments positions, declining investments, reduced external \ncreditworthiness, and a general backsliding in economic development. \nThe flow of international development finance to developing countries, \nboth official and commercial, has continued to decline at a time when more is \nneeded. This has resulted in the net outflow of resources from the developing \nto the developed countries. In order to reverse this negative trend, the \ndeveloped countries and the international financial institutions need to \nintensify their efforts to increase substantially the rate of financial flows \nto the developing countries on a continuous and assured basis. \nDonor countries which have not done so should make every effort to reach \nthe target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product in official \ndevelopment assistance to the developing countries as set out in the United \nNations International Development Strategy. Aid conditionalities and \n\ncross-conditionalities imposed on the developing countries by a number of \ndonors should be lifted. They are unrealistically stringent and \ncounter-productive. There is, therefore, urgent need for donors to re-examine \ntheir policies in international cooperation in order to avoid actions that \nhurt the already debt-ridden economies of the recipient countries. \nThe external debt crisis of the developing countries is being exacerbated \nby volatile exchange rates and currency fluctuations, the collapse of \ncommodity prices, a general deterioration in the terms of trade of the debtor \ncountries and the domestic financial and economic policies of the creditor \ncountries. In an effort to lower inflation the creditor countries have \nadopted measures which have reduced opportunities for the exports of the \ndeveloping countries and led to higher interest rates, further jeopardizing \nthe ability of the debtor countries to meet their debt obligations. \nKenya feels that any meaningful solution to the debt crisis must address \nthe real causes of the problem with a view to obtaining a durable solution. \nWe welcome the efforts taken by some members of the donor community to reduce \nor cancel the debts owed by the developing countries. An effective and \nlasting solution to the debt problem of developing countries can be achieved \nonly through measures directed towards the revitalization of the economic \ngrowth and development of the developing countries. \nTrade protectionism and the failure by the developed countries totally to \nobserve international trade practices have also contributed to reduced market \nopportunities for the exports of the developing countries. Protectionism, \nalong with subsidies, has adversely affected the ability of the developing \ncountries, particularly those in Africa, to earn badly needed foreign exchange \nand has resulted in developing countries losing some $500 billion a year. \n\nThat is 10 times more than the amount of foreign assistance granted to these \ncountries. The situation is worsened by the steeply declining prices of \ncommodities on which many developing countries are highly dependent. Since \nthe collapse of the International Coffee Agreement in 1989, for example, \ncoffee-producing countries have lost more than $10 billion. \nIn order to reverse this unfavourable trend, the developed countries \nshould dismantle protectionism in world trade and ensure that inward-looking \nregionalism and economic blocs do not undermine the multilateral trading \nsystem. There is urgent need for an early and successful conclusion of the \nUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) \nmultilateral trade negotiations. \nThe liberalization programmes supported by the donor community, \nespecially the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, should \nbalance between promoting a market for the industrialized countries and making \nthe exports of developing countries more competitive in the world market. \nThese programmes should also support processing in the developing countries to \ngive their products a higher added value in order to fetch more in \ninternational markets. \nSome developing countries, including Kenya, with the support of the IMF \nand the World Bank, are implementing structural adjustment programmes. While \nour countries accept the objectives of these structural adjustments, the rates \nand sometimes the methods of implementation advocated by the donor community, \nparticularly the IMF and the World Bank, are out of step with our political, \neconomic or social capacity to absorb them. Kenya is convinced that the \nsustainability of these programmes cannot be guaranteed unless they are \ncompatible with political and social situations in the recipient countries. \n\nKenya believes that peace, security and stability cannot be assured in \nthe face of the abject poverty in which millions of people in developing \ncountries live. We fully endorse the position of developing countries members \nof the Group of 77 that the eradication of poverty constitutes a major \nchallenge at the present time. That must be the goal in the revitalization of \ngrowth and in sustainable development in developing countries. We equally \nsupport and endorse the recommendation of the Economic and Social Council at \nits 1992 substantive session that the General Assembly should convene a world \nsummit for social development in 1995. Such a conference would contribute to \nthe important objective of putting people at the centre of development and \ninternational cooperation. Eradication of poverty is a national objective in \nKenya and every effort is being made towards that end. \n\nKenya, like many other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, has had its share \nof drought and of the shortage of food, which have been compounded by the \nrefugee problem. The persistent critical economic and social problems in \nAfrica, coupled with the debt-burden, declining prices of commodities, \nvagaries of climate and weather conditions, environmental degradation, \npopulation increase, and social as well as political effects of structural \nadjustment, have all added to the deterioration of living standards and have \nfrustrated efforts for economic recovery. Almost 40 million people in \nsub-Saharan Africa are currently faced with the threat of starvation. \nThe Government of Kenya is most appreciative of the response of the \ninternational community and of the bilateral assistance from friendly \ncountries, in the face of the severe drought and crop failure that gripped our \ncountry. The United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs launched a \nSpecial Appeal for Kenya, alongside the Special Emergency Programme for the \nHorn of Africa. I wish to convey the thanks and gratitude of my country to \nthe Secretary-General for this timely action and particularly for releasing to \nthe United Nations Children's Fund $2 million from the Central Emergency \nRevolving Fund for the provision of water, emergency drugs, vaccines and \nshelter in the north and north-eastern areas of Kenya. We should like to make \na further appeal for continued assistance in view of the overwhelming flood of \nrefugees and the effect of the drought in Kenya. \nThe holding of the United Nations Conference on Environment and \nDevelopment in Rio this year was a clear indication of the concern of humanity \nfor the state of the global environment. It Emphasized the fact that the \ncontinuing deterioration of the environment is a serious threat to the \nsurvival of the human race and the planet Earth. The agreements reached in \n\nRio represent a remarkable achievement by any standard despite the fact that \nthey did not meet all our hopes and expectations in all areas. None the less, \nwhat is gratifying is that the results of the Rio Earth Summit, contained in \nthe Rio Declaration and in Agenda 21, provide the basis for a new global \npartnership, embracing the rich and the poor. North and South, East and West. \nNoteworthy is the fact that, for the first time, the world community gave \nits united attention to the process of desertification, one of the problems \nfacing the African continent and indeed Kenya. This process has given rise to \nuntold levels of poverty and it is time we had an international legal \ninstrument that would focus on this scourge. It is therefore pleasing to note \nthat the Rio Conference called attention to the need to start work on an \ninternational convention on desertification, with special reference to Africa. \nIn spite of what was accomplished at Rio, we cannot afford to be \ncomplacent. Much more needs to be done. The road from Rio will be longer and \nperhaps more challenging than the road to Rio. Programmes need to be \nimplemented and treaties put into force and strengthened. \nWhile Kenya is ready to pursue the objectives of sustainable development, \nwe have to emphasize that a positive move on the part of developed countries \nis needed in the implementation of provisions regarding new and additional \nresources and technical assistance, as well the transfer of environmentally \nsound technologies, to enable developing countries to play their role. \nIndeed, at Rio, the developed countries reaffirmed their commitment to reach \nthe accepted target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official \ndevelopment aid to augment their aid programmes. While this commitment is \ncommendable, Kenya's view is that specific commitments should be spelt out, \nsince the success and implementation of Agenda 21 will depend very heavily on \n \nthe availability of finance. We also wish to underscore that the \nimplementation of sustainable development will be futile if developed \ncountries and financial institutions use financial considerations as an excuse \nfor interfering in the internal affairs of developing countries or as an \nopportunity to introduce conditionalities. \nThe establishment of the Commission for Sustainable Development is \nimportant since it will provide a focal point of intergovernmental \ndecision-making to effect the integration of the environmental and \ndevelopmental strategies contained in Agenda 21. Kenya believes that the only \nway for the new Commission to be most effective in implementing Agenda 21 \nwould be for the General Assembly to resist any organizational modalities and \nmandates that would create unnecessarily costly and large bureaucratic \nmachinery. The Commission should operate as a functional commission of the \nEconomic and Social Council within recognized rules of procedure and should be \nelaborated in the context of the ongoing revitalization and rationalization of \nthe Council. The policy responsibilities of the Commission must be well \ndefined to avoid conflicts with other bodies. It should be both future- and \ndevelopment-oriented, providing a forum for the review, further development \nand updating of Agenda 21 in the light of future economic, financial, \ntechnological, legal and other developments. \nAt its forty-sixth session, the General Assembly adopted resolution \n46/164, accepting the idea of convening a United Nations conference on human \nsettlements, possibly in 1997, and requested the Secretary-General to submit a \nreport on the item. My delegation fully supports this decision, which would \noffer a unique opportunity to evaluate and strengthen the progress of Habitat, \ntaking into account the fact that urbanization is one of the fundamental \n\nenvironmental problems that we cannot afford to overlook. \nBefore concluding, let me comment briefly on the Decade of International \nLaw. At its forty-fifth session, the General Assembly declared the 1990s to \nbe the United Nations Decade of International Law. Respect and adherence by \nall States to the principles and norms of international law would lead us to a \nmore orderly world in which disputes that may arise can be resolved by \npeaceful means. All of us must, therefore, exert every effort to ensure that \nthe aims of the Decade are promoted and that meaningful programmes are adopted \nso that the Decade may become a reality. \nIt would also be very opportune if, in this Decade of International Law, \nthe world were to witness not only the coming into force of the Convention on \nthe Law of the Sea, but also its universal acceptance as the comprehensive \nlegal order for the world seas. We therefore applaud the Secretary-General in \nthese efforts aimed at making this a reality and we wish him well and \nsuccess. We must, however, be very careful that universal acceptance of the \nConvention will not mean unravelling its core principle, which is that the \nhigh seas and the resources therein are and shall be exploited for the common \nheritage of all mankind.

        "file_text": "It\tis\tmy\tgreat honor and pleasure to\ncongratulate Mr. Ganev of Bulgaria on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. His election to this important office coincides with a critical juncture in the history of the United Nations when the world is taking a turn towards a new era in international relations, and I wish him success.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to extend my delegation's deep appreciation to his predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, who demonstrated outstanding skills of diplomacy and dedication during his term of office.\nIt is also my pleasure to pay tribute to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for the leadership and vision he has brought to the Organization at a time of crucial change.\nSince we met last year, 13 new Member States have taken their seats in our midst. I should like to extend a warm welcome to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. I am confident that our Organization, which has always striven for universality, will greatly benefit from their participation in the work of the United Nations.\nHe face a time of challenge and opportunity. The impasse that characterized international affairs for more than four decades through super-Power confrontation has ended, giving way to a new era of international cooperation. He dare to hope that the noble aspirations envisioned in the Charter of the United Nations may be within reach. Yet the way ahead is not without obstacles. New conflicts motivated by ultra-nationalism, ethnicism and even religious intolerance confront us daily.\nIn these turbulent times the United Nations must play an active and constructive role in soothing the fears and anxieties of its Member States.\nIn order to do so, the United Nations will need the full support and cooperation of all Members at the highest level, both large and small. The United Nations must be provided with the requisite support and resources needed to address the vital tasks that lie ahead. Never has the need for a strong and vibrant United Nations been greater, when we are on the threshold of a new century, a new awakening.\nHe believe that the concepts put forward by the Secretary-General in his report, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", deserve serious consideration. The need for both peace-keeping and peacemaking efforts with greater emphasis on the use of preventive diplomacy and post-conflict peace-building measures has never been more urgent. None of these indeed is a mutually exclusive concept, but they are closely interrelated and need to be implemented in a comprehensive manner. Too often, a conflict is allowed to rage on for too long, before the international community is convinced to act firmly, and too often this may be too late.\nMaldives is aware of the increasing financial pressure placed on the Organization as it is called upon to play an ever greater role in both conflict prevention and conflict resolution. It is imperative that the membership of the United Nations be committed to supporting these activities not by mere rhetoric but in substance. However, it may be fair to say that the smaller and the economically weaker members of this community will not be able to share on an equal level the burdens of the rapidly expanding peace-keeping and peacemaking activities of the Organization.\nUnchecked escalation of conflicts anywhere in the world affects all of us in varying degrees owing to the integrated nature of the global political economy. Yet we do not possess equal resources to address these problems. Perhaps it may be appropriate to consider directing a portion of the so-called peace dividend hoped for in the post-cold-war period towards United Nations peace-keeping and peacemaking efforts. That would ease the financial pressure being acutely felt by member nations, frequently unwitting victims of others' wars.\nDuring the past year we have witnessed a number of dramatic developments in the international arena, which inspire both hope and despair.\nThe situation in the Middle East and the question of Palestine still remain to be solved. He are encouraged by the ongoing peace talks and commend all parties involved in the peace effort for their courage and fortitude in coming to the negotiating table. He feel that no permanent peace in the Middle East can ever be attained unless the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people are protected, the Arab lands occupied during the 1967 war are returned and the right of all States in the region to live in peace is guaranteed. In this respect we firmly believe that the guiding principles in any negotiated settlement should be United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\nMy delegation supports the efforts of the Secretary-General to facilitate the establishment of a national government in Cambodia by the middle of nest year. The participation of all concerned is vital, and we encourage all parties fully to cooperate with the Secretary-General in the implementation of the peace settlement.\nThe progress that has been made in South Africa gives us reason for hope. However, we are disturbed by the repeated incidences of violence that have hindered the process of negotiations and disrupted efforts for dismantling apartheid and for the constitutional reforms that will ensure the rights of the black majority. We were heartened by the resumption of talks between the Government of South Africa and the African National Congress (ANC). We hope that the momentum will not be halted by a further outbreak of violence yet again.\nDespite the liberation of Kuwait at the end of the Gulf War, the international community and the people of Kuwait continue to be haunted by the tragic consequences of the invasion and the brutal occupation of Kuwait by Iraq. Maldives believes in the inviolability of international borders between countries and in this respect fully supports Security Council resolution 773 (1992), which addresses the root causes of the conflict. We are deeply concerned about the fate of all Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners still being held in Iraq and hope for their early release and return to their homes and families. We consider this to be an issue of an urgent humanitarian\nnature.\nIn my address to the Assembly last year, I cautioned that we should not allow our post-cold-war euphoria to blind us to the possibility of new threats which may endanger international peace and security, such as nascent belligerent nationalism, political hegemony, excessive protectionism and racism coming to the forefront once again.\nIt is with regret that I note that many of the fears that I had then are coming all too true today. The emergence of age-old rivalries based purely on ethnic differences and religious intolerance in the Republics of the former Yugoslavia have shocked and horrified the international community. The atrocities being committed against the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the name of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" defy description. The oppression of ethnic minorities, indiscriminate killings and illegal arrests of innocent civilians must cease immediately. The international community should commit itself fully to the task of restoring peace in that region so that its peoples may resume their lives in peace and harmony.\nThe world has seen remarkable progress in the realm of disarmament in recent years. Most noteworthy in this respect has been the agreement reached between the United States and the Russian Federation to reduce their nuclear arsenals by nearly 70 per cent. While we welcome that agreement, we should not be satisfied until the danger of nuclear proliferation is totally eliminated and the existing stockpiles are drastically reduced.\nThe international community may consider putting its foot down harder in regions where the possibility of nuclear proliferation and the use of nuclear arms exists. Such pressure should be extended sooner rather than later, as proven in the experiences of the recent Gulf crisis. But that approach should be considered an integral part of the process of global disarmament.\nWe have always supported the concept of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace. However, such zones cannot be realized without the desire and commitment of the States of the respective regions. We feel that the convening of international conferences or broad-based meetings on the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace should be preceded by consultations and a degree of agreement amongst the States concerned.\nMaldives considers that proposals for zones of peace and the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones should be re-addressed or revived in the context of the current and newly emerging international situation.\nWith regard to the proposals relevant to our own region, Maldives continues to support the establishment of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia. However, it may now be time to reinvigorate the process through the application of new and fresh ideas. We believe that the current international climate may make nations receptive to many of the ideas that were formerly not acceptable when the world was held captive to bloc politics.\nMaldives has always supported the prohibition and elimination of all forms of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical and biological ones. We are happy to note that during the current session, a convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons is to be adopted. We fully support this convention and intend to become one of its first signatories.\nWhile we are heartened at the progress being made in the field of disarmament, we have yet to see a very tangible return in the form of a peace dividend. The continuing economic deprivation in the developing countries poses a greater threat in many ways to the security of mankind than did the cold war. It is imperative that the developed countries direct their attention and resources to the assistance of the developing countries in their efforts to become more self-reliant.\nThe continuing and widening disparity between the developed and developing countries remains a matter of concern. It is futile to believe that the world may enjoy peace and progress while two thirds of humanity lives in utter deprivation. We call on the developed countries to liberalize their trade practices and expeditiously to conclude the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The inequities inherent in the international economic system must be remedied and the developing countries given a fair and just opportunity to improve the socio-economic well-being of their peoples.\nThis is the first opportunity the entire international community has had to comment jointly on the legacy of Rio. It is to be hoped that we all emerged from Rio imbued with a sense of commitment and the determination to implement the policies emanating from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. More than any other, my country is aware of the severe consequences inherent in ignoring the continuing degradation of the environment.\nMaldives is proud to have been one of the initial signatories of both the Climate Change and Biodiversity Conventions and we shall very shortly ratify them. We urge all others to do the same in order that the provisions of the Conventions may be implemented.\nOne of the very important documents of the Rio Summit was Agenda 21.\nThis session of the General Assembly has been charged with the task of organizing and implementing certain decisions included in that Agenda. One of those is the establishment of a commission on sustainable development, which Maldives fully supports.\nAs a small island State with minimal resources that are inadequate to confront the monumental environmental challenges we face, Maldives eagerly anticipates the convening of the Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island States in 1993. We hope that all countries will participate in that conference to the fullest extent possible.\nI should also like to recall at this juncture that during this session we are marking the second anniversary of another summit of equal importance the World Summit for Children. The Declaration endorsed by that Summit has now been signed by some 140 Heads of State or Government, and over 130 countries have prepared or are in the process of developing national programs of action to achieve the goals set out in the Declaration. It is now time for the implementation of these programs. Maldives has been working closely with the members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to execute the national programs of action adopted in the region.\nWe have just completed a ministerial conference on children, held in Colombo, where the Colombo Resolution on Children was adopted. It is our hope that the objectives set forth at the Summit for Children will also continue to be given the highest priority by all countries and that its noble aims will never be neglected.\nExperience has proven that peace can never be achieved through force or a balance of military strength. We have laid to waste so much of our precious and irreplaceable resources. It is time we forged a new path for peace based on partnership and cooperation. That is what the United Nations has always striven for. We, for our part, renew our pledge of full support and commitment to the noble objectives and principles enshrined in the Charter.\nAs I stated at the beginning, this is a time of challenge and opportunity. Let us not walk away from these challenges. Let us face them with resolve and dedication. Our goals can be achieved only through political will. The world deserves no less. \n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me \nto express my sincere congratulations to the President of the current General \nAssembly on his election. I should also like to wish every success to the \nSecretary-General in his work. \nThis session of the General Assembly is the first one for Kyrgyzstan, as \nit is for other new United Nations Member States, and provides us with a \nunique opportunity to introduce ourselves us to the world community and to \nexpress our vision of future cooperation with the organization. \nKyrgyzstan emerged as an independent State at a turning point in world \nhistory. The collapse of totalitarianism and profound geopolitical changes in \nthe territory of the former Soviet Union enabled my Republic to seize this \nhistoric opportunity to establish itself as an independent State. Less than a \nmonth ago, we celebrated the first anniversary of our independence. \nFrom the very outset, we saw no other alternative in using the right of \nindependent choice we obtained than the establishment of a pluralistic \ndemocracy as the only means of creating a decent life for the individual by \nensuring political, economic and spiritual freedoms. \nThe difficult process of creating a democratic legal State, strengthening \ninter-ethnic harmony and social accord and building the basis for a market \neconomy is under way in Kyrgyzstan. Our criteria are the highest \ninternational standards for ensuring human rights and freedoms, and we are \npursuing their implementation in all areas of political and legislative \nactivity. These standards are set forth in the draft of our new Constitution, \nwhich our Parliament is soon to discuss. In the near future, Kyrgyzstan will \nalso adhere to major international agreements on human rights. \nWe appreciate the friendly view taken abroad of the democratic changes \nunder way in Kyrgyzstan. \n\nKyrgyzstan today is recognized by 107 countries the world over, and \ndiplomatic relations have been established with more than 50 of them. It has \nbecome a member of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \nEurope (CSCE), the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other \ninternational and regional institutions. \nKyrgyzstan is open to sound, mutually beneficial relations and ready for \npartnership with those countries which share our ideals of freedom and \ndemocracy. \nWe attach great importance to maintaining cooperation within the \nCommonwealth of Independent States. The meeting of Heads of State of the \nCommonwealth, which took place in Bishkek recently, might help strengthen \nintegration, but we recognize the different situations involved and the \nvarious approaches taken to this integration. \nOn the international scene, Kyrgyzstan will act as peace-loving, neutral, \nnon-nuclear State. As such, our Republic is ready to sign the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to tackle other issues related to the \nstrengthening of strategic and military security. \nOur meeting takes place at a crucial turning point for the United \nNations. The process of searching for the most adequate and appropriate \nprinciples for the Organization, in keeping with the new, changing realities \nof a post-confrontation world, is now under way. \nDistortions caused by totalitarianism in the sphere of interstate and \ninterethnic relations have led to emergence of crisis zones in the vast area \nstretching from the former Yugoslavia to Central Asia. \nWe support the ideas put forward in the report of the Secretary-General, \n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277), aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of \n\npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping. We believe that in order \nto prevent and settle conflicts, it is necessary to apply within the framework \nof international law all existing mechanisms of the United Nations and the \nCSCE. The main thing is the timeliness and adequacy of the steps undertaken. \nPreventive diplomacy and timely reaction should be given top priority in all \npeace-keeping efforts. \nWe are especially concerned over maintaining stability in Central Asia. \nKyrgyzstan advocates constructive steps and a regional orientation for \nmaintaining peace and stability in the region. \nIn this connection, we were greatly interested by a proposal for \norganizing a forum on interaction and confidence in Asia similar to the \nall-European process put forward yesterday by the President of Kazakhstan, \nNursultan Mazarbayev, in his speech to the General Assembly. \nThis forum, as we see it, could help to adapt to Asian realities the vast \nexperience accumulated by world and European organizations in \nconfidence-building measures and mechanisms for collective security. \nKyrgyzstan is now passing through a harsh economic crisis, the reasons \nfor which are evident and well-known. The situation has been aggravated by \nnatural disasters. On two occasions this year an earthquake and a flood have \nled to the loss of human lives and caused enormous material damage. \nObviously, it would be difficult for us to overcome all the problems of the \ntransitional period by ourselves. \nIt is therefore difficult to overestimate the importance of the economic, \nfinancial, technical and humanitarian assistance provided us by the world \ncommunity. The cooperation of the United Nations and its specialized agencies \nwith a large group of countries that became full-fledged members only recently \n\nis especially valuable both from the standpoint of solving their problems and \nwith respect to reforms under way in the Organization. In general terms, this \nrelates to the effectiveness of the United Nations and of its system. \nWe appreciate the activities of the United Nations specialized agencies, \nwhich, through an adequate assessment of our status and situation, are active \nin setting up programmes in our country. The upcoming opening in Bishkek of a \nUnited Nations representative office will promote the speedy integration of \nKyrgyzstan into international economic, technical, scientific and humanitarian \ncooperation. \nOur Republic became a United Nations member at a time of renewal and \nreforms. We are in favour of practical steps aimed at enhancing the \neffectiveness of this Organization as the key factor in establishing a new \nworld order. \nI take this opportunity to confirm that Kyrgyzstan will adhere strictly \nto the provisions of the Charter and will make its contribution to the \nactivities of the Organization. \n"

We are \nconfident that he will conduct the work of the session wisely and effectively \nand we take satisfaction in the bonds of friendship and mutual cooperation \nbetween our two countries. \nI should like on this occasion to pay tribute to Ambassador Samir Shihabi \nfor the sagacious leadership and courage he demonstrated in presiding over the \nforty-sixth session of the General Assembly. He indeed deserves our deep \nthanks and appreciation. \nI have pleasure also in extending warm greetings to the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. We commend the resolve and \nability he has shown in steering the work of the Organization over the short \nperiod of time that has passed since the start of his mandate and his declared \nintent to make the United Nations more compatible with the political changes \nthat have taken place in international politics and the resultant increasing \ndemands upon the Organization in the areas of peace-keeping, peacemaking, \ndevelopment and humanitarian assistance. \nI am duty bound to extend our esteem and appreciation also to \nMr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former Secretary-General of the United \nNations, for his able leadership of the Organization's work for 10 years and \nfor the sincere concern he showed over the suffering of Lebanon during its \nprotracted agony. \n\nLebanon, a founding Member of the United Nations, welcomes the new Member \nStates and considers their membership to be an enhancement of the \nOrganization's universality, credibility and significance. \nOver the past few years, the world witnessed a series of historic events \nthat have led to a fundamental transformation in international relations. \nWith the collapse of ideological barriers, the cold war has come to an end and \nthus dialogue, cooperation and realism have taken the place of confrontation, \nalliances and mutual mistrust. New States have emerged, many political \nsystems have changed, and some States have opted for more open economic \npolicies. \nThroughout the world, all of this has generated a feeling of movement and \ngiven rise to expectations and optimism. These changes and new realities have \nhad a direct impact on the status of the United Nations and its role in \ndealing with regional and international problems as the atmosphere of dentente \nhas created more and better opportunities for the Security Council to deal \nmore effectively with world problems and to adopt resolutions and implement \nthem. The increased need for the United Nations system and its mechanisms has \nnecessitated the structural modernization of the Organization in order for it \nto improve its performance at all levels. \nThe dramatic transformations that have taken place in the world have \nprovided humanity with an opportunity to tackle its economic and social \nproblems and to move forward towards the building of a better world, based on \na collective commitment to peace, interdependence in the face of crises and \npartnership in working for development and progress. \nWhile the Middle East region still continues to suffer from its chronic \nproblems, a gleam of hope has appeared in the midst of the world's changing \n\nrealities. A serious peace initiative has shaped up, starting with the \nconvening in Madrid of a special peace conference on the Middle East on \n30 October 1991, under the auspices of the United States of America and the \nthen Soviet Union. \nIn response to the letter of invitation from the co-sponsors of the \nconference, and on the basis of the United States letter of assurances which \nspecified the necessity of fully implementing Security Council resolution \n425 (1978) and of fully respecting and preserving Lebanon's independence, \nsovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized \nborders, Lebanon has participated in the peace conference wholeheartedly and \nwith clear determination. By so doing, Lebanon has committed itself, \nirrevocably, to the pursuance of the peace process within the principles and \nparameters upon which it has been based and through which the process is \nexpected to achieve its objectives, especially the objective of comprehensive, \ndurable and just peace, and the settlement of the the Arab-Israeli conflict in \nall its aspects and with all its complexities. \nLebanon cannot help but be involved in this process of comprehensive \npeace on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), \nand the land-for-peace formula. Given its history, cultural heritage and \ngeographic location, Lebanon, since time immemorial, has played a major and \noutstanding role in the cultural development of this important region to which \nit belongs and of which it is an integral part. It influences what happens in \nthe region and is greatly influenced thereby. Hence, Lebanon's complete \nsolidarity with its Arab brethren and its involvement, side by side with them, \nin the search for real peace. \n \nWe must recall here that Lebanon has borne and continues to bear the \nconsequences of the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict. Let me mention, in this \ncontext, a few of the major aspects: \nFirst, the presence of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Lebanon. \nIn this respect, let us reaffirm, once more, our total and absolute rejection \nof the settlement of Palestinians on the soil of Lebanon. This is against our \nnational interest, on the one hand, and, on the other, contravenes the \nprinciple of self-determination. \nSecondly, the Israeli attack against Beirut International Airport on \n28 December 1968. Thirdly, the invasion of southern Lebanon by the Israeli \narmy in 1978. Fourthly, the massive full-scale Israeli invasion of Lebanon in \n1982, which reached Beirut itself, the only Arab capital ever occupied by \nIsrael. Fifthly, no less than 150,000 fatalities and more than 400,000 \ninjured or disabled over the past 16 years of bloody events in Lebanon, in \naddition to the billions of dollars worth of material damage resulting from \ndestruction and devastation not to mention the human misery resulting from \nmigration and displacement. \n \nSixthly, the continued occupation by Israel of parts of Lebanon's territory in \nthe south and the western Bekaa. That occupation in itself, together with the \nattendant Israeli practices and acts of aggression, constitutes flagrant \nviolations of the principles and norms of international legality. \nHerein lies the importance of implementing Security Council resolution \n425 (1978), which calls for Israel's complete withdrawal from the occupied \nLebanese territories. Lebanon has always emphasized the need to implement \nthat resolution through the mechanism referred to in Security Council \nresolution 426 (1978), as Israel's withdrawal from all occupied Lebanese \nterritories would create the propitious conditions for Lebanon to regain its \nstrength and stability, so that it may contribute fully and effectively to the \npeace process and, subsequently, carry out faithfully and scrupulously the \ncommitments resulting from that process. \nWe believe that if Israel were to allow the United Nations Interim Force \nin Lebanon (UNIFIL) to perform its significant role properly, as mandated by \nthe Security Council, UNIFIL would be able to discharge its mandate more \neffectively and successfully. \nTo enable UNIFIL to do that would be to reaffirm and highlight the \nincreasingly important role of the United Nations in peace-keeping. Hence our \ncall for demonstrating the prime importance of the participation of the United \nNations in the peace process as it is the accredited representative of \ninternational legality whose relevant resolutions constitute the very \nfoundations of the peace process. \nThe Lebanese army which has been reorganized and regrouped on a sound and \neffective basis has regained its ability to perform its duty in extending the \nauthority of the Lebanese State over our entire national territory, up to \nthe internationally recognized Lebanese borders. The Lebanese authorities are \n\nprepared to shoulder their full responsibilities with regard to the \nmaintaining of law and order and ensuring that the south of the country \nbecomes an oasis of peace and security under the rule of law and in \ncooperation with UNIFIL. \nThe Lebanese delegation to the peace conference has received assurances \nfrom the Israeli delegation in the name of its Government to the effect that \nIsrael does not have any territorial ambitions or designs on the land and \nwaters of Lebanon. This gives us hope that Israel will translate those \nassurances into concrete actions by withdrawing completely from all the \nLebanese occupied territories. \nLebanon strongly believes in the right of all parties to mutual security, \nprovided that the security of any one party is not achieved at the expense of \nanother's. \nProceeding from the foregoing, we declare from this rostrum and before \nthis Assembly that the Lebanese Government and people are fully committed to \nthe peace process and are determined to go ahead, regardless of the \ndifficulties. We shall spare no effort in ensuring success for the peace \nprocess so that it may achieve its lofty goals. We in Lebanon attach great \nimportance to the peace talks and realize that their success will be in the \ninterest of all. We are aware also that to proceed in the opposite direction \nwill be a blunder for which the region and the whole world would pay very \ndearly indeed. \nThe Lebanese Government continues to address the tremendous problems and \nto face up to the challenges that confront Lebanon after years of devastating \nstrife. It has taken major steps towards rebuilding its constitutional \ninstitutions in accordance with the Taif Agreement and, for the first time in \n20 years, has organized national parliamentary elections. \n \nThe main task that now faces the Lebanese Government is that of \nrebuilding the infrastructure of basic services and the vital sectors of the \neconomy. Our economic sectors still suffer from the destruction caused by war \nand invasion, and the Lebanese people continue to feel the horrendous effects \nof galloping inflation due to the decline in the purchasing power of the \nnational currency. The State budget is in the grip of a huge deficit owing to \nthe loss of basic sources of national income such as tourism and the service \nsector. Regional crises, the latest of which was that of the Gulf, have also \nhad sharp negative repercussions on the country. \nThe Lebanese still await the honouring of regional and international \npromises of help in revitalizing their national economy. The delay in \nsupporting the reconstruction and development efforts that are already under \nway is very regrettable, particularly since in previous years hundreds of \nmillions of dollars were poured into Lebanon to fuel the devastating strife \nand keep its flames alive. \nThe revitalization of Lebanon's economy would be an excellent investment \nin the future of the region. Lebanon and the Lebanese have played a \npioneering role in modernizing and developing the region, and they still have \nthe dynamism and ambition to play anew that same constructive role. \nAt this critical juncture the Lebanese economy is in urgent need of \nforeign financial and technical assistance, whether from fraternal or other \nfriendly countries or from United Nations agencies and other organizations. A \nquick and effective investment in the order of billions of dollars is needed. \nLebanese laws and regulations ensure for foreign capital funds and investments \na free and open working atmosphere, the same atmosphere that, previously, had \nmade Lebanon an important business and financial centre which attracted \ninternational investments and financial establishments of all kinds. \n \nWe look forward to the establishment of the Arab and international fund \nfor the reconstruction and development of Lebanon, as it represents the \npromised and effective initiative needed to revitalize the Lebanese economy \nand set it on course anew. \n\nDespite the disappearance of a considerable number of international \nproblems, a number of national problems have re-emerged to take their place \nafter having remained dormant for half a century. The disintegration of the \nSoviet Union and Yugoslavia and the resultant conflicts are prime examples. \nIn this regard, we denounce and condemn the aggression against Bosnia and \nHerzegovina which targets that republic's very existence. This aggression has \ncaused the death of tens of thousands of innocent victims and the displacement \nof hundreds of thousands of civilians. This tragedy requires decisive action \non the part of the international community to stop the military operations, to \npreserve the independence and sovereignty of this young republic and to return \nall displaced persons to their homes and properties. We commend the \nhumanitarian role of the United Nations Nations in providing relief assistance \nto the besieged towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the face of considerable \ndifficulties and dangers. \nEqually, we commend the sincere and persistent efforts made by the \nOrganization and its specialized agencies to bring food supplies to the people \nof Somalia in their plight. We call upon the international community to \nredouble its efforts to put an end to the distressing human tragedy in that \ncountry. \nThus far, the world economic situation and the relations between the \ndeveloped and developing countries have not been positively affected by \ndetente or by the political changes that have taken place in the world. The \nproblems of foreign debt, the shortfall in development assistance, the rise in \ninterest rates and the continued trade barriers all constitute serious \nobstacles to development in the South, whereas the developing countries are in \n\nurgent need for development if a decent standard of living were to be ensured \nfor the overwhelming majority of mankind and if the prospects of world peace \nwere to be guaranteed. \nThe Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit last June highlighted the relationship \nbetween environment and development. There has been an increasing awareness \nover the past decades of the dangers that threaten the ecological balance and \nthe future of life on the planet. The achievements of the summit were a \npromising start toward a series of wide ranging changes in the production and \nconsumption patterns that countries must adopt with a view to avoiding \nclimatic changes, depletion of the ozone layer, the spread of desertification, \nand air and water pollution as well as managing toxic wastes and radioactive \nmaterials. Here too, interdependence and shared responsibilities appear to be \nthe only option available to us in our dealings with nature and in our \nattempts to achieve sustainable economic growth. While we welcome the \nresolutions adopted at the Rio Conference, we entertain the hope that the \nnecessary funds will be made available to Agenda 21 for the 21st century, \nwhich will help ensure the well-being of future generations as well as the \nfuture of life on earth itself. \nThe Government of Lebanon continues to pursue its policy of eliminating \nthe traces of the tragic and devastating period that engulfed the country. \nDuring this year, we have managed to put an end to a problem that was \nassociated with the name of Lebanon: I refer to the question of hostage \ntaking. This solution was achieved thanks to the praiseworthy efforts of the \nSecretary-General and his personal representative, Mr. Picco, and with the \ncooperation of the parties concerned in the region. Lebanon has always \n \ncondemned this phenomenon, for it contradicts the basic principles of law and \nhuman rights. Such abnormal practices never served or sought to serve the \ninterests of Lebanon. Indeed Lebanon has always been their victim. \nFor many years, the mention of Lebanon or \\\"Lebanonization\\\" evoked images \nof fragmentation, devastation and human misery. Today, however, despite all \nits difficulties and sufferings, Lebanon stands before the international \ncommunity as an example of steadfastness, rebirth, creative coexistence, and \ndiversity within unity. All of these qualities made Lebanon what it was in \nthe past and what will make it what it will be in the future: an oasis of \nprosperity, openness and a beacon. This is our plan for the Lebanon of \ntomorrow. To realize it, we expect support and backing from our brethren in \nthe region and from all of our friends in the world. \n"

        "file_text": "It is with a deep sense of humility that I \nascend this rostrum and bring the greetings and best wishes of the people of \nSierra Leone as we approach the close of one of the most momentous years in \nour recent history. \nPermit me to convey to you. Sir, warm felicitations on your election to \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. Your \nelection is a tribute to your country and a testimony to its faith in this \nOrganization and all that it stands for. I wish you success in the \nperformance of your duties. \n\nThe year 1992 has witnessed the accession to membership of our \nOrganization of a record number of States, 13, thus bringing closer the \nattainment of the goal of universality envisaged in the Charter. To all these \nnew Members, Sierra Leone extends a warm hand of welcome and friendship, \nfeeling sure that together we shall cooperate in forging a new era of peace \nand progress and a better life for all the peoples of the world. \n\nSince Sierra Leone was admitted as the hundredth Member of this \nOrganization some 30 years ago, we have come to regard this Organization as \nthe custodian of international peace and security and as a bastion for the \ndefence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of all States, and \nparticularly small States such as ours. At the same time, this Organization \nhas not failed to deploy yeoman's efforts in solving the many international \nproblems of an economic, social, cultural, and humanitarian character which \ncontinue to plague us. In spite of all that may have been said and done, the \nUnited Nations in the course of its relatively short history has not only \ncontributed to preventing the nightmare of a nuclear war but also made an \ninvaluable contribution towards eliminating those other scourges that have \nafflicted mankind since time immemorial and continue to afflict it still. \nSierra Leone is indeed very grateful for the unstinting all-round support \nit has received from this Organization and its specialized agencies in \nconfronting these problems. I wish once again to pay a tribute to all those \nnoble men and women who in the name of the United Nations and its agencies \nhave participated in the socio-economic development of our country, in the \neradication of diseases, in caring for the needs of our children and giving \nhelp and succour to our refugees and displaced persons. Sierra Leone owes a \ndebt of gratitude to them all. \nRegrettably, the problems of poverty and underdevelopment have continued \nto have a direct bearing on our country. It is also a matter of regret that, \ndespite the assistance received from this Organization over the years. Sierra \nLeone has not registered the necessary economic growth and development that \nshould have brought about a fundamental and meaningful improvement in the \nstandard of living of its people. The past 24 years have witnessed a decline \nin the socio-economic fabric of our nation, resulting in tremendous hardship \n\nand suffering for our people. Though the reasons for this are manifold and \ncomplex, in the case of our country, however, one of the principal causes has \nbeen a succession of bad Governments that conspired against our people and \nneglected their welfare, and that when not sharing the national wealth among \nthemselves conspired with foreign elements to dispose of our natural resources \nat give-away prices, thereby depriving Sierra Leoneans of an improved standard \nof living and reducing them to second-class citizens in their own God-given \nland. \nAmid this nightmarish experience. Sierra Leoneans wondered what really \nhad gone wrong with their country, endowed as it is with rich natural and \nhuman resources alike, a country that was once referred to as the \\\"Athens of \nWest Africa\\\", given its rich educational and cultural heritage. Over the last \n24 years. Sierra Leone experienced such a far-reaching decline in its \nsocio-economic fabric that the average life expectancy of Sierra Leoneans was \nreduced to a mere 42 years, with one in four children dying before the age of \nfive owing to malnutrition and other diseases; with vital surgical operations \ncarried out in constant fear of a breakdown of the electricity supply; with \nteachers forced frequently to withdraw their services for non-payment of \nsalaries and trying to eke out a living other than by teaching; with the \ncapital city itself in perennial darkness for years because the Government had \nfailed to make provision for electricity supply. All this led to the \nconcomitant and inexorable decline in the national production and the standard \nof living of our fellow countrymen. \nWhile the external factors contributing to this decline cannot be denied, \nthe truth of the matter is that the incompetence and malpractices of the \nprevious Government had so permeated all facets of national life that the \nnation was left to drift without any sense of direction. Thus, instead of \n\neconomic development, there was a national slide into poverty and economic \nmalaise. It was as if the light had gone out of the nation's life with no \none in charge to rekindle it. \nAs if that were not enough, as members are aware, last year, as a result \nof the civil war which had been raging in Liberia, at a time when Liberians \nhad turned against each other, engaging themselves in an orgy of massacre, the \npeople of Sierra Leone opened their homes and schools to them and offered them \nsanctuary. In order to end the killings and consequent suffering which they \nhad to endure, and in the absence of any semblance of government in that \ncountry, the States of the sub-region, including Sierra Leone, with great \nreluctance and purely on humanitarian grounds, decided to send a peace-keeping \nforce the Economic Community Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to Liberia to stop \nthe carnage and bring the fighting among the various factions to an end. \nIt was because Sierra Leone provided a base for the ECOMOG peace-keeping \nforce in Liberia that Mr. Charles Taylor and his band of NPFL rebels launched \na premeditated and unwarranted invasion against our country. This senseless \nact of revenge was also motivated by the fact that Taylor had been denied the \nuse of our territory to infiltrate arms and ammunition to prolong the conflict \nin Liberia. Thus, because we allowed our country to be used to bring peace to \nLiberia, we now have a war imposed on us. \nIn the course of this act of perfidy, many innocent lives, including \nthose of women and children, have been needlessly lost. The national economy \nhas been laid to ruin, as no meaningful agricultural and mining activities \ncould be undertaken in the areas of rebel activity. The cost of this imposed \nwar for Sierra Leone and its people has been incalculable and agonizing. \n\nAs the custodian of international peace and security, this Organization \ncannot sit idly by while a group of armed bandits, let loose as a result of \nthe total breakdown of law and order in a neighbouring State, continues to \nengage in a campaign of terror and destabilization of the whole subregion. On \nbehalf of the people of Sierra Leone, I strongly appeal to this body for its \neconomic, military and diplomatic support to eliminate this cancer once and \nfor all. If this is not done, there could be further destabilization and \ninsecurity in the whole subregion. The Government and people of Sierra Leone \nexpect and deserve such support, especially when facing mortal danger launched \nfrom without. We hold Charles Taylor responsible for the suffering Sierra \nLeoneans have had to endure as a result of his acts of murder, banditry and \ninternational lawlessness. \nMy country need not have been left so exposed and so unprepared for such \nacts of aggression, our people need not have suffered such an ordeal, if only \nthe previous government had taken its responsibilities seriously; if only the \nnecessary material and logistical support had been provided for the armed \nforces to repel such aggression. The previous regime again failed to meet \nthis challenge. \nNot only did the previous Government breach its social contract with the \npeople and neglect their welfare, but it also failed to safeguard the \nterritorial integrity of the nation. These factors impelled us, as patriots \nin the armed forces, to intervene in a bloodless takeover on 29 April this \nyear and set up the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) to save our \nnation from further catastrophe. Herein lies the legitimacy of our action. \nWe intervened because we saw no way out of our affliction, no future to match \nthe sacrifice that people had been asked to make over many years. \n\nIn assuming so onerous a responsibility, my colleagues and I had no \npersonal ambition to assume power for its own sake. We saw it as our \npatriotic duty to take bold and forthright action to save our beloved country \nfrom the political, economic, social and moral decline that had overwhelmed \nit. As patriots, we felt we could not stand idly by and watch the total \ncollapse of our nation. We had to act to put our country back on the road of \nsocio-economic development and to restore its moral fibre. \nOurs was a very popular move, a case of unrepentant patriotism, as \nevidenced by the mass support we received then and continue to receive today. \nBy our action, our fellow citizens have once more found strength and \ninspiration. Once more, the light in them has begun to glow and the fire to \nbe rekindled. \nNotwithstanding such popular approval and the efforts we have exerted to \nrehabilitate and reconstruct the socio-economic fabric of our nation, let me \ndeclare from this rostrum that the government of the National Ruling \nProvisional Council has not come to stay in power. In the several decrees and \nproclamations issued since we assumed management of the affairs of the nation, \nwe made our intentions and objectives quite clear. They remain the same: \nfirst, to bring to an end the rebel war imposed on our country and to \nrehabilitate the devastated war areas; secondly, to put our country's \nbeleaguered economy on a sound and solid foundation; thirdly, to take all \nmeasures necessary for the recovery of all financial resources lawfully \nbelonging to the Government; and finally, to relaunch the democratic process \non a just, fair and lasting basis. \nWith regard to the Liberian rebel invasion, my Government is employing \nall the resources at its disposal to ensure that our gallant soldiers, who are \n\ndefending the nation at the war front, carry out their duties in the proper \nspirit and atmosphere. Not only are the proper logistics being provided for \nthem, but their material welfare is being assured as well. \nBut alas, against a weak economy such as ours and facing an aggressor \nthat receives armed support from a country in our continent, which sees it as \nits mission to carry out revolutionary warfare and create instability in the \nvarious regions of our continent and beyond in the name of revolutionary \nideals, my country should not be left alone to face such foreign onslaught. \nHence my plea to this Organization for the necessary military, economic and \ndiplomatic support to repel the invaders. \nThe war has continued to attract attention at international gatherings. \nAt the recent summit of Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) \nheld at Dakar, for example, a far-reaching communique was adopted by the Heads \nof State which, among other things, gave Charles Taylor and his fellow rebels \none month to fully comply with the Yamoussoukro Agreement, which includes, as \nan important element, the creation of a buffer zone between Liberia and Sierra \nLeone. Failing such compliance, all countries of the subregion would be \nrequired to impose sanctions against him and his armed bandits. We call upon \nthe international community to lend full support to the efforts of ECOWAS and \nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) to bring these senseless and reckless \nacts of banditry to a speedy conclusion. \nOn the question of the rehabilitation of areas devastated by the war, my \nGovernment has adopted definitive measures that will be put into place as soon \nas peace returns to those areas. In this connection, a National \nRehabilitation Committee has been set up to oversee this particular matter. \n\nIt is for us a source of comfort that the international community stands ready \nto support us with a rehabilitation exercise as soon as the right atmosphere \nprevails. \n \nIn so far as the second objective, regarding the revitalization of our \nsick and battered economy, is concerned, my Government has continued to be \nguided by the understanding reached with the World Bank and the International \nMonetary Fund. My Government has demonstrated its determination to keep the \nInternational Monetary Fund programme on course. The new 1992-1993 budget, \nwhich was recently adopted, was framed with this particular aim in view. The \nsigns are that we shall succeed. A dynamic programme for the collection of \nGovernment taxes and dues has been launched by the Department of Finance, and \nweekly as well as monthly revenue returns show that effective work is now \ngoing on to harness all financial resources due the Government. The \nDepartment of Trade and the Armed Forces have taken effective steps to ensure \nthat our basic commodities are not taken out of the country illegally, a \npractice which was rampant in the past. \nNaturally the undertakings subscribed to by our Government have not been \neasy to implement in view of the weak nature of the economy and the suffering \nit imposes on our people. Nevertheless, the National Provisional Ruling \nCouncil Government is determined to see the programme through because of its \nawareness that only by succeeding in this difficult endeavour can we hope to \nachieve meaningful economic salvation and progress in the near future. \nOn the objective relating to the relaunching of the democratic process in \nSierra Leone, the National Provisional Ruling Council firmly believes that a \ndemocratic system of government can operate only within certain parameters \nwhich, if absent, will abort that process sooner or later. When the National \nProvisional Ruling Council assumed the reins of government it also inherited \nan unresponsive bureaucracy which had aided and abetted the political system \nthat had ruined the socio-economic fabric of our society. The National \n\nProvisional Ruling Council Government therefore found it necessary as a first \nstep to embark on a cleaning-up exercise to provide the basis for building a \nsustainable democratic system. For reasons of national security, some people \nhave had to be taken into protective custody while they are, naturally, being \ninvestigated. All such persons are being well treated and investigated in \naccordance with internationally accepted standards. They have been allowed \naccess to their lawyers. The International Committee of the Red Cross and \nAmnesty International have been allowed to make regular visits. Recently, 18 \nLiberian nationals who had been detained for alleged rebel activities were \nreleased. \nThe various commissions of inquiry set up to investigate the detainees, \namong others, have remained impartial. Those found innocent will immediately \nbe released while those with cases to answer will face an open and impartial \ntrial. \nI wish to reiterate here that the National Provisional Ruling Council \nGovernment is committed to the rule of law and to the fundamental human rights \nand freedoms of the individual. \nAs an indication of our commitment to the democratic process, the \nNational Provisional Ruling Council has established an advisory council made \nup of eminent citizens from various walks of life and of proven integrity to \nadvise the Government on the restoration of the democratic process. The \nprincipal task of that council will be to work out the modalities for \nreturning the country to genuine multiparty democracy in the light of our \nnational experience and within the shortest time possible. \n\nSince assuming office four months ago the National Provisional Ruling \nCouncil has brought about a completely new framework and spirit within which \naffairs of State and Government are conducted. In the first place, a new \ndrive has been launched to generate total commitment, dedication and \nefficiency on the part of all Government and State functionaries. Sierra \nLeoneans generally are being made aware that they should see themselves as \nfirst-class citizens in their own country and that the potential of their \ncountry, in terms of economic and natural resources, can be harnessed to the \nfull only by hard work, honesty and dedication on their part. We have \nattempted to liberate Sierra Leoneans from shame, restore their vision of what \nour country should be and enable every citizen to enjoy the fruits of his or \nher labour. \nIn spite of our youth we believe we have demonstrated that capacity for \nleadership, that concern for our nation's welfare that previous Governments \nhad failed to provide our country in the past 24 years. The youthfulness of \nthe National Provisional Ruling Council Government should therefore not be \nheld against us or made a reason for not extending economic assistance to our \ncountry. After a long period of darkness and neglect, the men, women and \nchildren of Sierra Leone deserve the support of the international community. \nWe in Sierra Leone continue to view with dismay the unfavourable \ninternational economic environment. The continuing denial of access to a \ngreater market share for our exports, the gradual decline in export earnings \nand the continuing inability to meet the target for official development \nassistance, not to mention the shortfall in real terms of such assistance, \ncoupled with the high percentage of our gross domestic product diverted to \ndebt-servicing. Each year it has been reported that the countries of \n\nsub-Saharan Africa struggle to pay about one third of the interest due on \ntheir debt of $150 billion; the rest is added to the rising mountain of debt \nunder which the hope of the continent lies buried. The fact of the matter is \nthat even the small portion of the interest which developing countries such as \nmine manage to pay is absorbing one quarter of all our export earnings and \ncosting us each year more than our total expenditure on the health and \neducation of our peoples. It is in the light of this that the conclusion has \nbeen drawn that all our efforts at socio-economic development will come to \nnaught unless and until effective measures are taken to address the African \ndebt problem, which is now an unbearable burden. \nWhile Sierra Leone continues to welcome the various initiatives that have \nbeen proposed, including those first put forward by Prime Minister Major of \nthe United Kingdom and since developed into the Trinidad terms, and to pay \ntribute to those creditor countries that considered it necessary to cancel \nsome of our debts, it is the widely held view, after careful study, that the \npresent initiatives cannot be even remotely effective in achieving the \nobjective of relieving debt burdens sufficiently for African countries to have \na reasonable chance of successfully achieving structural adjustment, recovery \nor growth in the foreseeable future. It therefore remains our firm conviction \nthat our plea for debt relief is both compelling and humane and hence must be \nanswered. \n\nFor many developing countries especially the least developed, like \nSierra Leone - negative growth has become an all-too-familiar feature of \neconomic performance, with three-digit inflation among its worst features. \nSimply put, this is not a situation that can be sustained indefinitely. \nInvariably, the greater the stresses many of our countries are called upon to \nbear, the less likely it becomes for the world economy to assume its own \nsteady growth. While the interdependence of the global economy cannot be \nover-emphasized, the fact remains that in a global recession the pain is all \nthe greater for countries such as mine. \nIt is primarily for this reason that we hope that the New Agenda for the \nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s, adopted by the Assembly last year, will \nattract a much greater degree of response and support than did its \npredecessor, the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic \nRecovery and Development 1986-1990. The innovative and more positive approach \nthat the New Agenda offers should be seized by the international community to \narrest and reverse the downward trend that the severity of the many economic \nand human crises has inflicted on African development. We cannot afford one \nmore failure in this enterprise. \nSerious as our domestic preoccupations are, we shall be remiss if we fail \nto see events taking place elsewhere as important. It is in this vein that we \nmust once again register our deep concern over the bloody violence that in \nrecent months has been visited on the people of South Africa. The massacres \nin Boipatong and, even more recently, in Ciskei have today become a metaphor \nfor the struggle against apartheid - just as Soweto was decades ago. How many \nmore lives have to be lost, how many more families must taste the bitter fruit \nof violence, before the South African Government realizes that the campaign of \n\nterror being waged by its agents merely increases the scepticism over its real \nintentions? \nIf the South African Government is to continue to receive the cautious \napproval of the international community for its agenda of political reform of \nits society, it must demonstrate good faith by arresting the descent into \nanarchy and bringing the perpetrators of the violence to justice. Denials can \nno longer be seen as allaying the fears of those who fervently wish to see \nchange come by peaceful means. \nSierra Leone therefore supported the decision of the Organization of \nAfrican Unity Summit to bring the matter once again before the Security \nCouncil. We welcome the decision of the Council and commend the \nSecretary-General for dispatching observers to South Africa. This \ndemonstrated the international community's continued concern over South \nAfrica, and it is our hope that the mission will help to bring a halt to the \nviolence and will facilitate resumption of the talks aimed at a peaceful \nsolution of the problem. \nSouthern Africa continues to be plagued by conflict, and the human cost \nis a grim reminder of how much more needs to be done to bring hope to the \nlives of the peoples of the subregion, especially those of Mozambique. Too \nmany years of conflict have done little but ravage the country and leave the \npeople with not much to hope for. Lately, with the proposed ceasefire \nagreement, there have been some hopeful signs. We commend the role played by \nvarious statesmen .in bringing this about, and we believe that the United \nNations should bring its experience to bear in this final phase of the \nconflict. Now that a solution to the conflict is in sight, it is our hope \nthat the world community will increase its humanitarian assistance to \nMozambique, in view of the famine that threatens the population. \n\nWith preparations under way in Angola for elections leading to a national \ngovernment, it is our hope that peace will once again reign in that war-torn \nbrotherly country. \nSomalia today has the makings of a great tragedy. With the raging of \nwar, and the consequent massive outflow of refugees from that country, it is \nessential that the international community respond much more urgently and \nvigorously to this catastrophe. We cannot afford to sit by and watch the \npeople of Somalia descend into a quagmire of death and destruction. From this \ntribune Sierra Leone calls on the Somali leaders to stop the war a war that \nhas caused so much suffering to their people end the national suicide and \nembark on a process of negotiation and reconciliation. We should like to \nexpress our appreciation to the Secretary-General for bringing this tragedy to \nthe attention of the international community. \nThe plight of the southern Sudanese people, though perhaps less visible \nand less reported, is no less tragic than that of the people of Somalia. As a \nresult of a long-running civil war, millions of Sudanese are today languishing \nand facing a slow and painful death through neglect and famine and because of \nmilitary siege. Given the perils and immense suffering facing them, we call \non this Organization to intensify its humanitarian-assistance efforts and its \nefforts to find a durable solution to the civil war now going on in that \nbrotherly country. The peoples of Somalia and Sudan require all the support \nof this Organization, and, indeed, of the international community as a whole, \nin this their hour of national tragedy. \nThe current Middle East negotiations have renewed our confidence that \nthere will be peace in that volatile region. We allow ourselves to hope that \nin the peace talks now taking place all the parties - Israelis, Palestinians \n \nthrough their chosen representatives, Syrians, Jordanians and Lebanese will \nwork conscientiously and in good faith towards a resolution of decades of \nsuspicion and conflict. \nWhat the world continues to witness in the former Yugoslavia defies human \ncomprehension. The gravity and consequences of that war are reminiscent of \nconduct that the world had wished was only a memory. As the war continues to \nunfold, we may once again be facing, in an insidious form, the dread effects \nof racism in the former Yugoslavia, euphemistically described as \\\"ethnic \ncleansing\\\". This time should be different. We are concerned over the \nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The world cannot afford to be silent \nover what may become yet another sad chapter in its history. The ongoing \nefforts to bring that conflict to a speedy conclusion and save innocent lives \nmust be intensified. We call upon all the peoples of the former Yugoslavia \npeoples we so much respected and admired to hearken to our plea, to bury the \nhatchet and try to live in peace once more. \n\nIn other areas of the world, the guns of war have fallen silent and \npeace is being given a chance. In Cambodia and Angola there is renewed \nexpectation and hope that peace will endure. To all these peoples, we in \nSierra Leone extend our best wishes and urge them not to be distracted from \nthe path of peaceful solution upon which they have embarked. \nWhen I started my address to the Assembly, I referred to this year as \nbeing a momentous one. Few years have been as auspicious as this one. The \nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development held at \nRio de Janeiro this year provided us with a renewed opportunity to demonstrate \nour respect for the environment and ensure that our efforts at socio-economic \ndevelopment and the elimination of poverty should not be at the expense of the \nenvironment. Hence, Sierra Leone welcomes and supports the call for \nsustainable development of the environment. \nAlso in the course of this momentous year we have observed a renewal of \nfaith in the United Nations as mankind's best hope for peace, security and \nprogress. Nowhere was this more visible than at the summit meeting of the \nSecurity Council held on 31 January. We saw life breathed into a dormant \nconcept, a blueprint take shape, and the first steps of a long-delayed journey \ncharted. For over four decades the Organization has wrestled with itself, \ntorn between competing ideologies, becoming a helpless spectator to conflicts \nacross the globe, paralysed with the cold-war neurosis. Our collective \nactions during this period seldom bore resemblance to the vision of the \nCharter, embracing, as they often did, more an inclination towards the veto \nthan inspirations by altruistic considerations. \n\nLooking back, many will say we came through a crippling ritual sorely \ntesting the Organization's capacity for promoting conflict resolution, social \nprogress and better standards of living, while undermining our own faith in \nthe efficacy of multilateralism. History may yet treat us kindly if we seize \nthis sense of moment, seeing it as one more opportunity for all of us to give \nbirth to the dream of the Charter. \nAs the Secretary-General observes in his report, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\": \n\\\"The manifest desire of the membership to work together is a new \nsource of strength in our common endeavour.\\\" (A/47/277, para. 6) \nIndeed, the road ahead may be a demanding one, replete with pitfalls, \nchallenging the emerging metamorphosis while enticing us to return to the \nmentality of the past. We must therefore be driven by a focused determination \nto broaden our horizon of cooperation, acting in a manner consistent with the \nCharter, thus ensuring that the peoples of the world inherit the common ends \nenvisaged by the Charter. \nIn closing, I should like, on behalf of my delegation and on my own \naccount, to pay a tribute to our Secretary-General who, since his election, \nhas left no stone unturned in exerting himself to find peaceful solutions to \nthe many problems facing our world today. We recall our first encounter with \nthe Secretary-General earlier this year in Dakar during the summit meeting of \nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) when we came to appreciate his wise \ncounsel, which we took to heart. He has been reported to be a man who was \nborn to be Secretary-General. By his leadership and other qualities he has \njustified the confidence which we in Africa first reposed in him and which the \nrest of the international community later endorsed. We wish him continued \nsuccess in his mission. \n\nFinally, I should like once again to appeal through you, Mr. President, \nto the international community for their understanding. Our intervention of \n29 April was prompted by the highest of motives the salvation of our \nnation. Like most of the representatives in the Assembly, we are committed to \nthe democratic process and to the fundamental human rights of our fellow \ncitizens. We also happen to believe in good governance, that political power \nmust be exercised responsibly and in the interest of those for whom it is held \nin trust. This is our credo. We therefore appeal to the international \ncommunity to give us a chance, to enable us to plot a new course for our \nnation and its people, to lay a solid foundation for a genuine democratic \nprocess and to put in place a realistic programme of economic recovery and \nsurvival. \n"

        "file_text": "May I begin by extending to you. Sir, on behalf \nof my delegation and on my own behalf, warmest congratulations on your \nwell-deserved election to the presidency of the United Nations General \nAssembly at its forty-seventh session. We are confident that under your \nleadership our deliberations will be fruitful. \nAllow me also to express our admiration for the very able and dynamic \nmanner in which your predecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi, guided the work of the \nlast session. His stewardship of the Assembly at a most crucial juncture in \nmankind's history has left an indelible mark on the institution of the \npresidency. \nThe delegation of Myanmar notes with appreciation the remarkable \nachievements of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the brief \nperiod since his assumption of his high office. This world Organization is \nfortunate to have at its helm a statesman of his stature and experience at \nthis moment in history. He heads our Organization at a time when it is not \nonly seized of momentous peace-keeping operations but also challenged by \nuncertainties in several parts of the world. May I assure him of the full \nsupport of the delegation of Myanmar. \nI should also like to take this opportunity to express our deep \nappreciation to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former Secretary-General, for \nthe wise and skilful manner in which he led our Organization through difficult \nand trying times. \nWithin a short span of 10 months our Organization has grown rapidly with \nthe addition of 13 new Members. The delegation of Myanmar warmly welcomes \nthem to our midst. \n\nThe admittance of those new Members to the United Nations reflects the \nsignificant changes taking place in contemporary international life and has \nbrought the United Nations closer to achieving universality of membership. We \nfeel sure that the new Members will have positive contributions to make to our \nOrganization. \nThis session of the General Assembly takes place in an international \nenvironment that is markedly different from that which existed even a year \nago. Although the end of the cold war has effectively ended ideological \nposturing and has led to renewed confidence in the United Nations, it has, \nunfortunately, not eliminated all sources of strife and conflict. The \nrecourse to arms in the Balkans, the Horn of Africa and other parts of the \nworld serve to remind us of the fragility of peace in our contemporary world. \nAgainst that backdrop, the delegation of Myanmar is pleased to note that \nsteps have been initiated to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to \nmeet the twin challenges of maintaining international peace and security and \nof dealing with global problems. The summit meeting of the Security Council \non 31 January 1992 provided an historic opportunity for taking stock of the \nsituation and exploring ways and means of strengthening cooperation, \nparticularly in the field of maintaining international peace and security. \n \nThe fresh look contained in the Secretary-General's report, \\\"An Agenda \nfor Peace\\\", is indeed timely, as the Organization, now more than 45 years old, \nneeds to adapt to the rapidly changing world. In this process, however, care \nneeds to be taken to ensure consistent adherence to the principles articulated \nin the Charter. Most important, caution must be exercised to guarantee that \nthe sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of States \nwithin the established international system are not allowed to be eroded. \nTo be truly effective the United Nations must by its own actions inspire \nand command the confidence of all Member countries. Its actions must be \ngoverned by a sense of justice and guided by the principles of the Charter. \nThe decisions of the Organization must reflect that collective will and not \nthe narrow interests or predilections of a nation or a group of nations. Any \ndeparture from those principles is bound to be divisive and to detract from \nour efforts to construct a fair and equitable international order. The time \nis ripe to examine whether the constitutional balance between the principal \nbodies of the Organization, particularly between the General Assembly and the \nSecurity Council, is being consistently maintained as envisaged in the Charter. \nIf attempts at reform are to succeed, trust must prevail; and trust, as \nthe Secretary-General states in his report, \\\"reguires o sense of confidence \nthat the world Organization will react swiftly, surely and impartially and \nthat it will not be debilitated by political opportunism or by administrative \nor financial inadequacy\\\". (A/47/277, para. 83) \nTransformations and uncertainties prevailing in the present international \nenvironment underscore the need for countries of the world to work together to \nremove the root causes of strife and conflict. The Non-Aligned Movement, \nwhose membership encompasses close to 110 developing countries from around the \n\nglobe, stands out as an organization that can not only safeguard the \npolitical, economic and social independence of its member States but also play \na constructive role in charting a course to a new global order that is just, \npeaceful and secure. Although the world has witnessed unprecedented changes \nin recent years, the principles on which the Movement is firmly anchored \nremain as valid today as they were four decades ago. So long as the world is \nfaced with adverse situations, and the freedom and independence of nations are \nchallenged, and so long as the strong exploit the weak, the Non-Aligned \nMovement, under whatever name, will continue to be relevant. In the light of \nthe evolving world situation the Movement can and must play an increasingly \nactive role in international affairs to bring about a new world order of \njustice, peace and security. For this reason, Myanmar resumed participation \nat the Tenth Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement, held last month in \nJakarta. As a founding member we have always cherished and adhered to the \nprinciples of the Movement and are confident that we will be able to \ncontribute positively to the long-term interests of the Movement. \nOne field of human endeavour which has benefited from the winds of change \nsweeping our world is disarmament. Within the short span of a few years, \nthere has been a significant number of agreements on disarmament that together \nhave effectively diminished the possibility of a nuclear conflict between \nnuclear-weapon States. For this positive trend to continue, it is imperative \nthat the momentum generated by the Treaty on the Elimination of \nIntermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (INF Treaty), the Treaty on \nConventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), and the Strategic Arms Reductions \nTalks (START) be carried forward. The agreement of 16 June 1992 between \nPresidents Bush and Yeltsin on further cuts in nuclear-weapon arsenals is \n\ntherefore encouraging. Noteworthy also is the unilateral decision of the \nUnited Kingdom, announced on 15 June 1992, to reduce and in some instances \neven eliminate naval and maritime air tactical nuclear weapons. While the \nUnion of Myanmar is encouraged by these recent measures, we believe that even \nmore significant cuts in nuclear arsenals by all the nuclear-weapon States are \ncalled for, so as to remove the sword of Damocles that hangs over our heads. \nIn the wake of the Gulf war and the ongoing conflicts in parts of Europe \nwhich are in the throes of transition, there is a heightened sensitivity to \nthe proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. My \ndelegation feels that recent accession by the People's Republic of China and \nFrance to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is a \npositive step that will buttress the existing nuclear non-proliferation \nregime. All five nuclear Powers with permanent seats on the Security Council \nare now States parties to this important multilateral instrument. This augurs \nwell for the future of NPT, the review conference for which is less than three \nyears away. \nSince the twentieth session of the General Assembly, when Myanmar joined \nother countries in proposing a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, we have \nsought an acceptable balance of mutual responsibilities and obligations \nbetween nuclear and non-nuclear-weapon States. It was only because these \nresponsibilities and obligations were unfulfilled that Myanmar did not become \na signatory. Now that the principal nuclear-weapon States have initiated \nmeasures in the direction of effective nuclear disarmament in keeping with the \ndeclaration made in the Treaty and relevant resolutions of the General \nAssembly, the Myanmar Government has decided to accede to the NPT. \n\nArrangements are in hand to deposit the instruments of accession in London, \nMoscow and Washington. \nIn the light of the momentous changes in the world, the time has arrived \nfor the nuclear Powers to reassess their need for nuclear testing. We \ncontinue to believe that a comprehensive test ban is an indispensable step \ntowards a nuclear-weapon-free world. We are therefore encouraged by the \ndecision of France and Russia to suspend nuclear tests for 1992, and hope that \nothers will follow their good example. \nThis year is a landmark year for chemical-weapon disarmament. The \nsuccessful conclusion of a convention on chemical weapons is the culmination \nof years of hard work. For several years now, there has been complete \nunanimity in the international community on the urgent need to conclude such a \nconvention. It was only because of the complexity of the issues involved \nsuch as on-site verification activity and national rights to economic and \ntechnological developments to be guaranteed as nations implement their \nobligations under the agreement that the convention took years in the \nmaking. The convention is one of the most important achievements in the \nhistory of multilateral disarmament negotiations, and the delegation of \nMyanmar would like to pay tribute to Ambassador Adolf Ritter von Wagner, \nChairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on Chemical Weapons, for his unremitting \nefforts and to all delegations that have contributed towards the achievement \nof the consensus text. Myanmar has consistently sought a total ban on \nchemical weapons one that is comprehensive, universal and effectively \nverifiable. As a country that neither possesses nor manufactures those \nweapons of mass destruction, nor has any intention of acquiring them in the \nfuture, we welcome the convention and intend to become an original signatory. \n\nThe peace Agreement signed on 23 October 1991 provided a comprehensive \nframework for ending 12 years of conflict in Cambodia. Myanmar, as a friend \nand neighbour, rejoiced at the positive development and looked forward to the \nearly implementation of the Agreement. But today Cambodia is faced with a \ncomplex of problems. If these problems are not addressed expeditiously, both \nthe peace and the economic development that all parties concerned are looking \nfor will remain elusive. \nThe United Nations has embarked on one of the most ambitious missions in \nits history to restore peace with the establishment of a United Nations \nTransitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). That organization is doing a \ncommendable job in administering the country in the run-up to the elections. \nBut to succeed it needs the support of the international community as well as \nthe Cambodian parties concerned. We urge all parties to the conflict to \ncooperate fully with UNTAC in keeping with the letter and spirit of the \nagreement to ensure a smooth path to the elections. \nThe Middle East question continues to be of concern to the international \ncommunity. Notwithstanding the fact that the peace process has been kept \nalive by the ongoing talks in Washington, the question still remains \nunresolved. A change of attitude is essential to the resolution of \noutstanding issues. My delegation is encouraged to discern some flexibility \nnow being displayed by the parties directly concerned. We continue to believe \nthat a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region can be achieved \nonly through the faithful application of Security Council resolutions \n242 (1967) and 338 (1973) in their entirety. \nIn South Africa, a democratic reform process initiated last March was \nhailed as a major step towards the dismantling of apartheid, and the creation \nof  hoped that the measure would provide \n\na fresh and compelling impetus to the negotiations taking place within the \nframework of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa launched in \nDecember 1991. Unfortunately the political process was interrupted by the \nviolence sparked by the 17 June Boipatong massacre. \nWe welcome the recent agreement between President De Klerk and \nMr. Nelson Mandela to resume the dialogue. It is our hope that common ground \ncan be found to bridge the gap between the principal political players so that \nthe communal violence that has rent the fabric of the South African society \ncan be avoided and the political process resumed to achieve the goal of a \npeaceful transition to a democratic, non-racial and united South Africa. \nThe global economy remains sluggish, and the prospects for its recovery \nare dim, particularly in the immediate future. The uncertain and unfavourable \neconomic environment is having a negative impact on all countries, both \ndeveloped and developing, but more so on the developing ones. Now is the time \nfor the global community to make an all-out effort for the revitalization of \ngrowth. Only a more dynamic world economy can bring about world prosperity \nand stability. \nThe developing countries are faced with the very difficult task of \ncushioning their economies against the world economic slowdown. As \ncommodity-dependent economies, they are adversely affected by falling demand \nfor their exports and declining world commodity prices. Commodity prices are \nat record low levels and are not expected to recover substantially. These \ndifficulties are compounded by continuing protectionist trends, moves towards \nunilateralism, and managed trade. That is why Myanmar places great importance \non a strong multilateral trading system and special significance on the \nsuccessful conclusion of the Uruguay Round, which is expected to usher in a \nmore open international trade regime. \n\nThere were, however, a few encouraging signs in 1991. Net transfer \nthrough direct investment showed an upward trend. Also, for the first time \nsince the debt crisis in 1982, there was a positive net transfer of financial \nresources to capital-importing developing countries. On the other hand, the \nflow of official development assistance to developing countries stagnated. \nInterest rates retained their historical highs, and payment for debt service, \nbilaterally and multilaterally, continued to rise. There was also a further \nincrease in the total external debt of the developing countries. Consequently \nthe external debt problem of the developing countries remains far from being \nresolved, and an equitable and lasting solution to the debt crisis is urgently \nrequired. Moreover, to halt the economic slowdown and bring about renewed \nimpetus to recovery, a determined and concerted effort by the global \ncommunity, particularly by those developed countries whose policies have a \ndirect bearing on the present state of the world economy, is a prime requisite. \nIn the emerging new global order, the United Nations will be called upon \nto play an increasingly active role. The magnitude of the task ahead will \nrequire all the energy and attention the world Organization can bring to bear \non them. The success of the Organization will depend on the collective will \nof the membership to work together to achieve the objectives of the Charter. \nThe Union of Myanmar, on its part, will continue, as in the past, to \nco-operate fully with the Organization. \nMyanmar's manifest desire to do so is demonstrated by its actions in such \nareas of global concern as the environment, narcotic drugs abuse control, and \nhuman rights. \nSome four months ago nations of the world gathered in Rio for the \nhistoric Conference on Environment and Development;. It is now for this \nAssembly to take the necessary follow-up measures to consolidate and build \n \non the achievements attained in Rio. The three documents adopted by the \nConference and sent to the Assembly for endorsement provide the broad \nframework for a new global partnership in our common quest for sustainable \ndevelopment. A firm commitment to provide the developing countries with new, \nadequate additional financial resources on a predictable basis is of utmost \nimportance if we are implement the proposed plan of action to protect and \npreserve planet Earth. It is hopes that during the course of the present \nsession of the Assembly concrete steps will be taken to achieve this objective. \nAnother important task for all of us is to determine the specific \nprocedures and organizational modalities of the Commission on Sustainable \nDevelopment and give shape to it. This being the primary intergovernmental \nmechanism recommended by the Conference for follow-up and implementation of \nits decisions, the importance of the commission cannot be overemphasized. In \nour view the proposed commission will not only prove indispensable to affect \nthe integration of environment and development envisaged in Agenda 21 but will \nalso contribute to enhancing the role of this very Organization. \nMuch has been achieved at Rio. But much more needs to be done if we are \nto achieve sustainable development for the common good at the national, \nregional and international levels. Myanmar is firmly committed to the cause \nof the environment and sustainable development, and in keeping with the spirit \nof Rio stands ready to shoulder its responsibilities. Having signed the \nBiodiversity Convention and the Climate Change Convention, we are now taking \nthe necessary measures in accordance with our domestic procedures to ratify \nthem at an early date. Since Rio we have redoubled our efforts at \nafforestation. We are also engaging in a nation-wide public awareness \n\ncampaign stressing the need to preserve and protect the environment. We \nrealize that the road from Rio is even more challenging than the one that led \nto it. We know that there is no room for complacency. \n\nMyanmar's commitment to the eradication of narcotic drugs remains \nsteadfast. Significant achievements have been made in suppressing narcotic \ndrugs through the relentless efforts of law enforcement personnel. As in \nprevious years, the destruction of narcotic drug and opium refineries \ncontinues. Such an event held in Shan State on 5 June 1992 was witnessed by \nambassadors, military attaches and representatives of the United Nations \nagencies in Myanmar. Activities in the field of medical treatment, \nrehabilitation and mass media information have been intensified. \nThe problem of narcotic drugs is multifaceted and requires a \ncomprehensive approach. While Myanmar has taken an integrated approach, \nutilizing sustantial national resources, it firmly believes that these efforts \nshould be complemented by cooperation at the subregional, regional and global \nlevels. In June of this year, Myanmar took a significant step by signing a \nsubregional cooperative agreement with the People's Republic of China and the \nUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNIDCP). A similar \nagreement was also signed with Thailand and the UNIDCP. These agreements are \naimed at eliminating opium poppy cultivation and reducing trafficking in \nnarcotic drugs and chemicals used in the refining of heroin in the \nMyanmar-China and Myanmar-Thai border areas. Talks have also been initiated \nbetween Myanmar and Laos on bilateral cooperation in the control of drug \nabuse. It is also our intention to initiate discussions with our other two \nneighbours, India and Bangladesh, with a view to setting up similar \ncooperative arrangements. We are confident that these subregional cooperative \narrangements will succeed and promote global cooperation to rid our world of \nthe scourge of narcotic drugs. \n\nIn the realm of human rights, Myanmar has been subjected to undue and \nunwarranted criticism from some quarters. Critics have unjustifiably \nportrayed Myanmar as a land where gross violations of human rights have been \nperpetrated this, despite the full cooperation we have extended, and are \ncontinuing to extend, to the United Nations bodies concerned with the question \nof human rights, providing clarification or information requested of us. We \nhave also furnished information sought by the Commission on Human Rights and \nby the Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of \nMinorities. As a gesture of cooperation we received the two independent \nexperts appointed by the Commission on Human Rights in 1990 and 1991 \nrespectively. \nI should like to inform the Assembly that although we dissociated \nourselves from the decision taken at the forty-eighth session of the \nCommission on Human Rights, we will be receiving the Special Rapporteur \nappointed by the Commission, in deference to the United Nations and to \ndemonstrate our good will and cooperation. We are confident that his visit \nwill be worthwhile. He will have the opportunity to observe at first hand the \ntrue situation obtaining in the country. \nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that on 24 August 1992 the Union of \nMyanmar acceded to the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention, thus affirming our \ninternational commitment to humanitarian principles. The principles \nenshrined in the Conventions are not new to us. They have been part of the \neducational and training process of the Myanmar armed forces and of the values \ncherished by our people. \nThis year has witnessed many significant developments in our country's \nmarch towards a multiparty democratic State. These developments attest to the \n Restoration Council in upholding its \n \nassurances to fulfil its declared commitment to meet the aspirations of the \npeople of Myanmar. In accordance with the programme of action spelled out in \nits Declaration 1/90 of 27 July 1990, the Government issued a follow-up \nDeclaration on 24 April 1992 which maps out the programme to be implemented in \na specific time-frame in respect of the national convention that will set out \nthe basic principles for a new constitution. Our past and sometimes bitter \nexperiences have shown that only a firm constitution can guarantee a strong \ngovernment which will assure the peace, tranquillity and prosperity of the \nnation. \nIn accordance with the programme of implementation, a 15-member Steering \nCommittee was established on 28 May 1992. The Steering Committee met with \nleaders of the elected representatives of political parties and with elected \nindependent representatives in June and July to discuss and cooordinate the \ncategory and number of delegates to be invited to the national convention. \nFollowing a free and frank exchange of views among the participants, there was \ngeneral agreement that elected representatives, representatives of the \npolitical parties, the national races, peasants, workers, the intelligentsia \nand technocrats, service personnel and specially invited persons are to be \nincluded in the national convention. Terrorist groups which renounce the path \nof armed struggle and return to the legal fold will also have an opportunity \nto participate. There is a complete convergence of view to the effect that \nthe constitution to be drafted should uphold and safeguard the three main \nnational causes, namely: non-disintegration of the Union; non-disintegration \nof national solidarity; and perpetuation of national sovereignty. \n\nWith the successful conclusion of the coordination meeting, the country \nhas crossed a threshold, and an important political process has been set in \nmotion. The national convention is expected to be convened at the end of the \nyear or by the beginning of next year at the latest. To this end, a \ncommission has already been constituted and is now actively making the \nnecessary preparations for the holding of the national convention. Delegates \nrepresenting a broad spectrum of the entire Myanmar population will identify \nand lay down basic principles for the drafting of a firm and stable \nconstitution. The actual task of drafting the constitution will be entrusted \nto the elected representatives. \nIn parallel with the preparations being made for the convening of the \nnational convention, the Government has undertaken various measures designed \nto create an atmosphere and conditions conducive to the establishment of a \ndemocratic system in Myanmar. These include: the suspension of all offensive \noperations in Kayin State and other parts of the country to consolidate \nnational solidarity and unity; the release from detention of individuals \nagainst whom action had been taken under existing laws and who no longer pose \na threat to the security of the country and the lifting of restrictions on \nthem; the reopening of universities, colleges and other institutes of higher \nlearning that had been temporarily closed; the rescinding of the curfew order \nthroughout the whole country; the revocation of martial law orders that had \nbeen in force since July 1989; the reconstitution of township-level Law and \nOrder Restoration Councils that are responsible for local administration with \ncivilian service personnel in anticipation of the future democratic \nadministrative structure and the creation of a separate Ministry of \nDevelopment of Border Areas and National Races in order to implement more \n\neffectively measures for the welfare of the national races living in the \nremote regions of the country. \nThe Government of the Union of Myanmar is undertaking these measures \nwith conviction and dedication. It is fully aware of the dangers and pitfalls \nfaced by nations in transition from one political and economic system to \nanother. The Government and the people of Myanmar are determined to carry out \ntheir tasks at a sure and steady pace to ensure that the aspirations of the \npeople for a democratic Myanmar are realized."

        "file_text": "The euphoria and \nenthusiasm that greeted, no so long ago, the disappearance of ideological \nEast-West confrontation and the progressive expansion of freedom and democracy \nare today giving way to general discouragement because of the obstacles to the \nnatural aspirations of peoples to freedom and legitimate well-being. \nThe forty-seventh session of the General Assembly has begun at a \nparticularly difficult time in the history of humankind, which means that \nMr. Ganev has assumed the presidency of the Assembly in a context of disquiet, \nbut also one that is hopeful, because in all likelihood only our Organization \ncan help the world to meet these challenges. \nOn behalf of the delegation of Togo, we wish to convey to Mr. Ganev \nheartfelt congratulations on his election to the presidency of this session. \nThe selection of Mr. Ganev, who possesses such great intellectual qualities \n\nand experience, is for his country the true embodiment of the ideals of peace \nand justice that it constantly advocates. We will be available at all times \nto work with him to ensure the success of his daunting mission. \nThe delegation of Togo wishes to pay well-deserved tribute to his \npredecessor, Mr. Shihabi, for his outstanding performance in conducting the \nwork of the forty-sixth session. His dynamism, his high standards of \nexcellence and his zeal for punctuality compelled our admiration and accounted \nfor the great success of our deliberations. I reiterate our sincere \ncongratulations to him. \nWe take this occasion to salute the Secretary-General of the United \nNations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the dynamic work that he has \nundertaken since his election to the head of our Organization. The \nserious-mindedness and pragmatism he has demonstrated since taking office in \nJanuary of this year lead us to believe that the United Nations will be able \nto make an even greater contribution to the maintenance of peace throughout \nthe world and the promotion of solidarity among nations. \n\nIn recent months, the family of the United Nations has grown with the \naddition of new Members. We wish to bid them welcome and to say how proud and \nhappy the international community is to welcome them to our midst, with the \nhope that in keeping with the statements they made upon admission to \nmembership they will espouse the San Francisco Charter in its entirety and \nwill comply with its fundamental principles. \nSince the end of the last session, many events have marked the world. \nEfforts have been stepped up to build a new world order which must before all \nelse be liberal, because it is based on the absolute need to respect human \nrights, which is a fundamental requirement for the establishment of relations \nof trust, peace and solidarity among peoples of our planet. \nThe turmoil we have witnessed throughout the world, particularly in \nEurope, Asia and Africa in recent years, reflects the resolve of peoples to \ngain new freedom within which man can become the unchallenged artisan of his \nGovernment's destiny. Throughout the world, peoples are seeking freedom, \npeace and justice that only proper multipartite democracy can guarantee. \nAmong these are the people of Togo, which for 13 years has been persevering in \nthe effort to adapt the structures and the basic choices governing its \nsocio-political context to meet the needs of our time and changing attitudes. \nHaving broken with the previous regime and gained a constitution in 1979, \nour country resolutely committed itself to implementing measures of \nliberalization, detente and progressive democratization of our political \nlife. These measures inter alia made it possible to hold free elections under \nthe second and third legislatures and during municipal and prefectoral \nreferenda of 1987, at the same time as they strengthened protection of human \nrights, particularly by setting up an independent commission. \n \nThe subsequent adoption of laws relating to the liberalization of the \npress, political pluralism and general amnesty, along with the development of \na draft constitution to establish a multipartite regime, shows that already in \nthe middle of 1991 the Government and the people of Togo truly desired to move \non, without undue haste, to a higher stage in the process of democratizing our \ninstitutions. \nThe tremendous speed of this movement that was started in the late 1980s \nculminated with the National Sovereign Conference of the living forces of the \nnation, which led to the transitional Government which was to lead Togo to \nelections and establish democracy. \nWe must state that one year after the establishment of these transitional \ninstitutions the Government has faced enormous difficulties, and that \ntremendous efforts must be made before we attain our goals. \nThe recent adjustment of the machinery of the institutions of this \ntransition, proposed following the consultation meeting between the various \nprotagonists of political life and endorsed by the Government and the \nlegislature, the High Council of the Republic, overwhelmingly demonstrate the \ndesire of the people of Togo to do everything possible to achieve peace and \nsecurity, a State of law that they all sincerely want to see, by establishing \nnew institutions through free and dependable democratic elections. The latest \nof these, the Presidential elections, are to end on 20 December of this year. \nThis recent adaptation of the workings of this transitional Government \nmeets the needs of our march forward, both by ensuring proper application of \nthe constitution for this transitional period, so that no organ be unjustly \ndeprived of its constitutional prerogatives, and by involving in the \ndemocratic process all national political leaders to rally consensus around \nthe values underpinning our democratic renewal. \n\nThese bodies have sufficient power to lead the country to this \nirreversible democratic peace process, but they do not have enough power to \nblock our march to democracy. Accordingly we can only express satisfaction \nthat the two senior officials of the executive branch, the President and the \nPrime Minister, have solemnly proclaimed their determination to continue to \nits end the democratic process that is under way and to devote all their \nenergy to organizing referenda set by the electoral timetable. It is at this \nstage in our apprenticeship of democracy that the new Government of National \nUnion of Transition, formed by the Prime Minister together with the Head of \nState and after consultations with the large political families, was approved \non 14 September by a majority of 60 per cent by the High Council of the \nRepublic and following a secret ballot. \nVery revealing indeed of the resolve of the people of Togo to overcome \nits contradictions in order to promote democratic renewal, this vote of \napproval, cast in a particularly difficult context, sufficiently demonstrates \n\\\"that in Togo, whatever might be said, we can still say no in full freedom and \nwithout any fear of a proposal from the executive power\\\". \nWe take this opportunity to inform this Assembly that the draft \nconstitution of the Fourth Republic, submitted to referendum on Sunday \n27 September 1992, was adopted by 99.09 per cent. The referendum met with \ngreat enthusiasm and almost unanimous support, with a participation rate of \nnearly 75 per cent. The Government will not fail to learn the lesson from \nthis first vote to correct the mistakes revealed in the first referendum. \nThis is a guarantee for the acceptance of ballot results by all parties. \nIt is appropriate to reiterate to our friendly countries and to the \nUnited Nations, as well as to the entire international community, the profound \n \ngratitude of the Government and the people of Togo for the invaluable support \nthey have given to our democratic process. We sincerely hope that this \nassistance will be continued throughout the coming elections. \nIt is undeniable that the struggle to establish a State of law in Togo is \na job that falls essentially to the people of Togo themselves, and that they \nbear the primary responsibility for fashioning their democracy, according to \nthe means they have and in keeping with their culture and their national \nspirit. With courage and determination, we will strive to meet the challenge \nin union and mutual acceptance. \nIn keeping with the conclusions of the work of the joint commission, the \nGovernment has set up a security plan the results of which can already be seen \nin the field. \n \nThanks to this consensus, political violence, which until recently was \nrampant in my country, is now being stemmed throughout Togo. All political \nparties will have access, without restriction and with complete security, to \nall parts of Togo during their political campaigns. \nManagement by consensus in this short period of our political life is \nwithout any doubt the driving force behind political detente in Togo and a \nguarantee of the reliability and transparency of the coming elections. \nFinally, the major protagonists of our political life have agreed to the \nprinciple of mutual guarantees, whose importance is clear to all. We must \nimplement all the measures that we have decided on before, during and after \nthe elections. Our country, determined to restore peace and tranquillity, \nassures the Assembly that the democratic process under way is irreversible. \nDespite our hope that we can live from now on in an international society \nwithout conflict, the world continues to witness a growth of armed conflict. \nIt is no longer merely Africa and Asia that contain pockets of tension. \nEurope, with war raging in the former Yugoslavia more precisely, in Bosnia \nand Herzegovina is now affected. That tragedy challenges the international \ncommunity to do all it can to ensure respect for man and human dignity. We \nunreservedly support all the European initiatives and salute the laudable \nefforts of the United Nations to restore peace to that part of Europe. \nElsewhere in the world, in Africa for some years now Somalia and Liberia \nhave been two more hotbeds of tension where fratricidal war rages, already \nclaiming thousands of victims. Death, desolation, poverty and hunger are the \ndaily lot of these peoples. \nFrom this United Nations rostrum we call upon our Somali and Liberian \nbrothers to demonstrate positive nationalism and constructive patriotism to \n\nhelp implement the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity \n(OAU) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to contribute \nto restoring peace to their respective countries. \nThe South African Government must understand that the wheels of history \nare still turning and that it is now clear that structures imposed by force \ncannot survive the determination of the people to live in peace. The \ncontinued plight of that part of our continent demands that the General \nAssembly intensify its efforts for victory in the fight to eradicate \napartheid. This requires that all forms of pressure be maintained to compel \nthe De Klerk Government to commit itself fully to the political and \ninstitutional reforms that it has already courageously undertaken. \nTogo is following with particular interest the developing situation in \nthe Middle East. It reiterates its full support for the peace process started \nin October 1991 in Madrid, and calls upon the parties to demonstrate greater \nwisdom, courage and restraint in order to strengthen that process and bring \nabout a final solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. It should be based on a \nnegotiated agreement acceptable to all, guaranteeing the security of all the \nStates of the region, including Israel, within secure, internationally \nrecognized borders, and allowing the Palestinian people freely and fully to \nexercise their right to self-determination. \nWith regard to the Arab-Persian Gulf, where peace still seems to be \nthreatened, my country reiterates its appeal to all the States of the region \nscrupulously to abide by the various relevant resolutions of the Security \nCouncil, and to make every effort to avoid the risk of new confrontations \nwhich still hovers over that part of the world.\n\nIn Asia, Togo appreciates the Secretary-General's efforts to deploy the \nUnited Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). We hope that the \nnational reconciliation effort now going on will gain further ground. \nBecause of the great suffering they inflict on peoples, the conflicts to \nwhich I have referred render sterile any notion of sovereignty and \nindependence. Is it not better, then, to prevent armed conflicts rather than \nseek to resolve them? \nEfforts made throughout the world by regional and international \norganizations in the search for new machinery to prevent war and maintain \npeace are likely to promote social progress and to establish better living \nconditions for our peoples. Accordingly, my delegation welcomes the fact that \nthe Security Council on 31 January 1992 held a Summit meeting which considered \nways of strengthening and making more efficient the United Nations capacity \nfor preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping. Togo very much \nappreciates the conclusions of that meeting and the report (A/47/277) \nsubmitted by the Secretary-General at the Council's request. \nIn dealing with the many conflicts raging throughout the world, \npreventive diplomacy would allow, with real determination by the protagonists \nof international life, particularly the parties to a conflict, the speedy \nattainment of its goal of peace. \nThe world is now witnessing the end of East-West antagonism, but the much \nfeared danger of a world war has not yet been overcome. Arsenals of highly \nsophisticated weapons still exist throughout the world, posing serious threats \nto international peace and security. There is an urgent need to destroy \nweapons of mass destruction and halt the arms race; the military Powers should \ndevote themselves to that task in order to curb any reflex action to have \nrecourse to war. \n\nThe Non-Proliferation Treaty has been renewed without time-limit and the \nStrategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and the Treaty on Conventional Armed \nForces in Europe (CFE) have entered into force. The final text of the \nconvention banning chemical weapons will be submitted for our consideration \nthis session. All these developments increase the international community's \nhope that the military Powers will embark on general and complete disarmament. \nFurthermore, with the end of the cold war, and with distrust now giving \nway to trust and cooperation, the delegation of Togo believes that it is time \nfor the international community to envisage drafting, without delay, a \ncomprehensive test-ban treaty, after which the United Nations would play a \nleading role as the main body where consensus can be forged on security and \ndisarmament problems. \nWe welcome the recent initiative of President Francois Mitterrand in \nunilaterally decreeing a one-year moratorium on nuclear tests by his country. \n \nWe also welcome the statement made on 2 July 1992 by \nPresident George Bush on repatriating certain tactical nuclear weapons of the \nUnited States with a view to destroying them. \nAs we see it, recent events and initiatives, as well as many positive \nworld developments in the disarmament field, are encouraging. However, the \nproliferation and international transfer of conventional weapons, particularly \nin Africa, are a source of major concern on the part of the authorities of \nTogo. In this respect, we believe that a United Nations regional centre for \npeace and disarmament, like the one in Lome, is still useful and we should \nseek to increase its role, its powers and the scope of its activities. The \nUnited Nations should give the regional centres greater means so that they \ncould fully participate in the strengthening of security and peace. \nSerious problems such as the ones connected with the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security persist, and this absolutely dictates the \nexploration of new approaches that could lead to a strengthening of the \nability of the United Nations to act. While the East-West confrontation \nparalysed the Organization as it tried to carry out its noble mission, the \ncurrent detente seems to offer greater opportunities now to Member States to \nreaffirm their commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter. For \nits part our country reiterates its faith in the United Nations and adheres to \nthe mechanisms for establishing preventive diplomacy and restoring and \nmaintaining peace. However, the efficient functioning of the United Nations \npresupposes restructuring its organs and adapting them to contemporary facts. \nThe promotion of democracy and human rights means today that the fate of \nmankind as a whole in the special and delicate field of the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security should not be left to the discretion of only \n \na few States. The management of peace and security requires the concerted \naction of States as a whole, whatever their geographical size or their \neconomic, financial or military power. Consequently, Togo unreservedly \nsupports any proposal to revise the composition of the Security Council. If \nthat were done, the democratic revolution going on in States will finally have \nreached international organizations. \nPeace and democracy presuppose the existence of a viable economy capable \nof meeting the vital needs of food, health, training and housing. The \nprogress that needs to be made for man's full development is essential for \ndemocracy and its consolidation. It is a basic truth that there can be no \ndevelopment without democracy, just as one cannot conceive of democracy \nwithout development or peace. \nIn order to safeguard peace in the world we must commit ourselves fully \nto the idea of a fairer division of the riches of the Earth. But we must \nnote, with regret, that the international situation has not changed in this \nrespect. \nAt the end of this century an analysis of the international economic \nsituation points up many social inequalities between nations. The hopes we \nhad at the end of the cold war should find their justification in a \npartnership between rich countries and developing countries so that the \nappetites of some do not cause starvation in others. Unfortunately, we look \non, powerless, as the gap between rich and poor grows ever wider. \nThe economies of the developing countries are in a state of chronic \nrecession, the most serious in several decades. Growth has slowed, \nparticularly in Africa, where the crisis has fundamentally affected all \naspects of life, and a real deterioration of living conditions has resulted in \n\nthese countries. It is clear that this situation will continue unless efforts \nare made to establish a new world economic order based on fairness and a more \ngenerous humanistic vision of international cooperation. In this respect, we \nvery much appreciate the decision taken by Japan to make available to Africa \nan aid package of $700 million spread out over the next three years. This \naction, and other measures too, although encouraging are far from meeting the \nreal concerns of the developing countries, in particular the least developed \nof them. \nIndeed, if these countries are to break out of the profound crisis, \nurgent and appropriate action must be taken by the international community to \nguarantee remunerative prices for commodities and to dismantle tariff \nbarriers, which are obstacles to the exports of these countries. It is vital \nthat the international community mobilize larger resources to relaunch \ninvestment and that it find a lasting solution to the debt problem. \nAppropriate mechanisms must be found to make it possible to reimburse and \ngenerate resources to ensure economic recovery. \nThe economic crises of our countries have social consequences that \nparticularly affect young people. Juvenile delinquency, illicit \ndrug-trafficking, drug abuse and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome \n(AIDS) are serious threats for mankind. Constant attention should be focused \non them. \nSustainable and lasting economic and social development is impossible \nunless there is a healthy environment. Fortunately, today the international \ncommunity has mobilized to solve the problems caused by the deterioration of \nthe Earth and of nature. \n\nWe are living in a new era today. This new era should be based on \nfreedom, understanding, and love of one's neighbour and of peace. \nGuaranteeing peace and security, working for freedom and democracy, ensuring \nworld prosperity through free international trade, preserving a healthy \nenvironment and creating stable international relations based on dialogue and \ncooperation: all these, among others, are challenges that should be met by \nthe United Nations in order to establish the new world order that we all \nsincerely wish to see. Therefore we must give of our very best to attain \nthese goals. \nWe hope that the twenty-first century will give us a world in which man, \nfreed from the plight of poverty, oppression, tyranny and destitution, can use \nall his faculties and give free rein to his creativity in order to achieve his \nown full development and the social and economic development of the State as \nthe guarantor of peace and security."

        "file_text": "I congratulate you, Mr Ganev, on your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. \nYou take this important position at a very challenging time for the United \n\nNations and its Member States, not least for your own country, which is so \nadmirably consolidating the gains of the democratization process. The \nAustralian delegation looks forward to working closely with you as the session \nprogresses. \nI also extend, at the outset, Australia's very warm welcome to the 13 \nStates for which this session will be their first as Members of the United \nNations: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, San \nMarino, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia \nand Herzegovina. We have, I believe, in our own highly multicultural \nAustralian population immigrants from every one of those States, and we \nalready feel, as a result, that we know them well. \nIn the past year we have seen the total collapse of the bipolar global \nstructure which had underpinned international relations since 1945. The risks \nof a global nuclear holocaust have receded almost to the vanishing point. So \ntoo have the sterile ideologies of the past which for so long set obstacles in \nthe way of the development of a new international system of cooperation under \nthe authority of the United Nations and its agencies. \nBut while the opportunities for cooperation have never been greater, the \nchallenges to the international community posed by regional conflicts, \nhumanitarian crises and unresolved transnational problems have also never been \ngreater. What is expected of the United Nations system is now immense, but \nthere is still a very big question mark over the capacity of our system to \ndeliver. In the past twelve months the international community has had some \nconspicuous success in meeting some of these challenges. We have seen, for \nexample, the signing of the Paris Agreements on Cambodia last October, the \nrecently completed negotiation of a chemical-weapons Convention text, the \n\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) summit in Rio \nin June, movement forward in the Middle East peace process, and hopes for the \nresolution of the long-standing problems in Afghanistan, Cyprus and Western \nSahara. \nBut a number of problems have to date been beyond the capacity of the \nUnited Nations, or international cooperative efforts more generally, to \nresolve in a timely and wholly effective way. The most significant and tragic \nof these have been the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and Somalia. \nEqually, the world has failed so far in efforts to strengthen and expand the \nliberal international trading system through the Uruguay Round of multilateral \ntrade negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a \nfailure of just as much concern to the developing nations as to the \ndeveloped. \nThis session of the General Assembly gives us the opportunity of \nsystematically reviewing where we have got to and how far we still need to go \non the range of acute problems - political, economic and humanitarian - now \nconfronting us around the globe. We are much assisted in this respect by the \nSecretary-General's report entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", on some key aspects \nof which I want to focus in this statement. The report, although \nconcentrating specifically on the role of the United Nations in peacemaking, \npeace-keeping and related areas, was of course written very much against the \nbackground of the total challenge facing the United Nations international \nsystem, and in particular the critical importance of finding lasting solutions \nto the age-old problems of basic human survival and, in the words of the \nCharter, \\\"better standards of life in larger freedom\\\". \n \nIf we have learned anything from the passage of years about the sources \nof conflict and war, and what is necessary to achieve peace and security, it \nis that these problems have to be addressed at many different levels. Threats \nto security arise not only from military ambition and the race to acquire \narmaments, but also from economic and social deprivation, from ignorance of \ncountries about each other, from a failure to address problems that by their \nnature cross international boundaries, and from a failure by national leaders \nto trust the sense and judgment of their own people. An effective system of \ninternational cooperation to meet threats to peace and security itself has to \noperate at all these levels simultaneously. \nIn the first place, when unbridled aggression occurs across national \nfrontiers, the international community has to have a credible collective \ncapacity to resist that aggression. Chapter VII of the Charter provides for \nsuch a peace-enforcement function. There is now in the post-cold-war era a \nmanifest willingness in the international community to utilise interventionist \nChapter VII functions, so long rendered impotent by the veto in the Security \nCouncil, in cases of overt aggression and other obvious cross-border threats \nto international peace and security. \nOf course not every case of aggression, or the deliberate infliction of \nsuffering, occurs across State borders or in such a way as to clearly and \nunambiguously constitute a threat to international peace and security. And \nthere will be a number of such situations in which the intervention of the \ninternational community could make a difference, so much so that there are \nlarge moral and political pressures upon us all to take action. It seems \nlikely, unhappily, that the United Nations will increasingly be confronted \nwith situations in which the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs \nwill be matched by a compelling sense of international conscience. It may be \n\nthat our Charter will never be capable of formal amendment so as to precisely \ndefine those circumstances in which such intervention is legitimate and those \nin which it is not. But recent experience has shown that there is an emerging \nwillingness - which my country has certainly shared to accommodate \ncollective intervention in extreme, conscience-shocking cases, and it may well \nbe that a body of customary precedent will emerge over time and will \nconstitute its own source of authority for such intervention in the future. \n\nThe second level of necessary United Nations involvement in peace and \nsecurity matters is peace-keeping: that activity which falls short of actual \nenforcement, but involves assistance on the ground in monitoring, supervising, \nverifying and generally securing the implementation of agreements once made. \nAs the various peace-keeping operations now in place or planned for Cambodia, \nAfrica, the Middle East and elsewhere amply make clear, an increasingly wide \nvariety of activities, involving both military and civilian personnel, are \nbeing subsumed under this general umbrella: none of them are very clearly \ndescribed in the letter of the United Nations Charter, but all of them are \nvery clearly within its spirit. \nAustralia strongly endorses the call by President Bush on 21 September to \nstrengthen United Nations peace-keeping and related operations, and welcomes \nin particular the stated intention of the United States to look at ways of \nensuring adequate financial support for these activities as well as for United \nNations humanitarian activities. Financing and administration of United \nNations peace-keeping operations are obviously key areas of its activity where \ndecisions are necessary at this year's General Assembly. It is a source of \nregret that we, the nations of the world, have still not given the \nSecretary-General the financial resources or flexibility needed to undertake \nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations expeditiously. \nFor its part, Australia would support the Secretary-General's call in \\\"An \nAgenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277) for the establishment at this session of a \npeace-keeping reserve fund, and for virtually automatic approval of one third \nof the anticipated budget for a peace-keeping operation to enable it to be \ndeployed speedily and efficiently. We would also recommend that the \nSecretary-General consider further structural changes in the Secretariat as a \n\nmeans of improving the administration of peace-keeping operations, including \nthe relocation of the Field Operations Division into the Department of \nPeace-keeping Operations. \nThe third level of United Nations involvement in peace and security, and \nthe most basic and important of all, is the prevention of conflict. We in the \ninternational community should be working hardest through the United Nations \nto create conditions that minimize insecurity and threats to peace, and which \nmake it possible for specific high-risk situations to be addressed before they \nget to the point of requiring either peace-keeping or, worse still, coercive \npeace-enforcement responses. \nThe effective prevention of conflict and risk minimization involve three \nquite distinct kinds of activity. In the first place, it involves addressing \na variety of non-military threats to security; secondly, addressing the \nmilitary risk to security posed by uncontrolled arms build-ups; and thirdly, \nputting in place the most effective possible preventive diplomacy and \npeacemaking arrangements to deal at an early stage with specific high-risk \nsituations. I want to concentrate my remarks on what we should be doing, in \nthis General Assembly and beyond, in each of these areas in turn. \nAmong the gravest of all life-threatening non-military risks are those \nposed by humanitarian disasters, especially famine. The recurring tragedy of \nmass starvation in Africa often made worse by accompanying military \nconflict, but not wholly explained by that conflict underlines the need for \nthe United Nations system as a whole, and the Security Council in particular, \nto strengthen its capacity to meet the problems of potential famine. \nAustralia proposes the establishment of a group of senior officials from \ndeveloped and developing countries and relevant United Nations agencies, \n\nsupported by a strengthened Department of Humanitarian Affairs and by a \ncomprehensive database, which would convene regularly to conduct high-level \nreviews of the global famine situation and identify emerging crisis \nsituations. Such a group would be responsible for turning pledges into \ntimely, life-saving deliveries of food to people in need, and would seek to \nensure that donor contributions were complementary, properly coordinated and \nwell-targeted. That high-level review group would report regularly, with \nappropriate recommendations, to the Security Council. \nFamine is only the most extreme example of a much more widespread global \nproblem. The Secretary-General, in his address to the summit of the Movement \nof Non-Aligned Countries, identified our \\\"ultimate enemy\\\" as poverty. He \nargued for the indivisibility of peace and prosperity, of political and \neconomic security, of democracy and development, and environmental protection \nand sustainable development, making the point that unless we meet the threat \nposed by poverty, it will undermine all the advances we make elsewhere. We \nneed to have this firmly in mind as we act for the rest of this decade and \nbeyond to meet non-military threats to peace and security. \nTwo issues in particular will have a crucial influence on our ability to \nprevail over these threats. One is the retreat to protectionism, which could \nwell result from a failure to reach agreement in the Uruguay Round, which will \ndo untold damage to many economies around the world, particularly those of the \npoorest nations, which would effectively be excluded from the benefits of an \nexpansion in world trade. We cannot let pass the opportunity, provided by \nthis round of negotiations, to further liberalize world trade and establish \nequitable disciplines for the new components of world trade. The recent \nsummit of the Non-Aligned Movement illustrated beyond a doubt that this is a \nview shared equally by developed and developing countries. \n\nThe other important need in this context is for prompt and effective \nfollow-up to the outcomes of the United Nations Conference on Environment and \nDevelopment, and in particular the creation of an effective Commission on \nSustainable Development. We cannot waste now the opportunity offered to us at \nRio to make a serious attack on the elimination of global poverty, based on \nthe principles of sustainable development. Ignoring these will produce, at \nbest, only short-term solutions which will have little impact on our ability \nto secure the future of this planet. This places a particular onus on us at \nthis session. Our decisions and actions will have a crucial bearing on how \nthe concerns identified at Rio are taken forward. \nNatural disasters, acute poverty, famine and environmental degradation \nare all, along with war itself, major contributors to another great \nhumanitarian problem and by extension security problem with which the \ninternational system is barely coping: the problem of unregulated population \nflows. Much important relief and rehabilitation work continues to be done for \nrefugees and displaced persons by the relevant agencies, in particular the \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and some useful attention has \nbeen recently given to the problem by the General Assembly. But crises \ncontinue to escalate, and there are still problems evident in the coordination \nof responses between operating and supervising bodies. Those problems have to \nbe addressed as a matter of urgency, and one obvious way to do so is, again, \nto strengthen the capacity of the new Department of Humanitarian Affairs. \nThere is at least one other non-military threat to peace and security \nthat Australia hopes will get increased attention from this General Assembly, \nand that is the failure of Governments to observe the fundamental standards of \n \nhuman rights as set out in the Universal Declaration and the more detailed \nCovenants, to which so many of us have subscribed. \nThe Secretary-General in his report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277) very \nproperly emphasizes in this context the question of the rights of minorities. \nIt is understandable that, freed from the iron restraints of totalitarian \nregimes, some ethnic and linguistic groups have sought and no doubt will \ncontinue to seek - to establish their own political entities. As has been all \ntoo graphically demonstrated in the States of former Yugoslavia, Iraq and \nelsewhere, there is no easy answer to these aspirations, particularly when \nself-determination would in such cases be synonymous with fragmentation and \nitself be a source of threat to international peace and security. War, \nparticularly civil war, also engenders many of the greatest abuses of human \nrights. \nThe bulk of such aspirations to self-determination might, in fact, be met \nby stricter observance of human rights and guarantees of the rights of all \nminorities ethnic, religious, linguistic or social within democratic \nframeworks. The General Assembly will have before it at this session a draft \ndeclaration on the rights of minorities, endorsed earlier this year by the \nCommission on Human Rights. And the launch, later this session, of the \nInternational Year of the World's Indigenous People to which Australia is \nvery strongly committed will be a further indication of our concern in this \nregard. \n\nBreaches of universal human rights standards remain, unhappily, all too \ncommon. In a country such as Burma or Myanmar - the security of the State \nis based on a denial of fundamental human rights and the application of \ndemocratic processes. In South Africa, the promise of a peaceful, negotiated \ntransition to majority rule continues to be put at risk by recurring violence \nof appalling intensity, itself an all too obvious legacy of the apartheid \nsystem. \nThese and too many other examples that could be mentioned show the \ndimensions of the problem still ahead of us. They confirm the importance of \nnext year's World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, particularly for \nthose Governments needing further encouragement to adopt human rights \npolicies - founded, I emphasize, not on so-called Western values, but on \ninternationally accepted, universal standards of practice. Discussion at this \nsession should play an important role in developing a consensus approach to \nthe Conference. At the very least, I hope it will resolve the outstanding \nquestion of the agenda, which was left undecided at the recent preparatory \nmeeting in Geneva. \nThe General Assembly at this session might also usefully consider some \nother steps to consolidate respect for human rights. There is, for instance, \na growing call by the international community for a mechanism to try \nindividuals for breaches of international humanitarian law and other \ninternational crimes. Australia supports consideration being given to an \ninternational criminal jurisdiction to deal with such offences, and considers \nthat the International Law Commission should continue its important work on \nthis topic, specifically by drafting a statute for an international criminal \ncourt. \n \nThe end of the cold war notwithstanding, a major preventive effort by the \ninternational community is still necessary in relation to the military threat \nto security posed by continuing arms build-ups. The climate for such an \neffort is certainly now encouraging. International endeavours in this field \nare finally producing results. After over 20 years, agreement has finally \nbeen reached on a chemical weapons Convention text. It is a historic \nachievement, and one for which Australia has worked particularly hard. \nUnanimous endorsement of this Convention, with a recommendation for its \nuniversal signature and ratification, would be one of the major outcomes of \nthis forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. \nWe should also build on the success we have had in concluding the \nchemical-weapons Convention to reinvigorate our efforts to reach agreement on \nother elements of the multilateral disarmament agenda. The benefits to \nmankind of the end of the cold war will be quickly lost unless progress, which \nis being made in bilateral arms control and disarmament negotiations between \nthe United States and the former Soviet Union, is carried into the \nmultilateral arms control process. \nWe must redouble our efforts to achieve a world free from nuclear \nweapons, and the threat of nuclear war. We must work harder to obtain \nuniversal membership of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \nand ensure its indefinite extension unamended in 1995. We should also \ncontinue the progress that has been made since the Gulf War to strengthen the \nnuclear safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and \ntighten export controls on nuclear and nuclear-related dual-use items. We \nshould build on the moratorium on nuclear testing advanced by Russia and \nFrance. And I urge Member States to support once again the draft resolution \n\nthat Australia will co-sponsor at this session on the comprehensive test-ban \ntreaty. \nIncreased transparency in military activities should continue to be a key \nobjective for all Members of the General Assembly. I regard the United \nNations Register of Conventional Arms Transfers, established by the \nforty-sixth session of the General Assembly, as an important step in this \nprocess. Australia welcomes the Secretary-General's report on the operation \nof the Register and supports its adoption. \nAt the recent summit of non-aligned countries in Jakarta, leaders \nexpressed their deep concern over the negative impact of global military \nexpenditure, and their support for the attainment of security at lower levels \nof armaments. We must all work to make good these pledges, thereby releasing \nsorely needed funds to help free the peoples of the world from want, as well \nas from the fear of war and destruction. \nPursuing an effective arms control agenda and addressing a variety of \nnon-military threats to security are all important ways of creating a general \nenvironment in which risks to security are minimized. So too are the \npeace-building strategies described in the Secretary-General's report, many of \nwhich are as much applicable to pre-conflict as to post-conflict situations. \nBut the tools with the cutting edges in specific situations of conflict \nprevention and avoidance of conflict escalation are preventive diplomacy and \npeace-making. \nIn \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", the Secretary-General emphasized the importance \nof preventive diplomacy as a cost-effective means of avoiding the human and \nmaterial costs of conflict and the burdens involved in using armed force to \nresolve conflicts. Indeed, if we examine the worst conflicts over the last 12 \n \nmonths in the former Yugoslavia, Somalia and Afghanistan we could \nplausibly argue that, at least in the first two cases, more attention to \npreventive diplomacy may have avoided the catastrophes that befell those \nnations and peoples. Australia considers, therefore, that the challenge \nbefore the United Nations in the coming year will be to establish more \neffective processes for converting the promise of preventive diplomacy in all \nits aspects into reality. \nEffective preventive diplomacy cannot be ad hoc or peripheral to the \nother activities of the United Nations. What is required is a strengthened \ncapacity within the United Nations to encourage and assist parties to disputes \nto resolve their differences peacefully. The crucial elements in making \npreventive diplomacy work are timing, adequate resources and the willingness \nof Member States to invest the United Nations with the authority to use all \nthe means available for its effective implementation. \nIn practice, the trigger for United Nations action, and the threshold for \ndefining a situation as a threat to international peace and security, has \ntended to be the outbreak of armed hostilities. The earliest possible \nattention to potentially significant disputes is crucial if they are to be \naddressed before the parties have become committed and entrapped by their own \nrhetoric and actions. \nThis in turn calls for the formation of a permanent unit within the \nSecretariat with an enhanced capacity to gather, receive and analyse not only \nbasic facts, but also information about the concerns and interests of the \nparties to a dispute, in order better to prepare recommendations on possible \naction. This requires a more systematic approach to information-gathering and \nanalysis, for which a professionally dedicated support unit in the Secretariat \nis essential. \n\nThis will need in turn a sophisticated level of expertise and skill in \nthe form of a nucleus of foreign affairs specialists and policy analysts \nexperienced and knowledgeable in conflict resolution, with the skills that are \nnecessary to encourage parties to a dispute to improve communication, minimize \ninflammation, define issues and create innovative and imaginative ways of \nreconciling their conflicting interests. Regular and routine field visits \nshould allow an improved capacity for fact-finding, early-warning information \ngathering and the opportunity quietly to provide good offices. Staff should \nhave the capacity to develop in-depth knowledge of emerging disputes and to \ngain the confidence of all parties at an early stage. An evaluation mechanism \nshould be developed to collect, analyse and retain experience from such \nactivities that could prove useful in other similar situations. \nI therefore applaud the decisions Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has so far \ntaken to create geographically based divisions within the Department of \nPolitical Affairs, whose tasks will include the collection of information on \nvarious regions and the early identification and analysis of possible \nconflicts, and I do urge all Members to support the Secretary-General in \nfurther efforts to establish a professional and effective mechanism for \npreventive diplomacy. \nThere is also scope, in encouraging greater use of preventive diplomacy, \nfor more extensive training in the principles underpinning the concept. It is \ngood to hear, in this context, that the United Nations Institute for Training \nand Research (UNITAR) is planning to launch a new fellowship programme in \npreventive diplomacy in 1993. I think it will be important for relevant \nUnited Nations Secretariat staff and diplomats and officials from Member \nStates to participate in this fellowship programme. I am pleased to announce \ntoday that Australia will contribute US$ 50,000 to UNITAR to assist with the \ncosts of the first year of the fellowship. I would urge that other Member \nStates also consider a contribution, and participation by their officials. \nA significant challenge to an enhanced Secretariat role in preventive \ndiplomacy will, of course, be the deep reluctance of many States to accept any \nsuggestion that a contentious bilateral issue be internationalized. While \nthere will no doubt continue to be caution about too early resort to Articles \n35 and 99 which enable Member States and the Secretary-General, \nrespectively, to bring disputes to the Security Council there should not be \nthe same degree of reluctance to have regard to Article 33, which requires \nparties to a dispute to first seek a solution by negotiation, mediation or the \nlike. \nWhat has been lacking hitherto is any real institutional capacity within \nthe United Nations system to respond to such approaches on other than a wholly \nad hoc basis. The building of such a capacity for quiet diplomacy in the way \nI have been describing would be a major step forward, and help over time to \nincrease the confidence of Members in other more formal United Nations \nprocesses. \nI have today sought to give some substance, not just rhetorical support, \nto the proposition that the changed conditions of the post-cold-war world call \nfor new responses from the United Nations. The Secretary- General has shown \nus some new directions in his \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\". What is needed now is \naction. \nIn nearly all cases, no major new international machinery is called for \nor necessary, because the machinery is already there in the Charter rusty, \nin some cases, but still serviceable. What is needed, however, in virtually \nevery case, is the lubrication of adequate financing and restructuring within \nthe United Nations system to meet the increasing demands being made on it. \nOne of the really fundamental tasks we need to move forward at this session is \ncontinuation of the process, accordingly, of United Nations reform. \nThere is no single, or simple, enemy to peace in the contemporary \nworld. The appalling situation in Somalia, and the looming crises in \nMozambique and the Sudan, are demonstrations if any are still needed - that \nproblems do not come in neatly defined packages. The Somalian situation \ninvolves, simultaneously, humanitarian assistance, peace-keeping and political \nnegotiation, with no one of these elements being capable of delivery in \nisolation. The United Nations is now organizing itself in Somalia to deliver \nthese elements in an integrated way, although it has been a difficult and \nProtracted process to get to this point. The task for the United Nations in \nthe future is to learn from this experience and to devote the necessary \nresources to achieving the kind of cooperation between humanitarian and \npolitical strategies that is going to be increasingly necessary in the future \nif durable solutions are to be found to many real world problems. \nMore and more attention is going to focus, as indeed it has already \nfocused in this general debate, on the role and representativeness of the \nSecurity Council itself. As President Soeharto said last week, speaking in \nthis respect on behalf of the whole non-aligned Movement, the post-cold war \nworld is not the world as it was after the Second World War. Our guiding \nlight should by all means continue to be the present terms of the Charter, but \nit should be within our collective capacity to work out the changes in the \ncomposition and methods of decision of the Security Council that will ensure \nthat it can both fulfil its duty and command overwhelming consensus for its \ndecisions in the years ahead. \nIn many respects the task ahead of us, and ahead of the United Nations, \nis daunting. It is clear that we are part of an evolutionary process, with \nboth the world and the United Nations adjusting to new demands. We must draw \nstrength from the success achieved in the last 12 months, and from the \nprogress we have made in improving global co-operation. \nBut our success has not been uniform: we were not able to respond \nadequately to some key challenges. We must not ever lose sight of the goal \nahead of us: a more stable and secure world, devoid of abject poverty, with \nall peoples able to enjoy basic rights and freedoms. And we must never avoid \nthe responsibility we all have to achieve those goals. "

        "file_text": " It is a great pleasure to see you, \nSir, a youthful symbol of a profoundly changed Bulgaria, in the Chair. I know \nand trust that you will steer us skilfully through this session of the General \nAssembly. \n\nThe cold war is over. The world has heaved a sigh of relief. The United \nNations now has an unprecedented opportunity to carry out the mandate \ncontained in the Charter, even though politically the world has grown much \nmore complex and complicated. \n\nOf course, no change has occurred in the underlying problems of a \nlong-term nature. The threat to the very survival of the human race posed by \nthe deterioration of the environment, overpopulation and poverty was there \nalready, even though awareness of the threat has increased quite dramatically \nin recent years. It is a threat that will be with us for years to come, and \nit will grow more and more acute if there is a lack of appropriate action. \nOne course of action is for the United Nations to put its house in order in \nthese areas through a restructuring of its economic and social sectors and \nthrough a meaningful follow-up to the Rio Summit. The United Nations \nConference on Environment and Development has put sustainable development high \non our agenda, and there it should remain. The establishment of solid \nmachinery, including a high-level commission on sustainable development, will, \nwe hope, be one of the major achievements of this session of the General \nAssembly. \nBut in the political field, on which I will concentrate today, there has \nbeen a qualitative change. We are still thankful for the end of the cold war, \nwith its menace of massive nuclear destruction, but in its stead a plethora of \nconflicts and potential conflicts has sprung up with a vehemence which nobody \nhad foreseen. Each of these conflicts has its own characteristics, and each \nhas to be dealt with in a particular fashion. The United Nations is, on the \nwhole, the right organization to deal with these emergencies, whether directly \nor indirectly. In order to carry out that task it will need to possess all \nthe means necessary for what I would call a flexible response, ranging from \npreventive diplomacy to repressive action. A number of these requirements \nhave been set out by the Secretary-General in his impressive report \\\"An Agenda \nfor Peace\\\" (A/47/277). This Agenda will form the basis for our discussions on \nthe subject. \n\nWhere and when should the United Nations intervene? Clearly, it cannot \nbe everything to everyone. In order not to overstretch, it inevitably has to \napply a certain degree of self-restraint. Moreover, the membership of our \nOrganization consists of sovereign States, and respect for their sovereignty \nis one of its principles. Nevertheless, it would be too easy to make \nnon-intervention and deference to domestic jurisdiction the leading \nguideline. Moreover, it would not work. Frontiers have become porous and \ninformation world-wide. Atrocities and aggression committed within a country \ncannot pass unnoticed, and once noticed will not be tolerated by world \nopinion. For the United Nations to stand idly by would be detrimental to its \nnew-found status, which we all have an interest in protecting. \nWith the end of the cold war, regional conflicts have proliferated, but \nat the same time the possibility of doing something about them has increased. \nThis is both because the Security Council is not paralyzed by vetoes any more \nand because the risk of a conflict's degenerating into global war has \nsubsided. This makes it possible to contemplate international action where it \nwould have been impossible or unfeasible before. With the possibility of \naction comes the notion that lack of action is a form of action as well, \nrequiring a decision, just as a decision is necessary to act. A decision not \nto act in the case of flagrant violations of human rights or the rights of \nminorities, or in the case of large-scale human suffering, will now set a \nprecedent, just as planned intervention does. It is no longer possible just \nto look the other way. \nPerhaps somewhat belatedly, this has been recognized in the case of \nSomalia. The international community could not afford to condone the \n\nintolerable situation in that country any longer. The short-term task \nconsists of assuring the survival of the people. In the somewhat longer term, \nthe whole country will have to be reconstructed. The United Nations has a \nmajor role to play on both counts. \nThe United Nations has also become involved in former Yugoslavia. Here \nwe see massive aggression, destruction, impending starvation and even the \nestablishment of concentration camps, all with a view to making large areas \n\\\"ethnically clean\\\", as the ugly saying goes. Nationalism and irredentism have \nrun wild and are threatening neighbouring States as well. Everyone knows who \nis mainly responsible. \nConcerted action can and should be taken. Effective delegation and \ncooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations is crucial. \nJoint United Nations-European Community efforts to help solve the Yugoslav \ncrisis are a clear example. Interaction between the United Nations and the \nEuropean Community, in their co-chairmanship of the London Conference, has \nunderlined the potential for coordination between the United Nations and \nregional organizations in the field of preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and \npeacemaking. It is not only Chapter VIII that is being put into practice \nhere. Even more important is the linkage between the quest for a diplomatic \nsolution on the one hand and the possibility of enforcement action by the \nUnited Nations on the other hand, in the event of non-compliance by the \nparties concerned. The recognition of territorial and ethnical faits \naccomplis would be an insult to the Charter. To my mind, the Yugoslav crisis \nis a compelling case for action. More could be done, and I hope that more \nwill be done soon. \n\nThe Netherlands fully supports the Secretary-General's view that: \n\\\"regional arrangements or agencies in many cases possess a potential that \nshould be utilized in serving... preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping, \npeacemaking and post-conflict peace-building\\\". (A/47/277, para. 64) \nIndeed, I am convinced that regional organizations increasingly have to take \nup responsibilities with regard to regional peace and security. The role of \nthe Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in the Yugoslav \ncrisis is a clear example of this trend. So are others, such as the \nOrganization of American States and the Organization of African Unity. \nThe process of delegation and cooperation between the United Nations and \nthe various regional organizations does not have to stop at this level. \nOrganizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Western \nEuropean Union have specific operational contributions to make as well. Both \norganizations recently announced at the CSCE Summit in Helsinki their decision \nto make resources available to support the CSCE or the United Nations in \ncarrying out peace-keeping activities. The CSCE can also call on others, such \nas the Commonwealth of Independent States, to contribute to peace-keeping \nactivities. This development is a concrete example of an evolving network of \norganizations which we refer to as 'interlocking institutions'. \nThe Security Council is rightly the focus of world attention nowadays. \nThis new interest has provided the discussion on the Council's membership with \na fresh impetus. In the last chapter of \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", the \nSecretary-General observes that agreement among the permanent members of the \nSecurity Council must have the deeper support of the other members of the \nCouncil. It should also have the wider support of the membership of the \n\nAssembly if the Council's decisions are to be effective and are to endure. \nThis raises the question of the relationship between members and non-members \nof the Council and of the Council's composition. \n\nThe achievements of the Council in terms of effective leadership and \ndecision-making, particularly during the last two years, need not be \nelaborated upon. Supporters of the maintenance of its current composition can \nhence, with some justification, argue that there is no need to change a \nwinning team, or, to use a colloquial expression of our host country, \\\"If it \nain't broke, don't fix it.\\\" The critics of the status quo argue that the \nCouncil's present composition is a reflection of the balance of power of days \ngone by. This leaves us with a dilemma because both sides have a point. \nImportant changes have taken place in international relations. The \nnumber of Member States has increased enormously since the enlargement of the \nCouncil in 1963. The Charter specifies in Article 24 that the Council acts on \nbehalf of all Members. This implies that the Council should be, to a certain \ndegree, representative of the international community. Were the Council to \nbecome an exclusive club disconnected from the United Nations membership as a \nwhole, this might tend to undermine its authority and diminish its \neffectiveness. So what are we to do when faced with the question of the \nCouncil's effectiveness on the one hand and its representativeness on the \nother? \nA possible solution to this question might be found in severing the \nautomatic link between permanent membership of the Council and the right of \nveto. A number of concrete options can be considered in this respect. One \nwould be to consider the adoption of a double veto: two negative votes by \npermanent members being required to hold up a decision instead of one. \nAnother suggestion put forward is the creation of semi-permanent membership of \nthe Security Council. This membership would apply to a certain category of \nimportant States for a period of, say, five to seven years, possibly without \nthe right of veto. \n\nTo determine which countries would be eligible for this type of \nmembership, it seems that two criteria are relevant: both the political \nweight of the country concerned and the degree to which its membership would \ncontribute to a more equitable geographical distribution of the Council's \ncomposition. In view of the Council's responsibility for the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security, it would appear to me that those two \nelements should be carefully balanced against each other. \nClearly, the creation of semi-permanent membership is only one of a \nnumber of options that can be considered. A broad international discussion on \nthis issue has already begun. The basis of this discussion should be in the \nagreement that any change envisaged should first and foremost seek to ensure \nthe continued effectiveness of the Council for the United Nations as a whole. \nIn recent years we have seen some very encouraging developments all over \nthe world in the field of human rights. Many nations have taken the difficult \nbut promising road to democracy. Their success will undoubtedly contribute to \na further spread of respect for fundamental human rights. It was our hope \nthat the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights, to be held next year \nin Vienna, would contribute to this positive trend. The Netherlands welcomed \nthe process from the start. We are, for instance, a major donor to the fund \nthat allows delegations from the least privileged countries to participate. \nHowever, the preparatory process has thus far failed to produce an agenda \nfor the Conference. The Chairperson of the preparatory process rightly \nconcluded that most States will be disappointed at the lack of results. The \nNetherlands shares this feeling of disappointment. Curiously enough, the \nresults thus far have lagged behind the constructive and relatively harmonious \nresults achieved in other United Nations forums such as the United Nations \n \nCommission on Human Rights. The perfect example of this was the recent \nunanimity displayed by this Commission when it met for its first emergency \nsession, which was devoted to the human rights situation in former \nYugoslavia. In view of this sharp contrast, one cannot but wonder what causes \nthe World Conference process to be so polarized and, subsequently, what \npositive contribution the Conference can make in these circumstances to the \nUnited Nations work in the field of human rights. \nMeanwhile, human rights are still, in practice, being violated in \nnumerous countries. I have already mentioned former Yugoslavia, where outrage \nat the massive violation of human rights and international humanitarian law in \nBosnia-Herzegovina, confirmed by the report of the United Nations Special \nRapporteur, Mr. Mazowiecki, has increased the calls for measures against the \nperpetrators of such acts. Personal accountability under international law \nand the appropriate machinery to deal with the individuals responsible are \nstill lacking, but Security Council resolution 771 (1992) paves the way for \nfollow-up action by Member States. My country favours the establishment of \nmachinery for the systematic gathering of data concerning criminal acts \ncommitted by individuals with regard to the Geneva conventions and the human \nrights conventions. I believe that such an approach can be expected to have a \ndeterrent effect. \nFor the longer term. Member States could consider the establishment of an \ninternational criminal court, taking into account work already undertaken by, \namong others, the United Nations International Law Commission. Although it is \nclear that the establishment of such a court will not come about overnight, it \nis certainly worthy of careful consideration by the 'Assembly. The Assembly \nmight give the International Law Commission the task of developing this idea \nfurther. \n\nThe United Nations involvement in conflict settlement has led to a wide \narray of peace-keeping operations. The number of Blue-Beret military has \nreached an all-time record. The Netherlands contributes sizeably to United \nNations operations worldwide and will continue to do so: taking into account \nother obligations and practical limitations, all units of the Netherlands \narmed forces can in principle be assigned for peace-keeping. We support the \nconcept of making available contingents to the United Nations at short notice \nand have included this in our standing offer to the Organization. \nThe Preamble to the Charter clearly states the United Nations \ndetermination to promote social progress and better standards of living. Many \ncountries are confronted with a lack of social stability, mass migration, \nrapid urbanization and other problems which affect the fabric of society. The \nworld summit for social development, in principle to be held in 1995, will \nallow us to address these issues at the highest levels of government. This \nwill help the United Nations to carry out the tasks inherent in its important \nsocial mandate. \nThe Security Council has rightly qualified the proliferation of all \nweapons of mass destruction as a threat to international peace and security. \nThis underlines the importance of combating their proliferation. Arms control \nand regional, political and security arrangements have their role to play. So \nhave export control regimes. \n\nThe Netherlands attaches particular value to the United Nations Register \nof Conventional Arms, and it is heartening to see before the Assembly the \nconcrete elaboration of technical procedures for this Register, agreed to by \nconsensus by a representative panel of governmental experts. The time has \ncome to render the Register fully operational starting next spring, in 1993, \nand we look forward to a universal implementation of its provisions. \nA convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons will be put before \nthis session of the Assembly. It is a magnificent achievement for all the \nmembers of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. My country hopes that many \ncountries will be amongst the original signatories of the chemical weapons \nconvention, so that it can be strictly implemented. The Netherlands, as host \ncountry for the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), \nhas a special role to play, and we shall endeavour to live up to expectations. \nWith the chemical weapons convention achieved, it becomes all the more \nimportant to reflect upon ways and means to strengthen the biological weapons \nConvention, in particular in matters of verification. Securing compliance \nwith the Convention could involve more than just voluntary measures, important \nthough these may be. \nAs to the third category of weapons of mass destruction, we have to bear \nin mind that the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is up for extension in \n1995. My country strongly advocates such an extension for an indefinite \nperiod. We welcome the progress made recently to strengthen the \nnon-proliferation regime by both further accessions to the NPT and \nmodifications of the Tlatelolco Treaty, opening the way for the entry into \nforce of that Treaty for all Latin American and Caribbean States. \n\nWe are are placing ever-increasing demands upon the United Nations. \nCambodia, Yugoslavia and Somalia are only a few examples of its increasing \ninvolvement. This is not without severe financial consequences for the \nOrganization. Quite frankly, I find it hard to believe that, at a time when \nwe expect the United Nations to play its demanding role, an important number \nof Member States is not paying its contributions on time and in full. We \nbelieve it is essential for the proper functioning of the United Nations that \nall Member States, not just 5 per cent, meet the condition of full and timely \npayment. The United Nations will not be able to fulfil its task unless \neveryone picks up his share of the bill. Financial discipline on the part of \nMember States is as important as it is on the part of the Organization. \nWith regard to peace-keeping especially, if regional responsibility for \nthe maintenance of peace and security is to acquire real meaning, we would \nstrongly favour Member States looking at the concept of burden-sharing on a \nregional basis. In any case, the present short-term solutions of ad hoc \nfinancing are neither satisfactory nor equitable. If we want a healthy United \nNations to deal with tomorrow's problems, this issue needs to be addressed \ntoday. It would be an illusion to think that the current stopgaps, creative \nas they may be, will eventually suffice. \nAs I have already stated, the opportunities for the United Nations to \ncarry out its mandate are unprecedented. This is true for a number of \nconflicts which until recently seemed intractable. Cambodia is the clearest \ncase where a United Nations peace plan is being implemented. Angola is \nanother example of what the United Nations can do. The continuing dialogue by \n \nSouth African parties provide us with a spark hope for the establishment of a \nnon-racial democracy. There is an initial involvement on the part of the \nUnited Nations. Negotiations within the framework of the Madrid Conference \nhave carried the Middle East peace process further after a long period of \nstandstill. I hope that in this area, too, the United Nations can at some \nstage become closely involved. \nMy friend and colleague Douglas Hurd, speaking on behalf of the European \nCommunity and its member States, rightly observed that the challenge facing us \nin this turbulent time is to reinforce the system of collective security based \non the United Nations. As I said earlier, the United Nations cannot be \neverything to everybody. Nevertheless it is clear that, because of the \nsuccess our Organization has achieved over the last few years, enormous \nexpectations have been raised. It is our duty to see to it that the United \nNations is equipped in terms both of personnel and financing to face the tasks \nwith which it will of necessity be confronted. \nThat brings me, logically and finally, to the Secretary-General. It is a \nsource of the greatest satisfaction to me to see Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in \nthis august position. His profound international experience, his keen \nintelligence and the determination which he has already shown in tackling a \nnumber of issues make him very much the right man in the right place. \nI wish to assure Mr. Boutros-Ghali of the co-operation of the Kingdom of \nthe Netherlands in the discharge of his arduous task. \n"

I am certain that, under his \nleadership, the Organization will be able to face its responsibilities at a \nmoment when fundamental changes are taking place in the world arena towards a \nmore just order and the aspirations of mankind. \nI welcome the 13 new Members of the Organization recently admitted and am \ncertain that their admission will enrich our collective dialogue in the search \nfor solutions to the international problems that affect us all. The principle \nof universality of the United Nations has thus gained more expression. \nI hope that countries still under foreign occupation will, in the \nnot-too-distant future, also join the community of nations represented here. \nAmong the countries still under colonial occupation is East Timor. Historical \nand cultural ties link us with the people of that Territory under foreign \noccupation. \nMy country sincerely hopes the ongoing negotiations between Portugal and \nIndonesia under the auspices of the Secretary-General, as mandated by the \nGeneral Assembly, will produce positive results which will make it possible in \nthe near future for the people of East Timor to exercise its inalienable right \nto self-determination. \nThe Assembly welcomed with enthusiasm the end of the cold war which put \nan end to the spectre of a nuclear holocaust and the policies of bloc \nrivalry. Cape Verde, together with many other countries, has great hopes for \nthe new era announced by the end of the cold war. We hope that this new era \nwill be dominated by peace \u201a\u00c4\u00fbn the world, cooperation among countries, global \nrespect for human rights and democratic values and by renewed efforts in the \nfield of economic development. \nIf, on the one hand, the end of the cold war has given rise to an \ninternational political environment of great optimism concerning our \ncollective future, it has, on the other, allowed conflicts to come into the \nopen, the negative effects of which are of great concern to us all consuming, \nas they do, energies and resources so necessary to the economic and social \ndevelopment of countries a prerequisite for peoples to attain their \naspirations for progress and well-being. \nThe redefinition of the political geography and the newly \ninstitutionalized democracies in Eastern Europe are, without doubt, a \npolitical event of major magnitude, the positive effects of which on the \ninternational scene are already being felt. Nevertheless, the open conflicts \nwhich seem to proliferate in that part of the world give rise to serious \nconcern about their negative impact on regional and global stability. \nSimilarly, the political movements towards the creation of democratic \ngovernments in many parts of the world, mainly in Africa, while anticipating \nthe emergence of a new order: in the existence of nations based upon democratic \nPluralism, the participation of populations in running their countries and the \naffirmation of and respect for the fundamental rights of the citizenry, are \nalso sometimes accompanied by internal political convulsions and conflicts. \nThus present international relations are dominated by the optimism and \nhopes for a better future for us all brought about by these changes and, at \nthe same time, by the current political realities where armed confrontations \nseem to take hold. \nThe tragic situation in Somalia is a blatant example of the many national \nconflicts that are ravaging the world. \nI believe that national conflicts such as the one in Somalia, deserve our \nfull attention, bearing in mind the dimension of the loss of human lives, the \ndestruction of property they entail and the repercussions they have on \nregional and international peace and stability. \nThe United Nations should assist those affected countries in the \nhumanitarian field as well as in helping them to regain their internal \npolitical harmony and to bring about a normalization of the situation. \nI hope that in the case of Somalia all political forces will extend their \nfull cooperation to the United Nations in facilitating the distribution of \nhumanitarian assistance to the affected population. My country condemns any \nresistance or opposition to the deployment of United Nations forces in \nSomalia, whose presence becomes necessary for the massive provision of \nhumanitarian assistance. I hope that the United Nations will proceed to the \nearly deployment of an additional 3,000 United Nations guards to Somalia in \nview of the urgency of the situation. What is at stake here is the survival \nof the population of Somalia. Each day that passes without humanitarian \nassistance represents the loss of innumerable lives. The United Nations \nshould stand firm in the implementation of its deployment decision, even in \nthe face of the opposition of certain factions. \nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is an example of the unfortunate \nreality that we are witnessing today, in which many conflicts seem to take \nhold despite attempts at peaceful negotiation. Notwithstanding the enormous \nefforts already made in various bodies, including the Security Council, to put \nan end to the conflict that is raging in the territory of the former \nYugoslavia, and that has affected in particular the Republic of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, no tangible and lasting result has been achieved so far. \nFor reasons having to do with peace and political stability in a region \nas important for international security as Europe, and also with the respect \nthat the humanitarian situation deserves from all of us, the international \ncommunity should make renewed efforts to bring about peace and normality in \nthat country. \nIn this context, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \nMontenegro) can and should play a positive role. Everyone should strictly \nabide by the principle of territorial integrity and non-interference in the \ninternal affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The internal conflict in Bosnia \nand Herzegovina requires a solution involving respect for the equal rights of \nall its citizens. The basis of that solution should be satisfaction of the \nlegitimate aspirations of the country's different communities. \nAgainst this background, my country hopes that the ongoing peace \nconference co-sponsored by the United Nations and the European Economic \nCommunity will produce satisfactory results in the very near future. \nThe armed confrontations that today seem to be occurring everywhere call \nfor a strong and more effective United Nations handling of its \nresponsibilities in the maintenance of peace and stability. This important \nrole of the United Nations takes on particular importance as an indispensable \nguarantee of the preservation of the independence, territorial integrity and \nsecurity of smaller nations. \nIt is incumbent upon the Security Council to carry out this primary \nresponsibility of the United Nations in a speedy, efficient, coherent, \nimpartial and unequivocal manner, whoever the participants in a conflict might \nbe and wherever it might take place. \nIn this connection, I should like to emphasize the relevance of the \nproposals put forward by the Secretary-General in his report \\\"An Agenda for \nPeace\\\" (A/47/277), with a view to strengthening the United Nations \nintervention capacity in the prevention and management of international \ncrises. These proposals deserve careful consideration. My delegation will \nmake its contribution to their analysis in the appropriate forum. The \nseriousness of the issues of international peace and security require careful \nconsideration of these proposals, with a view to their early implementation. \nThe Assembly should exert every effort to make the affirmation of and \nrespect for human rights in all their different dimensions a priority issue on \nits agenda. The repeated violation of fundamental rights in various countries \nis still a reality that the community of nations cannot tolerate. Every \neffort should be made to eliminate the abuses that are still being committed \nin various parts of the world against the dignity of human beings and their \nbasic human rights. \nWhile recognizing the multifaceted dimension of human rights, my \ndelegation does not share the functionalist approach to this question. \nIndeed, fundamental rights and individual liberties are fundamental to the \ndignity of human beings and should therefore be asserted unconditionally- Jt \nis in this context that my country has advocated strengthening and improving \nUnited Nations mechanisms for the protection of human rights whenever their \nviolation, by its dimension and degree, becomes intolerable. \nWhenever United Nations action to protect human rights comes into \nconflict with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the \ninternal affairs of States, we should face the issue with the necessary \ncourage and imagination to find a middle-ground approach. \nI should like in this connection to emphasize my country's concern about \nthe practices of xenophobia and racism in certain countries. Cape Verde takes \npride in receiving foreigners in its midst. It is therefore difficult for us \nto understand the surge of hatred and violence against foreign nationals and \nmigrant workers in certain countries. \nA large part of my country's population works and resides abroad. \nMigration is today a universal phenomenon that in a way involves all \ncountries. It is the expression of solidarity among groups and their ability \nto live in peace with one another, irrespective of their origin or race. Firm \nmeasures should be taken in the receiving countries against those engaged in \nsuch shameful practices, for they run counter to the basic rules of the \ncivilized world that we all wish to build. \nThe economic situation of the developing countries has not improved, \nnotwithstanding national efforts. The precarious economic situation in which \nthese countries find themselves plays a negative role in the establishment and \nconsolidation of democratic institutions and offers fertile ground for the \nresurgence of conflict, which not only poisons social harmony, but also \ndisturbs the peace and security of States. \nIn the past, responding to appeals for economic assistance for developing \nnations could be seen as the expression of a mere act of human solidarity, but \ntoday it is clear that the need to engage all countries, developed and \ndeveloping, in addressing the problems of underdevelopment represents a global \ninterest that we all have in the creation of objective conditions that will \nfacilitate the internal stability of nations and their harmonious relationship. \nThe problem of underdevelopment is thus today a global concern shared by \nall those interested in the stability and ecological balance of the world. \nTherefore the solution of this problem should be found by both developed and \ndeveloping countries, together. \nThis economic situation becomes even more fragile for the developing \ncountries that are affected by drought and desertification. Africa is the \ncontinent most affected in this regard. The enormous dimensions that drought \nand desertification has assumed in the world and the catastrophic effects it \nhas had on many developing countries and the well-being of their population \nrequires a global plan to face this calamity successfully. \nIn this regard, it is to be hoped that the decision of the Rio Conference \nto establish an inter-governmental committee to negotiate a convention on \ndrought and desertification will be implemented in the course of this session \nof the General Assembly. \nAs a country that is seriously affected by drought and desertification. \nCape Verde expects the negotiation of such a legal instrument to be crowned \nwith success and its early entry into force to be a landmark in the struggle \nagainst this serious problem. \nSimilarly, it is hoped that the important decisions taken at the Rio \nConference will have positive follow-up. \nThe time has come for us to show with deeds that this Conference \nrepresented a break with a past of environmental negligence. Let us hope that \nit will represent the beginning of a new attitude on the part of Governments \nand a new spirit of shared responsibilities and international solidarity in \nthe creation of a healthier and ecologically more sound world, a world \neconomically more interdependent and morally more just. \nThe world goes through political, economic and social changes of major \nmagnitude. The United Nations, as a permanent conference where economic, \npolitical and social issues are discussed, should reflect such changes in its \nown structures and procedures so that it may fulfil its potential and \nstrengthen its capacity in dealing with the ever increasing and diversified \nchallenges. \nIn this regard the efforts being made to streamline the work of the \nUnited Nations and rationalize its activities are undoubtedly commendable and \ndeserve our support. The \\\"Agenda for peace\\\" presented by the \nSecretary-General following the Security Council summit held in January of \nthis year is a solid basis for reflection on issues related to United Nations \nreform. It is to be hoped that the useful ideas contained therein will be \nfurther developed in the ongoing dialogue on the adjustment of the United \nNations to today's needs. \nThis necessity for adjustment is already felt even at the level of \ncertain United Nations organs. In fact, the activity of the General Assembly \nhas been seen lately as having lost certain importance, and its prestige has \nbeen affected. \nAs the most important organ of the United Nations, where the voices of \nall member countries are heard, it is important that this Assembly, which is \nthe expression of the democratic character of this Organization, find ways to \nreactivate its activities and restore its lost prestige. \nIn our view there are different means through which to strengthen the \nrole of the General Assembly. The consideration of measures to rationalize \nthe work of the General Assembly is one such means. Rationalization should \ntouch upon redesigning its agenda and reconsideration of its procedures, \nincluding restructuring the debate in the plenary and in the different \ncommittees, to avoid unnecessary overlapping and repetition. \nOn the other hand, it is important that whenever an item on its agenda \nassumes global relevance and generates universal interest it should be \nconsidered in the General Assembly itself instead of being transferred for \nconsideration as autonomous subject-matter in an international conference. \nLately voices have frequently been heard on the need to enlarge the \nSecurity Council membership. We believe that this issue should be tackled in \nthe light of the necessity of adapting this organ to the correlation of forces \nprevalent in the world today. Equally important is the necessity of taking \ninto consideration a relative balance in the representation in the Council of \ndifferent regions. Whatever the outcome, however, enlargement of the Security \nCouncil should in no way take place at the expense of the effectiveness of the \ndecisions that that important body is called upon to take on issues of peace \nand security. \nOn the other hand, the ongoing efforts to streamline the work of the \nEconomic and Social Council should improve the co-ordination of the activities \nof different bodies dealing with economic and social issues, due account being \ntaken, obviously, of the necessity of preserving the required decentralization \nand the specific nature of the functions of those bodies. We welcome the \ndecision of the Secretary-General to proceed to an in-depth study on the \nmodalities for that restructuring. \nOurs is an era of armed confrontation and profound changes in the \ninternational scene. But it is equally an era that offers a unique \nopportunity and exceptional conditions that nurture great expectations and \nhope in the shaping of a better and more peaceful relationship between nations \naimed at building a collective future of peace and well-being. \nTolerance, a spirit of solidarity and the promotion of universal values \nshould guide us in the shaping of this collective future. It is incumbent \nupon us all, small countries and big as well, developed and developing \nnations, to understand the sense of our community of interest and to take the \nnecessary steps towards that end.

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me to congratulate \nyou most warmly on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits forty-seventh session. I am confident that, given your skills and \nexperience, you will successfully guide our deliberations. I wish also to pay \na well-deserved tribute to your predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of the \n\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, for the excellent manner in which he steered the work \nof the forty-sixth session. \nIt is with a sense of pride and satisfaction that I take this \nopportunity, firstly, to congratulate Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, a \ndistinguished son of Africa, on his deserved election to the important post of \nSecretary-General of our Organization; and, secondly, to express sincere \nappreciation to him for the commendable leadership he has showed in carrying \nout his duties. Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali's long and valuable service to \nAfrica, especially within the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the central \nrole he played in peacemaking under the Camp David accord, and the \nconsiderable familiarity he has with the burning issues of the developing \nworld give him impeccable credentials for this Organization's highest and most \nchallenging post. We wish him every success; he enjoys Uganda's full \nconfidence; and he can count on our constant cooperation and support.* \nUganda welcomes the 13 new Members of the United Nations, with which we \nlook forward to forging close and mutually beneficial relations. An important \nprinciple of this Organization is self-determination by the people of the \nMember States. The admission of new Members is in keeping with that principle. \nWhen we gathered here at the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, \nit was against a backdrop of international political developments which had \nprofoundly altered the global landscape. The transformation of international \nrelations has, over the last year, increased in pace and ushered in a new \npattern of relations. In place of the cold war between East and West, we now \nMr. Kalpage (Sri Lanka), Vice-President took the Chair. \n \nsee a more cooperative relationship. Mutual suspicion, conflict and the \nattendant arms race between the major Powers have been replaced by dialogue \nand joint endeavours. Dictatorships are giving way to democracies, and \nconflicts are being resolved through dialogue. \nAs a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Uganda has always urged the \nmajor Powers to put an end to their rivalry and, instead, pool their efforts \nto promote international peace and security and also the economic and social \ndevelopment of all countries, as envisaged by the Charter. We therefore \nwelcome the emerging peaceful relations among the major Powers, and we \naccordingly have a good basis for hoping that investment in economic and \nsocial development worldwide will now receive a higher priority. In this \nconnection, special note must be taken of the important address to this \nsession of the Assembly by President George Bush of the United States when he \nput forward new ideas about international economic cooperation. These ideas \nmerit serious consideration. \nIt will be recalled that the cold-war divisions hampered the efforts of \nthe Organization in fulfilling its mandate. But now the correspondence of \nobjectives among the permanent members of the Security Council, as \ncontemplated by the founding fathers, has facilitated the United Nations \ncentral role in finding solutions to various regional crises. From Yugoslavia \nand Cambodia to Somalia, to name but a few, it has now become possible for the \nUnited Nations to handle the underlying causes of crises without its actions \nbeing hamstrung by the ideological differences between its Members. \nAs the confidence being reposed in the United Nations has increased, so \nhave the responsibilities the Organization is being called upon to undertake. \n\nYet its resources remain precarious. There is an urgent need for the \nOrganization to be strengthened, in order to be able to be appropriately \nrestructured, and to be provided with adequate means meet the challenges \nbefore it. \nIt is critical that the United Nations organs be made more representative \nso that they can cater more meaningfully to the interests and aspirations of \nall its Members. The objective should be to make the decision-making process \nin the United Nations, including the Security Council, more democratic and \ntransparent. It is with this in mind that Uganda will positively examine the \nvarious proposals for reform of the United Nations. We are thus prepared to \nexamine proposals for reform and expansion of the Security Council to reflect \ncontemporary realities that will lead to a more equitable and balanced \nrepresentation without, however, sacrificing capacity and efficiency. \nThe present structure of the Security Council reflects the realities of \n1945 and the resultant cold war. Countries were designated permanent members \nbecause of their capacity, at the time, to contribute to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security and to prevent war. For the record, it ought \nto be stated, with appreciation, that the Organization's structures have \ndischarged their principal obligations well, and have, in particular, \nsafeguarded the international community against a world war and against a \nnuclear catastrophe. \nIt must, however, be acknowledged that we are now moving into an age \nwhere new issues such as development, environmental protection and \ntechnological advancement are critical in international relations and affect \n\nthe security of the world. We therefore believe it is necessary to review the \ncriteria for permanent membership in order to take into account the capacity \nof countries to contribute in this regard. \n\nIf only for the sake of accountability, it is imperative that Member \nStates, on which our Organization will increasingly depend as the main source \nof contributions for the implementation of its new agenda for the next \ncentury, should also have a say in the decision-making structures of the \nUnited Nations. \nSecondly, in any restructuring of the Council, it is also important that \nconsideration be given to having for each major region a permanent member, \nwhich would be designated through consultation with the relevant regional \ngroups or organizations. An important criterion to take into account is that \na country, large or small, seeking membership on the Security Council must \nfully embrace, and be seen to act in accordance with, the underlying values of \nthe United Nations mandate for peace, respect for human rights, \ndemocratization and other accepted international norms. In our view that \nwould enhance both confidence in the Council on the part of the Members of the \nOrganization and the acceptability of the Council's decisions. \nWhile the rapprochement between the super-Powers, as well as the \nprevailing international climate, has been instrumental in the resolution of \nlong-standing conflicts, we should not be lulled into complacency. There are \nstill many formidable obstacles to overcome in our quest for a more peaceful, \nsecure, just and equitable new world order. Along with increased integration \namong States and increased democratic governance, we see centrifugal forces \ntearing States and societies apart, be it in Europe or in developing \ncountries. Many of those conflicts are driven by ethnic, religious, racial or \nother sectarian differences and have resulted in the loss of many lives and \nthe suffering of very large numbers of innocent people on account of \ndisplacement, the destruction of social and economic infrastructure, the \n\nbreakdown of law and order, and the lack of food, medical facilities and \nshelter. Quite appropriately, these conflicts ought to be the focus of our \nattention in our deliberations. In addressing ourselves to such conflicts, it \nis legitimate for the international community to press for their peaceful and \nprompt resolution and to resort to such mechanisms as are deemed practical in \ncoming to the immediate rescue, with humanitarian assistance, of those who are \nsuffering. National sovereignty should not be invoked for the prevention of \ndelivering needed humanitarian assistance to the innocent. \nIn South Africa we were encouraged by the positive steps taken by \nMr. De Klerk towards the dismantling of the apartheid apparatus. The repeal \nof the legislative pillars of apartheid the Population Registration Act, the \nGroup Areas Act and the Land Act followed by the convening of the Convention \nfor a Democratic South Africa (CODESA), gave us hope that at long last we were \non the verge of putting in motion an irreversible process towards the \nestablishment of a united, non-racial and democratic South Africa. It was \ntherefore a matter of deep regret that the process was subsequently undermined \nand endangered by the violence which claimed thousands of lives among the \nblack population. We vividly recall the carnage at Boipatong early this year \nand more recently in the Ciskei bantustan. The failure of. the South African \nGovernment to prevent and contain violence clearly raised doubts about the \nPretoria Government's commitment to the process of fully dismantling apartheid \nand ushering into the country a truly democratic order. \nWe welcome the recent talks between Mr. Nelson Mandela and Mr. De Klerk \naimed at breaking the impasse. Those talks should give impetus to the \nprocess. The De Klerk Government needs to take drastic steps to control \nviolence and to engender confidence in the negotiation process. It should \n\nalso release all remaining political prisoners without delay. We commend the \ndecision of the United Nations to station observers in South Africa at this \ntime to monitor the situation and to assist in the process towards democratic \nchange. It remains our conviction that many more observers are needed in \norder to ensure an effective international presence. \nThis Organization has been at the forefront of the struggle against \napartheid and it is imperative for it to stay the course until the objective \nis achieved. Uganda's position remains that until the apartheid constitution \nis scrapped and replaced with one which guarantees human rights and political \nfreedoms to all South Africans on equal terms, we shall not have achieved our \ngoal. While agreeable to the phasing out of sanctions in response to the \nprogress registered, we believe the international community should maintain \nthe necessary pressure to keep the South African Government negotiating in \ngood faith. It is critical to agree on a constitution that enjoys the widest \nconsensus. To that end, it becomes crucial for all parties in South Africa to \ntake part in the negotiations and for South African leaders and the \ninternational community to spare no effort in encouraging all necessary \nconsultations to ensure that no significant group feels left out. \nThe events in South Africa have a great impact on developments elsewhere \nin southern Africa. Apartheid has always been a source of destabilization for \nthe region, especially for the front-line States, with Angola and Mozambique \nbeing the most affected. Over the years, those countries have been the object \nof a destabilization campaign that encouraged fratricidal internal conflicts. \nWe are glad to note that in both countries progress has been made towards \nreconciliation and the comprehensive resolution of their internal conflicts. \n\nAngola has just held an election in which all the parties have participated. \nThe United Nations, through the United Nations Angola Verification Mission, \n(UNAVEM) II, has greatly contributed to the creation of an atmosphere \nconducive to reconciliation. In Mozambique, the Government and RENAMO have \nreached an accord, which is spelt out in the Joint Declaration signed in \nRome. We welcome that accord, and it is our hope that a cease-fire agreement \nwill soon be signed so as to facilitate elections and pave the way for an \nenduring peace. \nMozambique, Angola and other front-line States have borne the brunt of \nthe struggle against apartheid. Their economic and social infrastructures \nhave, in the process, been damaged. Their economies will therefore take a \nlong time to recover. The long drought they are currently experiencing has \ncompounded these problems. I wish to call on the international community to \nrender them the requisite assistance for their economic recovery and \ndevelopment. \nIn Somalia we have a disaster of enormous proportions which, on the one \nhand, is man-made and, on the other, is compounded by drought. Both the OAU \nand African leaders in the regional and subregional contexts have made \nstrenuous efforts to resolve the underlying political differences, but without \nsuccess. Last Saturday President Museveni of my country, with a view to \npromoting dialogue between the parties, had discussions with, among others, \nSomali interim President Ali Mahdi and General Farah Aideed of the United \nSomali Congress, in which he appealed to both of them to resolve their \ndifferences. Already the conflict has brought misery and massive loss of life \nto the Somali people. A major problem now is that the continued fighting is \n\nmaking it extremely difficult to distribute food. We appeal to the various \ngroups in Somalia to put an end to the conflict. We commend the efforts of \nthe United Nations and its agencies, such as the United Nations Children's \nFund (UNICEF), at providing humanitarian assistance, and we call on the \ninternational community to increase support for this initiative. We appeal to \nthe various groups involved in the fighting in Somalia to cooperate with the \nUnited Nations and work for national reconciliation. We support the call by \nthe current OAU Chairman, President Abdou Diouf of Senegal, for the convening \nof an international conference on Somalia after due preparation. \nThe Secretary-General, in his annual report and in \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", \nunderscores the role of regional and subregional efforts in defusing tension \nand in working out long-term solutions. We agree with the Secretary-General's \nobservations. \nIn East Africa the efforts of our Heads of State have gone a long way \ntowards finding long-term solutions to regional problems, in particular that \nof refugees. \n\nThe joint commissions we have with our neighbours have been most helpful as \nconfidence-building measures. The United Nations should be supportive of our \nefforts. \nAs regards Liberia, Uganda will continue to support the initiative of the \nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for a peaceful settlement. \nThe groups in Liberia should cooperate with the EOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring \nGroup (ECOMOG) and abide by the terms of the accord they reached at \nYamoussoukro, which were recently reaffirmed by the Dakar summit of ECOWAS, \nespecially with regard to demobilization and peaceful transition to democratic \ngovernance. There is also need for active involvement of the United Nations \nto assist the subregion in preventing the situation from getting* worse. \nThe conflict in southern Sudan has been a source of anguish for us. The \npeople in this area have for long experienced the agony of war with the \nattendant loss of lives and the problems of refugees and population \ndisplacement. The path towards a long-term solution lies in dialogue and \nreconciliation among the parties in the Sudan. Time is of the essence in this \nsituation. Uganda appreciates and encourages the efforts of President \nBabangida and of the OAU towards this end. I wish to register our gratitude \nto the international community for coming to the rescue of. the civilian \npopulation with humanitarian aid. It is our hope that both the Government of \nSudan and the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) will facilitate the \ninternational humanitarian relief effort, which at the moment is, regrettably, \nsuspended, with only little help reaching the affected population. \nUganda commends the fruitful regional and international initiatives for \nthe resolution of the social and armed conflict in Rwanda. Uganda \nacknowledges and supports the ongoing dialogue, under Tanzanian mediation, \n\nbetween the Government of Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic Front, in \naccordance with agreements and recommendations reached in regional conferences \nand under OAU auspices. Uganda appreciates the constructive and helpful role \nplayed by the international observers in these negotiations. \nAs to Western Sahara, Security Council resolution 690 (1991) remains the \nonly agreed basis for the resolution of the problem. It is our hope that the \nobstacles with regard to the criteria of eligibility to vote will soon be \nresolved so that the way can be paved for holding the referendum as envisaged \nin the settlement plan. \nThe Middle East crisis, at the core of which is the question of \nPalestine, has been one of the most intractable problems on the agenda of the \nUnited Nations. Peace in the region will continue to be elusive if a solution \nis not found to that question. Uganda thus welcomed the United States \ninitiative in launching negotiations between all the parties concerned, \nbeginning with the Madrid conference last year. While we regret that no \nbreakthrough has yet been made, we are encouraged that the dialogue is still \ncontinuing. We call on the parties to persist in their negotiations, remove \nmutual suspicion, engender confidence, and grapple with the real issues that \nwill bring forward a comprehensive, just and durable solution. \nUganda welcomed the restoration of Kuwait's independence, in which the \nUnited Nations played a key role. It is our hope that with the Gulf War \nbehind us, it will be possible to restore prosperity and to refocus the \nenergies of the countries in the region on economic and social development. \nAs regards Cyprus, we support the Secretary-General's efforts to reach an \nagreement on fundamental principles for an overall settlement. We maintain \n \nour position that the settlement should safeguard the sovereignty, unity and \nterritorial integrity of Cyprus. \nIn the Korean peninsula, Uganda continues to be supportive of the \naspirations of the Korean people for peaceful reunification. We wish to \nencourage them in their dialogue for. this purpose.* \nIn Cambodia, we note the progress made by the United Nations Transitional \nAuthority in implementing the agreements for a comprehensive political \nsettlement. It is for us a matter of regret that there are problems with \nregard to the second phase of the cease-fire regarding the regrouping, \ncantoning and disarming of the various armed forces. We call on all parties \nto the agreements to live up to their undertakings so that peace and stability \ncan return to that country. \nUganda has been deeply concerned at the continuing conflict in the former \nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was a pillar of the \nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries. It contributed a lot to the Movement and \nto the struggle for the independence of our States when the cold war was at \nits height. It is, therefore, a source of great anguish to see that in its \nbreakup, Yugoslavia has become a region of instability, strife and war based \non ethnic and religious differences. We reject the notion of \\\"ethnic \ncleansing\\\" as being repugnant to accepted norms. \nThe United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has been functioning under \nvery dangerous and trying circumstances. It deserves our maximum support as \nit endeavours to restore peace in the area. We call on the parties to embrace \nthe path of peace and reconciliation. \n\nIn the field of disarmament, Uganda welcomes the successful conclusion of \nthe negotiations regarding the Convention on the complete and effective \nprohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons \nand on their destruction, which is due to be submitted to the Assembly at this \nsession for adoption. As a party to the non-proliferation Treaty, Uganda also \nlooks forward to actively participating in the preparation for the 1995 Review \nConference, which will decide on the extension of the Treaty. It is our hope \nthat the review will strengthen the Treaty by removing the present imbalances, \nand result in increased assistance to developing countries in the peaceful \napplication of nuclear energy. \nUganda is happy to see that the question of human rights has a place of \npride on the international agenda. In both our domestic and our foreign \npolicies, we give high priority to this issue. As part of its commitment to \nthis end, a preoccupation of my Government has been to strengthen the rule of \nlaw and our capacity to enforce those rights. We regard the proper training \nof law enforcement officials as crucial. Therefore, this has been given due \npriority in our programmes. Currently, Uganda has embarked on a process for \nthe enactment of a new constitution that should have built-in safeguards for \nfundamental human rights and political freedoms. I wish to place on record \nour appreciation to those countries that are rendering assistance to Uganda in \nthis regard. \nUganda looks forward to the third World Conference on Human Rights \nscheduled to take place in Vienna next year. That Conference should provide \nus with an opportunity to enhance the implementation of existing human rights \ninstruments, to develop new norms where necessary, and to examine fully the \nintrinsic relationship between human rights and development. \n\nIt has been emphasized that people must be at the centre of development. \nWe agree. This requires us to strive for the attainment of social justice and \nequality for all peoples. Our avowed commitment for human rights and \ndemocracy cannot be taken seriously if it is not equally matched with a \ncommitment to address the problems of underdevelopment, mass poverty and the \nsocial misery in which the overwhelming majority of the world population is \ntrapped. Durable peace can only be anchored in the bedrock of economic \nprogress among and within nations. \n \nRegrettably, as we approach the next millennium, the economic and social \nproblems of the developing countries continue to worsen. The overall external \nenvironment remains unfavourable, with most of our countries confronted with \nworsening terms of trade, a crippling debt burden and a reduction in the flow \nof resources earmarked for development. While there is increasing integration \nin the process of production and the globalization of world trade, the trend \nof marginalization of the least developed countries continues. \nOf grave concern is the critical economic situation in Africa. The \nSecretary-General in his annual report aptly describes the plight of Africa as \nfollows: \n\\\"Most Africans are poorer today than they were when their countries \nachieved independence in the late 1950s and 1960s. The continent as a \nwhole accounts for 32 out of the world's 47 least developed countries. \nAfrica is the only low-income region in the world where the number of \npeople living in poverty is, if the current trends continue, likely to \nincrease by the year 2000. It is also the only region of the world whose \ntotal debt equals or exceeds its economic output. The freshly-witnessed \nmomentum for political pluralism in Africa can hardly withstand a \ncontinuing assault by desertification, famine and deprivation. Poverty \nis infertile soil for democracy. It breeds a search for survival that \ncannot be held back by national frontiers. The African countries need to \nbecome masters of their economic destiny in a more supportive global \nframework.\\\" (A/47/1, para. 62) \nIn response to this plight, the General Assembly adopted at its \nforty-sixth session, in resolution 46/151, the New Agenda for the \n\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s, whose objective is to accelerate the \ntransformation, integration and diversification of African economies. The New \nAgenda aims at achieving an average real growth rate in gross national product \nof about 6 per cent a year through the decade, paying special attention to \nsuch goals as increased life expectancy, lower rates of child and maternal \nmortality, and improved health, water, sanitation, basic education and shelter. \nMost African countries have undertaken major reforms of their internal \neconomic policies and mechanisms. In Uganda, for example, we are committed to \nthe liberalization of the economy and have enacted an attractive foreign \ninvestment code. These reforms can be meaningful only if the external \neconomic environment is supportive and there is a positive response in the \nform of increased investment and trade. It will be recalled that the United \nNations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development 1986-1990 did \nnot achieve its objectives because of the failure of the international \ncommunity to provide the requisite resources. For the New Agenda to succeed, \ntherefore, our partners must have the political will to live up to their \ncommitments. \nThe System-Wide Plan of Action which is before the General Assembly \nprovides a framework for the United Nations system to give more focussed \nattention to Africa. In this regard, Uganda strongly welcomes the \nInternational Conference for Assistance to African Children, scheduled to take \nplace in Dakar in November, and we commend the United Nations Children's Fund \nfor the preparatory work already undertaken. \nWe appeal to the international agencies to earmark resources for the \nimplementation of the New Agenda. In this connection, we commend the \n\nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development's Special Programme for \nSub-Saharan Africa. I also wish to register my appreciation to the Government \nof Japan for initiating and arranging to host, in 1993, an African development \nconference that will bring together African countries, major aid donors and \ninternational agencies to discuss ways and means of accelerating African \neconomic development. \nTwo major conferences were held last year: the Eighth United Nations \nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VIII) and the United Nations \nConference on Environment and Development, which culminated in Agenda 21. It \nis necessary to maintain the momentum achieved at Rio and at UNCTAD VIII by \nputting in place measures to implement those decisions. The Rio Summit \nestablished a clear link between environment, growth and development. The \nneed to help developing countries achieve sustainable development was \nunderscored. It is our hope that the Uruguay Round will soon be successfully \ncompleted and that it will remove the impediments to our products reaching the \nmarkets of the industrialized countries. \nIn the report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277), issued as a follow-up to \nthe statement adopted at the conclusion of the Security Council's historic \nSummit meeting of 31 January 1992, the Secretary-General outlines his \nproposals on how the United Nations role in the maintenance of international \npeace and security can be strengthened. The report contains a number of \nuseful proposals on preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-building and the \nrole of regional groupings which, if adopted, will enhance the effectiveness \nof the United Nations. We agree that regional arrangements in many cases \npossess a potential for early warning of. \n\nmonitoring and defusing conflict situations, a potential that should be \nrealized. The United Nations and the international community should help them \nto improve that capability. \nThe Organization of African Unity, for example, is in the process of \ntrying to establish a mechanism for conflict-prevention, conflict management \nand conflict-resolution. Such a mechanism would strengthen the OAU's \npeace-keeping capabilities. Any assistance given in this regard will be an \nimportant and useful investment for peace and development in Africa. \nI wish to emphasize that, as indicated in the Secretary-General's annual \nreport, underdevelopment and poverty are prime sources of conflict. The \nUnited Nations, through its macroeconomic policy formulation and \nimplementation, has played a central role in forging global consensus on \ndevelopment issues. As envisaged by the United Nations Charter, the \nOrganization must continue fulfilling this function, especially now, when many \ndeveloping countries are restructuring with a view to integrating their \nnations into the global economy. We should therefore endeavour to integrate \nour agenda for peace with our agenda for development. By strengthening the \nOrganization's peacemaking and peace-keeping capabilities, we should not, by \ndefault or neglect, reduce the United Nations focus on economic and social \nissues. Clearly, development and peace are so intimately related that they \nmust be tackled under a common agenda. \nWe stand at a historic watershed, especially given the fact that the \nglobal transition period we are entering is marked by contradictory trends. \nAt this crossroads, however, a unique opportunity exists for the United \nNations to achieve the objectives envisaged in the Charter. Whether or not \n\nthe United Nations can help create a better world for the twenty-first \ncentury, in which the interests of us all are adequately catered for, depends \non the structures we create now. History will judge us harshly if we fail to \nconstruct a firm foundation for the edifice of the future. That is our \nchallenge."

        "file_text": "Let me congratulate you. Sir, on \nyour election as President of the General Assembly at its forth-seventh \nsession. I wish you much success and promise you full support. \nI thank your predecessor, Mr. Shihabi, for guiding the General Assembly \nto success at its forth-sixth session. \nThe past year weakened further the illusion that the end of the cold war \nwould facilitate a speedy and effective solution of problems that built up \nduring the post-war period. It has been a sobering year, during which we have \nbeen involved in the gradual process of getting acquainted with the possible. \nSometimes we see euphoria replaced by total pessimism and little faith. \nWhile the era of bipolarity is over and democracy is winning, many \nconflicts remain unresolved, and a new generation of conflicts is beginning. \nIn addition to conflicts with which we have dealt routinely, but \nunsuccessfully, over the years, we are now witnessing a great variety of \nwars. The number of zones of conflict gets larger and larger. \nNagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria, South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Bosnia and \nHerzegovina mainly Bosnia and Herzegovina - are new symbols of violence to \nwhich we have no answers. \nThe United Nations, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe \n(CSCE), the European Communities, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n(NATO), the Western European Union (WEU) and the Council of Europe are unable, \ndespite all their commendable efforts, to exert sufficient pressure to secure \nthe desired solutions to these tragedies. In this respect, there has been \ngrowing impatience and anxiety, as well as dissatisfaction and criticism, on \nthe part of the public and the mass media. It has become routine to question \nthe role of international institutions as instruments that are suitable for \nconflict management. Let us be frank about this: we face a problem of \ncredibility. Much will be at stake if we fail to deal immediately with it.* \nThere is a risk that a very typical challenge of the 1990s the \nrelationship between statehood and nationhood will become a phenomenon of \nworld politics that defies efficient international regulation. In this \nrespect in particular, international institutions have a fundamental role to \nplay in providing a guarantee that the processes will develop on a basis of \ndemocracy and of respect for universal and civilized human values. \nHowever, it would be a mistake to start the search for solutions by \nchallenging international institutions as such. It would be a mistake to \ndecide to modify the United Nations radically and rebuild it by rejecting the \nwisdom of its founding fathers, as embodied in the Charter. The claim that \nrevitalization of the United Nations requires not a change in the Charter but, \non the contrary, full implementation of the Charter is often considered to be \na cliche. I regard it not as a cliche but as a wise approach, indicating not \nrigidity but, rather, a willingness to exploit fully the political potential \nof the Charter. \nIt is true that the Charter makes no explicit reference to drugs, \norganized crime, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), indebtedness \nor the widening gap between the haves and the have-nots. However, it contains \nfundamental political principles on the basis of which these problems can and \nshould be solved. To that end, the things that are lacking are sometimes \ninstruments, sometimes money and very often the political will. What is \nneeded is - in short - a change in our approach to the priorities of the \nactivities of the Organization. \nIt is in this climate that the Secretary-General's report the \\\"Agenda \nfor Peace\\\" - has come into our hands. The recommendations contained in that \nreport provide useful guidelines for effective exploitation of the Charter's \npotential. I believe that the section dealing with the prevention of conflict \nrequires elaboration, as it has been demonstrated that activity in this field \nwill increasingly become one of the basic orientations of multilateral \ndiplomacy. \nIn summary, the Secretary-General's report deals with confidence-building \nmeasures, fact-finding, early warning and preventive diplomacy. I am familiar \nwith these terms as the CSCE, at its third summit, held in Helsinki, firmly \nincorporated them into the list of its instruments. \nMention of the CSCE brings me to a question that Czechoslovakia has \nproposed as a new item for the General Assembly's agenda - coordination of the \nactivities of the United Nations and the Conference on Security and \nCooperation in Europe. In this connection, let me take the former Yugoslavia \nas an example. Several times, in my capacity as Chairman of the CSCE Council \nof Ministers, I have come across situations in which activities of the United \nNations and activities of the CSCE overlap. Naturally, such overlapping has \nreduced the effectiveness of those activities. \nMy meetings with Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the United Nations Special \nRapporteur for Human Rights in the former Yugoslavia, clearly demonstrated a \nneed for, and an interest in, regular coordination of United missions with \nthose of the CSCE. In this connection, I should say that the United Nations \nmade an excellent choice when it picked Mr. Mazowiecki for its human-rights \nactivities in this explosive area. \nHowever, this problem does not concern just the former Yugoslavia. Like \nthe CSCE, the United Nations has sent missions to Nagorno-Karabakh and \nTransnistria. As the aims of all these missions have been coordinated only in \noutline, it is no wonder that the parties to the conflict often fail to \nunderstand the purpose of these foreign delegations coming to see them and \nasking the same questions. It is often unclear how they differ. \nThe CSCE summit that took place in Helsinki in July laid the basis for \nimproved cooperation between the United Nations and the CSCE, as well as other \nother organizations NATO, the Western European Union (WEU) and the Council \nof Europe. The need for such interaction resulted in the London Conference on \nthe former Yugoslavia. This was the first example of systematic cooperation \nbetween three international organizations, and it amounted to the first \ninterlocking action by the European Community, the United Nations and the \nCSCE. As the London Conference was attended also by the Organization of the \nIslamic Conference and the International Red Cross as a non-governmental \norganization, I see it as the germ of a loose system of cooperation between \nvarious institutions. \nIt seems to me that the time is right to consider seriously the convening \nof an informal \\\"brainstorming\\\" meeting of the United Nations, the CSCE, the \nEuropean Community, NATO, the WEU and the Council of Europe to discuss the \nidea of an interlocking system of international organizations. The purpose of \nthe proposed General Assembly agenda item on coordination between the United \nNations and the CSCE is not simply to secure a resolution. In my opinion, \nthat discussion of the issue at this session could develop at two levels - the \nconceptual level, at which the fundamental political meaning of coordination, \nboth in the immediate future and in the light of medium-term and long-term \nprospects, could be clarified; and the practical level, at which the \nactivities of the two institutions have already begun to overlap, making it \npossible to draw conclusions. \nIt will certainly be in the interests of the United Nations and of the \nCSCE to have the meaning of \\\"preventive diplomacy\\\" and \\\"early warning\\\" \nclarified. These terms have already taken on a very definite meaning at the \nCSCE, and the majority of United Nations Member States, as they do not \nparticipate in the CSCE, will probably want to become acquainted with them. \nThe conceptual discussion might focus also on the relationship between \nthe United Nations and the CSCE as institutions each of which has the task of \nlooking after the security of its members. This is especially so as the CSCE \nnow covers an area stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok. \nFor the purpose of getting the discussion under way, I should like, in my \nnational capacity, to put forward some ideas. Whenever the Security Council \nwishes to discuss a security issue within the competence of the CSCE, a \nrepresentative of the CSCE should be invited to provide the Council with the \nnecessary information on any CSCE activities in respect of that issue or \notherwise to contribute to the work of the Council. The Council and its \nPresident, as well as the United Nations Secretary-General, should be kept \nconstantly informed of the main activities of the CSCE, and the reverse should \napply. \nCoordination of the human-rights activities of the United Nations and of \nthe CSCE could be improved by, for example, regular CSCE participation at \nmeetings of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and its committees, \nthe Economic and Social Council and the Third Committee of the General \nAssembly. And is there any reason why we should not establish working \ncontacts between the United Nations Centre for Human Rights in Geneva and the \nCSCE's Warsaw Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights? \nIn addition, one of the main elements of the CSCE's early-warning \nsystem the High Commissioner on National Minorities might have some link \nwith the United Nations. Indeed, at the appropriate time, that might even be \nturned into an institutional link. In the long term, the CSCE human-rights \ninstitutions, structures and mechanisms could become tools of both the United \nNations and the Council of Europe. \nSuch discussion as I have suggested could dispel the fear of United \nNations Member States which do not participate in the CSCE that the Helsinki \nprocess is an elite club that institutionalizes the gap between the rich North \nand the poor South. \nWe must also ensure that there is a proper understanding of the \npeace-keeping role of the CSCE vis-a-vis that of the United Nations. The most \nrecent reason for this comparison is to be found in President Bush's statement \nto the General Assembly on Monday, in which he suggested that the \npeace-keeping function of the United Nations should be expanded considerably. \nThe peace-keeping concept of the United Nations is not identical to that of \nthe CSCE, and I believe that there is a good prospect of their becoming \ncomplementary. It should be remembered that, in this respect, the North \nAtlantic Alliance and the Western European Union have made important offers. \nIt is unlikely that we shall be able to avoid having a debate on \npeacemaking and peace-keeping. The crisis in the former Yugoslavia \nnecessitates a really serious discussion of this question. It is unnecessary \nfor me to reiterate my country's full support for the United Nations \npeace-keeping operations, as there are Czech and Slovak \\\"blue helmets\\\" in the \nformer Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia has contributed to the United Nations \noperations in Angola, Somalia and Iraq. To be of practical benefit, \ndiscussion of the interaction between the United Nations and the CSCE should \ntake place annually. \nIn today's world the United Nations can play an even more important role \nin arms control and disarmament. I am thinking especially of the Convention \non the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of \nBacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction. When \nthe United Nations Register of Conventional Arms becomes operational, it will \nhave a substantial role to play. \nThe Secretary-General's report, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", says, \\\"globalism \nand nationalism need not be viewed as opposing trends\\\" (para. 19). These \nwords attracted my attention as they reflect one of the peculiarities of our \ntimes. They embody the historical experience of the two nations of \nCzechoslovakia experience that I should like to share with members. \nThe idea of the right of nations to self-determination advanced by \nPresident Wilson facilitated the disintegration of the former Austro-Hungarian \nmonarchy, thus opening up the way for the creation of Czechoslovakia. That \nwas 74 years ago. \nCzechoslovakia emerged, however, under the influence of the notion that \nthere was a Czechoslovak nation, whereas it should have been admitted that \nthere were two distinct nations the Czechs and the Slovaks. But the idea of \nCzechoslovakism, which resulted in the creation of a common State for the \nworld's two closest Slavic nations, impeded relations between those nations. \nThus a specific Czecho-Slovak problem was born, and it remains unresolved. \nAt about the same time, communism tied nations together by means of the \nfalse idea of proletarian internationalism. This was bound to affect \nrelations between the Czechs and the Slovaks. However, our experience \nindicates that communism was not the root of these problems; it simply gave \nthem a new dimension. Many nations are now searching for a new role in Europe \nand in the world by seeking integration into larger economic entities and \npolitical groups. \nI believe that, so far as Czechoslovakia is concerned, one possible \nsolution lies in the replacement of the existing federalist pattern by new \nties. Understanding and viable coexistence between nations cannot be based on \nfalse and outdated ideas. Czechoslovakia is therefore preparing to establish \ntwo closely connected sovereign States by creating a common economy space and \nretaining intact the close contacts between the peoples of the two republics. \nWe want to introduce elements of European integration into the relations \nbetween the republics. \nWhat is now taking place in Czechoslovakia is a process aimed at the \ncreation of a solid basis for a model of integration such as has been \ndeveloping democratically in Western Europe and has led to the creation and \ndevelopment of the European Communities. \nminim \nGlobalism and nationalism are not necessarily opposing trends, provided \nthat the right to self-determination is accompanied by the desire for closer \ncooperation with other nations and by efficient participation in international \nsystems of guaranteeing the basic values upon which the world and especially \nthe fragile structure of peace are built. We live in an era of global \nintegration comprising different subsystems, among which the United Nations \nhas an irreplaceable role to play. \nI should like, in conclusion, to say that this statement is a sort of \nfarewell speech of the Czechoslovak federation to the United Nations. It is \nhighly probable that by January of next year the federation will have ceased \nto exist. Thus one of the founding members of the United Nations will give \nits place in international politics to the two new independent States. It is \nmy hope that all the current Members of the United Nations will extend to the \nCzech republic and the Slovak republic the understanding that they have always \nshown to Czechoslovakia, by admitting them to membership as soon as possible.

        "file_text": "At the outset, I \nwish to convey the Egyptian Government's congratulations to the Presidency of \nBulgaria on the election to the presidency of the General Assembly of \nMr. Ganev and his assumption of that high post. \nI should like also to put on record our appreciation of the capable \nmanner in which Mr. Samir Shihabi, the permanent representative of the Kingdom \nof Saudi Arabia, conducted the work of the Assembly at its last session. \nIn addition, I want to congratulate the States that have recently joined \nthe United Nations. I hope that they will participate effectively and \nconstructively in the activities of the Organization and in defence of the \npurposes and principles of its Charter. \nThis session, like past sessions and those that will follow in the 1990s, \nis of great importance. It is being held at a stage of evolution and change \ncharacterized by unprecedented dynamism and speed. It is a transitional stage \nin the course of which new patterns of international relations are being \nmoulded. Hence, what the current session of the General Assembly is \nwitnessing is not a stable international situation but, rather, a phase in a \ncontinuing process of evolution and change. Consequently, it is difficult to \npredict with any certainty what the years and decades to come may hold for the \nfuture of the world and its order. \nThis uninterrupted process of change, however, requires the reaffirmation \nof certain matters which, in our view, constitute the basics which should \ndetermine the image of the future. \nThe process of change should have a human content. No progress or \ncivilization could have a point of departure other than respect for man, his \nrights, freedoms and dignity without discrimination because of colour, creed \nor religion. Only in a context of respect for peoples' rights, cultures and \nachievements and for their right to have their just demands met can there be \nany change or progress. \nInternational cooperation and interdependence based on justice and \nfairness constitute the basis for salubrious change and for positive movement \ntowards any breakthrough of the future. \nIn the context of the existing challenges, international peace and \nsecurity are the collective responsibility of North and South, which should \nshoulder their burdens and obligations and, thereafter, share the dividends of \nsuccess. Undoubtedly, the ever-increasing role of the Security Council \nnecessitates a review of its membership and the scope of its responsibility, \nso that it may be a genuine reflection of international and regional forces. \n\nIn their new concept, international relations should be integral in \nsubstance, rational in content and democratic in context. Therefore, the \nformulation of those relations requires collective participation if they are \nto reflect the interests of the international community, with all its \ncomponents, and of the balance between rights and duties and between power and \nresponsibility. \nInternational relations, in their current state of evolution, reflect a \ngreater awareness and wider recognition of the relationship between future and \ndestiny. Similarly, they reflect constant movement towards realism in dealing \nwith inherited and nascent dilemmas. Nevertheless, they have been unable to \nremove elements of suspicion and feelings of frustration. Rather, they have \nhelped to exacerbate such feelings in many places and about many issues, \nespecially in the third world. \n\nWhile the seeds of change indicate a relaxation of global military \nconfrontations, at the same time, they have crystallized the inherited \nsediments of regional and ethnic tensions and have transformed the equation of \nrivalry between East and West into an equation between North and South that \nhas not taken final shape yet as it has not dealt, and does not seem to be \ngoing to deal, rationally, with the massive historic imbalances between \nregions of affluence and regions of scarcity, between regions of progress and \nthose of backwardness. Indeed, there is genuine concern that unless it takes \nplace under agreed controls, the ongoing process of change, will lead to the \ncodification of these imbalances and, thereby, make them a feature of the new \nworld order, with all that that would entail in terms of turmoil and chaos. \nThese features of today's world, and portents of tomorrow's world, give \nrise to very real fears regarding the dominance of injustice and inequality in \ninternational relations on the political, security, economic and social levels. \nAfter this foreword, which reflects the feelings of the third world, \nEgypt's delegation would like to discuss four issues: the state of affairs in \nthe United Nations; the situation in the third world; disarmament; and peace \nefforts in the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Europe. \nIt is highly important that the purposes of the Charter be made the \nfoundation of the new era, so that justice may be ensured, social progress \npromoted and better standards of living achieved in greater freedom as \nexpressed by the Secretary-General in his Agenda for Peace. In our view, this \nis the real core of positive development and of any world order that strives \nfor stability and peace. \n\nThe purposes of the Charter, however, cannot be realized, and the strong \ndesire to ensure justice and to promote social and economic progress cannot be \nfulfilled, in an age in which acute racialist trends rear their heads anew, in \nwhich dangers threaten the lives of whole communities, and in which there are \nsigns of a return to foreign intervention in the affairs of States and of \npeoples. \nHence, foremost among the main goals highlighted by the Secretary-General \nin his plan is action to deal, in a wider context, with the deepest causes of \ntension economic deprivation and social injustice. Dealing with these banes \nshould be the cornerstone of the new world era. In this connection, I should \nlike to voice our strong support for a statement made by the \nSecretary-General a statement that seems to have commanded insufficient \nconsideration and appreciation. The Secretary-General said: \n\\\"It is noticeable that there is a common moral concept which is \nincreasingly emerging and spreading among the world's peoples and \nnations. It is reflected in international laws, most of which have \nemerged through efforts made by the United Nations.\\\" \nThis statement deals with an issue on which, in our view, we should \nreflect, for we are in real need of a common moral concept. For many decades, \nthe world has been plagued by policies of racial discrimination. Now is the \ntime, the opportunity, to rid ourselves of those policies. Unfortunately, \nhowever, other racial conflicts have erupted, and there have been calls for \nethnic purity. This shows that the world still lacks a common moral concept \nand the means of developing it in a rational and sound way. \nSuch a concept should be based on consensus among our various societies, \nand it should be developed within the framework of our political experience \n\nsince the Second World War. It should also be based on an analysis of all \nthat has been achieved and all that has not been achieved, with a view to \nassessing the role played by.existing human-rights instruments and deciding \nwhether to develop such instruments further or to replace them with new ones. \nWe need a new world social contract between various world communities, \ncultures and civilizations. This new social contract should be based not on \none model, no matter how successful such a model may have proved to be, but on \nrules upon which there is common agreement and which take into consideration \nthe intrinsic characteristics of various societies, with a view to devising \nthe best framework for the achievement of unity through diversity. In this \nway, we would define \\\"respect for human rights\\\" with reference to a concept \nshared and approved by all a concept that all would contract to implement. \nThe new world social contract for which we call a contract linking \nparties from different civilizations and cultures should be constructed \nwithin the framework of the new era in which neither globalism and nationalism \nnor commonality and individuality should be regarded as opposing trends, but \nshould be discussed from the point of view of peaceful evolution, equilibrium \nand respect for the purposes of the Charter. \nI strongly believe that calling for a new social contract is linked \norganically with the preventive diplomacy, participation in peacemaking and \ncontribution to peace-keeping called for in the Agenda for Peace. \nThe vision that the Secretary-General has put forth last June in his \nAgenda for Peace reflects hope as much as it reflects challenges. \nThis vision embodies a call for the development of the role of the United \nNations from one of mere crisis management and conflict resolution to a more \ncomprehensive one which would embrace social, economic and humanitarian \n\nissues. It is a vision that presents newly developed dimensions imposed by \nthe nature of the profound changes now taking place in the patterns of \ninternational relations. \nThere should be a comprehensive and in-depth debate on this report and on \nthe quintessence of this vision of the future. This debate should take place \nin the General Assembly and the Security Council, as well as in the various \nbodies of the United Nations, side by side with intensive examination in many \nother forums. It should involve research institutes in various States and \ncontinents, and should be aimed at reaching an acceptable formula to meet the \npolitical, security, economic and social requirements of the next stage in the \nhistory of the world. \nThis Agenda for Peace keeps hope alive and sets concrete goals. It is \ncharacterized by the fact that it does not ignore or overlook the realities of \nthe situation. It strikes a balance between the possible and the desirable, \nand it constitutes a prelude to the major aim of adapting the existing \ninstruments to the new realities. \nThe international community, which accepts even calls for - greater \nresponsibility in the resolution of global and regional conflicts, also calls \nfor an effective role for the United Nations in preventing wars and making \npeace. \nRespect for the United Nations involves, by definition, respect for its \nresolutions and the mobilization of its collective will to implement those \nresolutions with a view to imposing peace, if necessary, or negotiating peace \nif intentions are genuine and the parties concerned cooperate. \n \nIn the midst of all this, we find the problems nay, problem of the third \nworld which is one of the most important issues we have to discuss in this \nforum that brings together all the peoples and nations of the world. \nIn recent weeks the third world has convened a summit meeting in \nIndonesia, in the framework of the Non-Aligned Movement. President Soeharto \naddressed the Assembly in detail, yesterday, on the meeting, in his capacity \nas head of the Non-Aligned Movement. Today, I wish to dwell on a few points: \nfirst, the new world order should be based on solid foundations of law and on \nthe principles of the Charter, as well as on an equitable sharing of \nresponsibility and a joint commitment to cooperation and solidarity; secondly, \nthe structure of that order should be dedicated to peace and justice, security \nand development and democracy at the domestic national levels, and in \ninternational relations, as well as to the promotion of the fundamental rights \nand freedoms of individual human beings and peoples; \n \nthirdly, respect for sovereignty and adherence to the principle of \nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States as a principle that \nshould not be impaired or diminished; fourthly, settlement of disputes by \npeaceful means and through continued dialogue and negotiation; fifthly, peace \nand stability are contingent on social and economic factors as much as they \nare contingent on political and military factors. Therefore, the diminishing \nprospects of economic development and social progress result in a serious \nthreat to stability, and hence, to peace; sixthly, support for holding a world \nsummit on social development that would put people and their social needs at \nthe forefront of international efforts, and provide an opportunity to deal \nwith the multi-faceted dimensions of social issues; seventhly, the United \nNations, as the world embodiment of multilateralism, has a unique opportunity \nto be the international collective instrument for establishing a new world \norder based on justice and equality. \nHerein lies the link between the Agenda for Peace and the hopes and \naspirations of the third world for a positive role through which it would \ncontribute to building the new world order. We believe that the establishment \nof this order cannot and should not be realized through imposition or \ncoercion, but rather through a democratic process in which all peoples and \nStates of the world would have a role and a say. This can be achieved only \nthrough this Organization: the United Nations. \nIn today's world, there exists a great tide towards disarmament and \ntangible progress towards agreement on its mechanisms and the achievement of \nits aims which, for long, have been sought by developed and developing nations \nalike. Third world States, represented by the Non-Aligned Movement and the \nGroup of 77, have made abundantly clear their determination to give priority \n\nto disarmament issues, particularly nuclear disarmament, and the rechannelling \nof released resources to the areas of development and to the achievement of \nsocio-economic progress. \nToday, at this very same session, the new world is trying to take yet \nanother step in that direction by introducing the Convention on the \nProhibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical \nWeapons and on Their Destruction. Egypt, which was one of the first States \nthat participated in drafting this Convention and which called for the \nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and for the elimination of weapons \nof mass destruction, should like to present to the General Assembly our \nregional view of this Convention. \nFirst, we are in favour of moving towards chemical-weapons disarmament in \nthe framework of an international Convention that would constitute a part of \nan evolving and comprehensive process of disarmament towards general and \ncomplete disarmament, particularly of weapons of mass destruction; \nSecondly, we agree with the framework and content of the Convention as \npresented by the Conference on Disarmament; \nThirdly, however, from our regional perspective, we consider that this \nConvention should not be dealt with in isolation from other efforts related to \nother weapons of mass destruction, mainly the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \nof Nuclear Weapons, the international system of safeguards and inspection, and \nthe provision of credible international guarantees; \nFourthly, we have a declared initiative regarding the establishment of a \nzone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, including \nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons and other delivery systems. \nTherefore, our view of the Convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons \ncomes within this overall framework and is an integral part of it; \n \nFifthly, Middle East Arab and non-Arab States, with the exception of one, \nhave joined the international system of inspection or the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Thus their support for the disarmament \nprocess is evident. However, the existing exception of one State gives rise \nto many security concerns, particularly as we know that this exception enables \none State in the Middle East to possess nuclear weapons without any \ninternational restrictions. It also enables this State, which possesses a \nmassive arsenal of military industries, to be engaged in a process of missile \ndevelopment in a manner that makes it an enshrined exception in the framework \nof the disarmament process. This greatly negates the effectiveness of all \ndisarmament operational instruments and threatens the whole concept of \nregional and even international disarmament. It also restricts the freedom of \nthe region's States in acceding to the Convention on the prohibition of \nchemical weapons; \nSixthly, against this backdrop, the ministerial meeting of the League of \nArab States conducted an in-depth discussion of this issue in mid-September. \nThe meeting approved the following points as a basis for the Arab position \ntowards the Convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons: full \nwillingness to deal with all disarmament proposals that would provide security \nthrough equal obligations applicable by one standard to all the States of the \nregion; reaffirmation of full support for the elimination of all weapons of \nmass destruction from the Middle East, including nuclear, chemical and \nbiological weapons, as the best way to achieve security for all the States of \nthe region; and willingness to deal with the Convention on the prohibition of \nchemical weapons and the framework of efforts aiming at the establishment of \nthe zone to the extent that the excepted State, namely Israel, would respond \n\nto international calls to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons and to subject its nuclear facilities to the international \nsafeguards system. \nThat is our position towards the Convention on the prohibition of \nchemical weapons. It is a position of support, but within the framework of an \nintegrated disarmament process at the regional level in order to maintain the \nsecurity of the Middle East States that are threatened by the existence of \nnuclear weapons in their region without any international control or legal \nobligation. \nStill dealing with the Middle East region, I should like to say that the \nstage through which the region is passing now is characterized by many \npositive elements as well as negative ones. \nIn connection with the Middle East problem and the Palestine question, \nnegotiations are currently under way, bilaterally and multilaterally, within \nthe framework of a peace process based on the land-for-peace formula, and on \nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), adopted in the \nframework of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. They \nclearly provide for inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war, \nand thus safeguard the sovereign rights and territorial integrity of all, \nthrough withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1967; and for the right of \neach State in the region to live in peace within its internationally \nguaranteed borders, thus ensuring security for all, Israel and Arab States \nalike. \nIn fact, the Government of Mr. Yitzhak Rabin has moved in the right \ndirection, dissipating clouds of uncertainty and clearing the way for hope and \n\noptimism. A basis of credibility has thus been created for the negotiations. \nThat credibility was about to be lost indefinitely because of the actions of \nthe previous Israeli Government and the former Prime Minister's statement that \nhis intention was to procrastinate for 10 years. \nHowever, it is not only the atmosphere of the negotiations that is \nimportant but also the content of those negotiations, particularly in view of \nthe fact that the Arab parties, mainly Syria, have agreed to enter into \ncomprehensive peace agreements with Israel, provided that the latter adheres \nto its obligations under the Charter, and international law as well as to the \nunanimous international resolutions that stipulate withdrawal to the \ninternational boundaries and the recognition of the legitimate rights of the \nPalestinian people. \n\nEgypt has set out in detail its integrated view of the components of a \ncomprehensive peace based on the elements of security and justice in \naccordance with the following principles: \nFirst, that the Arab-Israeli conflict in its entirety has four \ncomponents: land, Palestinian rights, security for all, and regional \ncooperation in the framework of peace; \nSecondly, the need to implement the Security Council resolutions which \nrepresent the acceptable terms of reference for a negotiating process based on \nthe formula of land for peace; \nThirdly, the special status of Al-Quds city does not prejudice the fact \nthat East Jerusalem is a part of the territories occupied since mid-1967. The \nprinciples of any settlement are as applicable to it as they are to any other \npart of the occupied territories. Its future is not to be foreclosed nor \ndecided upon unilaterally. Consequently, it represents an area of the peace \nnegotiations, whether in the interim stage or in the final stage, of a \nPalestinian-Israeli settlement; \nFourthly, a settlement should be comprehensive for all fronts, including \nthe Golan, Gaza and the West Bank, the Jordanian territories and South \nLebanon, under Security Council resolution 425 (1978), and the behests of \ninternational legality. \nFifthly, interim arrangements in the context of the talks on full \nautonomy should be made without prejudice to the right of the Palestinian \npeoples to decide their own future and the exercise of their right to self \ndetermination; \nSixthly, the problem of the post-1948 war Palestinian refugees and the \npersons displaced after the 1967 war should be dealt with in conformity with \nresolutions based on international law and consensus based on good faith. \n\nThe Egyptian view of a future Middle East within the context of new \ninternational relations, as well as the context of cultural affinity and the \nhistorical ties that bind all Arab States, together with Egypt's peaceful \nrelations with Israel, enable Egypt to play an active role in the peace \nprocess and to provide some support for the negotiations to fulfill the \nlegitimate demands called for under Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) \nand 338 (1973) and the land-for-peace formula. So much for the problem of the \nMiddle East and Palestine. \nAs for the Gulf region, which is part of the Middle East, we witness new \ntensions caused by Iran's occupation of Arab islands, the latest of which was \nAbu-Moussa. This is a development we can neither overlook nor ignore. We \ntherefore call upon Iran to reconsider its position on this issue, to adhere \nto the principles of good- neighbourliness, to respect the norms of \ninternational law and the sovereignty of States over their territories and to \nrestore the situation to the status quo ante. We hope that the course of \nrelations between Iran and the Arab peoples will be one of friendship, \nbrotherhood and cooperation. These peoples have much in common to make them \nmore united than otherwise. \nAmidst these omens for the region, we in Egypt are concerned about the \nfate of all segments of the the Iraqi people and all parts of its land. \nTherefore, while we call upon the Iraqi Government to abide by the rules and \ndecisions of international legality, we call upon the international community \nto safeguard Iraq's territorial integrity and the unity of its people. In the \nsame way, we support Kuwait's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its \ninternational borders. \n \nAs we discuss the major issues facing the world of today, I cannot but \nrefer to the situation in Africa. The African continent, and particularly in \nthe Horn of Africa, faces a range of political, economic and social problems. \nThe situation cries out for increased attention to be paid to the continent on \nthe part of the international community. In the meantime, the democratic \nchanges in the continent and its States' awareness of the need for continental \nand regional cooperation gives us confidence that Africa has the capability to \nrise to the challenge. I therefore urge the international community to \nshoulder its responsibilities towards implementing the Second Industrial \nDevelopment Decade for Africa in the 1990s in order to accelerate the \ntransition to democracy and the economic and social development in the \ncountries of the continent. \nAt the same time, progress in the process of eliminating apartheid is a \npositive aspect amidst such drawbacks. It should not be hampered by the \nattempts of racial extremists. The people of South Africa are on their way to \nexercising their legitimate rights. Incidents of violence or apostasy must \nnot stop the positive evolution. Our responsibility is to support the process \nof dialogue and negotiations in order to restore the momentum needed for \nachieving a democratic non-racial society in South Africa. \nLast but not least, the situation in Somalia requires more than the mere \nhumanitarian assistance to which we all contribute. What we need is to \nintensify efforts to achieve national reconciliation. While we call on the \ninternational community to continue its efforts in the humanitarian field, we \ncall upon the Somali parties to rise to the responsibility of forging sound \nrelations between them and discarding the tribal rivalries and power struggles \nwhich show a lack of national awareness. \n\nBy the same token, we stand firmly against aggression and in defence of \nrespecting the sovereignty and independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and are \ncommitted to stopping attempts at interference in its internal affairs, as \nwell as the practices of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" committed against its people, \nwhich reflect an attitude of inherited racial bigotry, intellectual \nbackwardness and cultural regression. The demise of Yugoslavia, though \nregrettable in view of its past contributions to international life, makes it \nincumbent upon us to work for the respect of equal rights for all its peoples \nand all the States that have emanated from it, as all of them, not only one, \nare its successors in the world order. A view that has already been adopted \nby the General Assembly. \nThese are the issues that are of concern to us in Europe, Africa and Asia. \nWe are at the threshold of a world which looks forward to stability, but \nis in a transitional period in the course of which the map of tomorrow may be \nredrawn. Chaos may erupt and States, ethnic groupings, and terrorists may \nresort to force to an attempt to halt the march of history, civilization and \nprogress. But the collective will shall open the doors to the United Nations \nand, thereby, will allow us to opt for a better tomorrow of unhampered \neconomic development and social interdependence wherein we shall protect the \nenvironment, guided by the principles and obligations of the Rio de Janeiro \nsummit meeting; a better tomorrow of respect for human rights; a better \ntomorrow that all of us will participate in bringing about for the sake of the \nworld we aspire after in the twenty-first century. \n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, New Zealand congratulates \nyou on your election to lead the Assembly and offers you its support in your \ntask. \nOne year ago I stood on this rostrum and spoke about the Gulf crisis and \nthe way in which the United Nations, with strong leadership from the Security \nCouncil, had shown a firmness of judgement and a commitment to the ideals of \nthe founders of the United Nations that reinforced the status and authority of \nthe Organization. \nI spoke of my own country. New Zealand, a small nation in the south-west \nPacific, which supported the United Nations, in keeping with our tradition of \nopposing tyranny and supporting freedom. \nThis year I have returned to this Organization even more confident of the \nvital role of the United Nations in today's world, of the important \ncontribution each nation, be it large or small, can make to the achievement of \nits ideals. Most important, however, I want to affirm the commitment of New \nZealand, a founder member of the United Nations, to ensuring that this \nOrganization adapts to meet the challenge of a world that has changed, is \nchanging and will continue to change in the years ahead. To do that, the \n \nUnited Nations requires a vibrant, active General Assembly and a Security \nCouncil that truly reflects the different regions and the different peoples of \nthe world. \nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali,, has made his views clear in \nputting before this Assembly his report, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". His message \nis summed up in paragraphs 75 and 76, where he says: \n\\\"With the cold war ended we have drawn back from the brink of a \nconfrontation that threatened the world and, too often, paralysed our \nOrganization. \n\\\"Even as we celebrate our restored possibilities, there is a need to \nensure that the lessons of the past ... are learned and that the \nerrors ... are not repeated. For there may not be a third opportunity \nfor our planet ... .\\\" (A/47/277, paras. 75-76) \nNew Zealand endorses that conclusion. \nWe can also take hope from the fact that at last both the Security \nCouncil and the Assembly have the chance to work as they were originally \nintended, free from crippling ideological competition. Through the Security \nCouncil, and with the support of all the Members of the United Nations, we \nhave seen decisive action to implement collective security measures on a scale \nnever before possible. \nThere is much still to be done, but no longer need the people of the \nworld despair about impotence and inaction on the part of the United Nations. \nIn Cambodia, in Somalia, in the Balkans, in the Middle East, the United \nNations has moved to assist in the vital battle for human survival where \nbefore there was only the prospect of continued death and destruction. \n \nIn our view, the Agenda for Peace will succeed only if we support an \nagenda for action. This is no time for complacency. The heavy cloud of the \ncold war has lifted. But over the years that cloud concealed many smaller \nconflicts and tensions regional, national and ethnic. Freed from being \nbottled up by the cold war, a growing and frightening tendency is exposed to \nsettle ancient differences by the use of force. \nThe Agenda for Peace also reminds us that there are other critical issues \nwhich threaten not only the security of Member States but also the future of \nthe planet itself. \nPoverty, disease, malnutrition, crippling levels of debt and negligible \neconomic growth are scourges in themselves. They can unleash despair and \nanger that will destabilize political and social institutions. \nEnvironmental degradation does not threaten only our immediate \nsurroundings and livelihoods; problems such as the depletion of the ozone \nlayer, the spread of toxic chemicals, climate change and the overfishing of \nthe seas put at risk the well-being of whole communities, and even the very \nsurvival of certain small island countries. \nWeapons of mass destruction continue to proliferate. We must take a \nstand against those who are blind to the lessons of the past and remain \ndetermined to acquire or expand their stocks of nuclear or other weapons of \nmass destruction. \nThe Secretary-General reminds us, too, that \n\\\"social peace is as important as strategic or political peace\\\". \n \nIt is clear that a root cause of insecurity and conflict at the international \nlevel is the existence of social structures, policies and systems within \nStates which marginalize minorities or other groups. Such tension will be \nresolved only when the social needs of the underprivileged are addressed. The \nproposed United Nations social Summit could have a catalytic role to play in \nthis area. I suggest that it is only through tolerance and through talking to \none another that we can all encourage and achieve full respect for human \nrights and implement the international standards as they were intended. \n \nThe other very important issues raised by the Secretary-General must be \nconsidered thoroughly. This session of the Assembly provides the first \nopportunity to debate them and I wish to outline New Zealand's views. \nFirst, let me refer to peace and security. New Zealand stands very \nfirmly behind the United Nations as an instrument for collective action when \nsecurity is threatened. The situations which the world wants the United \nNations to respond to today are not the same as those of the cold-war era. \nNew Zealand supports concepts such as preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and \npeace-building. As a world body we know that consensus is important but \ncollectively we must be bold, we must be innovative. \nNew Zealand believes it is vital that the United Nations respond to \nsituations which threaten the peace or cry out for global action, wherever in \nthe world they may occur. We cannot, we must not, allow parts of the world to \nbe marginalized or thought less important than others. The tragedy in Somalia \nis different from, but of equal horror to, that in what was Yugoslavia. \nSecondly, I want to endorse strongly the conclusion that there is an \ninextricable link between security and economic development. This is not a \nnew or radical idea. Every political leader knows from domestic experience \nthat a nation feels more secure when its economy is performing strongly. \nPeople in every country have rapidly growing expectations, but with the global \neconomy very sluggish leaders are finding it difficult to satisfy these \nambitions. \nFurther, we need major sustainable growth in the global economy if the \ndevelopment concerns identified at the Earth summit at Rio are to be achieved. \nOne fact, though self-evident, must be repeated: sustainable and \nequitable economic growth and development will be possible only if there is an \nopen and fair international trading system. \n\nAs a world community we need the courage to pull down the artificial \nbarriers to economic growth. The solution is in our hands. We need leaders \nto say \\\"Yes\\\" to fair trade and \\\"No\\\" to their protectionist lobbies. If we \nknock out the selfish and inward-looking tendencies to protectionism and \nsubsidization, we will create a surge in global trade and real growth in the \nglobal economy. It will provide the opportunities we all want - so let's do \nit. \nThe alternative is bleak. History shows only too clearly what can happen \nif there is a deep and prolonged global recession. Political extremists come \nto the fore and begin to manipulate desperate people. Disintegrating \neconomies fall into the hands of dictators, and international peace and \nsecurity are quickly put at risk. \nBut this need not be so. It is not inevitable. A breakthrough in the \nmultilateral trade negotiations, the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade (GATT), is achievable, given the right degree of political \nwill. There is a risk that the political will may ebb away, that the focus \nmay be lost, that excuses for delay may become more important than reasons to \npress on. Should that prove true, then the bold reform set out in the Dunkel \ntext will go down as one more lost opportunity. We cannot afford that so we \nNew Zealand - continue to urge the European Community and the United States to \nresolve their differences and to put the GATT talks back on track for a \nsuccessful conclusion. For world economic growth, it is not an optional \nextra; it is essential. \nJust as economics and security are closely linked, the world seems to \nhave accepted, just in time, that there is a third element to this equation. \nIt is the environment. Everything we do has an impact on the environment. If \n\nwe cripple the environment, it will affect our economies, our societies and \nour security. Moreover, these impacts will not respect national boundaries. \nBefore the Earth summit, some important first steps were taken. The \nMontreal Protocol proved that the world had the political will to deal with \nthe problem of ozone depletion. The General Assembly itself responded to the \nchallenge of drift-net fishing and has secured a moratorium on that \necologically-destructive technique of fishing. \nThe Earth summit, under the auspices of the United Nations, has given us \na challenging work programme, \\\"Agenda 21\\\", to match the Secretary-General's \nproposals, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". But international agendas only work if \nnations are committed to their success. \nNew Zealand went to the Earth summit committed to working for consensus \nsolutions to the problems of environment and development which ultimately \nthreaten us all. \nNew Zealand is a country endowed with a rich environmental inheritance. \nBut we understand that our good fortune does not give us the moral right to \npoint the finger at other countries which are struggling for their very \nsurvival. At the same time, our considerable experience in sustainable \nresource management - for example, in the development of new forests can be \nhelpful in the search for practical solutions to problems of resource \ndepletion. \nAs part of New Zealand's commitment to environmental protection and to \nproviding sustainable resources, we have just agreed to go ahead with the \nplanting of another 200,000 hectares of forest. \nAt the Earth summit, we accepted a commitment to augment our aid \nprogramme as soon as possible in order to assist in the prompt and effective \n \nimplementation of Agenda 21. Our development assistance projects, based on \nconsultation with our partner countries, particularly in the South Pacific, \nhave always had a strong focus on the environment and on sustainable \ndevelopment. \nBut aid alone is not enough. New Zealand, like many countries which \ndepend on agricultural exports, has been severely disadvantaged by a world \ntrading system which handicaps non-subsidized and efficient producers. We \ntherefore strongly support the call in Agenda 21 for an open, transparent and \nnon-discriminatory trading system that reveals the real environmental costs of \nunsustainable production and enables all countries to pursue truly sustainable \ndevelopment on a secure and equitable basis. \nTo achieve that would be to achieve a real foundation for peace and \nprogress. I am not making these observations from an ivory tower. For its \npart. New Zealand already has one of the most open economies in the world. \nYes, there was a short-term cost in achieving that, but now we are reaping \nrewards through higher productivity and international competitiveness. \nDespite the progress made from the ending of the cold war, we have not \nyet removed the threat from weapons of mass destruction. \nNew Zealand warmly welcomed the agreement reached by President Bush and \nPresident Yeltsin in June. The two largest nuclear arsenals are to be reduced \nby some 70 per cent. That is remarkable progress and both leaders deserve and \nhave our thanks. They have made historic progress but we must keep the \nmomentum up. Unless we take decisive action, the dangers from nuclear \nproliferation will increase. \n\nTherefore we must build on the leadership shown by two nuclear-weapon \nStates in declaring moratoriums. We must advance the goal, which New Zealand \nhas unwaveringly pursued, of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We must \nstrengthen the International Atomic Energy Agency's safeguards regime. And we \nmust secure an indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons in 1995. \n\nFrance's decision to suspend testing has been widely welcomed by New \nZealand and Pacific island countries in the South Pacific Forum region. It \nhas opened the way for significantly more positive relations between France \nand the region, which I welcome. We hope the moratorium will be maintained, \nand copied by others. \nAnother milestone approaches, with the presentation to this session of \nthe General Assembly of a treaty banning another class of weapons of mass \ndestruction: chemical weapons. Patient and persistent efforts over 20 years \nwill have their reward. New Zealand has strongly supported those efforts and \nintends to be an original signatory to the treaty. We urge other countries to \ntake the same step. \nAnd we must not ignore the continued proliferation of conventional \narmaments. There are legitimate concerns about the levels and availability of \nhighly destructive conventional weapons. The implementation of the United \nNations Register of Conventional Arms would be a useful first step on the way \nto greater accountability in this area. \nFinally, I want to touch on the institutional issues the \nSecretary-General has raised. We strongly endorse the role that is envisaged \nfor the United Nations to work with, and on occasions through, regional \norganizations that have some special contribution they can make. Already in \nSouth Africa we see cooperation between the United Nations and the \nCommonwealth beginning to bear positive fruit. In Somalia the Organization of \nAfrican Unity (OAU), the League of Arab States and the Organization of the \nIslamic Conference have contributed positively to the United Nations mission. \nIn the Americas the Organization of American States (OAS) has played an \nincreasingly effective role. \n\nThe United Nations role in Cambodia is of particular importance in this \nregard. The operation is unique and deserves the highest praise. But the \ncountries of the region - which include New Zealand, with 100 men and women in \nthe United Nations force have also played a major part in bringing about the \nconditions necessary for a successful United Nations involvement. Regional \norganizations such as the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have \nbeen indispensable in this process. \nThe fact of the matter is that the United Nations cannot do everything. \nNeither do I expect it to do everything - but free from the shackles of the \npast it now has a new authority which it must exercise wisely. To maintain \nits authority we must ensure that democratic principles are applied to the \nworkings of the United Nations itself. That means that the small must be \nrepresented in major United Nations decision-making as well as the large. \nIt means that there must be fair and regular rotation among Member \nStates. And it means we must evolve processes that will allow constructive \ncommunication between the Security Council and the wider United Nations \nmembership so that broad coalitions in support of Security Council action can \nbe forged while preserving room for quick and decisive actions where necessary. \nNew Zealand's commitment to a strong, effective and democratic United \nNations has never wavered. At the beginning, at the San Francisco Conference \nin 1945, New Zealand championed the broadest possible participation in \ndecision-making. Over the years we have backed up our words with a real \ncommitment to United Nations peace-keeping efforts. We have participated thus \nfar in 15 such operations: New Zealanders have worn the blue beret in Croatia \nand Bosnia, Lebanon, Cyprus, India, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Namibia, Angola, \nCambodia, the Congo and Yemen. In addition. New Zealand supplied personnel to \nassist the United Nations with mine removal in Afghanistan. \n\nIn conclusion, I want to return to the two agendas which are before this \nAssembly and which seek to achieve a new partnership of nations. Nothing is \nmore important than the Agenda for Peace and the Agenda for the Environment \nand Sustainable Development. The United Nations Secretary-General and the \nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development have both identified \nmonumental challenges for the General Assembly for several years to come. \nThey also highlight the reality of global interdependence. The way ahead has \nto lie in cooperation rather than confrontation, in a recognition that the \nfuture of each of us is tied up with the future of us all and that no agenda, \nno matter how noble its goals, will succeed unless first and foremost we are \nprepared to work for them. New Zealand is. \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government and \npeople of Papua New Guinea, I should like to congratulate you. Sir, on your \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh \nsession. Your personal presence in this Hall, and your unanimous election to \npreside over our proceedings, are symbolic not only of the stirring changes \nwhich have been occurring in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, but \nof the manner in which they have been welcomed around the world. In offering \nyou my delegation's greetings, cooperation and support, I should also like to \npay tribute to the efficient manner in which your predecessor. \nAmbassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, performed his duties. \nJust as your election. Sir, is symbolic of wider changes in the world, so \nis the presence here for the first time of delegations from States which for a \nperiod were incorporated in the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. My \ndelegation takes very great pleasure in welcoming the membership of, and \nparticipation in the United Nations by, the nine States which were once part \nof the Soviet Union and the three States which were once part of Yugoslavia \nwhose representatives have just joined us. Their presence provides eloquent \ntestimony to the power of ordinary people to resist - and eventually to \novercome - both the ideology and the technology that are used in order to \noppress them. \nWith the addition of San Marino, the goal of universal membership - and \nof global coverage - of the United Nations is now in sight. \nComing from a region where membership of the United Nations is less \nwidespread than it is in other parts of the world, I pledge my Government's \ncooperation in the efforts to strengthen links between other South Pacific \nisland States and the United Nations. \n\nPrevious statements in this debate have made it quite clear that we have, \nin the words of the Secretary-General in \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", \n\\\"entered a time of global transition.\\\" (A/47/277, para. 11) \nThe Jakarta Message issued by the Tenth Summit Conference of Heads of \nState or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement, of which my Government has \njust become a full member, describes the present as \\\"a time of profound change \nand rapid transition.\\\" But transition to what? And will the effects be the \nsame around the globe? \nEven as we welcome the end of the cold war, we would do well to bear in \nmind the observation made in \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", that \n\\\"the issues between States north and south grow more acute.\\\" (A/47/277. \npara. 8) \nIt is, again in the words of the Jakarta Message: \n\\\"a time of great promise as well as grave challenge, a time of \nopportunity amidst pervasive uncertainty.\\\" \nIt is no accident that the preamble to the Charter contains not only \npolitical, but economic and social objectives, or that the Charter provides \nfor both a Security Council and an Economic and Social Council. Security has \nnever been simply a military or a political question; it has always had \neconomic and social aspects. For people in developing countries in particular \nthe economic and social aspects of security are inseparable from and often \nof great immediate importance than the military and political aspects. \nIf the transition on which so many previous speakers believe we have \nembarked is to be towards global peace, then we need to pay greater attention \nto the economic and social issues which divide North and South. Thus my \nGovernment supports the proposal to convene, looks forward to taking part in. \n\nand hopes for a positive outcome from, the world summit for social development \nproposed to be held in 1995. \nDisappointed though my Government is in the level of agreement reached at \nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in \nRio de Janeiro in June this year, we shall continue to support the UNCED \neffort in particular and similar efforts by the United Nations generally. We \nhave therefore offered to host a regional post-Rio seminar to follow up on \nUNCED in Port Moresby in November. \nMy Government welcomes the changes which have allowed people in Central \nand Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia to participate directly in \nnational political and economic life again. We welcome them and their \nGovernments to greater participation in international political and economic \naffairs, too. \nWe welcome no less the changes which have led to the replacement of \ndictatorships in Africa, Latin America and elsewhere. But in doing so I would \nnot be honest unless I added that we are concerned about ensuring that the \nchange is both comprehensive and enduring. \nMy Government is profoundly disturbed by the savage violence and terrible \nsuffering being experienced by the victims of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" in the former \nYugoslavia and of interracial, religious and ethnic conflicts there and \nelsewhere. \nWe sympathize with the concerns expressed by the members of the \nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, and support the efforts being made by \nthe United Nations and the European Economic Community to reduce these \nconflicts and to provide aid. \n\nBut, as the Secretary-General has so pointedly reminded the world, there \nare terrible conflicts and suffering no less worthy of attention in other \nparts of the world, including Somalia. \nIt seems distressingly significant that evert after the end of the cold \nwar, and during the global transition which the Secretary-General has so \neloquently analysed, part of the world where most humans live and where needs \nare greatest is still referred to and treated as a very poor third. \nI ask you. Sir, to cast your mind back to the 1960s, when foreign \ndomination came to an end in many parts of the world, a record number of new \nMembers was admitted to the United Nations and the prospects for democracy and \ndevelopment seemed, by common consent, to be quite bright. Then think of the \neconomic difficulties which often followed, and the dictatorships which all \ntoo frequently lasted until the present transition. And then ask why, \nwhatever our hopes might be, we should expect that the future will be \ndifferent. \n \nThe world has learned or, at least, should have learned - from the \npast. But have we all drawn the right conclusions? And what have we done to \nact on even the most obvious of our conclusions? \nIt is one thing to welcome the holding of free elections. It is quite \nanother to be certain either that they make a difference, or that they will \ncontinue to be held in an orderly, constitutional and fair way. \nPoliticians characteristically promise results. Their ability to be \nre-elected depends on results. So, too, does democracy itself. In other \nwords, democracy, like security, is more than a matter of politics; it also \nhas economic and social roots. \nIn developing countries or, more precisely, countries where development \nis a far-distant aim rather than a near-reality democracy depends not only \non opportunities for political participation, but on opportunities for \neconomic and social participation as well. As one who has played a modest \npart in constitution-making in Papua New Guinea, I am proud that the National \nGoals and Directive Principles contained in our national Constitution \nexplicitly recognize that point. \nI can recall a time, before Papua New Guinea became independent, when not \nonly free elections but free markets were widely regarded as characteristic \nor, at least, attainable - goals of many developing countries. I can also \nrecall the pain and anger felt by ordinary village people when they discovered \nthat free elections and free markets did not necessarily benefit them. \nI am, in fact, spokesman for a movement which mobilized tens of thousands \nof people to ensure that political and economic development would serve their \ninterests, and which paved the way to Papua New Guinea's independence. It is \n\nprecisely because of the lessons I learned from, and with, my people that I \nhave chosen to make opportunity and participation the main theme of the policy \nI shall follow as my Government's Minister for Foreign Affairs. Those lessons \nare also among the reasons why my Government will be seeking support for an \ninitiative designed to help identify, create, maintain, diversify and enlarge \nopportunities for economic participation, with particular reference to \ndeveloping countries. \n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" is a most constructive contribution to thinking \nabout conflict-avoidance, conflict-management and conflict-reduction after the \nend of the cold war. The initiative on self-determination being pursued by the \nGovernment of Liechtenstein should provide support for, and assist in, the \ndevelopment of ideas contained in the report. Ongoing discussions concerning \noptions for reform of the United Nations, including the High-Level Working \nGroup set up by the Non-Aligned Movement, as well as many statements made in \nthe current debate, are clearly intended to contribute to the same end. It is \nsurely among the most promising signs of the times that we can talk of a \nglobal agenda at all - and that the global agenda should be for peace. \nThe initiative which my Government proposes is intended to be, in effect, \nthe economic counterpart to \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". Our aim is not to engage \nagain in a general debate on development issues - although we have an obvious \ninterest in continuing discussion of the nature, direction, pace and \ninternational environment for developmental change but to stimulate the \nexchange of practical ideas and experiences relevant to enhancing and \nincreasing opportunities for economic participation for the benefit of people \nin developing countries. \n\nIn short, the proposal is to seek support for the appointment of a panel \nof distinguished, expert and experienced persons to prepare a practical report \nbased on experience in diverse countries and on a close, critical analysis of \npossible options for presentation to the United Nations. \nMy Government's plan is to seek the support of fellow members of the \nSouth Pacific Forum and other regional groups to which we belong or with \nwhich, like the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), we have close \nand cordial relations, to raise the proposal for consideration by members of \nthe Group of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement, and to discuss it on a bilateral \nbasis as widely as we can with a view to submitting a resolution to the \nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. We would hope to see a panel appointed \nin time to present a report during the forty-ninth session of the General \nAssembly, and to have it debated in 1995. \nLike many other countries represented in this Assembly, Papua New Guinea \ninherited many of its economic, legal and other arrangements from abroad. Many \nof the practices, policies and laws followed in the monetary sector of our \nnational economy were originally devised in different conditions, by different \npeople and to serve different objectives. \nWe believe that we have not exhausted - or even considered all \npractical policy or legal options for facilitating economic participation by \nour citizens in either national or international affairs. We have not had \nready and systematic access to experiences elsewhere. \nWe do not believe that market forces on their own will necessarily allow \nour people adequate opportunities to participate in and benefit from economic \ndevelopment without further change. \n \nFurther options need to be identified and further changes will have to be \nmade if people seeking to participate in economic development from the \nbaseline at which most people in developing countries start are to be able to \nidentify, utilize and benefit from the opportunities which are more often in \ntheory than in practice available to them. We want to learn what the \noptions are. \nMy Government will, therefore, be looking to other Members of the United \nNations for support and ideas to advance our proposal. The result will, we \nhope, be an important, practical guide to options for creating, maintaining, \ndiversifying and/or enlarging opportunities for economic participation, with \nparticular reference to developing countries. \nMy Government has recently found itself being criticized, for the first \ntime, before the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva and the \nJoint Assembly of the African, Caribbean and Pacific signatories of the Lome \nConvention and the European Economic Community over human rights abuses in the \nNorth Solomons Province of Papua New Guinea. \nIt gives me no pleasure to say, even though it is true, that most of the \nabuses, for which parties on all sides of the conflict must accept some \nresponsibility, occurred while a previous Government was in office, and that \nmy colleagues and I opposed them at the time. As members of the present \nGovernment, we are now responsible for resolving the situation, whatever its \ncauses. We must accept responsibility for what we decide or condone from now \non. But the situation which gave rise to the criticism to which I have \n\nreferred owes much to economic practices, policies and laws which were devised \nwith little or no regard for popular participation, and with even less regard \nfor the particular characteristics of the societies in which most of the \npeople in the area continue to live. \n\nIt also highlights the need to recognize that processes which might help \nalleviate tensions and reduce conflicts in some parts of the world might not \nhave the same effects in others. They might, in fact, only make matters worse. \nFor Papua New Guinea, as for many other developing countries which have \nbecome independent since the Second World War, nation-building remains a \ndifficult problem and a pressing concern. The issue for us is not, as it is \nelsewhere, to find ways of managing ethnic and other tensions now that the \nideological and technological weight of the cold war has been lifted from \npreviously subject peoples, but rather to reconcile differences within and \nharness them to a common, national cause. \nFurthermore, my Government has taken the view that dealing with human \nrights on their own is often not to the point. It can, in fact, be irrelevant \nand can even actively contribute to further suffering. \nMy Government has, therefore, admitted that wrongs have been committed by \nparticipants on all sides of the conflict in Papua New Guinea's North Solomons \nProvince. It has taken steps to ensure that they cease and are not repeated \nand has invited other Governments and international organizations to help \nredress them by contributing, for example, to the costs of assessing needs, \nplanning rehabilitation and restoring services to people who have suffered \nwithout them. \nMy Government believes that Papua New Guineans are best placed to resolve \nthe conflict; but we look to others for help in rehabilitating people, \nrepairing damage and restoring services. \nMy Government intends to be among the concerned participants in the \nsecond world conference on human rights, scheduled for June 1993. As was done \nat the tenth Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement, we reaffirm the \nuniversality of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms, which are \n\nembodied in the Papua New Guinea Constitution. But, like other members of the \nNon-Aligned Movement, we believe that economic and social progress facilitates \nthe achievement of such rights and freedoms, which is why I have emphasized \neconomic opportunity and participation. For similar reasons we welcome the \nbroad scope proposed for the world conference on women in 1995, which focuses \non action in the context of equality, development and peace. \nAs an active participant in the work of the Fourth Committee of the \nGeneral Assembly and the Committee of 24, my Government is a strong supporter \nof the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism (1990-2000). \nWe therefore look forward to hosting a Pacific regional seminar on \ndecolonization in Port Moresby in 1993 in order to help further the plan of \naction for the Decade. \nIn our immediate region, we continue to support United Nations \ninvolvement in the decolonization of New Caledonia and trust that the outcome \nof the forthcoming mid-term review of the implementation of the Matignon \nAccords will lead to further progress towards safeguarding the legitimate \nrights of the Kanaks. \nAs far as other developments in the South Pacific are concerned, we \nwelcome the French Government's decision to suspend its nuclear-weapon-testing \nprogramme in French Polynesia. We urge that it be ended for good. \nWe look to the Government of the United States of America to honour \nPresident Bush's promise to limit the use of Johnston Atoll for disposing of \nweapons which were never directed at us while they were active but which now \nthreaten our safety, health and economic welfare. \nWe seek assurances that the Pacific Ocean will not be used to transport \nplutonium or other hazardous nuclear, chemical or biological materials which \n \nmight pollute the seas on which we rely. Promises that every precaution will \nbe taken are simply not enough. \nLike the Governments of other South Pacific island countries, we are \nsympathetic to the aspirations of those who favour increased regional economic \ncooperation in Europe and North America. We support efforts to assist former \ncommunist States in the immense task of economic and social reconstruction \nwhich lies ahead. But, like the Governments of other developing countries, we \nin the South Pacific are concerned that regional integration and efforts to \nmeet needs in other parts of the world should not proceed at the expense of \nthe needs of our people. \nWe are also concerned that the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade (GATT) be brought to an early conclusion, with due regard \nfor the need to secure and expand opportunities for the economic participation \nof developing countries in the international economy. It is, in fact, \nprecisely because we believe that opportunities for economic participation \nshould be greater and more equitably distributed than they have been that my \nGovernment has proposed the initiative I have previously outlined. \nMy Government supports the active role being taken by the United Nations, \nin difficult circumstances, to ensure peace and to bring about a return to \nnormalcy in Cambodia. We also support efforts to secure peace in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and to facilitate relief efforts in Somalia. We are heartened by \nwhat we have heard from the Governments of Israel and neighbouring States \nconcerning the prospects for a negotiated settlement of outstanding sources of \nconflict in the Middle East. \nWe are cautiously hopeful about the prospects for a democratic, \nnon-racial South Africa. But, as the situation now stands, my Government \n\nbelieves that it should maintain existing bans on all dealings with South \nAfrica, continue to monitor developments there closely and consider relaxing \nthose bans only as further progress occurs in the desired direction and in \nclose consultation with African States. \nLike our predecessors, my Government supports efforts to limit the \nproduction and sale of arms. We believe that unwanted foreign military forces \nshould be removed from countries which do not pose a threat to their \nneighbours or to international law. \nHowever, coming as I do from a developing country, I feel it important to \nrepeat that we need to acknowledge the reality, recognized also in the report \n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", that there are non-military threats to peace which are \nperhaps becoming more obvious than ever before. My Government agrees with the \nobservation made in the report that there is a need to strengthen arrangements \nto identify, monitor, synthesize information about and act collectively to \navert, reduce and limit such threats, with sensitivity to local circumstances, \nincluding the interests of well-intentioned States, and with full regard for \ninternational law. \nI cannot help noticing not only how the membership and the agenda of the \nGeneral Assembly have changed in recent years but also how the content, tone \nand frankness with regard to domestic difficulties, and even the length of \ncontributions to the general debate, have changed, and generally for the \nbetter. \n \nAs head of my country's delegation, I have had the privilege of listening \nto delegations from newly admitted Member States make use of the opportunity \nto participate in the General Assembly on their own account for the first \ntime. I trust that other Governments will see fit to support my proposal for \na United Nations-sponsored initiative to prepare and discuss a detailed report \non how best to go about the task complementary to securing increased \nopportunities for political participation of securing increased \nopportunities for economic participation, with particular reference to needs \nin and of developing countries. Opportunity and participation are the keys to \npolitical development, security and peace. They are also the keys to economic \ndevelopment and justice, including equity between, and within, the northern \nand southern parts of the globe. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow \nme to congratulate you. Sir, on your election to preside over this session of \nthe General Assembly. \nI am also pleased to welcome the new countries that have joined the \nUnited Nations and to pledge to them the friendship and cooperation of \nNicaragua. \nNearly 50 years since the San Francisco Charter was signed there exists a \nnew world order similar in importance to, but very different from, that which \ngave birth to the United Nations Charter. The walls of intolerance are \ncrumbling and the pillars of apartheid are beginning to give way. New \ndemocracies have arisen on the ruins of dictatorships. The era of \nconfrontation between the super-Powers has come to an end, and most of the \nnations of the world are now working for peace. We are building a new world \norder in which equity, solidarity and the rule of international law must be \npromoted. \nThis transition towards a new world order, although positive, is not \nwithout danger. Major contradictions have arisen. The expectation that the \n\nimprovement of relations between East and West would yield a \\\"peace dividend\\\" \nhas not yet been realized. \nThere is an urgent need to forge a consensus on a world-wide commitment \nto strengthen international cooperation and reactivate economic growth and \ndevelopment. The efforts of the overwhelming majority of the Members of the \nOrganization to promote growth and development continue to be hindered by \nrestricted access to new markets, scarce financial resources, lack of foreign \ninvestment, the debt burden, limitations on the transfer of technology and the \nongoing inequality in the financial systems and international trade. \nThe coffee situation, brought about by an abrupt decline in prices, \ndeserves renewed efforts in the negotiations for a new Agreement in the \nInternational Coffee Organization. As regards bananas, we would like to see a \nfree market, without protectionist barriers, that takes duly into account the \neconomic and commercial realities of the Latin American countries. \nAn alarming number of people are still suffering the tragic consequences \nof armed conflict, and poverty continues to stifle hopes for a better future. \nMillions of children do not have access to health care or education. Millions \nof women, who constitute the majority of the world's population, remain \noppressed. Our Organization can become a more important mechanism for \npromoting economic and social development by implementing the primary \nstrategies that have been worked out and agreed upon by its members. \nThe restructuring of the United Nations in the economic and social fields \nis of particular importance to Nicaragua. We want the purposes that have been \nset forth to become realities. We support the actions of the \nSecretary-General to bring about improved coordination of the various \ncomponents of the system by establishing a presence in countries based on an \nintegrated and unified approach. We also support the reforms within the \n\nSecretariat itself and the functioning of the new Department of Economic and \nSocial Development. Nicaragua also supports the strengthening of the Economic \nand Social Council. \nThe yearning of peoples for freedom, justice and respect for the dignity \nand worth of the individual is stronger than evil or tyranny. Nothing can \nprevent peoples from freeing themselves from political oppression or the \nculture of violence. \nTwo years ago I referred here to the main challenges that my Government \nhad set for itself in bringing peace to my country, building democracy and \nfighting inflation. Today I can say that we have succeeded. \nIn the elections of 25 February 1990 Nicaraguans established a patriotic \nalliance based on peace, reconciliation, freedom, progress and justice. As an \nimportant initial step in the building of a democratic and free society, we \nbrought peace to the country after many years of civil war. Once the 24,000 \nmen of the Nicaraguan resistance had been disarmed we began the general plan \nfor reducing the size of the army. When I came to the General Assembly in \n1990 I said that we had reduced the army from 96,000 men to 34,000. Today our \narmy is made up of only 17,000 men. \n \nI feel that the dream of a Central America where the sound of hands at \nwork for ever takes the place of the sound of gunfire is coming closer. We \nhave established disarmament brigades throughout the country and are promoting \nthe national plan to collect, in stages, weapons in civilian hands. This \neffort has produced highly satisfactory results, and the people of Nicaragua \nthemselves have witnessed the destruction and burial of nearly 50,000 weapons \nof war, which has reduced the probability of armed conflicts and \nconfrontations. \nIn 1991, thanks to the effort made by our people, we laid the foundations \nfor economic recovery in Nicaragua by putting an end to hyperinflation, which \nhad reached nearly 55,000 per cent; today, the inflation rate is down to zero. \nWe have begun the transition from totalitarianism to civilian democracy, \nfrom a centralized economy to a social, market economy. We have guaranteed \nfreedom of expression, there are many more communications media, and there is \ncomplete freedom of thought and religion. \nWe have also strengthened the freedom of association. There is clear \nseparation of the powers of the State, and we have the first legislative \nassembly in Nicaragua's history; 16 political parties are represented in the \nassembly following the first free elections since our independence 171 years \nago. \nI should also like to emphasize the fact that, as a result of our \nstriving to come closer together, we have been able to develop, with great \nsuccess, the economic stabilization and adjustment programme. The budget has \nbeen balanced, military expenditure have been drastically cut, wages have been \nstabilized, privatization is moving forward with the support and participation \nof the workers, and new banks and private financial institutions have begun to \noperate in my country. \n \nThanks to the progress made in our economic programme, and with support \nfrom the provisions made by this Assembly in 1990 and 1992, it has been \npossible to ensure special treatment from the international community. We \nhave had 75 per cent of our debt to the Paris Club forgiven, and new \ninternational credits are being made available to Nicaragua. \nNow we must take the next step: to reactivate the economy of the country \nand promote development within the framework of increasingly strengthening \npublic order and the State of Law, which, together with attention to social \nproblems, is at the focus of our immediate aims. \nWe have come to this forum to speak of the urgent need for special and \ntotal cooperation from the United Nations system in the social and economic \nreconstruction of Nicaragua. Once peace and economic stability reign we must \ntackle the aftermath of the war and the root causes of that war, the problems \nof unemployment and also the reincorporation of displaced and repatriated \npersons into the social and economic life of the country. We ask for the \ninternational community's support for this United Nations programme, \nparticularly because our situation has been made worse this year by terrible \nnatural disasters such as the eruption of the Cerro Negro volcano and the \nrecent tsunami. \nThe chances for reinforcing stability and promoting reconciliation and \neconomic grown in our country are better than they were when I began my term \nin office. For the first time, we are the major players in championing our \nown freedom and- bringing about our own changes through dedicating ourselves to \nthe task of national reconstruction, the common cause of the Nicaraguan \nnation. The present democratic process in Nicaragua is in keeping with the \nlegitimate interests and the deeply-held convictions of our people, and is in \ntune with the spirit of the changes taking place throughout the world. \n\nThe major achievements of the last two years have been made possible, \nfirst, by the determined efforts of the Nicaraguan people, who have summoned \nthe determination to tackle the vicissitudes of history, and secondly, by the \nsupport and solidarity of the international community, whose friendly \ncooperation has supported the Nicaraguan people's own efforts. I wish to \navail myself of this world forum to offer profound thanks to the peoples and \ngovernments which have helped us, and to the international financial bodies, \nincluding the Interamerican Development Bank, the World Bank and the \nInternational Monetary Fund. I offer them all the sincere gratitude of the \npeople and Government of Nicaragua. \nInternational cooperation is indispensable if Nicaragua is to consolidate \nand build on the progress that has been made. If assistance to Nicaragua is \nsuspended, or, even worse, if the undertakings made by the international \ncommunity at the meetings of the consultative group organized by the World \nBank are not fulfilled, the land we have been cultivating with so many \nsacrifices will go back to being barren, fertile ground only for intolerance, \nconfrontation and totalitarianism. We must not allow that to happen. \nTwo years ago, in this very forum, I said that my dream was for a \ndemilitarized Central America. We have therefore worked tirelessly to promote \nregional negotiations with a view to reducing weapons and troop numbers in \nCentral America to the lowest possible level. \nI also talked about my dream of a unified Central America. Today, our \ncountries are speaking with one voice and are negotiating free trade \nagreements with other regional blocs. Our process of integration has taken on \nstrength and vigour in all areas. The ideal of a strong and united Central \nAmerica is coming ever closer. With every passing day, I see that reality and \n\nour dreams can come closer together when there is the will and the \ndetermination. I firmly believe that Central America has taken the historic \nand irrevocable decision to move forward, as a region, along the path of \npeace, freedom, democracy and development. \nWe in Nicaragua are concerned at how fragile democracy is in the \ndeveloping countries. Very many of them have chosen the path of democracy; \nsome, like Nicaragua, have made significant progress in the midst of a \ndifficult transition. All of them, though, could benefit even more from \nresolute international support in favour of democracy. We have the impression \nthat the international community has not yet fully realized what is at stake \nin some of these countries. Freedom is still extremely fragile there, and \neconomic and social democracy is a distant dream. The case of Haiti is a \nreflection of the concerns and sufferings of Latin America. \nGenerally speaking, the new democracies lack democratic institutions and \ntraditions; the economic elements that promote change are scarce; violence has \nnot yet fully died out and intolerance and hatred still reign. In the nascent \ndemocracies, the new political systems must be bolstered in the midst of high \nlevels of extreme poverty, the legacy of the foreign debt burden, the impact \nof stringent economic adjustments, the benefits of which will be felt only \nover the long term. These are serious constraints on efforts to get the \neconomy off the ground and to promote growth, and extra efforts must be made \non top of what is normal for developing countries. \n \nWith suitable international cooperation that complements internal efforts \nand respects the sovereignty of our nations, and with the establishment of \nmodern, flexible democratic systems, we will attain the noble objectives we \nhave set for ourselves. \nWith the end of the war and the emergence of peace, we have begun to lay \nthe foundations of a sovereign, non-aligned, independent foreign policy of \ninternational reconciliation, which will make it possible for us to establish \ndiplomatic relations with all the nations of the world. Its basic tenets \noffer an excellent opportunity to develop further our own democratic process \nand support that of fraternal countries. \nIt is our hope that meaningful commitments can be achieved among the \nmembers of the international community during the World Conference on Human \nRights in 1993, the Conference on Population and Development in 1994 and at \nthe World Summit for Social Development, which will be held in 1995. \nThe end of the cold war has given the United Nations the best opportunity \nin its history to play to the full its important role in the international \nsystem of collective security. \nPeace-keeping operations in their various forms and the participation of \nthe Organization in the resolution of conflicts should be strengthened. \nWith the onset of peace in El Salvador this year and the strengthening of \nour own process in Nicaragua, Central America has ceased to be a zone of armed \nconflict affecting international security. We welcome the great efforts \ntowards understanding being made in Guatemala and we call on the international \ncommunity to continue providing its valuable cooperation in the commitments we \nCentral Americans have undertaken with our own peoples. \nIn the Middle East it is urgent that a solution to the Arab-Israeli \nconflict and the situation of the Palestinian people be found. It is our hope \n\nthat the talks will continue and that concrete results will be achieved that \nwill contribute to better dialogue and a definitive peace agreement. \nWe condemn the serious situations existing in Somalia, Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and Iraq. \nIn the case of Iraq, we advocate full compliance with the Organization's \ndecisions, with regard to their humanitarian aspects and with the human rights \nof the civilian population. \nIn connection with the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the cessation of \nhostilities, the provision of humanitarian assistance and free access to the \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross and other organizations providing \nmedical and humanitarian assistance are universal demands that should be met \nimmediately. \nConditions in Somalia call for stronger action on the part of the \nOrganization. The world's conscience cannot tolerate situations like those we \nare witnessing there. \nNicaragua has offered to take part in any humanitarian-assistance or \npeace-keeping operation in Somalia, and we are also willing to be a part of \nany other effort to relieve the tragedy of that beloved people. \nWe are following with interest the situation in South Africa. We hope \nthat soon its sons and daughters, united, will devote themselves to the task \nof national reconstruction in democracy and freedom. \nI should also like to mention the situation of a nation of 21 million \ninhabitants which today has one of the most vigorous economies in the \ninternational system. It is time we acknowledged the important efforts made \nby that nation in the economic, political and social fields. I speak of the \nRepublic of China in Taiwan. \n\nIn conclusion, I wish to say that Nicaragua has faith in the United \nNations. We are sure that its reorganization will make it stronger and will \nmake further effective changes in its operation. Members may be sure that the \nUnited Nations community will always have Nicaragua by its side. \n"

        "file_text": " We have come here to renew \nour faith and confidence in the world Organization. In a way, especially to \nus in Africa, the United Nations has assumed a unique position. This is the \nfirst time since the founding of the United Nations in 1945 that the \nOrganization has a Secretary-General from Africa. The Tanzanian delegation \ncongratulates Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali on his well-deserved election. The \nUnited Nations has assumed great significance because this change in the \nleadership of the United Nations has come at a time when the changes in the \ninternational system during the last few years have imposed upon all countries \nthe need to reassess familiar attitudes and policies. \n \nI congratulate the President upon his taking office during this period of \nchange. His wealth of experience, skill and commitment are not only a \nvaluable asset to the forty-seventh session, but also speak volubly of the \ncapabilities of his own country, Bulgaria, with which Tanzania enjoys \nexcellent relations. I am confident that he will ably adorn the position, \nbringing to it prestige and impartiality. His predecessor. \nAmbassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, presided over the forty-sixth \nsession with great skill. My delegation joins in the expressions of \nappreciation addressed to him. \nIn any human history, there are certain historical conjunctures which \ndistinguish one period from another. The five-year period between 1987 and \n1992 will be regarded as an important period in world history. This phase \ncoincided with the ending of the cold war and witnessed the expansion of the \nboundaries of the international system through the birth of 21 additional \nStates in the period 1991-1992 alone. I am delighted to join the warm welcome \nextended to the newest Members of our Organization. \nThe nature of governments has been transformed by increased \ndemocratization of their domestic political orders; the structures of power \nand influence in the world have been altered by the disintegration of the \nSoviet Union. These developments call for a transformation of the pattern of \ndiplomatic interactions, especially in the United Nations, and the \nrefashioning of the basic structure underlying the international system so \nthat the emerging new order may be based on right rather than might, on \njustice rather than expediency. \nIn retrospect, the political landscape of the international system has \nbeen profoundly and positively altered in the last five years. Yet it has \n \nalso opened up new instabilities, more challenges to international peace and \nsecurity, greater uncertainties - especially for developing countries and \nmore danger of armed conflicts, as reflected in the killings in Liberia, \nSomalia and the former Yugoslavia. These conflicts pose a grave danger to the \nvery life of human civilization. \nThe forty-seventh session of the General Assembly is being held at a \ncritical juncture: we are between two worlds one dead, the other powerless \nto be born. We are overshadowed by the dangers of unipolarity, economic \ndecadence in the developing countries, ecological dangers in the developed \ncountries, and the persistence of old injustices in Palestine and South Africa. \nThis diagnosis of the state of the world applies to the contemporary \nglobal configuration and to regional scenes alike. In the global setting, a -\nperiod of deep-seated, intense East-West conflict has ended with the \nconclusion of the cold war. As a result, an established order has given way \nto an as yet undefined future. At the regional level, there are equally mixed \nresults. For example, in South Africa, not long ago, the progress made in the \nlast two years in eradicating apartheid all of a sudden appeared to be on the \nbrink of collapse as the apartheid regime not only retrenched, but also \nperpetuated township violence and refused to concede the major demands of the \nAfrican National Congress, the Pan Africanist Congress and other democratic \nforces. \nLooking at the areas of conflict, it appears as if, all of a sudden, the \nconclusion of the cold war has given way to a kind of Hobbesian state of \nnature in which peoples and nations are caught in perpetual conflict and \ncompetition over land, resources, food, labour and markets. \n \nIn the last two years alone, Africa has witnessed several intra-State \nconflicts which have resulted in heavy human costs, in terms of casualties and \ndislocations; direct material costs, in terms of property damage; and \nopportunity costs. Neighbouring States have also paid heavily through their \nefforts to strengthen their security on common borders, through caring for \nrefugees and through the diversion of their Governments' attention away from \ndevelopmental efforts to crisis management related to wars, armed conflicts \nand insecurity. \n\nIn short, these conflicts have thwarted African efforts towards economic \nrecovery and peaceful transformation to a democratic order. Thus, while \nencouraging Africa to transform its political and economic systems, the \ndeveloped nations have a moral and historical duty to assist the continent in \npursuing a sustainable development strategy that is people-oriented. Such \nassistance will ensure that Africa pursues genuine development and rids itself \nof a major cause of internal conflicts. \nIn the last year, Tanzania has been host and facilitator to mediation \nefforts in the conflict in Rwanda. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that \nthe Government of Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic Front have been able to \nachieve a cease-fire to set the stage for a lasting political solution. \nTanzania would like to congratulate them upon this great achievement, and to \npay tribute to the Chairman and Secretary-General of the Organization of \nAfrican Unity, to neighbouring States and to other countries for their \ncontributions to these efforts. \nAngola and Mozambique have endured long periods of internal conflict. As \nwe meet here today, Angola has successfully completed a crucial multi-party \ngeneral election and Mozambique has recently signed a joint declaration with \nRENAMO. These developments will determine the peace and security interests of \nthe two countries. Tanzania commends the Governments and peoples of Angola \nand Mozambique for having taken the path of reconciliation and accommodation. \nUnfortunately, the optimism expressed on Angola and Mozambique cannot be \nextended to the intractable problems of the Middle East. Since the Madrid \nConference, several rounds of talks have been held. There have been at least \ntwo outstanding obstacles to successful negotiations: Israel's refusal to \naccept a Palestinian delegation composed of members of the Palestine \n\nLiberation Organization, and Jewish refusal to freeze settlements in occupied \nareas. \nThere can be no successful mediation in which the Palestinians, as one of \nthe parties, are continuously denied legitimacy. While Tanzania supports all \ninternational efforts to resolve the conflict in the Middle East, the \nmediation process must be based on the presumed equality of the parties to the \nconflict. Effective mediation must also proceed from a clear consent and \nvalid representation of all the parties to the conflict. \nWhat has been said of regional conflicts can also be stated of the \nenvironment. As witnessed at the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro, \nhumanity now faces one of its most serious sources of insecurity, the \necological ill-health of the planet itself. Asymmetries in non-sustainable \ndevelopment and industrialization, economic development and resource politics \nare at the heart of the environmental debate. \nTanzania, like most other developing nations, has four major concerns \nover the environment, namely: environmental space; environmental growth; \nenvironmental conditionally; and environmental democracy. To explain these \nconcerns, we have to emphasize that the developed nations must reduce pressure \non the environment through corrective action to enable developing countries, \nincluding Tanzania, to achieve environmental space for industrialization. \nEnvironmental growth, that is, the provisions of resources to raise \nliving standards, is necessary to eradicate poverty. \nEnvironmental conditionality must, by and large, be eradicated. Without \nignoring the relationship between technology and environmental degradation, \nthe present conditionalities on the provision of foreign assistance is a \ndiversion which tends to conceal real issues that hinder development efforts. \n\nThe developing countries are responsible for only a small part of the \npressures on the global environment. \nEnvironmental democracy refers to participation by the developing \ncountries in the decision-making procedures in multilateral institutions \ninvolving finance for the environment. Another component of environmental \ndemocracy is to ensure that the question of economic development is not \nsubsumed under environmental concerns. Thus, the task for the international \ncommunity after the historic Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro will be to merge, \nwisely, environmental policies with socio-economic development. \nTanzania looks to the establishment of a high-level commission on \nsustainable development under Article 68 of the Charter. \nThe period from 1987 to 1992 could be regarded as an extraordinary \nmoment, one which has opened up opportunities to confront and surmount the old \nand new instabilities and challenges to peace and security. Typical of the \nperiod of transition in the international system, negotiations, as a \npeace-making and policy-making instrument, have assumed renewed significance \nin resolving old and new issues. \nIndeed, the debate in the United Nations during the last two sessions of \nthe General Assembly has been dominated by one theme: the unprecedented \nopportunity created by the end of the cold war to create a new world order. \nThere is no doubt that the end of super-Power rivalry has contributed \nsignificantly to the ending of a number of conflicts, including those in \nAfghanistan, Angola, Cambodia and Namibia. This historic opportunity has \nfacilitated increased United Nations involvement in peace-keeping and \npeacemaking activities in many parts of the world. \n\nHowever, a new world Older must be based on the linkage between freedom \nand development, justice, peace, security and democracy within nations and \namong nations. From time immemorial, philosophers have reminded practitioners \nof the primacy of human freedom that is possible in society and through \nsociety only when structural inequalities and injustices have been eradicated. \nAny new world order ought to be based on the greatest good, and in the \nguarantee of equality and freedom for all. It must be based on the genuine \nmaintenance of peace and security in the broader sense of preventive \ndiplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-fostering. For one can \nmaintain security without necessarily maintaining peace, as the former may \nrequire measures that uphold the status quo, while the latter could require \nactions aimed at altering the existing situation. While security refers to \nthe absence of direct violence, peace focuses on the absence of the structural \nviolence of institutionalized injustice and inequalities. This approach is a \nsine qua non for development, democracy and justice, and for peace and \nsecurity in general. \n \nThe conception of a new world order must begin with the reforms in the \nUnited Nations and emphasize the important role of regional organizations such \nas the Organization of African Unity and the Non-Aligned Movement. The role \nof the United Nations must be reinterpreted to foster emancipation from \nunderdevelopment, injustice, inequalities and political domination. It must \nspearhead both democracy and liberty in general, and the economic capacity to \nenjoy that liberty meaningfully. \nI reiterate that the United Nations, and especially the Security Council, \nmust be reformed because it is based on an outmoded concept of international \npeace and security. The maintenance of peace and security cannot be \nexclusively focused on traditional peace-keeping or peacemaking, nor can it be \nleft the exclusive domain of the Security Council. There is also an economic, \nsocial and moral obligation to the international community as a whole. \nThe tragic conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia indicate that \nthe traditional United Nations peace-keeping methods have outlived their \nutility. Where the very survival of humanity is at stake, where the outbreaks \nand the level of violence reach enormous proportions, threatening the very \nfabric of human civilization, and where ethnic conflicts might necessitate \nexternal intervention and thus threaten international peace and security, the \nUnited Nations must be able to act promptly and decisively. \nSomalia is a typical example. My delegation calls upon all parties \ninvolved in the conflict to exercise restraint, to cooperate in facilitating \nthe distribution of humanitarian assistance and to set up a government of \nnational reconciliation. Tanzania applauds the efforts of the \nSecretary-General of the United Nations, the Secretary-General of the \nOrganization of African Unity, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the \n\nArab League and individual Governments in providing humanitarian assistance \nand in searching for a political solution in Somalia. \nIn January this year the Security Council requested the Secretary-General \nto study and make recommendations on ways to strengthen and make more \nefficient the United Nations capacity for preventive diplomacy, peacemaking \nand peace-keeping in accordance with the United Nations Charter. Tanzania \ncommends the Secretary-General on his prompt, comprehensive and \nthought-provoking response. \nAny durable international system must have a sound legal regime, \nincluding respect for and compliance with the rule of law at domestic and \ninternational levels and a democratic pattern of interaction. It is in this \ncontext that the General Assembly's declaration of the United Nations Decade \nof International Law, from 1990 to 1999, must be supported. This declaration \nis a clear indication of the concerted efforts of the United Nations in the \nlegal field to advance the search for a new world order. The \nSecretary-General has underlined this very important point in his \nrecommendation for a much more effective use of the International Court of \nJustice, including acceptance of the Court's compulsory jurisdiction. \nHowever, an effective global legal regime presupposes the existence of \nsound economic and political institutions: there is a mutually reinforcing \nrelationship. \nThe end of the cold war has tended to strengthen international concern \nover a systematic policy framework for human development, and has provided the \nopportunity for a greater range of sophisticated analyses and strategies on \nthe question of development. As I have stated previously, a sound new world \n\norder based on human freedom is possible only in a reorganized global society \nwhere structural inequalities and injustices are systematically eradicated. \nYet the Fourth United Nations Development Decade is beginning from an \nunpromising base. Global macroeconomic indicators for the last 18 months \nreveal a bleak picture. World per capita output remained unchanged in 1990, \nfell by 2 per cent in 1991 and is expected to fall again, by about 1 per cent, \nin 1992. Developing countries as a whole have for two consecutive years have \nundergone an unprecedented decline in their per capita incomes. As the Group \nof 77 has consistently pointed out, economic growth in the South has been \ncountered by inequality in the global monetary, financial and trade systems \nand by dwindling resource flows, debt burdens, restrictions on the transfer of \ntechnology, denial of market access, adverse terms of trade and declines in \nthe prices of the primary commodities that the South produces. \nAmong the developing countries, the African region was the worst hit. \nTotal African-region output increased by only 1.9 per cent in 1991, compared \nwith 3.2 per cent in 1990, while the non-oil-exporting countries' average rate \nof growth of combined output! fell from 1.7 per cent to 0.5 per cent in 1991. \nSouthern Africa has the added problem of the worst drought in recent memory, \nwhich threatens about 100 million people. \nThe gloomy economic indicators coincide with the post-cold-war \ndevelopment of changes in the domestic policies of many developing countries, \nincluding Tanzania. Restructuring is designed to enhance the dynamism of \nnational economies through the provision of economic enterprise and innovation \nand opening up to the operation of market forces. The soundness and efficacy \nof the policies aside, many of the domestic reforms also depend on a \nsupportive external environment at regional and global levels on such \n \nimportant issues as debt-servicing burdens, capital flows, market access and \ncommodity prices. \nSeveral conclusions can be drawn from an analysis of the global economy, \namongst which are, first, that economic divisions and rivalries inevitably \nproduce political conflicts; and, secondly, that there is a lopsided global \ninterdependence of growing inequalities within and between nations, which \ncannot be resolved through narrow conceptions of power politics. \nThere can be no genuine democracy where development strategies do not \ncentre on humankind. As the South Commission report aptly defines it, \ndevelopment \n\\\"... is a process which enables human beings to realize their potential, \nbuild self-confidence, and lead lives of dignity and fulfilment. It is a \nprocess which frees people from fear of want and exploitation, and is \nalso a process of growth, a society that is developing development is \npeople-centred efforts of the people, by and for the people\\\". \nThis correct conception of development covers the essential variables of human \ndevelopment, such as putting people at the centre of any development, the \ncorrelation between human development and human freedom, advanced levels of \neconomic activity, and equitable domestic and global distributions of income \nand opportunity. Indeed, questions such as how the disparities between the \npoor and the rich can be reduced or why global markets fail to meet the needs \nof the world's poorest focus on the restraining problem of human development. \n\nTanzania has followed with great interest the efforts by the \nSecretary-General to restructure the United Nations. Tanzania believes that \nreform and restructuring of the United Nations, involving both the \nintergovernmental machinery and the Secretariat, should foster a more \nefficient and effective structure without marginalizing the interests of the \nMember States, and especially the developing countries. \nAs I stated earlier, the United Nations alone cannot succeed unless it \ncooperates with regional organizations such as the Non-Aligned Movement and \nthe Organization of African Unity, which represent the aspirations of \ndeveloping nations. The roles of the Non-Aligned Movement and the \nOrganization of African Unity are not unique to modern third-world or African \nconditions. The modern State system has historically been characterized by \nthe struggle for human freedom and development. This resolve has emanated \nfrom two concurrent historical tendencies: on the one hand, great-Power \nhegemony and exploitation; and, on the other hand, the opposition of the \noverwhelming majority of the medium and small States to that exploitation. \nNone of the present changes in the international system has undermined these \ncentral features of the 400-year-old State system. The number and identity of \nhegemonies may change over time, but the existence and nature of the \nstruggle namely, the demand for the State system to function according to \nthe universality principle and for equality and justice between States has \nnot changed. \nThe plight of developing nations underscores the significance of the \nNon-Aligned Movement and the Organization of African Unity in the struggle to \nbring equality and justice for the affairs of humanity. Tanzania believes that \nthese regional organizations provide the foundation for collective action in \n\nfostering South-South economic cooperation, enhancing the democratization of \ninternational relations, and renewing democratic debate and dialogue between \nnations, especially North-South multilateral negotiations, which are currently \nat a stalemate. \nThe end of the cold war should enhance rather than confuse our resolve to \nbuild a new world order based on freedom, justice, equality and the \ndevelopment of humanity as a single family. This approach is the one we must \ntake in the present period, when poor States and peoples are becoming poorer \nand the rich are becoming richer, and must be seen as the real meaning of \ndemocracy at national and global levels. Viewed from this perspective, it is \nintolerable that any section of the same human family should not enjoy basic \neconomic, social, cultural, political and civil rights. \nThe human family of nations must not only examine the underlying causes \nof conflicts, injustice and underdevelopment, it must also seek to change \nsocial relationships and transform social structures in such a way that a more \njust, equal and dignified world emerges. That new world order awaits us. \nThat world order beckons to us. It is a world order we must strive to achieve. \n"

        "file_text": "It is my honour and privilege, on behalf of the \nGovernment and people of Fiji, to convey to you. Sir, our warmest \ncongratulations upon your election to the high office of President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its forty-seventh session. We are confident that under \nyour distinguished leadership the Assembly at this session will be guided to a \nmost successful conclusion.\n\nMy delegation extends its deep appreciation to your predecessor, \nMr. Samir Shihabi, for his exemplary leadership during the last session of the \nGeneral Assembly. \nSince our last session, a year ago, several new Members have joined the \nOrganization. My delegation welcomes them most warmly. We believe that the \nnear-universality of membership of the United Nations that we now have can \nlead to greater understanding and ultimately to concrete action in the search \nfor lasting solutions to many of the problems facing our global community. \n\nThe report of the Secretary-General is broad, and it demonstrates the \ncomplexity of the issues that concern the world today. My delegation commends \nthe Secretary-General for his comprehensive report and for the important steps \nhe has taken to carry out the various tasks that our Organization has assigned \nto him. We hope that at its forty-seventh session the General Assembly will \nhelp to find real solutions to these problems. \nThe last few years have been a period of profound changes. With the end \nof the cold war, we have witnessed a new wave of nationalism surging in \nseveral parts of the world. This reflects an intense yearning for \nself-determination, especially in the political and economic spheres. At the \nsame time, we have seen the world economy moving towards even greater \ninterdependence and integration. In these developments, we see bright \nprospects and opportunities, but we also see the emergence of new problems, \ngreater uncertainties and more unresolved inequities. \nIn the Horn of Africa in Somalia a human tragedy of unprecedented \ndimensions is unfolding. War, drought and the collapse of civil authority \nthreaten the lives of millions. Starvation has already claimed the lives of \nthousands of Somalis. All international efforts to respond to the \noverwhelming needs of the people of Somalia must be stepped up. \nWe fully support the United Nations in its role in Cambodia, and we have \ncontributed 50 police personnel to the United Nations Transitional Authority \nin Cambodia (UNTAC). The task facing UNTAC is certainly not easy. Fiji \nbelieves that the Cambodian people must be given the opportunity to determine \nfreely their own political destiny and to enjoy the peace, stability and \nwell-being to which they have aspired for so long. \n\nWe hope that the reform process in South Africa can build on the progress \nthat has already been made. We urge that the efforts to dismantle apartheid \nproceed as quickly as possible so that more deaths and bloodshed may be \navoided. The international community must continue to assist the people of \nSouth Africa in their endeavour to bring an effective end to violence and to \ncreate the conditions for dismantling of apartheid in their country. \nMy country commended both Koreas for taking seats last year as new \nMembers of this Organization. It is encouraging to note that since then the \ntwo Koreas have intensified their dialogue and that they are taking important \nsteps to strengthen further the ties between their two countries. The \nreunification of the Koreas will go a long way towards ensuring peace and \nstability in North-East Asia. \nFiji welcomes the Middle East peace process that is taking place. We \nhope that the parties concerned will seize the opportunity to seek a \ncomprehensive and just solution to the Middle East issues, in line with the \nrelevant Security Council resolutions. We call upon all the parties involved \nto make every possible effort and to demonstrate all possible understanding, \nwith a view to bringing about a just and permanent peace in the area. Fiji \nhas already lost several of its soldiers engaged in peace-keeping duties in \nthe cause of peace in the area. We therefore firmly believe that a positive \noutcome to the process would be a fitting tribute to all those gallant \nsoldiers who died for the noblest cause in our world - the cause of peace. \nThe gap between the developed countries and the developing countries has \nwidened. The world's population has grown to 5.5 billion, and much of the \ngrowth has taken place in the developing countries, which are home for \n\n77 per cent of the world's people. Moreover, about 1.4 billion of the world's \npeople live in extreme poverty, and the external debt of developing countries \ncontinues to grow. \nAs Fiji is a developing country, faced with its people's rising \nexpectations of improved conditions of living, we believe that the \ninternational community must make every effort to address and find solutions \nto the economic problems that we face. We urge the United Nations to continue \nto play a catalytic role in the creation of an international economic \nenvironment that will enhance the economies of the developing and \nunderdeveloped countries of the world. \nI am aware that a process of review and revitalization of the United \nNations is already under way. We in Fiji fully support the process, and I \nurge all Members of the Organization to do likewise so that programmes to meet \nthe challenges of closer international cooperation may be created. \nWe welcome the reforms that have already been put in place to strengthen \nthe Economic and Social Council. The Charter envisages the Council's being \nable to provide Member States and relevant bodies and agencies within the \nUnited Nations system with overall direction and guidance on all matters \nrelating to social and economic development. The Council should explore new \nneeds, priorities and opportunities for joint international action and should \ncoordinate them. A sense of priority in such changes will strengthen the \nimpact of resolutions. \n\nMy Government firmly believes that the private sector has a pivotal role \nto play in the development of the economy and therefore of the nation. We are \ntaking a number of steps to enhance and facilitate private-sector activity. \nIn this regard, as a relatively small island State, we welcome several \nprivate-sector initiatives which the United States of America has announced \nfor our region, including the proposed United States-Pacific island countries \njoint commercial commission. \nFiji also strongly supports efforts to liberalize world trade, and in \nparticular we look forward to a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of \ntrade negotiations. In fact, Fiji is already committed to giving the smaller \nPacific island countries in our region duty-free access to our markets for a \nnumber of commodities and products. \nTo ensure the economic development of developing countries, it is vital \nthat our exports be ensured greater access to markets of developed countries. \nThe terms of trade for developing countries' exports, especially for \ncommodities, should also be significantly improved. There can be no doubt \nthat the only credible option for generalized prosperity and development is a \ntruly open and liberalized trading system. \nThe Government of Fiji is committed to this objective. In the last few \nyears our own trade regime has been liberalized considerably. Import quotas \nhave been replaced with tariffs. The Government remains committed to \ncontinuous and steady reductions in the overall level of import protection. \nIn addition, we are continuing to pursue a policy of attracting foreign \ninvestments through generous incentives to foreign investors wishing to set up \nexport and manufacturing facilities in our country. \n\nMy country was pleased to participate in the United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, in June. I reaffirm \nour full commitment to the several decisions taken at the Conference, \nincluding the Rio Declaration, Agenda 21, the Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, the Convention on Biodiversity and the Statement on forest principles. \nMy Government supports the proposed commission on sustainable \ndevelopment, which is to be discussed later in this session. We particularly \nsupport the proposal that the commission be the main forum for consultation \nand leadership on the implementation of Agenda 21 at the global, regional and \nnational levels. The commission should be able to review progress in \nimplementation of Agenda 21, as well as provide a forum for further \ndevelopment and updating in the light of all future developments in the \ntechnological, legal, economic, financial and other areas. To be effective, \nthe commission must be supported by a. small and well-organized secretariat. \nGlobal warming and a rise in the sea level pose serious threats to the \nvery existence of a number of our neighbouring small island States in the \nSouth Pacific, and, I dare say, in other parts of the world. We welcome, \ntherefore, the Framework Convention on Climate Change as an important first \nstep towards addressing these threats. We want to see the Convention put into \neffect as early as possible. Negotiations of protocols should commence soon, \nespecially on targets and timetables for the reduction of carbon dioxide and \nother greenhouse gas emissions. \nWe also welcome UNCED's call for a series of meetings and conferences on \nthe sustainable development of small island countries. Fiji supports the \n \nconvening of the first global conference on small island states' sustainable \ndevelopment and its implications, and we will eagerly follow progress on the \narrangements for the conference. \nAgenda 21 also called for conferences on the conservation and management \nof fish resources, one of the main sources of livelihood for many of our small \nisland countries. Fiji endorses the Agenda 21 chapter on marine living \nresources and, in particular, the proposed United Nations intergovernmental \nconference to address the issue of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory \nspecies in the context of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. \nUNCED was a major step forward, but the next step may be more difficult. \nThe spirit in which the various agreements were conceived and adopted needs to \nbe matched by their speedy implementation. \nWe are pleased that a good start has been made with the recently \nannounced \\\"Capacity 21\\\" initiative by the United Nations Development Programme \n(UNDP), which aims at providing support to developing countries in the \npreparation and management of their own sustainable development plans. This \ninitiative will go a long way towards translating Agenda 21 into effective \nnational programmes. \nToday the world recognizes that basic human and social dimensions of \ndevelopment have long been neglected. UNDP's latest \\\"Human Development \nReport\\\" reminds us that development means involving people, placing them at \nthe centre of all decision-making. At the United Nations, we, too, must place \npeople at the centre of all our activities. \nI ask Member States to support the proposed world summit for social \ndevelopment, to be convened in 1995. The summit should elevate important \n \nsocial issues and allow socio-economic questions to be addressed more \ncomprehensively than has been done in the past. \nFurthermore, the International Conference on Population and Development, \nto be convened in Egypt in September 1994, will provide an added focus on the \nrelationship between population and.social development. My country looks \nforward to participating in both conferences. \nWe have received the report of the Secretary-General, \\\"An Agenda for \nPeace\\\" (A/47/277), containing his constructive analysis and recommendations on \nways to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations for preventive \ndiplomacy, peace-building and peace-keeping. We applaud the Secretary-General \nfor his pertinent recommendations and for some of the measures that he has \nalready taken. \nPeace-keeping has eased tension and conflicts in several areas of the \nworld. Fiji takes pride in being one of the countries contributing troops \nthat are helping to promote and maintain peace in different parts of the \nworld. We support the extension of United Nations peace-keeping into new \nfields, including the prevention of conflicts and peace-building, as suggested \nby the Secretary-General in his report to the Assembly. We recognize, \nhowever, that peace-keeping operations can be successful only with the full \ncooperation of the parties and a clearly defined mandate from the Security \nCouncil. \n\nAs a former military officer, I know only too well that peace-keeping \ncosts money and that financial contributions to our Organization are vital to \nthe ultimate goal of secure and lasting peace in our universe. My delegation \nappreciates the undertaking by previous speakers to ensure adequate financial \nsupport for United Nations peace-keeping and humanitarian activities. \nIt is perhaps appropriate at this point to remind this gathering that \nwhen the former Deputy Prime Minister of Fiji, the Honourable \nJosefata Kamikamica, addressed the Assembly in 1991, he indicated that my \ncountry would hold a general election in 1992 under our new Constitution. A \npeaceful general election, in which all the major political parties \nparticipated, was held in May this year. Since then, we have had two sessions \nof the new Parliament. I felt constrained to mention this because there is a \ngrowing demand in the world today for democracy, a necessary aspect of which \nis the holding of regular elections. \nPrevious representatives of my country who have addressed the Assembly \nwithin the last four years adverted to the changes which had taken place and \nwere still taking place in Fiji on the new Constitution that was promulgated \nin 1990 on the basis of recommendations by an independent multiracial national \ncommission. I take great pleasure in informing this assembly of the world \nthat my Government has committed itself to a review of the 1990 Constitution \nof Fiji. Preparatory work has already begun with regard to the mechanism and \nprocedures for implementing this review. All communities in Fiji will be \nconsulted fully in the review process. It will also involve the \nrepresentatives of the people in Parliament and all the political parties. \nAs of December 1988 indigenous Fijians numbered about 345,000 out of a \n\ntotal population of 720,000. Fiji is their indigenous homeland. In fact, the \nFijians, through their mataqalis land-owning units own 83 per cent of all \nthe land in Fiji. We have a distinct culture and identity which we must, of \nnecessity, foster and develop for the very survival of the Fijian race. My \nGovernment is committed to providing continuing special assistance to the \nindigenous Fijians until they achieve comparable economic status with the \nother communities in Fiji, in keeping with the indigenous policies and \nprogrammes in many of our member countries. \nI should also like to express my Government's sincere and deep \nappreciation of the valuable efforts of the Working Group on Indigenous People \nin drafting the Universal Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People. My \nGovernment, while reviewing our Constitution, is also committed to taking into \naccount the meaning and obligations of this United Nations Declaration and all \nthe recent developments in international and constitutional law on indigenous \nand tribal rights. My Government also supports the declaration of 1993 as the \nInternational Year for the World's Indigenous People. \nAnd while we look forward to observing 1993 as the International Year for \nthe World's Indigenous People, we are also coming to the close of a very \nimportant year, the International Year for Disabled Persons. The disabled are \npresent in every class, in every race, in every culture and in every country. \nA feature the disabled share with indigenous groups is that, while they are \npresent, they are often not heard. We commend the United Nations for its \nefforts all along, including this year, in bringing to the fore the concerns \nof the disabled. \nMy country remains committed to the work of the Special Committee on \ndecolonization. The success that has been achieved so far should not lead us \n\nto forget what remains to be done. In the South Pacific region, we are \nencouraged by the measures being taken by the French Government under the \nMatignon Agreements to provide a framework for New Caledonia's evolution \ntowards self-determination and independence. My Government welcomed the \nFrench Government's decision to allow a South Pacific ministerial mission to \nvisit New Caledonia last year and to facilitate regular visits by United \nNations missions in the future. We look forward to the mid-term review of the \nMatignon Agreements towards the end of the year. We consider this essential \nin ensuring that progress is maintained towards the decolonization of New \nCaledonia. \nFiji will continue to oppose nuclear testing and the dumping of nuclear \nand other toxic wastes in the South Pacific region. The cessation of these \nactivities is vital for our very survival and the preservation of our fragile \necosystem. We in the South Pacific welcome the recent decision by France to \nsuspend its nuclear testing in the region. We are greatly encouraged by \nFrance'^ accession to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty, and we hope that \nFrance will also become a party to the Protocol of the South Pacific \nNuclear-Free Zone Treaty. \nAt the same time, my Government also welcomes the decision by the United \nStates to cease the operation of its chemical-weapons incineration facility at \nJohnston Atoll. \nWe also applaud Japan's decision to cease large-scale drift-net fishing, \noften described as the \\\"Wall of Death\\\", in our South Pacific waters, and we in \nthat region earnestly pray that other distant-water-fishing nations will soon \nmake similar decisions. \n\nSecure and lasting peace in our world is what we must all aspire to. \nDisarmament and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction are essential \nrequirements for peace. I believe that the Members of this Organization, all \nof us, should work together with total commitment to create and maintain \nsecure and lasting peace on our planet, and simultaneously to increase and \nexpand economic and social benefits to all the peoples of our world. \nFinally, our world today is what we, its nations, make it. With a \nknowledge of yesterday, with our experiences of today, let us all, great and \nsmall, rich and poor, as Members of this international Organization, \nrededicate our energies and efforts and commit ourselves to building a better \nworld for us and for those generations which come after us. \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government and people of Belize \nI extend congratulations to Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria on his election to \nthe presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We are \nconfident that he will steer the Assembly with wisdom and energy. \nMy delegation also pays special tribute to the Secretary-General for his \nuntiring efforts in bringing us closer to peace. \nFive hundred years ago the Colombus enterprise set off a chain of events \nthat created the world we know today. Some may find in this anniversary cause \nfor celebration, but the peoples of the Americas, of Africa and of Asia mourn \nthe ruthless exploitation of nature and humanity that was unleashed by those \nevents. \nThe enterprise brought Christianity to the Western Hemisphere. It led to \nthe creation of one world. It took humanity inexorably along the path to \neconomic globalization and interdependence in all spheres. It also led to the \ncreation of many dual worlds: in our Hemisphere, the European world and the \nindigenous world, the white world and the black world; the rich and the poor; \nthe dominators and the dominated. And on our planet this tragic dichotomy is \nwrit large in the great divide between North and South. \nThe sermon of the Catholic Friar Antonio de Montesinos delivered in 1511 \nwas and remains a telling message to the world. \\\"Tell me,\\\" he said, \\\"what \nright have you to enslave them? What authority did you use to make war \nagainst them who lived at peace on their territories, killing them cruelly \nwith methods never heard of? How can you oppress them and not care to feed or \ncure them, and work them to death to satisfy your greed?\\\" \nWe are not here to lament tragic occurrences of a distant past, but to \nrecord the facts of an unacceptable present reality, for the world order whose \nfoundations were laid then continues to this day. At this historic juncture of world history, we are called upon to create \na new world order, an order based on justice and respect, an order that can \nproduce peace. We should be in a better position than ever before to launch a \nunited struggle to achieve this goal. We have seen the consequences of \ninjustice and intolerance, and we are waking up to the obvious that we live \non one planet, and that the welfare of one is inextricably linked to the \nwelfare of all. \nJust a few days ago the people of Belize celebrated the eleventh \nanniversary of independence. On that occasion the Financial Times of London \nwrote about Belize as an oasis of calm with a promising future: \n\\\"Its judicial, political and educational systems work reasonably well ... \nIt is possible to be optimistic about tomorrow.\\\" \nOur goal is to become more productive, more competitive and more adaptable to \nthe changes that lie before us at the dawn of the unfolding century. But even \nas we celebrated, we reminded ourselves of the need for fundamental changes in \nthe present world order if people around the world are to achieve their \nexpectations for a better quality of life. And so we feel compelled to add \nour modest voice to the rest of humanity's and propose the outlines of \npolicies that will give us all a chance to pursue and maintain sustainable \ndevelopment and social equity. \nWith the Assembly's indulgence, I will say a few words about three \ncritical and interrelated blocks we believe must be used to build a new world \norder: justice, respect and peace. \nJustice for all. Five hundred years after, it cannot be right that \n200 million people in our Hemisphere are living in critical poverty. This \ncannot be right because, among other things, our region, Latin America and the \nCaribbean, is rich. With 8 per cent of the world's population, that region \npossesses 23 per cent of the world's potentially arable land, 46 per cent of \nthe tropical forest, and 31 per cent of the available surface water. \nNor is it that we have not been producing wealth. Since 1982 \nLatin America and the Caribbean have been transferring a net US$20 billion to \nUS$30 billion every year to the industrial world. The poor are subsidizing \nthe rich. \nThe external debt of our region has not been reduced but has escalated \nalarmingly, from US$285 billion in 1981 to US$500 billion today. At the same \ntime, the application of structural adjustment policies has enormously \nincreased the social debt in so many countries of the region since the burdens \nof payment have fallen disproportionately on the poor, their plight worsened \nby sharp cuts in social programmes and public services. \nCancellation or reduction of the debt of underdeveloped countries would \nbe an act of justice. It would be a first step in the process of constructing \na new world order that will enable sustainable development to take place based \non a new socio-economic strategy that puts people first. \nWe wish to emphasize that to achieve sustainable development we must \nbuild a new international order based on principles different from those that \nnow govern international relations. We must reach agreement on a common \nstrategy that respects the principles of non-intervention in the internal \naffairs of States and the right of each country to select its own path to \ndevelopment. In this day and age there is no place for the unilateral use of \nforce and for claims made by States to exercise extra-territorial rights. The \nnew international order must ensure for countries of the South adequate access \nto compatible technology, respect for the principle of gradualism for free and \nfair trade, just and stable prices for our products, food security, an end to \nthe North's practices of protectionism and non-tariff barriers, adequate \nfinancial flows and the provision of investment funds that produce mutually \nbeneficial results. \nThere is now a growing international recognition of the universal \nvalidity of the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We \nwelcome this growing trend towards democratization in our region and in the \nworld. We deem it necessary to echo the words of the Jakarta Message of the \nTenth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement: no country should use its power to \ndictate its concept of democracy and human rights or to impose \nconditionalities on others. Human rights must be addressed on the basis of \nuniversality, individuality, impartiality and non-selectivity. \nThe situation in South Africa today, while mitigated by glimmers of hope, \nstill presents a picture of daily massive abuse of human rights of black \npeople. Apartheid, by whatever name, is still firmly in place. We cannot be \ncomplacent about the one-step-forwards, two-steps-backwards syndrome that has \napparently settled on the politics of that suffering country. The \ninternational community must help the South African people to defend the \nadvances made so far and to advance the negotiations rapidly so that the \npeople of South Africa may soon be able to start building a truly democratic \nState, free of the blights of racism, repression and exploitation. \nThe people of Palestine, those in the territory and those scattered in \nthe cruel diaspora, cry out for immediate and effective action to allow them \nto exercise their rights to their territory, to self-determination and peace. \nThe institutionalized denial of the rights of Palestinians in the occupied \nterritories continues unabated - starting with the right to life and passing \nthrough all categories of rights. \nHow can we allow such denial and abuse to continue on the threshold of \nthe twenty-first century? My delegation earnestly calls on all parties \ninvolved rapidly to conclude negotiations for a just solution to the \nPalestinian question and on this body to do everything possible to facilitate \nthe process, beginning with the effective enforcement of all relevant United \nNations resolutions. \nIn the Arabian Gulf region, as in other regions, we must be alert to any \nviolations of the principle of territorial integrity. We cannot condone the \nacquisition by force of an island, no matter how small, or of any territory. \nIn our hemisphere the people of Haiti continue to suffer gross violations \nof human rights under a military dictatorship that deprives them of the first \nfruit of their decades-long struggle for democracy. We in the Caribbean feel \na special concern for - indeed a special debt towards the people of Haiti. \nAs our Caribbean novelist George Lamming said recently: \n\\\"The first and most decisive blow struck at the Plantation, destroying \nits hegemony, was the triumph of the Haitian war of independence.\\\" \nYet today the democratic triumph of the Haitian people is frustrated as \nPresident Aristide remains in exile. \nAs a Caribbean country we cannot remain silent in the face of this \ninjustice. Neither can we condone the systematic strangulation of another \nCaribbean nation in violation of all norms of international law. Justice must \nbe for all. It cannot be selectively dispensed. \nPerhaps the greatest contribution to world peace and development made by \nmodern environmentalists has been to remind us of what our ancestors \ninstinctively knew: that we cannot use the Earth's resources for our own \nbenefit, but that if we wish to survive we have to respect the Earth in all \nits diversity. \nSince that fateful landing 500 years ago, the assault on nature in our \nhemisphere has resulted in an ecological destruction unprecedented in world \nhistory. Countless numbers of plant and animal species have been permanently \nlost to humanity. The real tragedy, however, is that in this supposedly \nenlightened age the destruction continues. \nWe are destroying the planet by conscious acts of devastation, and the \ndouble tragedy for us in the South is that even when these acts take place \nwithin our jurisdictions we are rarely the authors and hardly ever the \nbeneficiaries of their short-term gains. While we accept the responsibility \nfor conserving our common environment, we cannot unilaterally close off \noptions for development to our people when their need is so great. What is \nneeded is effective international cooperation that, recognizing our \ninterdependence, compensates us for our efforts. \nWe in Belize are taking this responsibility seriously. We have set aside \nmore than a quarter of the country's land mass as environmentally protected \nareas; we have resisted the seductions of mass tourism and opted for \nsustainable eco-tourism. We are about to pass a comprehensive environment \nprotection law. \nWe are also struggling to come to terms with the demands of maintaining \nbiodiversity. The regional report, \\\"Our Own Agenda\\\", reminds us that \n\\\"diversity of life forms is indispensable for the survival of the \nbiosphere and the human species. Biodiversity is acknowledged today as a \ncommon value, and its conservation is of a high priority for all\\\". \nWe also believe, however, that we the world community will never succeed \nin respecting and preserving biodiversity if we do not respect and preserve \nhomodiversity. Our biggest incentive to preserve the environment is \nto preserve the human species and enhance its prospects for sustainable \ndevelopment. While it is true that we are all Earth's children, we are also \nenriched by differences. We are one people with many cultures, many \nlanguages, many distinct ways of life, many different creeds. We are one \ntapestry, but with many different threads. We must respect these differences, \nor there will never be peace. \nThe phenomenal growth in migration all over the world should convince \neven the most sceptical that it is in everyone's interest to learn to respect \nthe diversity of peoples. This phenomenon, while creating tensions in the \nshort term, will, we believe, enhance the probability of all of us learning to \nlive with people whose cultures are in many ways different from our own. \nEither that, or we condemn ourselves and our children to perpetual strife. \nWhen we struggle together for justice for all and we learn to respect \nnature and humanity, we give ourselves the opportunity of creating a world in \npeace. But we cannot talk about creating a peaceful world unless we first \nacknowledge that the world is not in peace and identify the major causes of \nthis situation. \nWe consider it more important to prevent conflicts than to separate \ncombatants after conflict has broken out. One cannot speak about keeping the \npeace when there is no peace to be kept. We believe, therefore, that the \nUnited Nations should concentrate much more on a new, expanded role of \npeace-building. \nHowever, we can work effectively together only if the structures we use \nto define and implement our common strategy are based on the very principles \nwe proclaim. We cannot espouse democracy in our various countries while our \nown collective Organization is not only profoundly undemocratic but based on a \nworld power relationship that is no longer valid. \nThere is an urgent need to reform the United Nations system. In \nparticular, the Security Council must be democratized. As His Excellency \nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United Nations, states in his \nreport, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", \n\\\"regional action as a matter of decentralization, delegation and \ncooperation with the United Nations efforts could not only lighten the \nburden of the Council but also contribute to a deeper sense of \nparticipation, consensus and democratization in international affairs\\\". \n(A/47/277, para. 64) \nIn our hemisphere we support moves to strengthen the Organization of \nAmerican States and its related institutions and join the efforts to make them \nmore effective mechanisms for addressing our common concerns. \nCloser to home, we are committed to an expanded Caribbean Community \n(CARICOM), as recommended by the West Indian Commission in its report entitled \n\\\"Time for Action\\\". The Commission recommended that CARICOM initiate proposals \nfor the establishment of an Association of Caribbean States directed to both \neconomic integration and functional cooperation, with membership open to all \nCARICOM member States, the other island States of the Caribbean and the Latin \nAmerican countries of the Caribbean littoral. \nThe Commission's recommendations are being carefully studied, but we can \nsay that the concept of an expanded Caribbean Community has always been on \nBelize's agenda, not least because we are both a Caribbean and a Central \nAmerican country, and we feel called upon to provide one of the vital links \nbetween the two subregions. The task of bringing them closer together is made \neasier by Guatemala's recognition of Belize as an independent sovereign State, \nand we are confident that with goodwill on both sides there will be a \nsatisfactory resolution of Guatemala's territorial claim, which is still \noutstanding. \nAnother important principle that our Organization is pledged to respect \nis that of universality. This session is enriched by the presence of 20 new \nMembers, and we must support the call for a return of the Republic of China to \nthe international community. We cannot continue to ignore the reality of \n20 million people organized in a State, and we are confident that those people \nare capable of making a useful contribution to our work at the United Nations. \nWe all rejoice at the end of the cold war. We can all breathe easier now \nthat the threat of a nuclear holocaust has been reduced. But while none of us \ndied as a result of the cold war, during all those years millions died from \npoverty, and hundreds of millions suffered hunger, malnutrition, lack of \neducation, poor housing and the indignity of unemployment. The tragedy is \nthat the system continues to take its toll. \nNow that the cold war is ended, are we not entitled to expect something \nmore than triumphalist declarations of this fact? It is unforgivable that, \nwhile military budgets remain so largely disproportionate to any rational \nsecurity need, children are dying from hunger or preventable disease. If, \nover the next five years. Governments in our hemisphere alone were to reduce \ntheir military budgets to a level 20 per cent below 1990 figures, a minimum of \n$50 billion would be available at the end of that period for the war on \npoverty. \nLet us not forget that poverty and misery have principally affected women \nand young people; they have borne the brunt of the hardships produced by \nstructural adjustment policies. We must make a firm commitment to implement a \ngender perspective aimed at the integration and mobilization of women as full \nparticipants in, and beneficiaries of, the development process. \nAt the same time, we must take special measures to provide young people \nwith the education and employment that will allow them to lead healthy and \nproductive lives. In this context, we cannot but agonize at the terrible toll \nthat drug abuse and drug trafficking are taking on our young people. We must \nredouble our efforts in the fight against these evils. Adequate resources \nmust be mobilized internationally and made available for the interdiction and \neradication of drugs, as well as for treatment and rehabilitation. \nWe harbour no illusions about the enormity of our task or about the \nchances of our succeeding in creating a just and peaceful world. But, no \nmatter what the odds, we must make a solemn commitment to give it our best \nshot. We owe it to the millions who have gone before us and who have \nstruggled against injustice and poverty. We owe it to the suffering peoples \nof our time. Above all, we owe it to the children who will inherit the world \nwe make for them. We must all reaffirm our commitment to full and effective \nimplementation of the Declaration and the Plan of Action of the World Summit \nfor Children. It is for the children that we must construct a world system \nthat will guarantee the quality of life necessary to ensure their well-being. \nThe challenge is there for us. All we can do is begin the task; the \nchildren must pursue it. We must begin now if the children are to have any \nchance at all. We must do so with a sense of urgency. Time is running out. \nThis is the moment to act with God's help and the support of peoples \nrepresented here at the United Nations. "

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Lesotho delegation, and on \nmy own account, I wish first and foremost, to congratulate you. Sir, on your \nelection as President of the forty-seventh session of the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly. It is indeed a deserved acknowledgement of your personal \nattributes, as well as eloquent recognition of the important role that your \ncountry has always played in world affairs. \nI cannot but also seize this opportunity to express our appreciation to \nAmbassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia for the dedication and competence \nwith which he conducted the deliberations of the forty-sixth session. \n \nWe are proud to see at the helm of our Organization an eminent son of \nAfrica, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. We warmly congratulate him on his well \ndeserved election to the office of Secretary-General. His achievements to \ndate are a source of satisfaction and pride to us all. \nWe share in the joy of welcoming to the family of nations all the new \nMember States. Their presence within our ranks is a further fulfilment of the \nprinciple of universality of the United Nations. \nThe forty-seventh session of the General Assembly has begun against a \nbackdrop of renewed confidence in the ability of the United Nations to \nfacilitate the resolution of a vast array of problems facing humanity. Thanks \nto the demise of the cold war and the debilitating Power-bloc politics of old, \nthe inherent dynamic of the United Nations has been unleashed, giving reason \nfor optimism that the Organization is now poised to assume a major role in \nshaping the new world order. \nEven as the main elements of the new order begin to crystallize, their \nattendant uncertainties necessitate that we duly voice some of our primary \nconcerns and desires regarding international relations in the post-cold-war \nera. \nIt is our firm belief that the socio-economic and political \ntransformation the world is undergoing will not culminate in a better and \nsafer world unless it is guided by the ideals and principles enshrined in the \nCharter of the United Nations and unless we acknowledge that, diverse as \nmankind is, its fundamental interests are common and indivisible. \nWithout our being complacent, it can be said that, with the ideological \nantagonism of the past now overcome, never before in the history of \ninternational relations has such a congenial atmosphere prevailed for \ncollective action towards creating a secure and viable future for mankind. \n\nOne positive development in this connection is that, increasingly, there \nis among States, large and small, a happy convergence of shared values and \nideals for a better world. It is in this spirit that we should focus \nundivided attention on the problems confronting the world. \nPotentially disruptive to the new world order and to the cohesion of \nnation States is the resurgence of the phenomenon of intolerance, which is \nassuming prominence in many parts of the globe. Intolerance, whether \nmanifested through racism, religion or ethnicity, breeds discrimination and is \na negation of civilized norms and a threat to world peace. \nOptimistic as we are that a new world order will bring about an \nenlightened approach to inter-State relations, small States have no option but \nto continue to emphasize the centrality of the principle of sovereignty and \nequality of States. \nTendencies towards domination and hegemony are still a factor to reckon \nwith, hence our concern with the issue of the security of small States. \nEqually, we cannot fail to register the lingering perception on the part of \ndeveloping countries, particularly small States, that the post-cold-war era \ncan potentially lead to their political and economic marginalization. We \ntrust that a matter of such importance as this will evoke an appropriate \nresponse on the part of the international community in the period ahead. \nThe new world order we are striving to build will remain on a shaky \npedestal unless it places at the centre issues relating to the dignity of the \nhuman person. Happily, there is already a global consensus acknowledging that \ndemocracy and respect for fundamental human rights are a starting-point for \ninternational stability and a foundation for a world free from national and \nregional conflicts. It is in this context that we hail the decisions of the \n\nAssembly to convene in the not-too-distant future international conferences on \nhuman rights, on women and on development. \nThe clarion call of the moment is for countries of the world to create \ntruly democratic societies. We note with satisfaction that many countries in \nAfrica are increasingly embarking on that road. \nIn the case of Lesotho, arrangements are very advanced towards holding \nthe first genuine democratic elections since Lesotho attained independence in \n1966. \nIt may be recalled that the military assumed power in 1986 in order to \nrestore peace, to foster national reconciliation and to set in motion \narrangements for a return to democratic rule. We have pledged to return to \nthe barracks and to hand the reins of power to a democratically-elected \ngovernment. Our commitment in this regard is both unshakeable and \nirreversible. Furthermore, the military will not be a contestant at the \nforthcoming multiparty general election. Its primary role will be to ensure \nthat the election is free and fair. To achieve maximum transparency, several \ncountries as well as international organizations have already agreed to send \nobserver missions to witness the process. \nThe cause of restoring democracy in Lesotho has been found worthy of \nmaterial support and encouragement by many friendly countries, including the \nUnited States of America, the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, \nCanada, Sweden, Denmark and Australia. For this we are profoundly thankful. \nIn the same breath, we would also like to express our deep appreciation for \nthe assistance and support received from the Commonwealth, the European \nEconomic Community (EEC), and the Organization of African Unity (OAU). In \nkeeping with its resolution 46/137 on \\\"Enhancing the effectiveness of the \n \nprinciple of periodic and genuine elections\\\", the United Nations has provided \nhighly valuable assistance through the Geneva-based Centre for Human Rights. \nIt goes without saying that in the wider context Of the democratization \nprocess, the holding of democratic elections is but the beginning. The vital \ntest will be to sustain democratic rule. Newly-emerging democracies will have \nto contend with the challenges to stability brought about by poverty and \nunderdevelopment. The efforts of many developed countries in nurturing the \nseed of democracy will need to be complemented by enhanced resource flows from \ndeveloped countries to assist developing countries not only to escape from the \nvicious circle of underdevelopment, but also to institutionalize a culture of \ndemocracy. \nWe in Lesotho are about to hand over power to a civilian government \nagainst the background of serious socio-economic problems accentuated by a \ndevastating drought engulfing the whole of the southern region. I express \nheartfelt thanks to all those who responded positively to the Geneva Pledging \nConference organized in June by the United Nations and the Southern African \nDevelopment Community to mobilize international assistance towards mitigating \nthe plight faced by countries of the subregion. \nWe are happy to join many delegations in congratulating the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his report entitled \\\"An \nAgenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277). Lesotho is in full agreement with the \nperceptions and conclusions set forth therein. \nThe stability of our subregion remains a source of concern. South Africa \ncontinues to be in the grip of violence. While we note that the parties \nconcerned have agreed to resume talks, we urge the South African Government, \nthe liberation movements and all other democratic forces to continue the \n\nprocess of negotiations leading to the creation of a new and democratic South \nAfrica. Similarly, we encourage them to persevere in their efforts to find \nviable modalities for the cessation of violence. \nWe welcome the recent decision by the Security Council enabling the \nSecretary-General to monitor violence in South Africa and facilitate the \nrestoration of negotiations. We equally appreciate the recent release of some \npolitical prisoners and hope that the remaining political prisoners will be \nreleased on schedule as agreed by the parties concerned. \nNotwithstanding continuing initiatives by the OAU towards conflict \nmanagement and resolution in Africa, many Africans continue to suffer as a \nresult of internal strife and regional conflicts. \nWe are hopeful that the suffering in Mozambique and Angola will soon be \nbrought to an end. We fully welcome the involvement of the United Nations in \nthe ongoing process towards restoring normalcy, which will give the people of \nthe two sister countries greater hope for the future. \nThe human suffering and political impasse in both Somalia and Liberia \ndeserve urgent attention by the international community. The human tragedy \nunfolding in those countries is immeasurable. While commending the active \nrole of the United Nations in the resolution of the conflicts as well as in \naddressing the humanitarian dimension, it appears necessary to extend that \nrole to include the involvement of United Nations peace-keeping forces. We \nare equally saddened by the senseless carnage in Bosnia and Herzegovina. \n\nThe problem of Western Sahara is still with us notwithstanding \npreparations for the deployment of the United Nations Mission to supervise the \nproposed Western Sahara referendum. We appeal to both Morocco and the \nPolisario Front to co-operate fully with the efforts of the international \ncommunity in resolving the question of Western Sahara. \nPursuant to the Madrid peace talks, we welcome the ongoing peace efforts \nregarding the Middle East question. Lesotho remains firm in its belief that \nthere can never be a lasting solution to the problem of the Middle East unless \nIsrael fully recognizes the right of the Palestinians to self-determination \nand withdraws from all occupied Arab territories. However, we are encouraged \nto note a promising change of attitude in Israel since the change of \nGovernment. \nSecurity Council resolution 668 (1990) and the signing of the peace \nTreaty in October 1991 by all parties to the Cambodia conflict, as well as the \njoint statement of the leaders expressing full support for that Security \nCouncil resolution, gave hope that peace was in sight. We urge all parties \nfully to respect the peace accords, as well as to comply, without fail, with \nthe terms of Security Council resolution 766 (1992). \nIt is our belief that world security cannot be assured through the threat \nor use of force or by stockpiles of dangerous weapons. We therefore recognize \nthe validity of preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping as viable \nconstituents of the international security agenda. \nWe cannot lose sight of the now universally acknowledged linkage between \npeace, security and development. Peace is a fundamental element of human \nexistence. It is a universal ideal, and its achievement a perpetual quest of \nmankind. On it depend our survival, advancement and happiness. \n \nWith the demise of the bipolar structures, the whole world, particularly \nthe developing world, had hoped for bright prospects of strengthening \ndevelopment co-operation through the release of financial, material and human \nresources hitherto tied up in military expenditures. \nRegrettably, the issue of the peace dividend did not materialize as \nanticipated. Instead, the spectre of donor fatigue has contributed to the \nlessening of interest in bridging the economic gap between North and South. \nWe believe that the only way out of this state of affairs is to reactivate the \nNorth-South dialogue in earnest. \nThe perennial problem of external debt remains a constraint to our \ndevelopment efforts. The situation is further compounded by trends towards \nprotectionism and other discriminatory policies in international trade against \nimports from developing countries. \nWe therefore urge the developed creditor countries to urgently strengthen \nand broaden initiatives towards debt relief. In good faith, they should also \nfacilitate a speedy conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade \nnegotiations in a balanced and equitable manner that will reflect the \ninterests of the developing countries. \nThe convening of the United Nations Conference on Environment and \nDevelopment, in Rio last June, presented a unique opportunity to us all to \nreaffirm our commitment to the preservation of the environment. Important \ninternational agreements were adopted. The major challenge before the \ninternational community is to fully honour and implement the commitments \nmade. The provision of adequate financial and technological resources for the \nimplementation of Agenda 21 is an imperative."

        "file_text": "Allow me, first of all, on behalf \nof the Angolan Government and on my own behalf, to congratulate you. Sir, on \nyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh \nsession and to wish you success in carrying out your mandate. I am sure that \nyour experience and competence will guarantee the success of our work. The \nAngolan delegation wishes from the outset to assure you of our complete \ncooperation. \nTo the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Samir Shihabi, I should \nlike to express my appreciation for the valuable work done during his mandate. \nTo Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, I express my Government's \nprofound appreciation of his goodwill and selfless efforts, demonstrated in \nthe constant search for just and lasting solutions aimed at preserving peace \nand international security. \nMy Government supports and will contribute in a positive way to the \nrealization of the valuable concepts formulated in his report \\\"An Agenda for \nPeace\\\", whose sub-heading includes the words \\\"Preventive diplomacy\\\" (A/47/277). \nOn behalf of the Government and people of Angola, I wish to welcome the \nnew States that have been admitted to the United Nations; we are certain that \ntheir participation will contribute to the Organization's betterment. \nThe world has witnessed important political transformations occurring in \nAngola in the past. The armed conflict that had ravaged the country since \n1975 was ended with the signing of the Bicesse Accords on 31 May 1992. There \n \n83 \nis no occasion more appropriate than the present one to sum up the situation \nwhich has followed the peace accords. The Angolan people is preparing for and \nawaiting with great expectations the holding of the first multiparty general \nelections on 29 and 30 September, which demonstrate my Government's \ndetermination to comply with the obligations it has assumed under the Bicesse \nAccords. \nWhile the incidents taking place in my country represent transitional \noccurrences in a process as complex as ours, their recurrence in almost all \nparts of the country is a source of grave concern to my Government and to the \nAngolan people. In this regard my Government believes that the United Nations \nand the rest of the international community have an important role to play \nduring this decisive phase of the Angolan peace process. \nThe environment of peace and relative tranquillity that prevails in my \ncountry is the result of persistent and arduous work and of the tenacious will \nof the Angolan people, which counted upon the international community. The \nAngolan people has provided proof of civilian rule and political maturity by \nspontaneously and massively participating in electoral registration and in all \nthe activities which will bring about the elections in spite of the difficulty \nin communications. \nOf the estimated number of slightly more than 5 million voters, \n4.8 million have registered. The national electoral council has demonstrated \nforesight and has performed its work with praiseworthy efficiency. And from \nthis podium, I wish to express once more Angola's appreciation to all those \ncountries and organizations which lent us their support in so many forms. \nMy Government sincerely hopes that before the election definitive accords \ncan be reached on certain aspects which continue to be a source of concern \nwith regard to the conduct of free and fair elections at the end of this \n \n84-85 \nmonth. I am speaking, in particular, of the disbanding of the present \ngovernmental armed forces and the military wing of UNITA, of the cessation of \nthe wave of violence and intimidation provoked by the Government's \nco-signatory to the Bicesse Accords and of the formation of a national army. \nThe process of peace and democratization under way in my country, to \nwhich I have previously referred as a historic event in the life of Angola, \ncannot but have positive repercussions and effects in the international \nsphere. Associated with this is another factor of profound significance for \nthe southern region of our continent. I am referring to the negotiations \nbeing conducted in South Africa within the framework of the Convention for a \nDemocratic South Africa (CODESA), which Angola considers the most appropriate \nmeans to find a fair, lasting and satisfactory solution for all the parties \ninvolved. \nAs a result, Angola supports and shares the African position that CODESA \nshould achieve concrete objectives, such as the establishment of a \ntransitional government and the creation of mechanisms for elaborating a \nconstitution for a democratic South Africa and for holding free elections \nbased on the principle of \\\"one person, one vote\\\". \n \n86 \nI should like also to make reference to the situation in Mozambique and \nin other parts of the African continent. The Angolan people stand in \nsolidarity with our brethren in Mozambique. For that reason, my Government \nencourages the Government of Mozambique to persevere in its peace effort for \nthe country and urges the international community to give its assistance to \nthe parties involved with a view to achieving peace and national \nreconciliation. \nAnother question that still worries us is the unjust situation that \npersists in East Timor. The position of the Angolan Government is well known \nby all; we continue to defend the principle of direct negotiations between \nPortugal, as the administering Power, and Indonesia, without excluding the \npresence of the legitimate representatives of the Maubere people, so that a \ncomprehensive solution can be found, taking into consideration the aspirations \nof the Maubere people. In this context, we express our wish that the next \nmeeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia and Portugal, under \nthe auspices of the Secretary-General, will produce positive results. \nIn relation to Western Sahara, my Government supports the holding of a \nreferendum in that Territory and sincerely hopes that the obstacles that still \nexist will be removed as soon as possible. \nAngola looks with concern to the situation which prevails in the former \nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, where the short-term outlook for \nreaching a lasting peace is poor, and where the lives of innocent people are \nbeing taken. \nIn relation to the Middle East, the Angolan Government has always \nfavoured holding an international conference to reach a comprehensive solution \non the Middle East, in particular the Palestinian question. Therefore, we \nsupport the rounds of negotiations that are taking place; we hope that \nalthough there are many obstacles to overcome, the concerted efforts and the \ngood will of the parties will bring positive results and that the tragedy of \nthe Palestinian people will finally end. \nA fact which cannot but bring us satisfaction and which has our total \nsupport and encouragement is the holding of direct negotiations between Israel \nand the other parties concerned on the occupied Arab territories. We hope \nthat those negotiations will yield fully satisfactory results for the parties \nparticipating in the negotiations, and that peace will finally be restored in \nthe region. \nIn our view, whatever measure is taken, or whatever solution is advised, \nwill never be satisfactory or lasting unless it takes into account and is \nbased upon the true interests and concerns of the peoples involved. \nThe great changes that have recently taken place in the international \narena have in a certain way dictated the necessity of providing our \nOrganization with greater dynamism in taking decisions and greater efficiency \nin implementing and monitoring them. \nThe increase in the membership of the Organization, while strengthening \nit numerically, has also created the need for greater participation, on an \nequitable basis, in the various agencies of the United Nations system which \nbear mandates of fundamental importance in resolving the affairs of mankind \nwith respect to problems of peace, international security, development and \nenvironmental protection. \n \n88 \nWe hope that the work under way for the restructuring and revitalization \nof the United Nations will take our needs into consideration. Angola \nconsiders such restructuring to be opportune provided it is directed towards \neliminating mechanisms for taking action that are outdated or are no longer \nattuned to the present reality, and provided that the restructuring has as its \nfundamental objective the strengthening of the role of the Organization to the \nbenefit of all mankind. \nIn recent decades the world economic situation has swung widely in \nvarious corners of the planet. But the general trend has been towards \npolarization. As a result, while we observe an increase in economic growth \nfor the developed countries, we note a substantial decrease in growth for \ndeveloping countries. The situation in some cases is critical. \nThe second Conference of the Least Developed Countries, held at Paris in \nSeptember 1990, concluded that the economic and social situation of those \ncountries as a whole has deteriorated over the past decade, since, with very \nrare cases of better performance, the average annual growth rate was \n2.2 per cent. In many cases the rates were negative. \nFaced with this sad reality, the Conference set forth a new programme of \naction for the present decade which provides for national and international \nmeasures in favour of these countries and indicates the basic principles which \nmust orient relations between those countries and other countries and \norganizations which cooperate with them for development. In each case, \neffective implementation of that programme will require serious and profound \nreflection, and commensurate action. \n \n89 \nWith the end of the cold war, a new era has begun in which decisions on \nmatters of world interest are dealt with more and more on the basis of \nconsultation and understanding, instead of confrontation and competition. \nThis has rapidly transformed isolated cases of integration into a general \ntrend, with countries in various regions organizing themselves into more \nclosely aligned economic and political entities. \nThis trend towards the formation of larger economic blocs will inevitably \ntransform the world economically and politically. This poses a challenge for \nwhich we must be duly prepared in order to avoid deepening still further the \ngap that separates rich countries from poor countries. It is a challenge with \nrespect to which all of us, rich countries and poor, large countries and \nsmall, must make a commensurate collective effort to maintain effective, \nmultifarious international cooperation directed always towards the development \nof the parties involved, based always upon the true needs of the development \nprocess. \nHowever, certain political situations are now viewed as faits accomplis. \nor as conditions to be perpetuated. These must be the object of immediate and \nradical revision, with a view to harmonizing positions and interests, and \nweakening wide barriers that impede true cooperation between countries and \nnations separated by vast differences in their levels of economic, social, \nscientific, technical, cultural and educational development. \nIn our view, this revision should consist, inter alia, of the following \nelements: abolition of protectionist measures by developed countries that \nblock or impede access to their markets for products from underdeveloped \n \n90 \ncountries, or their limitation to those that are strictly necessary; total or \npartial cancellation by the developed countries of the underdeveloped \ncountries' external debt; in the granting of loans or credits, the imposition \nof no further conditions with respect to concomitant, mandatory adoption of \npolitical measures that are not always in keeping with the level of \ndevelopment of the beneficiary country; concessions or an increase in grace \nperiods, and rescheduling of payment; a reduction of interest rates and the \nnon-capitalization of interest; favouring of investments in nationally defined \nareas, with particular emphasis on industrial development; and transformation \nof technology and its application to development. \nThose are some of the basic aspects around which the strategy of \ninternational economic cooperation must revolve if we intend, as is our duty, \nto eliminate the poverty in which the majority of the inhabitants of our \nplanet languish. Poverty grows daily, especially in our African continent. \nIt is worsened by natural calamities that exacerbate the present grave \neconomic and social situation in Africa. \n \n91 \nAngola is a country with many natural resources. It exports petroleum, \ndiamonds, coffee and other products, and with the advent of peace we intend to \ndiversify fully our export products, in this manner participating more \neffectively in the division of international labour. \nHowever, we are concerned by the exaggerated protectionist measures \npractised by developed countries in international trade, which are manifest in \nthe unprecedented drop in the prices of raw materials and in the deterioration \nof the terms of trade, as well as the lack of success in the General Agreement \non Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiation rounds. \nAs a third world country, and with the objective of correcting the \ndistortion in its economy, Angola reformulated its socio-political situation \nwith measures which will necessarily have positive effects on the economic \nlife of the country and which are consonant with this new situation. We \nrecently adopted a Government programme of action designed to decentralize the \neconomy, liberalize trade, revitalize business, democratize the banking sector \nand encourage foreign investment. \nIn this manner, we believe that adequately carrying out this programme in \nresponse to these new conditions will permit us, as is our desire, to \nparticipate actively in international economic cooperative efforts, making our \ncontribution, to the extent possible, to the socio-economic development of \nAfrica and the world. \nAllow me to express here my country's profound interest in the need to \nprotect the environment. The Rio Conference, held in June this year, not only \nconstituted a means for an interesting exchange of experiences and viewpoints \nconcerning a most important programme but also provided a moment for \nreflection on the continuing need for coordinated efforts for the benefit of \n \n92 \nall mankind. Most certainly, the Conference allowed us to see clearly that, \ngiven current trends in scientific and technical development, any brash \nmisstep detrimental to the environment could lead to the destruction of our \nplanet. \nI wish for this reason to reaffirm here my country's commitment to \nobserve and fully apply the decisions of the Conference and to express our \nreadiness to engage in unrestricted cooperation with the international \ncommunity in undertaking all necessary steps so that we, together, can save \nthe Earth. \n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I have great pleasure in congratulating you. Sir, \nand your country, Bulgaria, on your election as President of the General \nAssembly. I should also like to express Italy's satisfaction, and my own, at \nseeing here present the delegations of the new States admitted to our \nOrganization during the past year: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Slovenia, \nTajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. May I be permitted to extend a \nparticularly warm welcome to the delegation of San Marino, a State with which \nItaly has close ties of very long standing. \nI should particularly like to express my Government's most sincere \nappreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who is \ngiving the United Nations the benefit of his wealth of experience in political \naffairs and diplomacy. Even in his first year he has already worked \ntirelessly and constructively to apply the principles which we all support and \nwhich are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. \nThe points I am about to make follow on the comments, which Italy fully \nendorses, made by the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, the current \nPresident of the European Community. \n\nSince the historic events of 1989, no General Assembly session has been \nheld, or will be held in the near future, against the same international \nbackground as the session of the previous year. Since the demise of \nbipolarism, international society has become subject to processes of \nreaggregation which are made more laborious and arduous by an array of \nhistorical, cultural, ethnic, religious and nationalistic factors. There are \ncertain groups that, wishing to assert their own specificity, are not content \nto be recognized and safeguarded within the State framework to which they \nbelong, but seek to express their own identity in the form of statehood. \nIn the East, what was once a monolithic structure has been falling apart, \nand, in some cases, is being fragmented into a multiplicity of separate \nentities, each demanding to translate its own history, culture and national \nidentity into an international personality. In the process, they are \nresorting to all available means, including conflict and violence. \nThe obstacles preventing the restoration of equilibrium are not really \nnew: they derive from factors that have long been chafing under the heavy yoke \nof dictatorship. Constrained in ideological straitjackets, they have been \nunable to engage in an open dialectic. Denied all opportunities for natural \ndevelopment, they have maintained the potential for confrontation and conflict. \n\nWith the fall of ideologies and the break-up of the Soviet empire, \nthe nightmare of a nuclear holocaust has receded. But while the spectre \nof a world war has been banished, we are still seeing a proliferation of \nlocal wars. These and the manifold antagonisms underlying them now pose a \nnew threat, particularly in geographical areas that have regained their \nfreedom but find it marred by violence and conflict and are unable to \nbuild a new structure based on tolerance and peace. \nThere are therefore hotbeds of war, signs of revolt and unresolved \nconflicts in areas formerly belonging to the Soviet empire, which is now \ndivided into a number of republics united only by tenuous economic \nrelations and very fragile political ties. \nIn Central Europe, ancient nations which have graduated from limited \nto full sovereignty are endeavouring to become pluralistic democracies \nwith a market economy.. They, too, are having their share of problems. \nAnd how can we forget the war raging in the very heart of Europe \nthe most complex, dangerous and tragic of all these conflicts and the one \nthus far untouched by all international appeals? In the territory of the \nformer Yugoslavia, and particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, bloodshed \nand strife are accompanied by violations of the dignity of the human \nperson. After the horrors of the Second World War, we had all hoped never \nagain to witness acts of discrimination and violence against those \nbelonging to a different ethnic group. \nWhat gives.us cause for pessimism is the fact that after the London \nConference a new and original experiment, which brought together round \n\nthe conference table the United Nations, represented by its \nSecretary-General, the 12 members of the European Community, the members \nof the United Nations Security Council, and representatives of Serbia and \nMontenegro, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia, and \nafter clear commitments were entered into and undertakings were even \nsigned on such matters as cessation of the violence, control over heavy \nweapons, the cessation of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" and the closure of \nconcentration camps, nothing I say nothing - has been done apart from \nsome occasional checks on heavy weapons. \nIn spite of the assurances and undertakings given by Prime Minister \nPanic, which we consider sincere and deserving of support, shooting \ncontinues in the towns and in the mountains, and planes are being shot \ndown, as in the case of an Italian aircraft carrying relief supplies. \nFour airmen died in that incident, and three French soldiers belonging to \nthe United Nations Protection Force have been killed. Many other lives \nhave been lost. A miserable winter lies ahead and people will suffer from \nhunger, cold and disease. It is now too dangerous to provide humanitarian \nassistance, and the threatened sanctions are not entirely watertight. \nCan the international community and its institutions permit this \nongoing tragedy to persist in spite of the solemn promises and pledges \nmade at high-level peace conferences? Can the perpetrators of heinous and \nodious crimes be allowed to escape international judgement, also at the \nlegal level? This question must be answered by those whose duty it is to \ndo so, including myself, in the appropriate forums. \n \nHowever, going beyond politics, I should like to reiterate an appeal \nvoiced by one of the greatest writers of this century: \n\\\"What we need today is a 'militant' humanism imbued with the \nconviction that the principles of liberty, tolerance and doubt must \nnot be exploited or defeated by a fanaticism that knows no doubts. \nIf European humanism has lost its robust capacity to review its \nideas it will end in ruin, and we will have a Europe whose name is \nno more than a geographical term.\\\" \nIn the third world, too, the end of bipolarism has eliminated for \nmany States the need to \\\"belong\\\" and to heed the dictates of a particular \nbloc, even in a non-aligned context. Crises exist also in this area, as \nin the case of Somalia, Iraq and Mozambique, although we hope to see this \nlatter crisis resolved, also as a result of Italy's mediation efforts. \nAt this point we should ask ourselves a question: Now that the gulf \nbetween East and West has been bridged, are we not about to face a rift \nbetween North and South? We must counter this danger and reactivate the \ndialogue in all possible forums and translate the concept of assistance \ninto a living reality. We should also oppose methods and procedures that \nuse development cooperation to help the economic agents of donor \ncountries; work on the basis of established programmes; ensure that \nassistance is not wrongfully diverted both in the countries of origin and \nin those of destination; and reorganize and coordinate the various sources \nof financing. Italy realizes that it has not yet reached, owing to its \nfinancial imbalances, the generous development assistance targets it had \n\nset for itself. A reorganization of the country's financial structures \nwill also facilitate a renewed effort to fulfil this pledge. \n\nNow that the Rio Conference has been held, international cooperation will \nhave to reconcile the needs of development with the equally pressing need to \nprotect the environment. Italy, which supports the establishment of the \nUnited Nations Commission for Sustainable Development, undertakes to implement \nthe Rio recommendations in an effort involving governments as well as \nnon-governmental organizations. \nChile's proposal for a world social conference, which Italy warmly \nsupports, opens up yet another important field of endeavour for the United \nNations. \nIn surveying this new international scene, we have no reason to lament or \nregret the passing of the bipolar structure of the world. We cannot forget \nthat we paid for the containment of a global threat with a peace guaranteed by \nthe menace of nuclear war, by the denial of freedom to millions of human \nbeings, by violations of the fundamental rights of man and by the inaction of \na society that destroyed resources, stunted the growth of its own leadership \nand is now posing the same old problems in a more acute form. \nThe ideological confrontation has ended with the downfall of the largest \nideological system in our history, the communist system, but now that this \nideology has collapsed, problems have remained in individual nations and in \nthe world as a whole. The names of these problems are hunger, disease, \nenvironmental degradation and political instability. It would indeed be an \nirreversible defeat for mankind were the world of affluence, production and \nconsumption of our generation to confuse the downfall of ideologies with the \ncollapse of all values and if it were to forget that in every national \nsociety, and particularly in relations between the industrialized world and \n\nthe developing countries, the two concepts of solidarity and interdependence \nneed to be translated into political action. \nAn example of this need is provided by the problem of Somalia. This \ncountry tragically illustrates the total detachment and lack of concern shown \nby the affluent societies towards countries plagued by poverty and disease, \nbut the fate of this country also exemplifies the harm caused to people by \nprolonged power struggles that are never resolved. The country is divided in \nhalf. The capital, Mogadishu, is also divided, and like other population \ncentres lacks essential services. The people are suffering from malnutrition \nand their health is in jeopardy. Armed youths, some no older than 14, are \ndefending the territory by violent means. They do not attend school because \nthey are unable to do so. We must gratefully acknowledge the initiative taken \nby the United Nations and its Secretary-General in sending a Special \nRepresentative, Ambassador Sahnoun, who is doing outstanding work in the field \nof humanitarian assistance and in the service of peace. \nI myself paid a two-day visit to the capital and parts of the interior. \nI found assistance facilities deplorable, and I spoke individually with the \npersons who have the power to make war or peace in an effort to promote peace \ninitiatives. Anyone, regardless of region or religious affiliation, who is \nable to assist in the peace process must do so, because Somalia needs \nguidance, partners and, in short, a government. We must therefore give urgent \nattention to the need for an international initiative involving organizations \nand countries able to contribute to the pacification and reconstruction of \nSomalia, with the active participation of the United Nations. \nAt this point, I should like to emphasize one of the most delicate and \nproblematical, but also most promising points of contact between North and \n\nSouth, namely, the Mediterranean. Italy is currently following, in a spirit \nof optimism and active support, the promising developments in the peace \nprocess designed to end the Arab-Israeli conflict and provide a solution to \nthe Palestinian question. Italy is aware that this hoped-for solution should \nalso lead to the removal of a burden that has jeopardized the prospects for \npromoting a climate of peace and collaboration in the Mediterranean. Our \nexpectations, which, we believe, are shared by the entire international \ncommunity, thus extend beyond the vital objective of achieving mutual \nacceptance between all the peoples of the Middle East and look forward to a \nfuture characterized by sincere commitment to the process of dialogue and \ncooperation in the economic as well as in other fields in order to build peace. \nIn trying today to identify possible means of reconstituting the \ninternational order, we find that regional groupings can play a unifying role, \nwhether they follow the path of integration or confine themselves to close \ncooperation in the economic field, in foreign policy or in security matters.* \nIn Western Europe, we have built and tested structures that have brought \nabout a phenomenon quite different from the situation now prevailing in the \ntroubled Eastern part of the continent. \n\nThe need to defend democracy, the vast scope of economic development, \nspurred by technological progress, and the necessity of preserving the values \nof European culture and history, so that Europe can again play a major role in \ninternational society have led us to attach less importance to the theory and \npractice that nations must necessarily take the form of States. They \nphenomena have shown us that large areas of State sovereignty can be \nadministered jointly in a supranational context and that such a link can also \nmake war impossible. The process is certainly not an easy one, because it \nmust be achieved through consensus and because obstacles, as we have seen in \nthe last few days, crop up at every turn. \nEuropean integration has repeatedly proved capable of overcoming the \ndifficulties it has encountered. It is a mistake to speak, as some have done \nrecently, of delays or setbacks in the process of further integration \nestablished at Maastricht. At their meeting held here in New York, the \nForeign Ministers of the Community took note of the positive outcome of the \nFrench referendum and reaffirmed their determination to ratify the Treaty \nwithin the time stipulated without renegotiating it. \nThe phenomenon of European integration can be seen as an attractive \nexample and also as a factor for re-aggregation and stability in Central and \nEastern Europe. In this context, the Commonwealth of Independent States could \nbe a stabilizing element in so far as it can offer its former components valid \nprospects for association. \nA significant link between various components of the European continent \nis provided by the Central European Initiative, which Italy continues to \nsupport. \nIn the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), nations both large and \nsmall have gained the conviction that war can never again be a means of \n\nsolving problems between them. That alliance has now formed an association in \nthe framework of the North Atlantic Council with countries that were formerly \nits adversaries. \nSince Helsinki II, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe \n(CSCE) has been setting up institutional machinery to assist it in better \nperforming its tasks. \nExamples of integration are to be found not only in Europe but on every \ncontinent, and they encompass a variety of forms, ranging from the more tried \nand tested institutions, such as the Andean Pact and the Association of \nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), to more recent initiatives, such as the \ncommon market of four South American countries (MERCOSUR), or completely new \ndevelopments, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Also \nvery important are the new forms of cooperation in certain specific and highly \nsensitive areas, such as the nuclear sector. The recent agreement between \nArgentina and Brazil would appear to be very promising. \nThe formation of regional associations is a course worth pursuing and an \neffective means of strengthening international society. The United Nations \nmight find this a useful means of consolidating the peace. \nThe problems in whose solution the United Nations will increasingly be \ninvolved deal not only with relations between States but also with their \ninternal structure and their components in terms of minorities and ethnic \ngroups. Italy does not have an answer, but it does have concrete experience \nto contribute to the international community: the solution to the Alto Adige \nproblem. That dispute between Italy and Austria, which was brought before the \nUnited Nations in the period 1960-1961, was officially brought to a conclusion \nlast June. That conclusion came as a result of a lengthy process involving \nthe elaboration and application at the national level of a package of measures \n\nadopted by Italy in consultation with the representatives of the \nGerman-speaking population of Alto Adige. Those measures cover all aspects of \ncivilian life and provide one of the most progressive examples of minority \nprotection in Europe. \nWe feel that the settlement of that issue proves that autonomy, when \nadequately guaranteed by domestic legal provisions, serves to strengthen \nrather than weaken harmony in a national setting, while also promoting \ngood-neighbourly relations and international cooperation across borders. \nThere is no doubt that in the changed conditions in which we are living \nthe United Nations will have greater responsibility and will therefore need \ngreater authority and more effective means of performing its mission; hence \nthe discussions concerning a \\\"new United Nations\\\", that is, an Organization \ncapable of moving in new directions to satisfy the widely felt need for some \nkind of world order or government. \nIt is the members of the Assembly that, in conformity with the Charter \nand in fulfilment of the obligations deriving from it, must assume the status \nand responsibility not only of peace-loving countries, but also of States that \nrenounce the use of force as a means of settling international disputes and \nconsider the protection of human rights to be an inescapable duty. \n\nWe welcome the appearance of a new and compelling document which should \nserve as a basis for discussion in the Organization. I am referring once \nagain to \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", the Secretary-General's report on preventive \ndiplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping. Preventive diplomacy should be a \nmeans of defusing potential conflicts before they reach the critical threshold \nof a confrontation. \nThis preventive approach calls also for prompt steps to guarantee \nthrough mechanisms contemplated in General Assembly resolution 46/36 L the \ntransparency of international arms transfers and of their production. The \nsame applies to the convention banning chemical weapons, which has finally \nbeen submitted to the Assembly for approval and which will institute a global \nmonitoring system with unprecedented powers of on-site verification. \nPeace-keeping must now be approached and applied today in innovative ways \nso as to make more effective the linkage between action to prevent a \nsharpening of armed conflict and the search for negotiated solutions. \nIt is also worth giving in-depth consideration to the possibility of \nusing \\\"peace-enforcement\\\" units, not just to perform the tasks of traditional \npeace-keeping forces, in other words to intervene where a cease-fire exists, \nbut in order to restore and maintain it. \nLastly, a new need arises from the existing conflicts, the need to \nsupplement peace-keeping and peacemaking instruments by providing adequate \nmilitary protection for humanitarian assistance efforts. \nIn order to cope with all these requirements we will need adequate \nstructures and resources. Also, Italy along the lines here illustrated by \nthe French Foreign Minister is prepared to give its own concrete \ncontribution, as it has proved with its recent offer of men and equipment \nformulated in the framework of the Yugoslav crisis. \n\nThe situation of former Yugoslavia also highlights the importance of the \nregional dimension in pursuing \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". It now seems that the \noption of a regional solution for regional conflicts as provided in the \nCharter could be effectively applied in a variety of ways in a kind of \nvariable geometry of peace. An important example is the format of the London \nConference, which I have already mentioned. Here the regional dimension is \nnot an alternative to United Nations involvement; it also operates on the \nbasis of a creative formula for the sharing of responsibilities. \nThe United Nations system in any case seems destined increasingly to rely \nin practice on regional organizations - ranging from the Organization of \nAmerican States (OAS) to the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the \nConference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and communities, \nalliances or unions of States, as is the case for the European Community, the \nWestern European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in \nthe Yugoslav situation. \nImportant new developments compel us also to rethink the limitations on \nthe application of certain traditional concepts and principles underlying \ninternational relations. To rethink certainly does not mean to reject. It \nmeans avoiding all rigid and absolute definitions and interpreting principles \nin such a way as to preclude unbalanced applications that are bound to be in \nconflict. \nWe may note, for example, that at the urging of a collective conscience \nthat now knows no boundaries the principle of non-interference in the domestic \naffairs of States is being increasingly reviewed in the light of the grave \ndangers threatening the survival of entire population groups. It is also \nclear that if every ethnic, religious or language group were to claim its own \nState there would be endless fragmentation and, consequently, instability. \n\nFrom the discussions held during the first few days of the session it is \nbecoming increasingly clear that all Members of the Organization agree in \ntheir evaluation of the central role regained by the United Nations. We all \nseem to realize that this strengthening of the United Nations will require not \nonly the assignment of new roles but also the provision of adequate powers and \nresources. The alternative would be the anti-historical reconstitution of an \noligarchy made up of those countries having the greatest capacity for \nunilaterally assuming the role of guarantors of international legality. \nWe must protect the United Nations new capacity for action with greater \nvigilance and a keen sense of responsibility without becoming entrenched in \npositions that would preclude future institutional development. \nItaly, along other countries, has already stated that the question of \nrevising certain parts of the Charter relating to matters such as the \ncomposition of the Security Council must be adequately debated. We still \nbelieve that the Council could be made more authoritative and representative \nby increasing the number of temporary and permanent members, choosing the \nlatter on the basis of objective criteria. \nItaly will also assert its aspiration for a more adequate representation \nin the Security Council at that moment, unless institutional developments in \nthe European Union will not allow at a certain stage the institution of a \nEuropean seat in the Security Council. \nI should like to conclude by observing that the United Nations has the \nmain responsibility for handling the difficult yet exciting international \ndevelopments we are now witnessing. It will do so with tools of crisis \nmanagement that are suitable to the world of today, a world in which it is \n\nbecoming increasingly necessary to accept limitations in the area of national \nsovereignty, guaranteed by the objectivity of a supranational collective \nsystem, by using political instruments and procedures wherever possible, or by \napplying coercive measures if they are needed. \n \nWhat needs to be preserved are the aims of the Charter, which continue to \nbe not only valid but indeed essential. But in a world that is now quite \ndifferent from the world of 1945, the transformation of which began to \naccelerate in 1989, it would be unthinkable to suggest that we should avoid \ntaking speedy and courageous action to devise new instruments, change our \nthinking and review the powers and composition of United Nations organs. Only \nby maintaining a fruitful polarity between permanent goals and new \ninstruments, to which we must all contribute, will we be able to meet the \nchallenges of our times. \n"

        "file_text": "In addressing the \nGeneral Assembly this afternoon from this rostrum, I should like first of all \nto offer Mr. Ganev my warmest congratulations on his unanimous election as \nPresident for the forty-seventh session. His great experience is \nunquestionably a most valuable assurance for the international community \nduring this tumultuous period in the world, a world which is seeking peace, \nsecurity and well-being. He can count on the strong support and the full \ncooperation of the Chadian delegation, which it is my privilege to head. \nAmbassador Samir Shihabi, his predecessor, won our admiration with the \ntact and skill with which he handled the serious questions that arose during \nthe period of his mandate. We express to him our fullest appreciation for his \nvaluable contribution. \n \nLess than 10 months after the beginning of his term of office, the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has put his stamp on the \nOrganization and has been called upon to play a role of growing importance in \nthe life of free peoples and nations. We wish him ever-greater successes and \noffer him our support in the execution of his weighty duties. We have no \ndoubt he will discharge his tasks with his well-known skill and tenacity. \nI should also like to extend a warm welcome to the new Members of the \nOrganization. Their presence here cannot but strengthen the universality of \nthe United Nations, the goal of whose founding fathers was to bring together \nall peoples, put an end to the scourge of war and other forms of conflict, and \nabove all to ensure socio-economic development and fraternity among men. \nAt the last session of the General Assembly my delegation set forth the \nchanges that had taken place in Chadian politics. We announced the enactment \nof the law on the conditions for the creation and functioning of political \nparties in the framework of pluralistic democracy and on the holding of a \nnational sovereign conference scheduled for May 1992. It goes without saying \nthat a meeting of such crucial importance for the future of the country had to \nbe most carefully and rigorously prepared if optimum results were to be \nachieved. Thus, it was not possible to convene the conference on the \nscheduled date because the commission in charge of preparations for it did not \nsubmit its conclusions in time. \nToday I am in a position to announce from this rostrum that the Chad's \nnational sovereign conference will take place during the first quarter of \n1993, at the latest. This is a solemn commitment and one that has been \nrepeatedly reaffirmed. Similarly, I reiterate here and now that the \ndemocratic process under way in my country is irreversible. \n\nLooking forward to this important date, and with a desire to bring \ntogether the largest possible number of our fellow citizens in the daily \nmanagement of the affairs of the State, President Idriss Deby decided, after \nlong consultations, to modify the National Charter which has governed Chad \nsince 4 March 1991. On this basis, Mr. Joseph Yodoyman, a member of the \nopposition, has been appointed Prime Minister and Head of Government. The new \nGovernment includes both representatives of the opposition parties and \nrepresentatives of ordinary citizens. This forward-looking government has set \nfor itself the objective of pursuing the orientation plan presented to the \ndonors and sponsors of Chad in Geneva in June 1990. Stress has been laid on \ndisengagement of the State, privatization, liberalization of the economy and \nsector-based development, with priority given to competence and experience in \nthe administration and to maintaining a dialogue with our social partners. \nLike many other countries on the continent, Chad is confronting an \nunprecedented economic and financial crisis. To deal with the crisis, the \nGovernment adopted a number of measures to stabilize public finances. These \nmeasures included: an increase in individual income taxes; a 50 per cent \ndecrease in compensation given to all governmental and related workers; a \n10 to 20 per cent reduction in indexed income; a 20 per cent reduction in \nlump-sum income; a 10 per cent reduction of the numbers working in public \nadministration; and a reduction in State spending. These measures, which \naffect workers in both the public and the private sectors, encountered the \nvigorous opposition of the trade unions, leading to days of strikes in May, \nJune, July and August 1992. \nAlthough the strikes were conducted lawfully, the Government had no \nchoice but to maintain these measures, the overriding necessity of which was \nrepeatedly underscored in the face of limited national resources. To make it \n\npossible for these measures to have effect, the Government is at the present \ntime negotiating with social partners a social truce that will apply to the \nrest of the year. \nThe Chadian people, officials and agents of the public and private \nsectors have a moral obligation to endure these sacrifices if they are to be \nable to look forward to the future with greater hope and serenity. With a \nview to reducing expenditures and establishing balance, the Government is \npursuing its programme of restructuring the army. In this respect a protocol \nagreement has been signed with France which should make it possible to reduce \nthe army from 50,000 to 25,000 men and to integrate all forces into a truly \nnational army. This means that the French Government is giving us technical \nand financial assistance in this tremendous undertaking. \nIn connection with this programme, my country has not lost sight of \nquestions of security at the regional level, and we have taken part in \nsubregional cooperative meetings in this regard. At the initiative of the \n10 States members of Central Africa, the United Nations General Assembly \nadopted by consensus on 6 December 1991 resolution 46/37 B entitled \\\"Regional \nconfidence-building measures\\\". In keeping with this resolution, on \n28 May 1992 the Secretary-General of the United Nations announced the creation \nof the Permanent Consultative Committee on Questions of Security in Central \nAfrica. The Committee is charged with developing confidence-building \nmeasures, promoting the limitation of armaments and furthering development in \nthe subregion of Africa. From 27-30 July 1992, in Yaounde, Cameroon, the \nCommittee held its organizational meeting at the ministerial level, with the \nassistance of the Office of Disarmament Affairs of the United Nations \nDepartment of Political Affairs. In its final report on this meeting, the \n\nCommittee laid down, among other measures within the framework of \npeace-building, assistance for restructuring the army and providing new job \ntraining to military personnel. We place tremendous hopes in the results of \nthis meeting and expect eventually to benefit from this assistance as we \nendeavour completely to reorganize our army. \nDuring the most critical periods of its history Chad has always enjoyed \nthe invaluable support of the international community, and the Chadian people \nand Government are particularly grateful for this. Today again we urge all \nour partners to help us to carry out our ongoing stabilization programmes, and \nto stimulate economic activity in the country. These programmes have been \nlaid down in a political context that has not always been conducive to the \nprocess of democratization that had been begun. Indeed, there have been here \nand there pockets of resistance to change, leading to instances of rebellion \nthat have been put down thanks to the Government's policy of reaching out and \npromoting dialogue. Several peace agreements have thus been signed with \nrebellious movements, with the support of friendly countries, which deserve \nour heartfelt gratitude. \nOur joy at the ending of the cold war, which led to the beginning of a \nfruitful dialogue in the Security Council, is matched by our concern at a \nresurgence of certain problems such as injustice, ultranationalism, racism and \nreligious fundamentalism, all of which are potential sources of conflict. The \nChadian delegation would like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his report, \\\"An Agenda for \nPeace\\\", which gives us valuable guidelines towards achieving a more secure, \npeaceful and just world. \nBut, as I said, there remain many sources of potential concern. In \nEurope, for example, an area that had been spared violent upheavals thus far/ \n\nwe are now helplessly witnessing a situation that defies the conscience of the \nworld. The breakup of the former Yugoslavia could have led to relationships \nother than those based on war, particularly since the birth of that country \nhad been accompanied by much suffering. We denounce practices such as \\\"ethnic \ncleansing\\\", a notion we had thought definitively eradicated from the language \nof modern nations. Chad believes that, whether in the States that have \nemerged from the former Yugoslavia or elsewhere, our conduct should be guided \nby the hallowed principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of \nall other related instruments. \nOn the other hand, the Chadian delegation welcomes the evolution of the \nsituation in Cambodia and expresses the hope that this most ambitious \noperation undertaken by the United Nations will be successfully concluded, as \nis so ardently desired by the international community and by the Cambodian \npeople, who have suffered long enough. \nTurning now to the situation in the Middle East and Palestine, my \ndelegation observes that the process which began last year in Madrid has \ncontinued towards a lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli crisis. The results \nof the Washington meetings, however, have fallen short of expectations. While \nwe believe that a certain dynamism emerged, this will lead to success only if \nthe relevant United Nations resolutions are taken into account in good faith \nthus showing a clear determination to restore peace and security in that part \nof the world. \nEven if the end of the confrontation between the two blocs has led to \ncertain bright spots in Africa, with the logic of peace at work in Angola and \nMozambique, even if democratization has made considerable progress, peace and \nharmony are not yet at home in many parts of the continent. \n\nFor example, in South Africa, notwithstanding the positive initiatives of \nthe minority Government, we must continue to condemn manoeuvres aimed at \nsetting some peoples against others in an attempt to justify a system that \nbelongs to another age. The international community must bring sustained \npressure to bear to ensure that the vestiges of primitive racism will yield to \na democratic, multiracial and egalitarian South African society. \nMy country also deplores the break-up of the Somalian nation as a result \nof the appetites of certain warlords there. It is high time that we put an \nend to this abominable carnage whose victims are always the same: women and \nchildren. \nWe strongly support the current initiatives of the Organization of \nAfrican Unity, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the \nUnited Nations, and we urge the heads of the Somali factions to sit down at \nthe negotiating table and try to put an end to the terrible tragedy of the \nSomali people. \nLiberia symbolizes the freedom of the black man. For the past two years \nit has been bogged down in a war that has taken a heavy toll in human lives \nand economic infrastructure. We appeal to the sense of responsibility of the \nprimary leaders of that country and urge them to heed the voice of reason. \nCivil war in the last decade of the twentieth century is a major \nchallenge to the constantly expressed desire for peace and security. In the \nrecent past Chad has experienced internal crises, so we are hardly in a \nposition to preach to anyone. But we still believe that a sincere commitment \nto disarmament or rigorous control of the transfer of conventional weapons, \nwhich are flooding zones of tension or open conflict, is an absolute necessity. \nMy delegation welcomes the opening of the Register on Conventional Arms \nestablished by the Secretary-General. However, we have no illusions as long as \n\nthere are secret sales of weapons, which are a source of income for certain \nsuppliers and a means of acquiring power for the many beneficiaries. \nIf today, with a degree of optimism, everybody could agree there is a \nreal desire for change and progress in the world with regard to democracy and \nhuman rights, the economic situation in many developing countries of Africa, \nLatin America and Asia remains particularly disturbing notwithstanding some \nprogress that has been made. The cold statistics of the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, the World Bank and the United Nations give us food for \nthought. The economic situation of the developing countries requires urgent \nsolutions. \nAs was stressed by the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali at \nthe eighth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, \n\\\"The economic crisis that results from weakening investments and the slow \ngrowth of democratic institutions has threatened the national stability \nof these countries and their political future. Zones of poverty, which \nfar from beginning absorbed are only spreading, are potential sources of \nviolence and confrontation. The proof has already been given that these \nareas could flare up in ethnic, tribal or national conflicts. Therefore \nlasting development is an essential factor in the establishment of world \npeace and stability, which is undeniably in the mutual interest of all \nthe members of the international community, whether developed or \ndeveloping.\\\" \nMy delegation supports that analysis, and we urge the international \ncommunity to implement without delay the various instruments that have been \nadopted thus far, in particular the Declaration on International Economic \nCo-operation, more specifically the growth the development of the developing \ncountries. \n\nIf there is one question that is of concern to all the members of the \ninternational community, it is the challenge of the environment. My country \nis located in a Sahelian area and daily witnesses the deterioration of its \nenvironment, so we attach special importance to this question at both the \nnational and regional levels. However, the universality of the question means \nthat it can be tackled only within the framework of international co-operation \nbased on interdependence and solidarity. While we welcomed the Rio Conference \non the Environment and Development, we still believe that its results will not \nput an end to the many and varied threats to the environment if real substance \nis not given to the concept of sustainable development. \nOver the past few years human rights have played a preponderant role in \nthe lives of nations. New concepts that are still vaguely defined have \nemerged. However, political pluralism alone will not solve all the problems \nof more than half of mankind. That is why we hope that at the 1993 Conference \nall questions concerning human rights will be tackled. \nThe United Nations is revived and refreshed as a result of the end of the \nera of confrontation between the super-Powers. The Organization has recorded \nastounding successes in such varied fields as decolonization and the \nmaintenance of international peace and security thanks to the Blue Helmets who \nare scattered around the world, notwithstanding the difficulties that have \nbeen encountered in implementing the ideals of the Charter. \nOne such ideal is the need for solidarity among peoples, and that \nsolidarity can be realized only if we take into account the elementary needs \nof those who are destitute. On the threshold of the twenty-first century, men \nmust show that, having avoided a nuclear holocaust, they are now capable of \nbuilding a universal peace through development."

        "file_text": "Please accept Latvia's congratulations on your election to the \npresidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly, Sir. The \npeople of Latvia wish you a successful term as its leader. \nLatvia wishes to pay its respects to those nation States which have \nrecently been admitted to the United Nations and looks forward to cooperation \nwith them. \nMore than a year has passed since the Republic of Latvia, with the \nsupport of the world's democracies, restored its independence. This past year \nhas been characterized by the renewal of our State institutions. The \nrestoration of independence is a complicated process during which we have \nlearned from our mistakes. Our own experience and that of other nations has \ncontributed to making the transition process more effective. \nThe goal of independent Latvia to become a democratic free market \nState has not changed. Unchanged also are Latvia's efforts simultaneously to \n\nfind an optimal solution to two acute and unavoidable problems: the \ncorrection of the injustices fostered by the illegal occupation and the \nprotection of the rights of all residents of Latvia. \nThe majority of States never recognized the annexation of Latvia. This \nwas of vital significance for the restoration of our independence. It is only \nnow that we have begun fully to understand the complexity of our situation. \nThe stabilization and development of our independence is largely dependent on \nthe objectivity with which the consequences of the former colonial policies \nare evaluated and on the manner in which they are eliminated. \nI would even say that in the recent past the restoration of independence \nin the Baltic States was of the utmost importance for security and stability \nin Europe. Today the international appraisal of the consequences of the \nannexation is just as crucial. A flawed approach to this question, which \nwould legitimize these consequences, could severely destabilize the political \nsituation in Latvia. \nBut now I invite representatives to take a fundamental and unprejudiced \nlook at the consequences of the half-century-long illegal incorporation of \nLatvia into the Soviet empire. \nForeign military troops are still stationed on the territory of Latvia. \nMoreover, the Latvian Government has been denied the right to monitor these \nforces. The lack of control over this army, its sometimes chaotic \ndemobilization, and its wilful and covert merging with economic enterprises \nand civil institutions in Latvia, create the threat of unsupervised arms \ntransfers, even to international markets. \n\nToday there is no other nation State in the world with as many active or \nretired military persons per civilian as in Latvia. Our small nation has been \npressured to provide social guarantees, including living accommodation, to the \nmilitary forces of a great Power upon their withdrawal from Latvia. \nMeanwhile, Latvians who were deported to Siberia on a mass scale in 1941 and \n1949 are still unable to find housing in their homeland. Latvians who fled to \nthe West as a result of oppression by the former occupation regime, and who \nnow wish to return to their native land, are also unable to find accommodation. \nThe great neighbouring Power also attempts to determine the political \nbasis of our State the composition of its body of citizens. \nWe welcome the adherence of the Russian Federation to the Helsinki \nDocument of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, particularly \nparagraph 15, in which the participating States committed themselves to end the \n\\\"stationing of foreign armed forces on the territories of the Baltic \nStates without the required consent of those countries.\\\" (A/47/361. \nannex, para. 15) \nIn our turn, we can affirm the willingness of Latvia to see that the \ncommitment expressed in this paragraph is fulfilled in our negotiations with \nthe Russian Federation. Unfortunately, to date we have not seen similar \ninterest on the part of Russia. \nIt is a matter of concern that the view has been expressed in the \nParliament of the Russian Federation that the agreement already concluded on \nthe withdrawal of troops from Lithuania should be annulled. In the \nnegotiations with Latvia, the Russian delegation is constantly changing its \nposition even on matters previously agreed upon. \n\nTherefore Latvia, together with Estonia and Lithuania, requested that the \nissue of the complete withdrawal of foreign military forces be included on the \nagenda of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Latvia also \ninvites the Security Council to send observers to the negotiations with the \nRussian Federation, and is looking forward to the other party's consent. \nAside from the serious issue of foreign military forces in Latvia, one of \nthe most serious consequences of the annexation of Latvia is the dangerous \nalteration of the demographic situation as a result of forced migration and \nthe Soviet Union's colonial policies. \nIn the last 50 years no other State has had its indigenous population \nreduced to the status of a near minority as a result of both immigration and \nthe loss of a large part of its indigenous population during occupations by \ntwo criminal regimes. Communist and Nazi. Latvia must now devote great \nefforts to preserving its State language, the major component of Latvian \nculture and heritage. \nAnother truth is becoming more transparent. We cannot utilize only \nexisting schemes and models to solve our internal problems. Our unique \ndemographic situation requires us to solve the citizenship question with \nrespect to immigrants on the one hand, to create a secure environment to \npreserve our national identity, and on the other to give immigrants every \nopportunity to integrate into Latvia's society while preserving and developing \ntheir own languages and cultural traditions. \nThe State of Latvia, of course, is interested in expanding its body of \ncitizens, but not with retired officers of the former Soviet army who, even \nnow, do not recognize the independence of Latvia. There are other States from \n\nwhich the armed forces of the former Soviet Union are being withdrawn but the \npossibility of granting the citizenship of these States to former Soviet \nofficers has not been an issue. \nThe current domestic debate suggests that the Latvian Parliament adopt a \nlaw on citizenship in which the principal criteria for granting citizenship \nwould be a 10-year residency and a basic knowledge of Latvian. Such a law, if \naccepted by a referendum of citizens, would have legal force. Currently, all \npermanent residents of Latvia are being registered and are being given the \nopportunity freely to declare their intention to become citizens of Latvia or \nto remain citizens of another State which is their country of birth. \nFurthermore, the laws of Latvia guarantee, according to international \nstandards, each individual's human rights, which quite frequently, consciously \nor unconsciously, are confused with the right to citizenship. \nSome political forces in Latvia have requested that decolonization \npolicies be carried out. The notion of a colonized country in \ntwentieth-century Europe may seem strange. However, an examination of \nevidence provided by 50 years of annexation suggests the possible validity of \nthis notion. \nWhen referring to decolonization, in no case do we imply that all \nimmigrants must or will leave Latvia. However, our internal situation \nrequires clarity on the very important question of who must leave Latvia. \nFirst, the former Soviet military forces must leave. Secondly, all those \nforeign citizens to whom the existence of an independent Latvia is \nunacceptable must leave. Thirdly, those who wish to live among members of a \nsingle ethnic group, in Russia or elsewhere, will leave on their own \ninitiative. However, the great majority of immigrants will stay in Latvia, \nand our desire is that they be integrated into our society. \n\nIn regard to the protection of human rights in Latvia, we wish to follow \nexamples found in independent and democratic States: the indigenous people, \nLatvians, should have the same rights as similar groups in other States, \nwhereas minority and immigrant groups should have cultural autonomy, including \nopportunities to use and develop their language. \nWe reject the accusations, made here by the Russian Federation, that the \nrights of minorities are being violated in Latvia. We are ready to have our \nhuman rights situation examined by experts of the Commission on Human Rights. \nWe are linking our hopes with the experiences of States that have \ntravelled the road of decolonization, and from these States we expect \nunderstanding and support. The economic reforms, which have brought good \nresults to many of these States, are very attractive and can be used by us. \nThe situation in the world, especially in Europe, is changing \nqualitatively. In the past, the world order was dictated by the great \nPowers or, to be more precise, by military-political blocs created by the \ngreat Powers. For better or for worse, this system worked, even if through \nmutual fear rather than mutual trust. \nThe stated goal of the former world order was the maintenance of world \npeace and stability. Contradictory or delayed actions are not the best means \nof increasing stability. The international recognition of Slovenia, Croatia \nand Bosnia and Herzegovina was delayed precisely because of such \nconsiderations; the tragic consequences of such a delay are still with us \ntoday. \n\nIn international relations there exist problems of yet a different \nnature, problems related to the unification of nations as well as to the \nrepresentation in the world community of sovereign parts of a divided nation. \nThe Government of the Republic of China in Taiwan has been created by the \ntides of history. In our opinion, the international community has been unfair \nin ignoring this fact. Does not international experience bear evidence that \nparticipation in the international community by two sovereign parts of one \nnation provides an opportunity for a productive dialogue between these parts? \nThe United Nations must pay attention to the problems of both large and \nsmall States. In our opinion, the security of small States should be a \ncentral concern of the Organization, since there does not exist a balance of \npower or agreement on goals between small States and their larger neighbours \nat this time. \nIn my opinion, when discussing the relationships between nations, one \nmust remember that there are neither great nor small nations. A nation is \nonly as great as its will. Large and small States, however, can be equally \nfree even if not equally powerful. \nWe place high hopes in the United Nations. \nLatvia values highly the documents of the United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development, in particular \\\"Agenda 21\\\". We therefore \nreiterate our proposal, first made at Rio de Janeiro, that a conference be \nconvened in Latvia on the subject of \\\"Disarmament for Environment\\\". We ask \nthe United Nations and all States for their support. \nLatvia is grateful for the support received from the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP). A UNDP representative now resides in Riga and \nassists the Latvian Government in the preparation of projects on technical \nassistance. \n\nA matter of great importance to Latvia, from the viewpoint both of respect \nfor our sovereignty and of our capacity to pay, is the determination of the \nassessment rate for the contribution of Latvia to the regular budget, a rate \nthat will in turn determine our total contribution to the United Nations \nsystem. Respect for our sovereignty requires that the assessment be \ndetermined on the basis of data accepted by Latvia itself, rather than on data \nprovided by the State Statistical Committee of the former Soviet Union in \nparticular, because it is not and never has been the position of Latvia that \nit is a successor to the rights and obligations of the former Soviet Union. \nLatvia unequivocally supports the statement adopted at the first summit \nmeeting of the Security Council that the Secretary-General be invited to study \nmethods of strengthening and making more effective the capacity of the United \nNations for preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping. We support \nefforts that will decrease threats to the maintenance of international peace \nand security and to our own sovereignty. Regrettably, in the presence of the \ninternal instability of large neighbouring States, the security of small \nStates is not guaranteed. Latvia would support the granting of authority to \nthe Secretary-General to use not only diplomacy against aggression but force \nas well. Of course, it will be necessary to create and approve a legal basis \nas well as a mechanism for the implementation of such authority. \nWe shall always be responsible to our nation for observing United Nations \nlegal norms and principles. Were we to fail in meeting our responsibilities, \nwe would not excuse ourselves by reference to our limited political \nexperience, nor to our economic problems. It is our hope that no State will \nuse its size or its economic and military power as an excuse for ignoring \nUnited Nations standards. \n\nLatvia values highly the report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", the inspiration \nfor, and author of, which was the Secretary-General. Latvia hopes that United \nNations support for the rightful demand to withdraw foreign military forces \nwill be evidence of the good will of world opinion and a good example of \npreventive diplomacy. \n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure, on behalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates, to extend to you. Sir, sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. We are confident that your vast experience in the area of international relations will enhance the role of the Organization and promote its goals. \n(Mr. Al-Nuaimi. United Arab Emirates!\nHe wish to express our gratitude for, and our deep appreciation of the tireless efforts of your predecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi, during his tenure as President of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session, which was characterized by many constructive achievements.\nThis session represents a historic turning-point in the enhancement of the universality of the United Nations. Hence, we believe that the admission of the new States Members will strengthen the role of the Organization, especially in the current international situation, and we reiterate our commitment to cooperation with all States in maintaining international peace and security.\nI take this occasion to reaffirm our confidence in and our support for the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to contain existing problems and to find peaceful solutions thereto within the context of a strengthened role for the Organization in consolidating the basis of international peace and security.\nAs we approach the beginning of a new century, the United Nations passes through a very delicate phase that will have far-reaching effects on the nature and course of international relations. One of the most outstanding features of that phase is the disappearance of bipolarity and its attendant phenomena. This is a development that ushers in a new era whose principal characteristic is that most countries of the world, particularly the major Powers, now resort to the United Nations, thus strengthening the Organization and enhancing the effectiveness of the role envisioned for it by the Charter. Consequently, the Organization has become the appropriate forum for resolving regional conflicts and maintaining international peace and security.\nOver the past few years, the world has been witnessing the emergence of a new world order after which every nation has been aspiring. We in the United Arab Emirates welcome this development and consider that it is positive in its basis, substance and goals, as, in our view, it will promote cooperation towards the building of a better future of respect for the rights of nations and equality between States, freedom and independence for all peoples and the peaceful settlement of disputes.\nMy country, proceeding from its traditions, cultural values and history, firmly believes in the United Nations Charter. We also support the organs of the United Nations as well as the peaceful means prescribed in the Charter for \nthe settlement of inter-State disputes, and reject violence as a means of settling such disputes.\nIn spite of the optimism created by the recent changes in the world and the constructive role played by the United Nations in creating an environment of peace, there is still a number of problems that endanger international peace and security and require a great deal of hard work. Moreover, the new spirit of detente that pervades world politics does not mean necessarily that we now live in a world of absolute harmony. The security of small nations is still threatened, in the still existing maelstrom of regional conflicts, by the dangers arising from the ambitions of those States that still seek hegemony and expansion at the expense of their neighbors. This, of course, contravenes the principles of the United Nations Charter, undermines the rule of international law and runs counter to the desire of the international community to live in peace and to resolve disputes by dialog, peacefully. Consequently, we must take the appropriate collective measures that are capable of preventing those who wish to create situations that threaten international peace and security from perpetrating such actions. Such an undertaking on our part would be compatible with the new international realities especially now when we are on the verge of turning a new leaf and ushering in a new era of international relations based on peaceful coexistence and mutual respect. One of the most important lessons history has been teaching us since the Second World War is that aggression does not pay and that we must forswear the use of force to achieve political expansionist goals. It is indeed the responsibility of the United Nations to focus attention on this lesson and to translate it into concrete action through the exercise of a collective will that is capable of deterring aggression and warding off the grave dangers which threaten international peace and security.\nOver the past few years, the Gulf region has witnessed grave events, from the Iran-Iraq war to the Iraqi aggression against the sisterly State of Kuwait. These events had deleterious effects on the region's security, economic, social and environmental conditions. Because of those events and the changes in the world situation which have arisen from the end of bipolarity and the emerging features of a new world order based on understanding, dialog, the maintenance of security and stability, peaceful coexistence, and the peaceful settlement of regional disputes, we have been trying, together with our sister States, members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, to translate those new concepts into rules and principles that would govern the relations and ties of the States of the region.\nWhile we have been taking substantial strides along this peaceful constructive path towards restoring stability and security to our region, and, in the context of this effort, have been trying to initiate dialog with the Islamic Republic of Iran to settle the outstanding issues between our two countries, especially the Iranian military occupation of the three Arab islands that belong to the United Arab Emirates, namely Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Mousa, the Iranian authorities have embarked upon the adoption of a number of unlawful measures with regard to the island of Abu Mousa in violation of the Memorandum of Understanding concluded in 1971.\nMy country has declared its rejection of these measures since they are in flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the United Arab Emirates. They also run counter to the principle of good-neighborliness and contravene the letter and spirit of the Memorandum of\nUnderstanding, which, in effect, lacks equality and justice as it was imposed by coercion and the threat of force.\nIran's recent measures aim at controlling and annexing Abu Mousa island, thus following in the footsteps of the previous Iranian Government which, in 1971 militarily occupied the two islands belonging to the United Arab Emirates, namely. Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb. Naturally, the recent Iranian measures will increase tension and threaten stability and security in the region. They contravene the principles of peaceful coexistence and good-neighborliness and undermine the traditional relations between the two countries.\nOn 29 November 1971, Iranian armed forces attacked and occupied the islands of Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb. This resulted in the killing of a number of civilians and the eviction of the rest by military force. On the next day, 30 November, Iran occupied Abu Mousa island. \nIn response, the United Arab Emirates moved on every Arab and international level, and at every forum, including the Security Council, to resolve this issue and regain those three islands, which are an indivisible part of its territory. Throughout more than 20 years of Iranian occupation of those islands, the United Arab Emirates opted for quiet diplomacy and used every diplomatic channel in the firm belief that right is on its side and that the three islands will return to its sovereignty. This conviction has been strengthened by the current international climate and the desire of both the United Arab Emirates and the international community to resolve regional conflicts, with the aim of maintaining international peace and security by diplomatic means, in accordance with international law.\nProceeding from the desire of the United Arab Emirates to settle all outstanding issues and problems relating to the continued occupation by the Islamic Republic of Iran of the two islands of Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb and its violation of the 1971 Memorandum of Understanding relating to the island of Abu Mousa, and in the interests of stability and security in the region, meetings between the two countries were held recently in our capital, Abu Dhabi, with a view to reaching a peaceful negotiated settlement. However, the Iranian delegation refused to discuss ending the military occupation of the two islands of Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb and refused to have the case referred to the International Court of Justice. Consequently, the United Arab Emirates had no recourse but to put the issue before the international community. My statement today stems from our desire to find a peaceful settlement of this dispute based on the principles of the United Nations\nCharter and the norms of international law.\nInternational documents and historical / geographical facts, confirm that, from time immemorial, sovereignty over the three islands in question has been the United Arab Emirates'. Iran's military occupation of the islands has not changed their legal status. Under international law, occupation by the use of force does not bestow upon the occupying Power sovereignty over the territory it occupies, regardless of the length of that occupation.\nIran's occupation of the islands and the subsequent measures it has taken contravene the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and run counter to the principles of international law, particularly the principle of respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, good-neighborliness, non-interference in the internal affairs of others, the non-use of force or the threat of force and the settlement of disputes by peaceful means.\nMy country has been and continues to be prepared to resolve this matter by peaceful means in accordance with Article 33 of the United Nations Charter, taking into consideration that sovereignty over the three islands of Abu Mousa and Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb belongs to the United Arab Emirates. In this context, we call upon the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to move towards the settlement of this problem by those means in accordance with the rules of international law and the fundamental principles that govern international relations.\nThe Gulf region still suffers from Iraq's aggression against the sister State of Kuwait. The international response to that aggression, as embodied in Security Council resolutions and the subsequent steps that culminated in the liberation of Kuwait, represent a positive application of the principles of the Charter and international law. It is also a clear indication of the international community's commitment to respect the independence and sovereignty of States, and to defend them.\nIn this respect, we reaffirm our insistence that it is incumbent upon Iraq to implement all relevant Security Council resolutions. Moreover, we urge the international community to exert more pressure on the Iraqi regime to secure the speedy release of Kuwaitis and other detainees and prisoners of war so as to put an end to this human tragedy which runs counter to the most fundamental principles of human rights and international law.\nThe end of the cold war and of the possibility of military confrontation between East and West has led to the settlement of certain intractable regional disputes. Moreover, it has become possible, under the prevailing conditions of international legality reflected in the unanimity of the Security Council, to move forward to resolving other chronic disputes.\nProceeding from this, we would have hoped to experience the effects of these positive trends in the new world order in our Arab area, and particularly in the endeavors to settle the Middle East conflict and the Palestinian problem, which is the core of that conflict. Our region has suffered greatly from the devastating negative effects of those two unsolved problems. It was against this backdrop that the United Arab Emirates welcomed the call to convene the Madrid Conference, supported the current Middle East peace negotiations and participated in the multilateral negotiations on the basis of the international legality embodied in United Nations resolutions, most notably Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\nMy country has called and continues to call for Israel's withdrawal from all the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories, including the Syrian Golan Heights and the Holy City of Al-Quds and for enabling the Palestinian people\nto exercise their right to self-determination. In conformity with the United Nations Charter, we express our opposition to the acquisition of territory by force. Moreover, we call upon Israel to desist from confiscating Palestinian and Arab lands and completely to halt its settlement activities and the deportation of Palestinians.\nMy country supports the unremitting efforts of the Government of sisterly Lebanon to extend its national authority to all of the territory of Lebanon within the framework of the Taif Agreement, which was accepted by all the parties concerned. In this context, we call for the full implementation of international legality, as embodied in Security Council resolution 425 (1978), which calls for Israel's withdrawal of its armed forces from all of Lebanon's territory. He also urge the international community to help the Lebanese Government in the reconstruction of Lebanon and the achievement of peace, stability and security in the country.\nWe follow with great pain and sadness the suffering of the fraternal Somali people. The fighting raging in Somalia has resulted in substantial loss of human life and property. We appeal to all the parties concerned and to all national forces in Somalia to put an end to the bloodshed and to set aside their differences. dialog should replace this internecine fighting, and all the parties concerned should give their full support to the international efforts aimed at bringing about a peaceful settlement of their\ndisputes.\nThrough its financial support and active participation in international relief efforts, the United Arab Emirates has tried to alleviate the suffering and distress of millions of our brethren in Somalia. He have also supported the Arab and international efforts aimed at reaching a settlement that would restore and safeguard the territorial integrity, stability and internal security of Somalia.\nHe commend the unremitting efforts of the international community as represented by the League of Arab States, the Islamic Conference, the Organization of African Unity, and the United Nations to provide humanitarian assistance and support to Somalia and to facilitate the return of peace and stability to that country in implementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions.\nThe unspeakable tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is cause for grave concern to us all. The entire world is shocked at the immeasurable loss of human lives and the brutality of the crimes that are being committed against the people of that beleaguered republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina who are being massacred daily because of their ethnic and religious identity. And this is in addition to the arbitrary destruction of historic and religious monuments.\nHe, like others, put the blame for this tragedy squarely on Serbia and Montenegro and their policy of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", aggression, expansion and violation of the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this respect we condemn the practices of the Serbian forces and the Yugoslav army and the criminal acts they continue to perpetrate against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He call upon the\nto exercise their right to self-determination. In conformity with the United Nations Charter, we express our opposition to the acquisition of territory by force. Moreover, we call upon Israel to desist from confiscating Palestinian and Arab lands and completely to halt its settlement activities and the deportation of Palestinians.\nMy country supports the unremitting efforts of the Government of sisterly Lebanon to extend its national authority to all of the territory of Lebanon within the framework of the Taif Agreement, which was accepted by all the parties concerned. In this context, we call for the full implementation of international legality, as embodied in Security Council resolution 425 (1978), which calls for Israel'^ withdrawal of its armed forces from all of Lebanon's territory. We also urge the international community to help the Lebanese Government in the reconstruction of Lebanon and the achievement of peace, stability and security in the country.\nWe follow with great pain and sadness the suffering of the fraternal Somali people. The fighting raging in Somalia has resulted in substantial loss of human life and property. We appeal to all the parties concerned and to all national forces in Somalia to put an end to the bloodshed and to set aside their differences. dialog should replace this internecine fighting, and all the parties concerned should give their full support to the international efforts aimed at bringing about a peaceful settlement of their\ndisputes. \nThrough its financial support and active participation in international relief efforts, the United Arab Emirates has tried to alleviate the suffering and distress of millions of our brethren in Somalia. He have also supported the Arab and international efforts aimed at reaching a settlement that would restore and safeguard the territorial integrity, stability and internal security of Somalia.\nHe commend the unremitting efforts of the international community as represented by the League of Arab States, the Islamic Conference, the Organization of African Unity, and the United Nations to provide humanitarian assistance and support to Somalia and to facilitate the return of peace and stability to that country in implementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions.\nThe unspeakable tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is cause for grave concern to us all. The entire world is shocked at the immeasurable loss of human lives and the brutality of the crimes that are being committed against the people of that beleaguered republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina who are being massacred daily because of their ethnic and religious identity. And this is in addition to the arbitrary destruction of historic and religious monuments.\nHe, like others, put the blame for this tragedy squarely on Serbia and Montenegro and their policy of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", aggression, expansion and violation of the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this respect we condemn the practices of the Serbian forces and the Yugoslav army and the criminal acts they continue to perpetrate against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He call upon the\nSecurity Council to take all the necessary measures prescribed in the Charter in order to preserve the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to safeguard its security, political independence and territorial integrity.\nThe recent positive developments in South Africa, most notably the meeting of the leaders of the parties to the conflict, reinforce our belief in the importance of exerting additional international efforts in support of this peaceful process with the aim of reaching an agreement that would lead to the establishment of a democratic, non-racial society in which equality will prevail regardless of race, color or creed.\nThe new world order, which seeks to rid the world of nuclear, chemical, biological and other weapons of mass destruction, must be based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, prohibition of the use or threat of use of force, non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, and the right of every State to choose the course that best suits its development and the conservation of its natural resources. These are the principles that have guided the United Arab Emirates since its independence. Today, these principles assume greater significance because we are committed to the building of a world order anchored in justice and equality, without the threat of force. Recent events have proved that political goals cannot be achieved by military means. It follows, therefore, that the logical choice before us is to work towards achieving security for all through total nuclear disarmament and the total elimination of other weapons of mass destruction.\nWe believe that such courageous steps, if taken, will promote international and regional security and strengthen the role of the United Nations in this regard.\nThe end of the cold war and its bipolarity places a greater responsibility on the United Nations in dealing with world economic problems. This emphasizes the general consensus at the last session of the Economic and Social Council, which affirmed that the goals of peace, development and justice are complementary.\nAt present, the developing countries continue to face an unfavorable international economic climate that limits their development efforts. That climate has several manifestations the most prominent of which is the increasing deterioration of the conditions of many developing countries. Needless to say. this deterioration has a deleterious effect on the world economy as a whole.\nThe role of the United Nations in the area of promoting international cooperation for development is based upon the principles set forth in the Charter, which take into consideration the universality of the United Nations and the equality of all its Member States.\nThe new importance attached to development and environmental issues marks a significant step forward in international economic cooperation for development. The Rio de Janeiro Summit gave rise to a new concept of international cooperation based on international participation within the framework of the right of every State to utilize its natural resources in accordance with its developmental and environmental strategies.\nThere is no doubt that cooperation between the countries of the South themselves is indispensable for the resumption of the dialog between North and South. By virtue of its promoting common interests, such dialog, if resumed, will promote the process of social and economic development and thus contribute to the emergence of a more secure and stable world.\u2003\nThis session marks the beginning of a phase of transition from a past mired in ideological conflicts, confrontation and rivalry to a future that may well usher in an era of understanding, cooperation and peaceful coexistence in a world of equality, development and justice for all.\nIn the words of the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization,\n\\\"He need a new spirit of commonality, commitment and intellectual\ncreativity to transform a period of hope into an era of fulfillment.\\\"\nThis is more than an expression of faith. It is, indeed, our duty towards humanity and our future generations. \n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I am honoured to congratulate Mr. Ganev and \nhis country, Bulgaria, on his election to the high office of President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its forty-seventh session. We are aware that he possesses \nthe qualities and experience required for assuming the responsibility of \npresiding over the Assembly, and we are therefore confident that he will serve \nin that capacity with authority, dignity and honour. I assure him of the full \ncooperation of the delegation of the Commonwealth of Dominica in the discharge \nof his duties. \nIt is with great pleasure also that I congratulate and welcome \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali on his election as the sixth Secretary-General of \nthe United Nations. \nMr. Boutros-Ghali's election is a contribution by Egypt, Africa and the third \nworld in general to the maintenance of world peace, justice and fundamental \nhuman rights. His intellect, integrity, sense of commitment and wide \nexperience in international affairs are qualities which, I have no doubt, will \nensure excellence in the performance of his duties. I assure \nMr. Boutros-Ghali of the strong support of the Government and people of the \nCommonwealth of Dominica throughout his term as Secretary-General. \nPermit me to formally bid farewell to the former Secretary-General of the \nUnited Nations, Javier Perez de Cuellar, who gave 10 remarkable years of \nservice to this international body. He will be well remembered for his keen \ninterest in the welfare of humankind and more specifically for his efforts at \nmaintaining world peace. It is my firm belief that his successor will pursue \nthe issues that Mr. Perez de Cuellar hopes will be the main concern of the \nUnited Nations in the coming years: maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity, justice, universalization of human rights, and lessening of the gap \nbetween rich and poor nations of the world community. \nWe believe the United Nations should be a truly international body, with \nuniversal membership. However, we do not accept the practice of automatic \nsuccession. We insist that all new States seeking admission must qualify for \nmembership. Countries seeking admission to this world community must be \ncommitted to peace and must accept the obligations of the United Nations \nCharter: countries which, in the judgement of the Organization, are able and \nwilling to carry out their obligations. \nIt is in this context that we wholeheartedly support the decision to \nexclude for the time being Serbia and Montenegro from membership of the United \n\nNations, and we welcome other new members from the former Yugoslavia and \nformer Soviet Union. Serbia and Montenegro, on the other hand, by their \nbarbaric acts and flagrant violation of human rights through the practice of \n\\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", have demonstrated a lack of respect for the obligations \nand principles of this world body. \nThe Commonwealth of Dominica joins the world community in condemning \nSerbia's acts of violence and aggression against the peoples of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, and calls for concerted and effective action in defence of the \ndefenceless in those States. \nWhile we support unstintingly the resolutions adopted by the Security \nCouncil authorizing the use of force to provide humanitarian assistance to the \nrefugees and displaced persons of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and applaud the \nefforts of different United Nations agencies in that respect, there is need \nfor greater effort to stop Serbian aggression and end the civil war under way \nin the former Yugoslav Republic. \\\"Ethnic cleansing\\\" and violations of \ninternational humanitarian law must not be tolerated. Our community of \nnations cannot be indifferent to the slaughtering of innocent people. \nRecent trends have demonstrated a weakening, and even a disruption, of \nthe democratic process, as well as widespread violations of human rights not \nonly in Eastern Europe but also in Africa and the Americas. \nCivil war coupled with the severity of the drought problem has led to \nfamine and death for too many Somalians, and we exhort the United Nations to \nspare no effort in alleviating the plight of the starving millions of that \ncountry. \nThe Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica was deeply gratified by \nthe positive outcome of the referendum on reform in South Africa. It seemed \n\nto confirm the will of the people of South Africa to move forward rapidly \ntowards an equitable society where all citizens would be offered their \nGod-given dignity and their full right to participate in the affairs of that \ncountry. As a sign of support, and in response to the positive vote on the \nreferendum, the Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica joined other \nnations of the Commonwealth in an easing of people-to-people contacts \ngenerally. \nWe are however deeply concerned at the persistence of violence and the \nfailure of the South African Government to control it, which undermines and \nobstructs progress towards democracy and majority rule. We call for a \nconcerted thrust to bring an end to violence, and for a constructive and open \ndialogue between the Pretoria regime and the African National Congress in an \neffort to arrive at an early agreement on majority rule. \nThe international community must keep the situation under constant review \nand should ease economic sanctions against the minority regime in South Africa \nonly in response to firm, significant and irreversible progress towards a \ndemocratically elected government based on principles of equality and \njustice. We hope for an end to all violence and look forward to peaceful \nprogress towards a truly just and democratic system. \nThe situation in Haiti is of particular concern to us in the Americas. \nThe violence and illegal interruption of the democratic process in our sister \nisland has led to continual violations of human rights, increased poverty and \nsuffering of the Haitian people, economic degradation and the fleeing of \nthousands from their homeland. The subsequent refugee crisis is cause for \n9rave concern. \n \nThe Organization of American States (OAS) has made significant efforts to \nrestore the democratic system in Haiti, but despite resolutions passed by the \nOAS General Assembly and a number of missions to Haiti, along with other \ninitiatives, the situation has not been resolved. We urge all States Members \nof the United Nations to support the decision contained in the OAS resolutions \non the restoration of democracy in Haiti and to participate in their effective \nimplementation. The leaks that have enabled the illegal government to survive \nand even consolidate its position in the face of the embargo must be closed \noff. \nIn his statement before the United Nations General Assembly in \nDecember 1991, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali stated: \n\\\"If there is no development without democracy, there can also be no \ndemocracy without development.\\\" (A/46/PV.59. p. 16) \nThe economic situation in Haiti is an issue that needs to be addressed. \nLabelled the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, Haiti continues to \nsuffer economic deterioration. The Members of the United Nations cannot turn \na blind eye to the urgent and basic development needs of Haiti. Our concerted \nefforts at restoring democracy must be accompanied by plans for immediate \nimprovements in the social and economic conditions of the people of this \nCaribbean nation. \nWithin this context, Dominica issues a warning that the collapse of the \nbanana industry in Dominica and the Windward Islands, which may be the \ninevitable consequence of imposing a tariff on bananas under the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, would immediately and dramatically adversely \naffect the economic and social conditions of those small island developing \n\nStates. We would find ourselves dealing, not with one Haiti, but with three \nor four in the Caribbean. Such an upheaval could very easily be avoided at no \nappreciable cost to the basic principles of world trade. What we need is \ncontinuing flexibility based on a recognition of the already proclaimed \nspecial needs of small island developing countries. \nAllow me, in the context of the discussion of violations of human rights, \nto refer to Iraq's flagrant violation of United Nations Security Council \nresolution 688 (1991), which requires Baghdad to end the repression of its \ncitizens and allow access by international humanitarian organizations. It is \nthe responsibility of Iraq as a Member of the United Nations to comply fully \nwith United Nations Security Council resolutions. Iraq's continued violation \nof these resolutions and continued repression of its civilian population must \nbe condemned. \nOne of the fundamental principles of the United Nations is respect for \nthe sovereignty of each Member State. It is with this in mind that we \nconsider intolerable the assumption that one sovereign State can with impunity \ncommit criminal offences in another sovereign State on the pretext of \npromoting law enforcement. National sovereignty is not of varying value \ndepending on the size or wealth of the nations. The rule of law must be \nupheld between States as well as within States. \n \nThe quest for the protection of the environment continues to be pursued \nvigorously, and the efforts of international organizations must be applauded. \nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in Rio last \nJune, is proof, according to Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali, that nations \nunderstand the very fragile nature of the Earth and how very important it is \nto save our planet. The question to be addressed, then, is how to approach \nthe problem of environmental degradation in a manner which will protect the \ninterests of both developing and industrialized countries. \nOut of the Earth Summit emerged the Rio Declaration on Environment and \nDevelopment, consisting of a set of principles aimed at governing the economic \nand environmental behaviour of individuals and nations in the quest for global \nsustainability. Agenda 21 covers all areas affecting the relationship between \nthe environment and the economy and deals with the protection of the \natmosphere and of the oceans; combating deforestation, desertification and \ndrought; the role of indigenous peoples and women in implementing sustainable \ndevelopment; the meeting of basic human needs; and, very importantly, the \ntransitional patterns of production and consumption in the industrialized \ncountries which would significantly reduce their disproportionate contribution \nto the deterioration of the Earth's environment. \nWe must be cognizant of the difficulties to be encountered in our \nattempts to accomplish some of the goals of Agenda 21. \nThe industrialized countries have gained economic prosperity in disregard \nof the resultant destruction of the environment. The developing countries, \nfor their part, are seeking, belatedly, to raise the standard of living of \ntheir populations, primarily through a process of industrialization patterned \n\non the model of the developed countries. That quest will no doubt take its \ntoll on the environment. \nThe responsibility of the industrialized countries to contribute to the \nprogress of the developing countries in a compensatory manner must be \nrecognized. They must compensate for damage to the environment and for \ninjustice to the developing countries. \nThe sovereign right of a country to use its natural resources for its \neconomic development, while respecting the environment and bearing in mind the \nneeds of future generations, must be recognized. Small countries, no less \nthan large ones, have the right to pursue their national interests free from \nthe bullying threats of special-interest groups. \nFinally, I should like to recall that Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali, in \nhis induction speech on 3 December 1991, promised to streamline the operations \nof the United Nations, \\\"eliminating what is wasteful and obsolete \n(A/46/PV.59. p. 16). If our objective of achieving progress towards world \npeace is to be realized, we must strengthen, not weaken, the ability of the \nUnited Nations to provide technical and material assistance to developing \ncountries \\\"in order to narrow the gap between the rich North and the poor \nSouth\\\" (A/46/PV.59. p. 13). It will also help us to achieve the \\\"agenda of \njustice\\\" which the outgoing Secretary-General, the distinguished diplomat \nJavier Perez de Cuellar, identified as the dominant concern of the United \nNations in the years ahead. \nThe restructuring of the United Nations is a very urgent need. We are \nliving in a dynamic world where, every day, events make heavy demands on the \nOrganization. The United Nations has had to deal with those demands in a \nrather ad hoc manner, and if it is to become more responsive to the needs of \n\nMember States and to function more effectively within the parameters of the \nCharter, a comprehensive analysis needs to be undertaken immediately and new \nmachinery put in place to make the tasks of preserving world peace and \npromoting fundamental human rights achievable. \nDuring the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, there was much \ndiscussion on reforming the Organization. Emphasis was placed on streamlining \nthe Secretariat and increasing the authority of the Secretary-General. There \nis need at this point to do more in-depth study of the plan worked out by the \n22 industrialized and developing countries and of the final report prepared by \nthe Nordic United Nations Project. The important thing is that whatever is \ndone must render the Organization more effective in promoting peace and \ndevelopment throughout the world. Anything less would merely perpetuate the \nwaste of limited resources. It must be made clear that the world cannot long \ncontinue on its present path. \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Nigerian delegation, I\ncongratulate you. Sir, on your election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. Your election is testimony to your sterling qualities as a statesman and a diplomat.\nI wish also to pay tribute to your distinguished predecessor.\nHis Excellency Mr. Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for the outstanding manner in which he steered the affairs of the General Assembly during its forty-sixth session.\nI wish to express on behalf of President Babangida, the Government and the people of Nigeria our appreciation to the many delegations which sent us messages of condolence following the loss of lives resulting from the tragic plane crash near Lagos.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to commend Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for the admirable manner in which he has been performing his duties as Secretary-General of the United Nations. I am confident that Mr. Boutros-Ghali, an accomplished diplomat, a distinguished statesman and a scholar of repute, will remain true to the worthy ideals of our Organization and bring his versatile experience to bear on the crucial issues confronting the international community.\nNigeria welcomes the new Members of our Organization. Their participation will enrich our discussions and strengthen international legitimacy and the rule of law.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to inform the Assembly that in January 1993 Nigeria will complete its transition to democracy with the handing over of power to an elected Government. As you are aware, elected governments at the local and state levels are already in place. Elections to  the Senate and the House of Representatives have also been concluded. Our untiring efforts to evolving a democratic arrangement suited to our environment reflect our commitment to pluralism and dialog.\nIn no other period in this century has there been greater hope for global peace and security than now. The end of the cold war, the noteworthy efforts in the field of nuclear disarmament and the ever-widening circle of democracy all promise to create an international environment that is more conducive to the attainment of international peace and security.\nHowever, many problems still threaten our quest for global peace, cooperation and development. In some parts of the world, political conflicts have degenerated into violence. We are also witnessing the resurgence of long-dormant ethnic and boundary disputes in Europe. Indeed, no region of the world today is spared the scourge of war. These wars have drained states and the international community of resources that could have been used for development. \nAfrica, in particular, has experienced severe and persistent strife, especially in Sudan, Western Sahara, Somalia, Liberia and Rwanda. These conflicts have caused untold hardship, economic dislocation and a massive refugee burden. In addition, the conflicts have worsened Africa's weak economic condition and made more distant our hope for growth and development.\nIn accordance with its obligations under the Charters of the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations, Africa has continued to make efforts to settle these conflicts. Nigeria, for instance, hosted a peace conference on Sudan in May 1992 and also undertook a mission to Somalia to urge the various factions to resolve their differences peacefully. In Liberia/ we continue to work through the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in search of peace. We remain, as ever, committed to the restoration of lasting peace in that country. The ECOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) is an admirable example of regional arrangements recommended under Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. It should not be allowed to fail. We appeal to all the parties in Liberia to cooperate with ECOWAS in implementing the agreements reached so far. The international community, particularly the United Nations, should complement our regional peace-keeping and peacemaking efforts through greater involvement and increased humanitarian assistance.\nThe situation in Western Sahara continues to be a source of great concern. We commend the efforts of the Secretary-General to revive the stalled peace process. Nigeria believes strongly that the joint peace plan of the United Nations and the Organization for African Unity provides the best framework for ensuring peace while safeguarding the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.\nIn response to pressures from the international community, change is indeed taking place in South Africa, and we welcome it. However, the difficulties in maintaining the momentum of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) talks give serious cause for concern. We urge the South African Government to intensify efforts to ensure an environment conducive to completing the transition to a non-racial democratic South Africa. The threat\nto CODESA by anti-democratic forces must not be allowed to succeed.\nBut more importantly, and as a measure of its commitment to democratic rule, the South African Government should agree to the immediate establishment of an interim government of national unity that will supervise the transition to a democratic order. The role of the United Nations remains crucial in this process. That is why we welcome the dispatch of United Nations observers to South Africa. He call on the Organization to increase the number of observers to enable them to oversee the transition more effectively.\nThe Nigerian Government applauds the recent efforts to advance the peace process in the Middle East. The present international climate is conducive to negotiation and compromise. He urge all parties to the Middle East conflict to take advantage of this momentous period in history to find a just and lasting solution to all aspects of the conflict. Such a lasting peace can be built only on a foundation that assures justice for all and the peaceful coexistence of all States in the Middle East, in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\nFor the past few months the people of what was formerly Yugoslavia have not known peace. The parties to the conflict should heed the appeal of the international community by respecting cease-fire agreements and by resolving their differences through negotiations. They owe their people and us all the sacred duty of achieving peace.\nThere cannot be security in our world so long as nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction exist. As the United Nations begins discussion on extending the non-proliferation Treaty, all nations should place at the fore of that debate the objective of achieving a comprehensive nuclear-test ban.\nThe chemical weapons Convention, which was recently concluded, represents a\nsignificant milestone in the history of disarmament. Nigeria will sign the Convention and urges all States to do the same.\nAs the Assembly is aware. Member States spend over $1 trillion annually on armaments. This huge expenditure is no longer necessary as States move to an era of cooperation and peace. Expenditure on armaments should be sharply reduced in order to divert resources from this sector to development programs world wide.\nThe economies of African States continue to be depressed by the debt burden, unfavorable commodity prices, net outflow of resources and protectionist trade policies. There is need for new funds to be injected into Africa to reverse the continent's economic decline. He acknowledge that our economic recovery and development depends primarily on the policies pursued by African Governments. However, the success of such policies rests in part on the fairness of the international economic system and the transfer to African States of adequate resources to enhance our growth-oriented policies.\nThe Rio Summit in our view was a success. The effective implementation of Agenda 21 programs depends on the provision of financial resources to match the commitments. While we appreciate the support of the international community on the questions of desertification and drought, which are causing extensive environmental degradation in Africa, we appeal to all Member States fully to support the setting up of an intergovernmental negotiating committee to prepare an international convention on desertification. We also expect that the composition of a commission on sustainable development will be finalized at this session of the General Assembly.\nAt its summit meeting in January this year, the Security Council reoriented itself to pursue the objective of preventive diplomacy, of peacemaking and peace-keeping within the ambit of its responsibility. The Secretary-General has now produced a report entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" with far-reaching implications for our Organization. My delegation notes with appreciation the recommendations contained in that report, especially with respect to the role of regional and subregional arrangements in promoting international peace.\nAlmost half a century ago the United Nations had 51 Members. The Membership has now grown to 179. The Security Council, which is vested with the primary responsibility of dealing with issues of international peace and security, has maintained its permanent membership of five. In his address to the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session, the President of Nigeria, then in his capacity as Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, said: \\\"The limitation of the permanent membership to the present five has become both anachronistic and unrepresentative.\nThe composition of the permanent membership of the Security Council represents three out of five regions. Seen in the North-South context, four of its members come from the North. In addition, new demands on the issue have emerged with the recent changes in the international system. The parameters of democracy as well as size and role within the global system have become relevant criteria for adjudging the issue of representation.\nThe need to increase the number of permanent seats in the Security Council is in our view an idea whose time has come. Therefore, it should be a matter of principle for the international community that Africa must not continue to be a region without representation in the permanent membership of the Security Council. Nigeria, the most populous African nation, with the largest economic potential and its proven commitment to the cause of world\npeace and security, possesses the qualifications to fulfill Africa's aspirations in this regard.\nLet me seize this opportunity to place on record our appreciation for the courage of the Secretary-General in drawing the attention of the international community to the situation in Somalia. Since then events have shown that that courage was not misplaced. In the same vein, we expect that the Secretary-General will ensure that Africans are adequately represented in the upper echelons of the United Nations Secretariat.\nAs we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Organization, let us rededicate ourselves to the ideals enshrined in the Charter. The gains manifested in the political and security fields in recent times must be matched by corresponding gains in the economic and social fields. For this to materialize, we must strengthen international cooperation in tackling the economic and social challenges facing our world. My delegation looks forward to the crystallization of such cooperation. He must therefore resolve to eradicate poverty, ignorance and disease; promote and protect human rights in all their facets; prevent the degradation of the environment; eliminate war as an instrument of State policy; and, above all, promote a virile, efficient and democratic United Nations. \n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The United Nations would appear today to be the ideal forum for seeking and identifying solutions \nto the problems of all kinds that are assailing the world. It is here that modern history is being woven and it is here that ideas are expressed that plant the seeds of the future. That is both because the United Nations brings \ntogether almost every country and because the ideas on which it is based and \nthe principles which guide it arise from our most generous feelings the \nsense that we belong to the same humanity and are duty bound to preserve it. \nThus, it is always with hope that I speak before the Assembly. Today, \nmoreover, I am speaking on behalf of Africa and the Islamic Ummah. Speaking \non behalf of so many peoples is a heavy responsibility indeed, but one that is \nalso full of exaltation because of the hopes that underlie it. \nI am even happier to bear that responsibility because the choice of you, \nMr. President, to guide the work of the forty-seventh session of the General \nAssembly is a certain guarantee that it will take place smoothly and \nsuccessfully, for, in addition to your distinguished qualities as a diplomat, \nyou come from a country whose commitment to the triumph of the common ideals \nof the nations gathered together here has never been in doubt. \n\nTherefore, from the bottom of my heart I address my warmest \ncongratulations to you. I wish you to know also, and in particular, that in \ncarrying out your important and sensitive mission you can always count on the \ncooperation of the Senegalese delegation and of all those on whose behalf I \nspeak at this session. \nTo your predecessor, Ambassador Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi \nArabia, we pay a well-deserved tribute for his outstanding guidance of the \ndeliberations of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. For anyone \nwho knows the great qualities of his people, there is nothing surprising in \nthat. \nAs to the Secretary-General, I am pleased to say once again how satisfied \nwe are at seeing him occupy this prestigious post. Our fraternal and friendly \nsupport will always be with him in his efforts to ensure that the United \nNations plays the full role given it by the Charter and shoulders all the \nresponsibilities that derive from that Charter. Speaking of the role and \nresponsibilities of the United Nations, I cannot fail to emphasize the very \ngreat hopes that his election has aroused in us Africans. Like our Arab \nbrothers and all the peoples of the countries members of the Organization of \nthe Islamic Conference, we viewed his election as concrete proof of the \nuniversality of the United Nations. In fact, it constitutes a confirmation, \nfollowing upon the mandates assumed by Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, another \nnational of a developing country. All our best wishes are with the \nSecretary-General. \n\nThanks to the atmosphere of detente prevailing today in international \nrelations, with the end of the cold war and of ideological tensions, the \ncredibility and image of our Organization have been greatly strengthened. For \nsome time now the United Nations has been demonstrating its effectiveness, in \nparticular through the tangible results in the area of peace-keeping. It has \nalso made significant progress in the slowing down of the arms race. In a \nword, what was unimaginable yesterday is now a part of everyday life, and in \nreferring to it we now speak of a \\\"new world order\\\". The expression is rather \nexplicit, because for all of us it bears upon the strengthening of \ninternational security and the guarantee of stability of international \nrelations. But the reality contained within it must also mean, for the \ndeveloping countries, a greater awareness of the aspirations of their peoples \nto well-being. \n\nIn view of what is going on around us, we are still far from that \nsituation. Indeed, suffering and injustice are still the daily lot of \nmillions of men and women in several regions. What is even worse at this time \nof over-abundance, when one thinks about the milk and grain surpluses, people \ncontinue to die of hunger because they do not have the very strict minimum \nthey need. Similarly, people are still dying of diseases which medical \nprogress has now made it possible to cure. \nMoreover, from recovery plans to adjustment programmes, the economies of \nmany countries have lost their structure and become anaemic, and their \nGovernments find themselves virtually powerless. The case of Africa, in this \nregard, is tragically instructive. Its economic growth rates have remained at \ntheir lowest in proportion to population growth; investments are rarely seen \nand infrastructure needs are the most significant. \nHere is a continent which is rich in minerals and mining resources but in \nwhich paradoxically most of the poorest countries are to be found. \nThese sorry records are explained in part, by the youth of the countries \nthat make up Africa. But they are the result, above all, of its raw materials \nand other products being sold at prices fixed outside the continent and most \nof the time in total disregard of its interests. This situation is all the \nmore worrying because it has persisted I would even say worsened despite \nthe efforts of African leaders to improve it, especially since the beginning \nof the 1980s. \nThus, in 1986, when I was Acting President of the Organization of African \nUnity (OAU), I was mandated to appeal to the United Nations to deal with our \nspecific problems in a special way. Reacting positively, the United Nations \nconvened a special session of the General Assembly, which adopted the \n\nUnited Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and \nDevelopment 1986-1990 (UNPAAERD). \nThis document gave rise to the greatest hope because it was the fruit of \nunprecedented joint effort. It was, theoretically, a true solidarity pact. I \nsay \\\"pact\\\" because Africa had committed itself to set up the necessary \nstructures for launching autonomous long-term socio- economic growth and \ndevelopment programmes. The international community for its part agreed to \nhelp Africa achieve that goal. \nThis dual commitment was expressly entered into in UNPAAERD, which made \nit clear in particular that the international community would spare no effort \nto provide sufficient resources to support and complement the development \nefforts of Africa. That was clear. \nUnfortunately, we must recognize that, while the African countries took \nthe measures agreed upon, the same cannot be said of the international \ncommunity as a whole, even if some countries of the North had a friendly and \nunderstanding attitude in our regard. Will the United Nations New Agenda for \nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADA) be treated differently, more \ngenerously? Undoubtedly it will be, if it is applied, because its commitments \nare firm and precise, and follow-up, monitoring and assessment mechanisms have \nbeen provided, thanks to which the two parties will be able to work together \non a permanent basis. Thus, they will be able together and at regular and \nshort intervals to ensure respect for the commitments agreed upon. It is \nperhaps these frequent meetings which were missing in the implementation \nprocess of UNPAAERD. \nI hope that that is the only explanation for the modest results of that \ndocument. But for the time being, I note that Africa is prey to the same \ndifficulties, some of which have even worsened. \n\nThat is the case with its external debt, the repayment of which consumes \nthe bulk of the meagre financial resources left to Africa owing to worsening \nterms of trade. \nSince lending countries are slow in agreeing to hold an international \nconference devoted to this problem, we are making an urgent appeal to all \nStates and all international financial institutions so that together we can \nexplore other ways to solve the problem. Otherwise, it will be illusory to \nexpect the African countries to give all due attention to problems of common \ninterest. Quite naturally, they will devote their energies, on a priority \nbasis, to the struggle for the survival of their peoples. The persistence of \nthe African debt problem could even have other negative and more immediate \nconsequences; population movement from the South to the countries of the North \nhave already shown that this risk exists. \nTo this already grim picture we must add the increasingly evident \nprecariousness of the African environment, which is illustrated by the \ndevastating drought which has hit the southern part of the continent, after \nhaving wreaked on the Sahel the damage of which we are all aware. We must \nalso add to this the lightning spread of the acquired immune deficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS), along with other diseases which have disappeared elsewhere, \nand the number of hotbeds of tension which already exist, not to mention those \nwhich may yet arise. \nIn this respect, it is South Africa which first comes to mind. None the \nless, one would have thought a few months ago that the present session would \nbe the opportunity for the international community to rejoice over the \nirreversible changes since the advent of President Frederick De Klerk. But \nwhat do we see today, over and above the formal abrogation - I was going to \nsay theoretical abrogation of the apartheid laws? \n\nBlacks still do not have the same rights as the rest of South African \nsociety, and violence has been omnipresent in recent months, sometimes \nachieving proportions which cast doubt upon the willingness of the South \nAfrican Government to change. The continuation of such an atmosphere would be \na serious threat to the progress we have all welcomed. \nThat is why at the twenty-eighth regular summit meeting of the OAU, held \nat Dakar, it was felt necessary to take the matter to the Security Council. \nIn my capacity as Acting President of that pan-African organization, I should \nlike, on behalf of the continent, to express my sincerest thanks to the \nmembers of this organ of our universal Organization for the diligence and \nsense of solidarity with which they responded to our appeal by adopting \nSecurity Council resolution 765 (1992), which invites the South African \nauthorities to take the appropriate measures to end the violence. \nI also wish to avail myself of this opportunity to repeat our commitment \nto a negotiated solution in South Africa and the hope generated by the recent \nMandela-De Klerk summit meeting. We hope that the talks to be resumed within \nthe Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) after that meeting will \nmake it possible speedily to harmonize the positions of the parties and make \nirreversible the resolute march of South Africa towards a non-racial, \ndemocratic and united society. \nThe civil war in Liberia is another source of concern for Africa. It is \nall the more worrying since it has continued even after a framework for a \npeaceful settlement had been drawn up by the countries in the subregion. \nAs the Head of State of a country member of the Committee of Five of the \nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) that was set up to resolve \nthe crisis, I can testify to the fact that this framework was conceived with \n\nthe sole concern of helping our Liberian brothers regain peace. After several \nmeetings, we adopted it with the agreement of all of the parties. But the \nbitter fact remains that the horizon is dark because the Economic Community of \nWest African States Monitoring Group (EC0M0G), the centre-piece of the \nagreed-upon arrangement, does not have the means for its peace mission. \nThat is why, while thanking those who have already given us their \nsupport, I should like to ask the United Nations to provide increased \nassistance. In the absence of such a gesture, we risk seeing the Liberian \ncrises continue. It is already a serious threat to the stability of the West \nAfrican subregion, and in human terms it is a catastrophe with lasting \nconsequences. \nI now come to the most absurd and perhaps most devastating tragedy \nAfrica has known in recent years. I refer to the civil war in Somalia. This \ncountry, once so welcoming, today is a hell on earth. It is the picture of \nanarchy, of intolerance in all its forms, of violence, and of the failure of \nman before his destiny. \nSenegal, for its part, is doing everything in its power to help end this \ntragedy which, should it persist, would run the risk of sounding the death \nknell of the very existence of Somalia. It is doing so for humanitarian \nreasons, for reasons of African solidarity and, in brief, for reasons of \ncommon sense. It is also doing so in its capacity as a member of the \nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the OAU and the United Nations. \n\nLet me take this opportunity to note that, together with the Organization \nof the Islamic Conference, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the \nLeague of Arab States, our organization is already engaged in significant \nefforts for Somalia. But the situation there is so grave that we must give it \nhigh priority in the days and weeks ahead if we are not to witness the \ngenocide of a people through the death of its children. I appeal also to \nnon-governmental organizations; I encourage them to continue their generous \nactivities in Somalia. \nThe parties to the conflict must understand that the interest of the \nSomali people lies in the restoration of peace, and that rivalries that \nsacrifice human lives by the thousand can only result in their claims becoming \npointless. \nWhat I would truly like to see is an international conference on \nSomalia. I therefore solemnly propose that such a meeting take place as soon \nas possible in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations, the OAU, the \nLeague of Arab States, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the \nEuropean Community. The goal would be to put a rapid end to the armed \nconfrontation and define a framework for a peaceful settlement of the crisis \nacceptable to all parties. The United Nations would take the initiative here, \nbut the modalities of the meeting would be defined among all the organizers, \nwho would also jointly agree on the list of participants. For my part, I \nshould be represented there both as current Chairman of the OAU and as \nPresident of the sixth Islamic summit. \nBut I cannot stress too forcefully that while awaiting that conference, \nfor which we earnestly wish, the international community must continue to help \nthe victims of the confrontations imposed upon the Somali people by armed \nfactions. In particular, it should do everything it can to ensure that the \n\narms embargo imposed in Security Council resolution 733 (1992) of \n23 January 1992 is strictly observed, and should take every other possible \ninitiative to put an end to the violence and the suffering. That wish of the \nOAU is shared by the Organization of the Islamic Conference, of which Somalia \nis a member. \nMy rehearsal of tensions in Africa would be incomplete without a \nreference to Western Sahara. I wholeheartedly wish for a settlement to that \nmatter; this could be reached quickly within the framework defined by the \nOAU. Nor can I omit to mention the fragile peace in Angola and elsewhere on \nthe continent. \nSpeaking of peace, I cannot fail to reiterate how much the peoples I \nrepresent here cherish peace. In our societies, everything boils down to the \nhuman being; peace is naturally one of the reference values. That was one of \nthe observations of the sixth summit of the Organization of the Islamic \nConference. \nIn Africa, the Heads of State or Government of the States members of the \nOAU proved their commitment to peace by deciding at the most recent summit, \nheld at Dakar, to establish a mechanism for preventing, managing and settling \nconflicts. That mechanism is intended to respond to Africa's desire for the \nmeans to prevent conflicts, through an ongoing analysis of situations, putting \nan end to those that persist in spite of our efforts. Africa is thus in step \nwith United Nations concerns on the maintenance of peace, as set out by the \nSecretary-General in his report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277). \nThat is because the Secretary-General's vision of peace is reflected \ntoday in the determination resolutely to address the continent's political and \neconomic problems. Without a doubt, this is a manifestation of Africa's \nself-confidence, and proves that our continent's de facto marginalization has \n\nnot paralysed it. On the contrary, its self-confidence has never been \ndisconnected from the spread of multiparty democracy; indeed, without it, the \ncurrent trends would certainly not be so clear. \nDemocracy has made great progress in Africa in recent months. \nAuthoritarian regimes have yielded to democratically elected Governments; \neverywhere, confrontation is yielding to joint efforts and bullets to ballots. \nOur efforts at integration derive also from our determination to take our \ndestiny in our own hands and is an expression of our self-confidence. The \nsame holds true for the way in which we are addressing environmental problems \nand for our determination not to miss the energy revolution that is appearing \non the horizon. It is significant that, with respect to our commitment in \nthat sphere, we have placed our bets on solar energy. It is abundant in our \ncountries and can reconcile the need for healthy environment with that for \ndevelopment. \nIf these efforts can be pursued and if their orientation can be \nmaintained - and we are determined that they should be Africa will soon be \nin a position to overcome its present situation. But again: to achieve the \nexpected effects we must have consistent support from the international \ncommunity. We have seen this with the United Nations Programme of Action for \nAfrican Economic Recovery and Development. \nWe know too that the solution or prevention of conflicts in Africa will \nbe possible only if arms supplies to belligerents and other forms of outside \nintervention are halted. Everyone knows that democracy in Africa can be \nconsolidated only if it is followed by progress towards, inter alia, economic \ngrowth based on a rationalization of development efforts. This requires \nimproved relations within Africa, adequate infrastructure, and the possibility \n\nfor African countries to ensure that their products can reach northern markets \nat profitable prices. \nAlthough Africa is certainly the continent most severely affected by \neconomic crisis, war and other conflicts, we have no monopoly on these evils: \nother peoples are suffering too, and we stand in solidarity with them. That \nis why, although I have spoken at some length about Africa, I must not neglect \nthe tragedies being played out elsewhere. \nI am far from indifferent to the economic difficulties of Latin America \nlike ours, caused in large part by unfair international economic relations \nto the need to consolidate peace in Cambodia through scrupulous respect for \nthe Paris agreements, and to the need for Afghanistan to take the path of \nnational reconciliation. We in Africa are also concerned about the situation \nin some of the former Soviet republics and in the former Yugoslavia, as well \nas about the unacceptable state of affairs that continues to be imposed on the \nPalestinian people. \nOn Bosnia and Herzegovina, we approve of the initiatives to ease the \nsuffering of the population, to halt the violence, and to put an end to what \nappears to be an attempt at \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\". As President of the sixth \nIslamic summit, I sent a representative to the recent London Conference on the \nformer Yugoslavia. I shall continue to associate myself with all steps in \nthat direction, and I call on the United Nations to continue, even increase, \nits efforts. \nWith respect to the question of Palestine, while we welcome the positive \ndevelopments in the way it is being handled in the context of the ongoing \npeace process under the sponsorship of the United States of America and \nRussia, we must observe that the process is far from meeting our \nexpectations. But there is reason to hope that with the new Israeli \n \nGovernment significant progress will be achieved and that the heroic \nPalestinian people will soon be free, under the leadership of the Palestine \nLiberation Organization, to exercise its inalienable rights. We call on the \nIsraeli Government to show realism and political courage, and we urge all \nparties to have a sense of history. It is only in that way that peace can be \nrestored and that the Arab world and Israel can draw upon their rich common \nheritage and their vast economic potential. \nTo face these challenges and realize the potential that is present \ndespite all the problems, we need greater solidarity, both among people and \namong nations. I am thinking of a \\\"general agreement on solidarity\\\". As \ndistinct from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, this moral contract \nwould make possible the effective implementation of all the provisions of the \nUnited Nations Charter. This presupposes awareness that we all share the same \nfuture and that we agree to bear an equal interest in the maintenance of \npeace, the promotion of human rights and democracy both nationally and \nworldwide, the struggle against poverty and the protection of the \nenvironment. There is no lack of opportunity: let us begin at this session \nof the General Assembly. Clearly, this would be the best way to move towards \nthe new world order to which we all aspire. \nTo be sure, with respect to the maintenance of peace, the United \nNations to which we pay an enthusiastic tribute - under the dynamic \nleadership of the Secretary-General is making notable efforts to respond to \nthe many demands upon it. \n\nTo be sure, in the Middle East, in the rest of Asia, in Africa and in \nEurope, United Nations peace-keeping forces, in most of which my country is \nproud to participate, are carrying out their missions courageously, loyally \nand effectively, and for the most part to the great satisfaction of the \npeoples of those regions. \nWe must, however, recognize that this universal Organization is not \nequally successful everywhere its intervention is desired and necessary. \nOften this is because of the Charter requirement that regional organizations \nplay the primary role in the settlement of regional disputes, but we must \nrealize that their effectiveness is limited in the case of armed confrontation \nbecause they do not have the means required for peace-keeping operations. \nI believe that fidelity to the spirit of the Charter in this regard \nrequires the establishment and operation of a system of co-operation between \nthe United Nations and the regional organizations so that they may benefit \nfrom appropriate technical and financial assistance and thus can become more \ninvolved in the management and settlement of regional conflicts. I am happy \nto note that this is the thrust of the report of the Secretary-General \nentitled \\\"Agenda for peace\\\". \nIn any case, this is what should flow from our concern to preserve our \ncollective security. That is clear militarily, but it is also increasingly \ntrue with regard to the other aspects of security. No one is unaware that \nthose aspects are equally important. Thus the strong solidarity I have been \nadvocating, through the \\\"general agreement on solidarity\\\", presupposes also \nthe resumption of the North-South dialogue. More exactly, it will be a \nquestion of engagement in a new dialogue between the developed and the \ndeveloping countries. I say \\\"new\\\" because the dialogue would be imbued with \n\nthe spirit of partnership and agreement to joint responsibility in facing \ncommon challenges: challenges involved in economic and trade problems as well \nas environment and health. The General Assembly could ask the \nSecretary-General to make concrete proposals along those lines at its next \nsession. \nI am among those who believe dialogue would be easier if the solidarity \nwe are seeking to promote were indeed effective at the regional level, and it \nwill be necessary for that to be taken into account in the efforts under way \nin the regional groups. \nThat is one of the reasons why Senegal has made the achievement of \nAfrican integration, as advocated in the Treaty setting up the African \nEconomic Community, one of its main priorities in matters of foreign policy. \nThat explains our commitment to the Organization of the Islamic Conference \n(OIC). But a reminder is needed here. The OIC is not a religious \norganization. Its objective is to organize solidarity among its member \nStates, whose peoples are united by the same faith and have the same \nconcerns. It already is a very good tool for political and cultural \nco-operation, and it is our ambition to make it an effective instrument for \neconomic, commercial and technical co-operation. The Dakar Summit of last \nDecember was a turning-point in this respect. Of the groups that must have \nour attention in the framework of the rebalancing of international economic \nrelations, I must mention the Summit Group for Consultation and the \nSouth-South Co-operation Group, the so-called Group of 15, whose goal is to \nmake South-South co-operation effective through the drawing up and \n\nimplementation of specific projects. But I hasten to make it clear that that \ngroup is not a closed club; indeed, everything that is discussed there is at \nthe disposal of the other developing countries; nor does it claim to be a \nspokesman for the entire South. However, I am convinced that it does \nconstitute a framework for the definition of the common concerns of the \ncountries of the South with regard to specific questions, and for the \nexpression of their views. Moreover, it has drawn up and circulated a \nposition paper on the new world order. \nReturning to the North-South dialogue and to the \\\"general agreement on \nsolidarity\\\", which should promote the dialogue while belief in it may be \nunrealistic, and the meetings that have taken place so far have been rather \ndisappointing for the most part, the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro last \nJune has given us reason for greater optimism. Indeed, while far from \nperfect, it worked for the taking into account, in the long term, of all the \nconcerns and perspectives of the world. It is not an exaggeration to say that \nafter Rio nothing is the same as before in approaching environmental problems \nand their interrelationship with development. What is even better, the change \nthat has taken place thanks to a real awareness of the globalization of \nmankind's problems could be the dawn of the new world order. The forthcoming \nconvening of certain international conferences gives us the opportunity to \nconfirm and amplify on that change. \nI believe that the World Conference on Human Rights planned for 1993 and \nthe International Conference on Population and Development to take place in \n1994 reflect our common willingness to deal with questions that no longer know \nany borders. The same is true of the Fourth World Conference on Women and the \nWorld Summit on Social Development, both planned for 1995. \n\nIs it not significant that those meetings were programmed after the Rio \nSummit on Environment and Development, as well as the World Summit for \nChildren? In any case, we must hope that, like their two predecessors, these \nother conferences will not lose sight of the need to ensure the follow-up on \ndecisions and recommendations that would make their work fruitful. \nIn this regard it is a pleasure for me to announce on this day, which \ncoincides with the second anniversary of the World Summit for Children, that, \nin the spirit of that historic meeting, an international conference on \nassisting African children, organized by the Organization of African Unity \nwith the support of UNICEF, will take place in Dakar from \n25 to 27 November 1992. Our goal is to bring the international community to a \npoint where it thinks about the special situation of African children and the \ndifficulties facing the African countries with regard to ensuring their \nharmonious development, or indeed their mere survival. This situation and \nthese problems will also be focused on in meetings to be held soon devoted to \nchildren in French-speaking countries and also within the framework of the OIC. \nWhile reflecting a real awareness of the interdependence of the world, at \nwhich we rejoice, the programme of international meetings I have just \nmentioned shows that much remains to be done in this vast field through joint \nefforts. In particular I have in mind disarmament for the benefit of \ndevelopment, the easing of the foreign debt burden of the developing \ncountries, the removal of protectionist tariff barriers, the improvement of \ncommodity prices, and the transfer of the technology and human resources \nnecessary for development. No one denies that today our collective survival \nlargely depends upon adequate consideration of these questions and the \nchallenges of the environment, AIDS and drugs not to mention the problem of \npeace-keeping operations. \n\nHence, it is urgent to achieve greater solidarity, to which I referred \nearlier. Moreover, there is a central role that the United Nations must play \nin dealing with these problems. There is no need to emphasize that such a \nrole requires that this universal Organization review its methods of work and \nthat Member States reassess the means made available to the United Nations. \nIn Africa and within the Islamic Ummah we recognize the importance of the \nrestructuring and other work to restore dynamism to our Organization being \ncarried out by the Secretary-General and by such organs as the Economic and \nSocial Council, which is intended to cope with the new burdens arising from \nworld developments. On their behalf, I welcome the results already achieved \nin this regard, and I encourage a continuation of those efforts until they are \nsuccessful and the goals are reached. I particularly hope that this new trend \nwill duly take account of what are in our view two essential ideas on the \none hand, peace and security are precarious without the eradication of poverty \nand misery and without a reduction of the gap separating the North and the \nSouth; on the other hand, efforts towards effectiveness should not sacrifice \nthe democratic spirit by which the universality of the United Nations is \nmaintained. \nMoreover, the Tenth Conference of the Heads of State or Government of the \nNon-Aligned Movement, which was just held successfully in Jakarta, bore the \nstamp of renewal in continuity and achieved considerable progress in \nreinforcing that trend. \nGiven the scores of challenges and the ever stronger commitment of the \nnon-governmental organizations working alongside Governments to meet those \nchallenges, I would add the need to take into account the recommendations of \nthose organizations. I am thinking even that we could study the possibility. \n\nthrough the efforts of the Secretary-General, of requiring such \nrecommendations to be taken into account in specific fields. \nI have had the signal honour to address you on behalf of various peoples \nsome of which are separated by thousands of kilometres. But these peoples \nshare with my country Senegal the same faith in human solidarity, the same \nhope for a better tomorrow, even the same goals. United in their diversity, \nthese peoples are calling for justice where it is trampled and peace wherever \nit is threatened. They are calling for the coming of a world in which hunger, \nintolerance and unfairness have disappeared. These peoples call upon you to \nact together, to innovate and to do so without delay. \n\n"

        "file_text": "It is with a special sense of \nsatisfaction that I wish to congratulate Mr. Ganev on his unanimous election \nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. His \ncountry, Bulgaria, is a protagonist in an exhilarating democratization and \nliberalization process that is transforming a whole region and has already \nushered in a new era in international relations. It is therefore most \n\nappropriate that, as a representative of his country and his region, he should \nbe presiding over the General Assembly in these momentous and challenging \ntimes. \nThe exceptional nature of our times is reflected in the fact that over \nthe last eight months 13 countries have become Members of the United Nations. \nWe welcome these new Members, many of which are a direct product of the \ndramatic developments of the last few years. Their membership constitutes a \nfurther welcome affirmation of the universality of our Organisation. \nIn January this year a new Secretary-General took over the charge of the \nUnited Nations. His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali is a most respected \nand long-time friend of Malta. He has brought an impressive dose of energy \nand intellectual force to the task of restructuring the United Nations on the \nsolid foundations left by his predecessor. The international community is \nindeed most fortunate in having individuals of such high calibre and \ndedication consistently in its service. \nBold and far-sighted leadership is of critical importance at the present \njuncture of international relations. Ours is a time when major challenges and \nexceptional opportunities compete with each other for attention and action; a \ntime when hope, rather than fear, colours humanity's vision of its future - a \nvision which places the individual at the centre of all activity and which \nsees as an ultimate and cherished objective the creation of a just and \nprosperous community of nations living in peace and harmony with each other. \nEvents over the past 12 months have brought home the reality that the \ndemise of the cold war did not automatically usher in the era of uninterrupted \npeace, stability and prosperity to which we are all aspiring. Vast problems \nstill remain in the political, social and economic spheres, and at the \nnational, regional and international levels. What is new today is the \n\npossibility for the whole international community to consider these problems \nas a shared burden standing in the path of a common vision. We therefore \nstrive for their resolution on the basis of practical cooperation rather than \nseek to exploit them divisively in the framework of ideological confrontation. \nAt first glance, the emerging world order presents a dark tapestry of \nrekindled ethnic and national rivalries, massive economic disparities, \nextensive and irreversible environmental degradation, and horrific instances \nof human suffering. In the context of what is happening in the former \nYugoslavia, in Somalia, and elsewhere, it may indeed sound ironic to identify \nthe spirit of cooperation as the touchstone of this new world order. \nYet these unprecedented problems of our times have also generated an \nunprecedented determination for cooperative action at both the regional and \nthe global levels. In cases like Yugoslavia and Somalia, the efforts so far \nundertaken have fallen far short of the needs. Yet the international \ncommunity persists in its collective endeavour to achieve a peaceful solution \nof these problems. In this it finds encouragement in the progress being \nachieved elsewhere, especially in Cambodia, in Central America and in Angola. \nA few days ago Malta joined a large majority of the United Nations \nmembership in deciding to deny the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Serbia and \nMontenegro its claim to succeed the former Socialist Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia, and consequently in calling upon it to reapply for United Nations \nmembership in conformity with the provisions of the Charter. We did so in the \nlight of our shared abhorrence of the atrocities that are taking place in the \nregion of former Yugoslavia. \nIn the Middle East, the peace process launched in Madrid last year \ncontinues upon its fragile but persistent path. In South Africa, the hopes \nfor an early and peaceful dismantlement of the policy of apartheid have ebbed \n\nand flowed in recent months in the wake of alternately encouraging and tragic \nevents. In these instances too, however, the collective determination of the \ninternational community to promote a peaceful and lasting resolution of \nlong-standing problems, on the basis of principles contained in relevant \nUnited Nations resolutions, is pre-eminent. Equally steadfast is the \ncollective determination to bring peace and justice to other still-troubled \npeoples around the globe, in particular the peoples of Cyprus, of Afghanistan \nand of Mozambique. \nIn the year of the Rio Conference we are perhaps particularly conscious \nof the fact that the equitable and sustainable economic and social development \nof all peoples is not only a major objective in its own right; it is an \nindivisible component of international peace and security. The sharp economic \nand social disparities which continue to intensify, both within and among \nnations, pose a direct challenge to the hopes for peace and security raised by \nthe emerging new order in international relations. \n\nThere is growing recognition of the fact that an approach to these \nproblems must be rooted in the notion of global economic interdependence a \nnotion that must inspire concrete action at the global, as well as at the \nregional, level on such questions as international trade, financial flows, \ntransfer of technology and debt relief. Major projects of regional \ncooperation, such as those that are taking place in North America, Western \nEurope and South-East Asia should therefore be conceived of as stepping-stones \ntowards increased trade and economic cooperation at the global level, rather \nthan as attempts to create a set of monolithic and competing trading blocs in \ndifferent parts of the world. \nA successful and balanced outcome of the Uruguay Round of multilateral \ntrade negotiations would go a long way towards providing the necessary \ndefences against any insidious and harmful fragmentation of world trade. \nThe disappearance of super-Power confrontation has perhaps had its most \ndirect and visible impact in the field of disarmament. At the bilateral \nlevel, there have already been significant reductions in the nuclear and \nconventional arsenals of the two major Powers. The prospects for an \nindefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \nand for a comprehensive test-ban treaty are encouraging. At its current \nsession the General Assembly will be considering a draft convention for a \ncomprehensive ban on chemical armaments, including their means of delivery, \nwhich has been finalized by the Conference on Disarmament. \nMalta welcomes these developments and expresses the hope that they are \nthe precursors to further cuts in strategic arsenals, especially as regards \nweapons of mass destruction, thereby releasing resources to be used for \nmuch-needed development purposes. At the same time, however, we should not \n\nlose sight of other, less rosy, aspects of the disarmament question, that now, \nmore than before, assume greater relevance in the context of efforts towards \nreducing tensions and enhancing international security. This is the case in \nparticular with regard to regional disarmament. \nThe proliferation of armaments, conventional or otherwise, at the \nregional level is a matter of serious concern. It is a factor that directly \nand negatively affects security and stability at both regional and broader \nlevels. At the same time, it absorbs scarce resources that could otherwise be \nutilized for economic and social development. \nThe European experience, through the Conference on Security and \nCooperation in Europe (CSCE), has been that the progressive reduction of \nmutual suspicion through the adoption of confidence- and security-building \nmeasures plays a significant role in creating the necessary conditions for \ndisarmament at the regional level. Transparency is an important aspect of \nconfidence-building. \nIn this context, the setting up by the General Assembly last year of the \nRegister of Conventional Arms was an important first step, which Malta had \nindeed advocated as far back as the late 1960s. It is hoped that this \ninitiative will be followed up, within the various regions, by determined \nefforts towards other concrete measures of confidence building. \nThe United Nations system is today being called upon to play a \ndetermining role in a vast and bewildering array of problems. Our \nOrganization was originally conceived in the perspective of global \ncooperation, not of super-Power confrontation. After a 45-year gap, it is \nonly now, with the dawning of an era of cooperation, that it can therefore \nbegin to operate fully in pursuit of its essential vocation for peace and \n \nunderstanding among nations. It is essential that we all play our part in \nensuring that it has the necessary resources, and appropriate structures, to \nfulfil its tasks. \nThe original United Nations structures combine the principle of equality \nwith the pragmatic differentiation of roles and responsibilities arising from \ndifferent capabilities and historical circumstances. In the field of peace \nand international security, the two complementary poles of the United Nations \nsystem are the General Assembly and the Security Council. A dynamic \nrelationship between these two organs remains the prerequisite for the \ncredible and effective functioning of the United Nations in the field of peace \nand international security. \nMany of the issues related to these matters have been impressively \nexamined in two reports prepared by the Secretary-General during the course of \nthis year. The first is the report entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". The \nsecond is his first annual report to the General Assembly. These reports \ncontain a wealth of new ideas and proposals dealing with the evolving role of \nthe United Nations in preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping, and \nthe promotion of economic and social development. These ideas provide us with \nan excellent stimulus to rethink the role that the United Nations can and \nneeds to play if the end of the cold war is to become the beginning of a \nconstructive peace. \nIn his reports, the Secretary-General also pays special attention to \nregional cooperation, which is increasingly being seen as a useful, indeed a \nnecessary, complement to multilateral action at the global level. \nPerhaps what is most needed in this regard is that regional and global \nactions be better harmonized and made to dovetail into each other. This is \n\none reason why Malta proposed to the CSCE and the proposal was endorsed at \nthe Helsinki summit in July that the CSCE be designated as a regional \narrangement under Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. \nLikewise, Malta has been urging for some years that the provisions for \nthe establishment of technology development centres related to regional seas \nenvisaged in the Convention on the Law of the Sea be put into effect in such \nobvious contexts as the Mediterranean, the Caribbean and the South Pacific. \nWe have also urged that these functional centres should illustrate the new \nconcepts of governance that have emerged as most appropriate to the new world \norder that is, their governing bodies should include not only \nrepresentatives of States, but also non-governmental bodies, whether set up on \na national or on a plurinational basis. Such centres would be geared both to \nencouraging the transfer of technology and also, and perhaps more important, \nto promoting co-development of new, locally adapted technology. \nAs a European country, Malta seeks to participate as actively as possible \nin the many-faceted and far-reaching initiatives for regional cooperation that \nare unfolding on the European continent. Recent developments in our region \nhave injected new life and vigour into longstanding institutions such as the \nCouncil of Europe and the Economic Commission for Europe, whose pioneering \nrole in many areas of economic and social development at the regional level \nhas always been recognized. From the darkest days of the cold war, the CSCE \nsought its vocation in the merging of the strict issues of disarmament with \nthe wider aspects of cooperation in the economic, social and humanitarian \nfields. For nearly four decades the European Community has slowly and \npainstakingly forged a path towards regional economic and political \n \nintegration which, in spite of the present difficulties, represents the best \nguarantee for a secure and prosperous future for all the peoples of this \nhistorically troubled continent. \nMalta sees in its aspiration to become a full member of the European \nCommunity a natural culmination of its European identity and of the role it \nhas played over the years in promoting European cooperation, within the \nCouncil of Europe, the Economic Commission for Europe and the CSCE. For us, \nmembership of the European Community is an overriding political objective \nfounded upon the conviction that such membership offers us the best prospects \nfor political, economic and social development while permitting us to play our \nrightful role in a unique experiment for regional integration. \n\nOur geographical location in the centre of the Mediterranean has also \nmade us conscious of the issues which were so effectively highlighted at this \nyear's United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, notably the \nawareness of the fragility of our planet Earth and the intimate relationship \nthat exists between human development and ecological stability. The General \nAssembly at this session has an important task in following up the decisions \ntaken at Rio, with regard both to the implementation of the proposals and \nrecommendations contained in Agenda 21 and also to the establishment of the \nnew commission for sustainable development. \nIn this context, Malta shares the view that, in the endeavour to \nrestructure and adapt the United Nations system better to deal with the issues \nof the new world order, a revitalized role could be found for the Trusteeship \nCouncil as a guardian of the common heritage of future generations, to replace \nits fast disappearing role as trustee of dependent Territories. \nOver the 28 years of its United Nations membership, Malta has taken \nparticular pride in identifying its commitment to multilateralism, especially \nthrough its many initiatives on issues related to the environment as it \nconstitutes a common concern of mankind. It is worth noting that this year \nmarks the twenty-fifth anniversary of Malta's proposal to the General Assembly \nthat the seabed and ocean floor be reserved exclusively in the interests of \nmankind. Also this year we have been gratified to see our latest initiative, \nrelated to the protection of climate for present and future generations, \nresulting in the signing of the Framework Convention on Climate Change by over \n150 nations. We earnestly hope that the ratification of the Convention will \nproceed quickly to ensure its early coming into force. \n\nThe basic starting-point and the goal of our activities is the well-being \nof the individual in society. The importance of the human dimension in all \nour endeavours should not and cannot be underestimated. It is in this context \nthat Malta attaches fundamental importance to issues of human rights. Over \nthe years, the United Nations has elaborated major instruments relating to \nhuman rights, starting with the Universal Declaration and leading up to the \nCovenants on civil and political, economic, social and cultural rights, and \nthe Convention against torture, to all of which Malta is a party. \nCollective action aimed at ensuring the effective protection of the \nrights enshrined in these documents should not, in our view, be unduly \nconstrained by arguments over issues of national sovereignty. We believe that \nthe Commission on Human Rights and other relevant bodies should have their \nmandates enlarged beyond their present monitoring role along the lines of the \nrelevant institutions within the Council of Europe. We look forward to the \nUnited Nations Conference on Human Rights due to be held in Vienna next year, \nin the hope that effective and bold steps will be taken in the endeavour \nfurther to safeguard and guarantee the fullest possible enjoyment of human \nrights at the individual level throughout the world. \nThis year the General Assembly will be holding special commemorations on \nthe conclusion of the Decade for Disabled Persons and on the tenth anniversary \nof the adoption of the International Action Plan for the Elderly. Over the \nyears, Malta has taken an active role on the question of the elderly and the \naged, a subject which it first brought to the attention of the General \nAssembly in the late 1960s. Today Malta hosts an International Institute on \nAging that plays a leading role in the promotion of new ideas and training in \nthe field of ageing. \n\n1995, the year marking the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, \nwill be devoted to two important conferences relating to social development \nthe World Summit on Social Development and the Fourth World Conference on \nWomen. We welcome these, together with the 1994 International Conference on \nPopulation and Development, as a further indication of the growing commitment \nof our Organization to the importance of the human dimension in international \ncooperation a commitment which has been reinforced by the recent creation of \nthe Office of Humanitarian Affairs within the Secretariat and which, as our \nSecretary-General so eloquently states in his report to the General Assembly, \nis renewed daily through the quiet heroism of the many individuals working in \nthe field under the aegis of the United Nations throughout the globe. \nIn spite of the many difficulties and recognized weaknesses, we all \nacknowledge how fortunate our generation is in its possession of such a global \norganization as the United Nations, founded upon a Charter which encapsulates \nthe highest and most lasting ideals of humankind. It is my privilege to take \nthis opportunity to rededicate the commitment of the Government and people of \nMalta to the United Nations. \n"

        "file_text": "It\tgives me pleasure to convey my sincere congratulations to Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I am confident that he will devote his rich experience and diplomatic expertise to ensuring the success of this session.\nI am also pleased to welcome the new States that have recently joined the membership of the United Nations.\nThe great hopes for the emergence of a world enjoying peace, stability, economic growth, justice, and equality for all remain in all our minds. But we cannot help wondering whether the international community is any closer today to realizing these hopes than it was in the past. The rapid developments and radical changes that have taken place in the world since 1989 still continue apace. These developments and changes have led the world situation to the threshold of a new era, whose features have not become clear yet. He can say, however, that our world today - despite the end of' the ideological conflict that divided a large part of the world into two blocs, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Harsaw Pact - continues to be unstable, and continues to be prey to racial conflicts and armed disputes in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America.\nOn the other hand, the economic crisis has intensified, bringing greater misery to the developing countries, which experience famines of unprecedented magnitude in modern history. All indications point to an exacerbation of the division of the world into North and South, a world without equality, justice, or equity between the rich and strong countries of the North and the poor and weak countries of the South. These signs also warn against the advent of a new era of big-Power hegemony not only over weaker States but also over all international organizations with a view to using them as instruments to implement their policies and serve their interests.\nThe challenges which face us, particularly in the developing countries, make it imperative for the United Nations to discharge its responsibilities under the Charter, with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security, within the framework of a world order in which the United Nations, through the collective will of all its Member States, should play an effective and influential role in protecting the sovereignty and independence of the Member States and in achieving the economic and social development which constitutes the greatest and principal challenge to the developing countries.\nHowever, actual reality shows that the United Nations, which continues to strive to attain these aspirations, faces many obstacles that impede its progress towards them. The most prominent hurdle is the attempt by one State or group of States to impose hegemony over the policies of the United Nations and its institutions. The most flagrant aspect of that hegemony is what has been taking place in the Security Council since the course of international changes acquired its new, accelerated pace. As a result of this hegemony, which is being spearheaded and intensified by the United States of America, resolutions and measures adopted by the Security Council have become conspicuous for their double standard and selectivity in applying the text of the United Nations Charter. In so doing, the Security Council has distanced itself from the letter and spirit of the principles enshrined in the Charter and from the provisions of international law and the principles of justice and fairness that are necessary if a balance is to be maintained between the obligations and the rights of Member States. \nThere is no doubt that this imbalance will lead inevitably to opportunistic dealings that may very well stem from the ability of the stronger to deal and not from the foundations established in the Charter for the relationship between the Council and Member States. Such a state of affairs would pose a grave threat to peace and security on both the regional and the international levels.\nWhat Iraq has been subjected to over the past two years, and the practices it continues to face under the cover of so-called international legality, are the most telling examples of double standards selectivity, and of the failure to strike a balance between rights and obligations.\nThe will of the Security Council has become divorced from the Charter and its resolutions have been transformed into political practices aimed at destabilizing a State Member of the United Nations, undermining its security, starving its people and depriving its sick and ailing citizens of the medicine they need. All this is being done to serve declared political objectives that in no way relate to the letter or spirit of the United Nations Charter or to the rules of international law.\nIn the name of international legality and under its cover, Iraq has been made the victim of an all-out war that has destroyed its economic installations and the infrastructures of its civilian life in a manner that is unprecedented in modern history. The motive behind this overkill and arbitrary use of armed force against Iraq was to throw a whole people back into the pre-industrial age, as then United States Secretary of State Baker told the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, in the course of their Geneva meeting on 9 January 1991. The studies and reports of the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations have highlighted the magnitude of the destruction inflicted upon Iraq as a result of that aggression and the subsequent huge losses sustained as a result of the blockade and the embargo. I do not need to go into the details of those reports, which contain the findings of people commissioned by the United Nations and which have been distributed as official United Nations documents.\nNotwithstanding all the excesses and the untold iniquities perpetrated against Iraq, we have striven in all sincerity and earnestness to honor our commitments vis-a-vis the resolutions of the Security Council and to cooperate with United Nations organs in doing all that is required of Iraq in every field. Many acts of provocation have been committed by persons who have been planted in the mechanisms entrusted with the implementation of Security Council resolutions with the aim of obstructing Iraq's discharge of its commitments and thereby making Iraq appear to be rejecting the resolutions of the Security Council. The obvious aim has been the creation of a climate that would justify new military strikes against Iraq and block any consideration of lifting the unjust and iniquitous blockade imposed upon it.\nHowever, we have been able to foil the efforts aimed at achieving that evil objective and all the attempts made with the aim of creating crises between the United Nations and Iraq have been contained. Iraq has demonstrated full cooperation with the United Nations in order to ensure the sound and balanced implementation of the resolutions of the Security Council.\nWhile Iraq is earnestly striving to implement its commitments vis-a-vis Security Council resolutions, we have yet to see the Council take any step towards lifting the blockade or even loosening its economic shackles which it has imposed upon the people of Iraq and which have had very grave effects indeed on the daily lives of the Iraqi people at every level.\nIt has become evident from the firm determination of the Security Council not to ease the comprehensive economic sanctions imposed upon Iraq that the Council does not follow the rule of balancing obligations and rights, but is rather acting in line with declarations of the officials of the countries that exercise hegemony over the Council that the economic blockade against Iraq will never be lifted until Iraq's political system is overthrown.\nHere, we feel entitled to pose a question to the whole world from this rostrum, asking whether the Security Council, in dealing thus with a State Member of the United Nations, has acted on the basis of the provisions of the Charter, international law and the principles of justice and fairness, or whether the Council has succumbed to the will and diktat of the Powers that exercise hegemony over it with a view to serving those Powers' interests before all else.\nThe present relationship between the Security Council and Iraq does not fall within the framework of implementing the resolutions of the Council but rather within the framework of implementing the foreign policy objectives of a very limited number of States. If those States, which are led by dubious policies in the United States, were to be given a free hand, then the grave danger would spill over beyond Iraq and engulf other nations; it would spill over beyond the present and engulf the future. The campaigns of threats and intimidation under the cover of the Charter continue unabated in order to create the appropriate climate for continuing the economic blockade against Iraq and justifying new military strikes against it with the aim of destabilizing its political system and finishing off its vital economic installations and infrastructures which are still suffering from the impact of the first military strike.\u2003A flagrant example of the injustices to which Iraq is being subjected within the framework of this relationship can be seen in the practices of the sanctions Committee set up under Security Council resolution 661 (1991). This Committee too is subject to the rule of veto despite its camouflage as a committee conducting its work on the basis of consensus.\nAs I have informed the Secretary-General in official letters citing factual instances, a review of that Committee's work would show how the objection of one or two members of the Committee is sufficient to prevent any response to Iraq's basic needs and even to make it ignore the special exemptions stated in the resolutions concerning civilian needs in such spheres as food, electricity, agriculture, water and sewage, medical and educational requirements, and clothing. \nIraq has been allowed, in theory, to import food and medicine. But, for two years now, Iraqi assets have been frozen while Iraq has not been able to sell any oil or export any other commodity in order to pay for its basic humanitarian needs. On top of all this, we see attempts now being made to seize completely Iraqi frozen assets abroad through a draft resolution currently tabled before the Security Council. This draft resolution has no justification or legality whatsoever, not even in the light of the pretexts contained in the draft itself. Iraq has cooperated, in good faith and in earnest, with the United Nations Secretariat in order to reach an agreement on the export of quantities of Iraqi oil and the use of the revenues thereof to provide for basic civilian needs and cover United Nations costs. The reason an agreement is yet to be reached has been the refusal of certain countries in the Security Council to remove from any prospective agreement their humiliating political preconditions, which are not in any way related to the substance of the agreement desired.\nIraq is prepared to address this question according to the following formula first, that Iraq be allowed to export crude oil and oil products to produce a net return of no less than $4 billion for a period of six months, which may be extended for a further period if by then the embargo of Iraqi oil exports has not been completely lifted.\nSecondly, that the net returns of the exports be deposited in an escrow account set up by the United Nations, then to be used for the purchase of foodstuffs, medicines and other essential civilian needs, the importation of which will be subject to the special measures of the Committee established under Security Council resolution 661 (1990).\nThirdly, that the Security Council name certain countries from which goods may be purchased according to normal commercial practices.\u2003\nIraq is prepared to grant 5 per cent of the net return of this operation to the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies as a contribution towards international relief work in Somalia/ for the benefit of the Palestinian people through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Middle East, in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in other areas.\nThis will be donated in keeping with Iraq's humanitarian principles and outlook. \nIn April 1991 the United Nations began its humanitarian relief program to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people with simple and limited means. Interference from parties hostile to Iraq began to surface in order to influence the course of the program by using it as a pretext and a gateway through which to interfere in the internal affairs of Iraq. It became clear that the program dealt with the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people according to the political desires, intentions and schemes of the countries presenting the aid, a fact attested to by some officials in the program.\nTherefore, the humanitarian program has not assumed, in actual application, the effectiveness that would have made it possible to achieve its desired humanitarian objectives. Iraq reiterates the necessity for the United Nations humanitarian program to remain within the framework of purely humanitarian objectives, away from political considerations and from the tendency to interfere in the internal affairs of Iraq. We are prepared to cooperate in the achievement of any purely humanitarian goal sought by the United Nations.\u2003\nCalls and allegations are increasingly made about alleged violations of human rights in Iraq. The parties that waged a destructive war on Iraq in the name of international legality would like to forget that the suffering of the people of Iraq resulted from their own actions which constitute the most flagrant violation of human rights witnessed by humanity in all its history.\nI ask here, before this international gathering: what words can describe\nan action in which one hundred twenty-five thousand tons of explosives were dropped on the people of Iraq, bringing death to thousands of its children, men and women of all ages, and raining destruction upon all its vital economic installations, its civilian, residential centers and its schools, hospitals, formula milk plants, kindergartens and houses of worship? Is this not a most flagrant violation of human rights and negation of all moral and human values and standards, in addition to being a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the covenants related to it?\nThe false accusations being leveled at Iraq are the stuff of lies, rumors and distortions. They go nowhere near the very minimum of any objective, impartial or reasoned approach.\nThe real motive behind this orchestrated vociferous campaign is to serve the very same political objectives that were behind the military aggression perpetrated against Iraq and that are still operative in the continued economic blockade against Iraq, the starving of its people, the trumped up pretexts of interference in its internal affairs and the undermining of its national unity. The so-called no-fly zone over southern Iraq has been imposed by a decision of the United States, Britain and France, this time nakedly, without any Security Council cover, thus underscoring the flagrant aggressive policy currently pursued in order to partition Iraq rather than defend its \\\"civilians\\\"/ as the Western imperialist countries claim while they maintain their embargo against Iraq after having killed thousands of its civilian population through an aerial onslaught with bombs whose explosive force equaled that of a number of atomic bombs of the type that removed Hiroshima from the face of the earth. It is these very countries that continue to impose an embargo even on toys for the children of Iraq.\nNo one can deny that the main cause of suffering among the people of Iraq was the military aggression that destroyed Iraq's economic infrastructure and brought to a halt its services. The suffering has also been caused, and further intensified, by the continued imposition of this iniquitous blockade, which has visited yet more economic hardship and human suffering on the people of Iraq, in addition to continued foreign interference in the internal affairs of the country, the creation of problems and fueling of internal conflicts and obstruction of the efforts of the central Government to carry out their duties and discharge their responsibilities towards the maintenance of law and order and preserve security and stability.\nThe only way to put an end to this injustice and ensure some justice is to lift the embargo imposed upon Iraq and allow its people to rebuild what has been destroyed and resume their normal life. With its known potential, Iraq is a country that can do without donations given by this or that country as a\ncover for well-known intentions. Indeed, Iraq can participate effectively in providing humanitarian assistance to countries in other regions of the world where such assistance is needed, once it regains its economic health. It had been providing such assistance before the blockade. Instances of this are numerous indeed, in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and many of the representatives listening to this statement know quite well that this is a fact.\nThe circumstances which were used as a pretext for imposing the blockade against Iraq no longer exist. Therefore, lifting the blockade is an urgent necessity on the legal and humanitarian levels. As a matter of fact, this step ought to have been taken immediately after the disappearance of the circumstances to which I have just referred. Persistence in imposing the blockade constitutes a naked violation of the letter and spirit of the Security Council resolutions, contravenes all humanitarian principles and values, and must make it clear to the representatives here, as it has made clear to us, that the reasons behind it are and have been the inhuman intentions harbored against Iraq by well-known parties, now and in the past.\nIt is indeed, in the interest of the human rights of the people of Iraq, that neighboring countries should abide by the terms of international agreements and undertakings and desist from sending infiltrators into our country to perpetrate acts of murder, robbery and plunder against persons and property of the civilian population, as well as against the State assets, just as they perpetrated their criminal acts against us in March and April 1991, as I believe everyone now knows.\nThe Security Council's silence with regard to the criminal acts and\noperations of military aggression perpetrated in Palestine, Lebanon and other occupied Arab territories by the pampered and American-veto-protected Zionist entity are the most damning proof that the practices of the Security Council are devoid of justice and international legality because of the total domination by the United States over the Council and its procedures.\nThe violations that the Zionist entity has committed over the years, and continues to commit with impunity, against the people of Palestine and the other occupied Arab territories - in breach of the principles enshrined in the Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Conventions of 1949, as well as in resolutions of the United Nations would take an entire volume to list if those Israeli practices were to be classified according to the breach of every article and paragraph dealing with human rights and the rights of nations.\nIn return for all these policies of aggression and expansionism, the annexation of lands, the displacement of populations, and the killing and repression of civilians under military occupation, the Zionist entity receives nothing less than ever increasing political, military and economic aid which enables it to persist with impunity in its policies of aggression against the Palestinian people and its denial of their most basic and inalienable right the right to return to their homeland and to establish an independent State in Palestine under the leadership of their sole legitimate representative, the PLO.\nOn the other hand, the importance of the Security Council vis-a-vis the armed conflicts that are currently raging in a number of regions, and its inability to address the attendant human tragedies as in the case of Somalia, whose plight is one of the most horrendous human calamities, are further proof of the double standards and politically motivated considerations that govern the conduct of the Security Council and the measures that it adopts in accordance with the wishes and dictates of the United States of America - the Power that dominates the Council.\nI wish, in conclusion, to point out that the peoples of the world as a whole do look forward to the day when the United Nations will play a real and effective role in bringing about a world of security, stability and prosperity. However, that day will come only when the Organization applies the letter and spirit of its Charter and the principles of international law in dealing with the major issues of mankind. That day will come only when the United Nations refuses to bow to any pressure or blackmail and, thereby, avoids becoming hostage to the will of the big Powers and refuses to be sidetracked from the noble human objectives that it was established to achieve.\nUnless such a state of affairs pertains clearly and decisively, as the States of the world that are jealous of their independence and freedom hope, the world will suffer disastrous consequences and the very foundations of the United Nations will be weakened as non-compliance with the United Nations Charter would put into question the very credibility of the Organization, and that might result in bringing upon it the same fate that overtook the old League of Nations, or some such undesirable fate.\n"

        "file_text": "\tOn\tbehalf of my Government and the people\nof Jamaica, I take this opportunity to congratulate you. Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I am confident that your vision and energy will guide this session to a successful conclusion.\nI must also take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has assumed the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations at a most challenging period for this Organization and a turning point in the history of world affairs.\nHe are all gathered here today to present our varying viewpoints about the many issues which are of concern to us as individual nations and as a world body. That in itself gives all of us a sense of hope that our problems, which loom so large on the world horizon, are not insoluble if we all determine to use this forum as a vehicle for working together to solve them.\nIn the past the admission of new Member States has been largely the result of the decolonization processes in Asia, the Pacific, Africa and the Caribbean. The current phenomenon of new States from Europe signals the fundamental realignment of political boundaries on that continent. I wish formally, on behalf of the Government and people of Jamaica, to welcome warmly the 13 new Members to the family of the United Nations.\u2003We meet in the aftermath of fundamental changes in the political landscape which have profound implications for each of us as individual nations. They also impact on the world community collectively and therefore on the agenda and future activities of this Organization. The end of the cold war heralds a new era in which the United Nations is expected to take decisive action based on the merits of each issue, rather than in response to fixed ideological positions buttressed by the use of veto power.\nThe world economy is experiencing revolutionary alteration. No country, developed or developing, is immune. In all of this, the fundamental and unchanging reality is the widening gap between the relatively few rich industrialized countries of the North and the many poor developing ones in the South.\nIn so many ways so much has changed, and yet so much remains the same.\nIt was 12 years ago, in 1980, that as Foreign Minister of my country I last addressed the Assembly. It was a time of great optimism. There was ongoing dialog between North and South. He seemed to share a common understanding of the requirements for international cooperation and development. Barely had the decade of the 1980s begun than the dialog abruptly ended. The international economic environment became even more unfavorable. The developing countries of the South were left to grapple with enormous external debt. Most of us spent the decade undertaking major structural reform.\nThe painful adjustment has weighed heavily on the poor and the vulnerable. Only now are we beginning to see prospects for growth and development as a result of these reforms. It is important that a favorable international economic environment be established so as to complete the process. It is imperative that the United Nations, this universal\nOrganization, play a central role in enabling mankind to meet the challenges and grasp the present opportunities.\nAll Member States, be they large or small, have the right to articulate their views and express their aspirations. Me have an equal obligation to contribute to finding a common solution. Today I address my remarks from the perspective of my own country, which exemplifies in many respects the goals and concerns of the developing world.\nWhen Jamaica joined the United Nations in 1962 we recognized that to make a better life for our people we were required to consolidate our democracy, respect human rights, ensure the rule of law and promote racial, religious, and cultural tolerance. Ours is a society which reflects a varied mosaic \\\"Out of many, one people\\\" is our motto. Ideally, this mirrors the central purpose of the United Nations \\\"Out of many nations, one world\\\".\nTo achieve sustainable development and fulfill the promise of a better life for our people, we must create the conditions for economic growth and development for all our countries. To achieve this, we must reduce the vulnerability of developing countries to external shocks. I call upon the General Assembly to issue a summons to all Member States for a new agenda which provides the basic conditions for human survival everywhere.\nOver the past 45 years the peacemaking function of this Organization has been circumscribed by the dictates of the cold war. The threat of a nuclear holocaust was averted not so much by reason but by the certainty of mutually assured destruction. The United Nations was relegated to the role of spectator, fearful of the consequences, but powerless to act. Peace and security in many regions was breached. This often reflected the surrogate conflicts between the super-Powers, exploiting the reality of economic disparities and nationalist or ethnic animosities.The United Nations can no longer remain impotent to prevent conflict/ to make peace/ to build peace and to keep the peace. The Secretary-General's \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" contains many innovative proposals in these areas. They provide a constructive basis on which Member States may formulate effective responses to conflicts, actual or potential, around the world. Jamaica will contribute to the search for a full consensus on the effective role for the United Nations and its organs in the new scenario. The interface between the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council and the International Court of Justice can best provide the requisite framework for legitimacy, authority and the operational context of international law.\nWe note the hopeful signs that are emerging in South Africa, the Middle East, Cambodia and the Korean peninsula. The current round of direct negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors is an encouraging development which Jamaica fully supports. But there is still a long way to go in achieving the goals of peace and security. The world community cannot afford to relax either its vigilance or its commitment to a just and lasting resolution of these problems.\nWe began 1992 with hope that the progress towards ending apartheid in South Africa would gain momentum. The referendum in March formally sanctioned the reform process. Hope has turned to despair as violence has continued to pose a serious threat to that process. The blood of South Africans continues to be shed in the long struggle to end the abhorrent system of apartheid. The incidents that have taken place since July in Boipatong and the Ciskei homeland have nearly torpedoed the prospects for peace and the process of negotiating towards democratic rule in South Africa.\nThe Government and people of Jamaica have long supported the anti-apartheid struggle in that country. He were heartened by the appearance of progress. He would not wish to see the process derailed.\nThe international community must signal its clear and unswerving determination to see concrete results that end the cycle of violence and ensure the success of negotiations aimed at achieving a democratic and non-racist society. Jamaica will not be satisfied until there is the reality of one-person, one-vote.\nThere are other areas in urgent need of effective United Nations initiatives. In Central and Eastern Europe, in the Persian Gulf, in South Africa, in Somalia, in Haiti, the problem varies in magnitude and in complexity. There is a real chance that the United Nations can make a significant contribution. It cannot do so without the resources and full support of the rich and powerful nations.\nIn my own region, in the Caribbean country of Haiti, a repressive and illegal regime continues to hold power a year after overthrowing the democratically elected leader of that country. President Jean-Bertrand Aristide remains a virtual exile. Measures taken by the Organization of American States (OAS) to resolve the situation have not yet achieved the hoped for results. In particular, the embargo is being flouted by some European countries and even by some member countries of the OAS itself.\nHe owe it to the people of Haiti and to ourselves to continue support for their cause for a restoration of constitutional rule. All those who espouse freedom must remain resolute in the conviction that the democratic flame which flickered briefly should remain for ever alight in that country.\nThe machinery of the United Nations, in concert with the OAS, must render positive assistance to the Haitian people. We urge the General Assembly to lend its weight in support of the legitimate Government and people of one of its Member States.\nThe Secretary-General has correctly highlighted the importance of the concept of the rule of law in international, no less than in national, affairs. The International Court of Justice should be strengthened and its jurisdiction must be extended to command universal acceptance. Its judgments must have binding force and effect.\nWe would also urge the major industrial countries to give concrete expression to their commitment to international law by ratifying the Convention on the Law of the Sea without delay. The informal consultations initiated by the previous Secretary- General, and still continuing, have resulted in significant progress. The work must now revert to the Preparatory Commission, which has the competence and authority to make the necessary decisions.\nLet us now review the world economic scene and the new agenda on which the Organization must immediately embark.\nThe link between peace, security and economic well-being is recognized by our Charter. It mandates the United Nations to promote the economic and social advancement of all peoples through international action.\nThe break-up of the integrated trading system of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, coupled with the rapid movement to dismantle their centralized economic system and substitute one that is market-oriented, has undoubtedly, in its immediate aftermath, posed severe challenges to the peoples of those countries.\nThe Governments of the Western industrialized countries were quick to recognize the threat to peace and security, if these unstable and chaotic conditions were not effectively and immediately addressed. They have moved with commendable speed to identify and provide the assistance required.\nRegrettably, the same urgency and attention has never been forthcoming in respect of what has been a problem of longer standing, that is far more fundamental and potentially catastrophic. I speak of the ever-widening gap between the affluent countries of the North and the poverty rampant in most countries of the South.\nThe decade of the 1980s brought sustained economic growth and increasing affluence to the industrialized countries and rapid development to the newly industrialized countries of South-East Asia. For the rest of the developing world in Latin America and the Caribbean, in Africa and in the rest of Asia - this has, with few exceptions, been a period of relative, and often actual, decline in economic growth and living standards, exacerbated by rapid population increases.\nThe last decade witnessed a severe fall in commodity prices, the reduction of private- and public-sector flows, and a mounting debt burden which have resulted in outflows to the international financial institutions and to the developed world. Those trends must be halted and reversed*\nIn the search for lasting peace we must prevent increasing poverty for a substantial portion of the human race. The affluent also have a vital interest in the reduction of human misery. This is no time for recrimination as to who created this fundamental problem. He must all be part of finding an urgent solution to avoid political instability and social unrest.\nMost of our countries have embarked with determination on the difficult task of economic restructuring. We have been reducing government budgets, opening our economies, emphasizing the pre-eminent role of the private sector and creating conditions for competitive market-driven economies. Undoubtedly, these are necessary prescriptions.\nThere is, however, no denying that in the short run, they have imposed considerable hardships on all sectors of our population, particularly the poorest our women and our children. In this critical situation, a supportive international economic environment is an urgent necessity to mitigate the short-term effects.\nThere is need for a greatly increased flow of public and private financial resources into the countries of the South. We must devise machinery to facilitate the transfer of relevant technology. We must create a climate of international trade which rejects protectionism and stimulates export-led growth.\nOf increasing importance in the world economy is the trend towards regional economic integration movements and the consolidation of trading blocs among the countries of Europe and Worth America.\nFor the developing countries, the trend towards regional integration of economic structures is an essential step in the process of our own development. To the extent that this expands our home market base and promotes the cooperative sharing of financial and technical resources, it will strengthen our economies, increase our purchasing and productive power and contribute positively to the growth of world trade. From this exercise we\nwill all benefit.\nThe developed countries already control the major share of world trade, financial resources and technology. If the trading blocs of Europe and North America create defensive mechanisms against each other and establish barriers impenetrable by the rest of the world economy, the result is likely to be a growing marginalization of the developing countries and a concomitant widening of the gap between North and South.\nSuch a process will lead to stagnation and an eventual shrinkage of world trade. An increasing world population alongside the prospect of more impoverished countries is a recipe for explosion.\nA fair trading system is required to encourage the development of regional integration processes among developing countries to recognize their need for temporary preferential and protective measures in specific areas and promote the maximum openness in the economies of the developed countries.\nThis path is essential to a more equitable, prosperous and peaceful world.\nThe iron curtain between East and West has finally been dismantled. It is now high time to bridge the gulf that perpetuates the great divide between the North and the South. This Organization the United Nations - must provide the forum for meaningful dialog and chart the course for practical, effective action.\nThe abatement of cold war tensions, the outbreak of ethnic conflicts, the reality of global interdependence, dictate that the world community must seize this opportune moment to give concentrated focus on a secure peace that rests on the foundations of meaningful development and sustained economic growth for all.\nHe must approach this dialog in sober recognition of the fact that no part of the world can long remain immune to events in any other part. Famine,\ndisease/ ecological degradation/ the desperate migration of people in search of survival, the inhumanity of poverty, cannot indefinitely be ignored by any creature on planet Earth.\nMeaningful development must have a social dimension and must be sustainable. In respect of the former, we welcome the proposal for the convening of a world summit on the theme of social development.\nThe Earth Summit, recently concluded in Brazil, served to underscore the inter-linkages between security, disarmament, debt, trade, technology, the environment and development. Heads of State and Government were obliged to accept the interrelationships of these perennial concerns. We were forced to admit that these issues could not be treated in splendid isolation, but required concerted action. This very admission suggests that the time is propitious for a new beginning.\nThe spirit of Rio must not be lost. Time will tell whether the political will exists for us to cooperate with each other against the common threat to the environment we all share. Mere lip service will not suffice.\nI expect this session of the General Assembly to settle the institutional machinery that ensures decisive action in the period following the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. It will need to address the concerns of small island States and the enhancement of scientific and technological capacity among developing countries.\nJamaica supports the decision to form a high-level commission for sustainable development. We intend to assist the commission fully once the important details of its program of work have been agreed.\nI expect the Assembly also to confront the question of financial resources in order to implement Agenda 21. An initial commitment of at least $600 billion annually is required so that the work we have painstakingly accepted can be adequately implemented.\nThe key donor countries and agencies will need to look at several proposals within the Global Environmental Facility, the International Development Association, regional development banks, private-sector funding and financial transfers from Governments, to see how best a realistic international economic effort can be organized. But we must all resist the tendency to use resources for environmental protection and management as but one more device to bring developing countries under the dictates of the multilateral financial institutions.\nThe development that we seek in the present and the coming century is impossible without managing our environment efficiently. The case for acting in concert is overwhelming. The time for action is now.\nOur agenda of political, economic and environmental changes, which all our citizens demand, no longer permits the United Nations to remain a passive spectator. It must play a catalytic role and assume operational leadership.\nThis makes it imperative that we re-order our priorities. This can be accomplished only in the context of institutional restructuring. The Secretary-General has already demonstrated his own commitment to this process. His proposals have been supplemented by proposals from many other sources. All of this provides a framework and a point of departure for our discussions and decisions in the months ahead, here in the General Assembly and in other organs of the United Nations.\nThe debate must be informed by the principles enshrined in the Charter. The decisions we make must ensure that the vision is realized and our purposes are met. This Organization must always act in a transparent manner so that it is never subverted by the introduction of hegemonism from any quarter. Any new world order must be based on the rule of law. In creating or shaping it, we need to be inclusive, not exclusive. All nations and peoples must be encouraged to satisfy their legitimate aspirations and fulfill their dreams.\nWhile the new spirit of cooperation in the Security Council is a most welcome development, that body must reflect all interests in its determinations. Maintaining the confidence of the General Assembly requires its acceptance of accountability to this body. The role and function of the General Assembly must be enhanced. There must be non-selectivity in the taking of decisions and the consequent action to enforce them.\nDefinitions of human rights are not susceptible to differing interpretations imposed by any one State or group of States. The relevant international covenants on economic, social, cultural, political and civil rights must be universal standards. Once this is accepted we can deal effectively and even-handedly with all violations of human rights wherever they may occur. Resolute international action, based on the Charter and other rules of international law, must be applied.\nOnce more, this Organization is presented with a real opportunity to fulfill its noble purposes and to be an effective instrument in creating a world order of lasting peace, economic prosperity and social justice. Its success depends on the commitment and practical support that we, the sovereign nations that constitute its membership, bring to those purposes.\nThere is a clarion call proclaiming that a new dawn is at hand. If we succeed, the fruits are glorious.\nThe fact is, everything is at stake; we are all at risk, and so we dare\nnot fail.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour \nfor me to extend to you. Sir, my sincere congratulations on your election to \nthe presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the \nUnited Nations. I wish you every success in your high post. I also take this \nopportunity to extend to Ambassador Samir Shihabi, through you, our deepest \nappreciation of the great role he played during his outstanding presidency of \nthe forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. \nI also take the opportunity to commend the outstanding and significant \nrole of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-General of the United \nNations, in promoting the effectiveness of the United Nations through the \nimplementation of the principles and purposes of the Charter. \nMore than two years have passed since the establishment of the Republic \nof Yemen. This national historic achievement has been one of the most \nimportant world events of the beginning of this decade which abounds with \ngreat changes. The dream of the Yemeni people has become an actual reality \nthanks to their deep belief in the inevitability of unity and their persistent \nstruggle to achieve that unity. \n\nThe Yemeni people have earned the admiration of the world through the \nrealization of their unity by peaceful and democratic means. The Constitution \nof the Republic of Yemen emphasizes the commitment of the country to the \nprinciples of democracy. It enshrines the right of all Yemeni citizens fully \nto enjoy their principal freedoms, including the freedom of expression, in \nevery way. It also stipulates respect for their legal and constitutional \nrights, such as the right to unrestricted unionist and political action. \nThe Republic of Yemen, from its very inception, has enjoyed the benefits \nof an active participation in political life by a society that, having evolved \nthrough a multiplicity of political parties, associations and people's \norganizations, recognizes the importance of diversity and the exchange of \nopinions and ideas. \nYemen in its new era is about to end the transitional period and is now \non the threshold of another, more promising, stage. It will hold the first \nelections throughout the country in which all Yemeni people, men and women, \nwill cast their votes and elect the members of the new House of \nRepresentatives in accordance with the Constitution. \nIn the face of all these historic, vital changes, Yemen is confronted by \na number of challenges which include certain economic difficulties that have \nresulted from the return, because of the Gulf crisis and for other reasons, of \nmore than a million expatriates who used to work in neighbouring sisterly \ncountries. On the other hand, parts of Yemen have suffered destructive floods \nand violent earth tremors in the middle region. In addition, these are the \nburdens of providing shelter and sustenance to thousands of our brethren, \nrefugees from sisterly Somalia. \n\nFollowing the proclamation of the Republic of Yemen, my country declared \nthat Yemeni unity was not intended to be set against the interests of any \nState in the region, especially those of neighbouring States and that it was \nproclaimed to contribute to the strengthening of security, stability, \ncooperation and integration in our region. In confirmation of all this the \nYemeni House of Representatives approved the first statement of the Government \nof Unity, which emphasized the willingness of Yemen, for the first time, to \nstart negotiations concerning its borders with neighbouring sister countries \naccording to historical and legal rights and the principles of international \nlaw. In this context, negotiations between Yemen and the sisterly Sultanate \nof Oman concerning borders have reached their final stage. \nOn the question of the borders between Yemen and Saudi Arabia, my country \nreiterated its willingness to consider this question and to discuss it with \nthe sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The initiative of \nPresident Ali Abdullah Saleh, Chairman of the Presidential Council, in which \nhe called upon our brethren in Saudi Arabia to initiate face-to-face meetings \non the question of borders according to historical and legal rights, has had \nits positive impact. Our brethren in Saudi Arabia have responded to the \ninitiative of the Yemeni leadership. The first preparatory ministerial meeting \nbetween the two parties was held in Geneva on 20 July last. During that \nmeeting, proposals were exchanged concerning the holding of the second meeting \nin one of the two capitals, either Sanaa or Riyadh. It has been agreed to \nhold the second meeting at the level of a committee of experts in the city of \nRiyadh later this month. This demonstrates Yemen's determination, in its new \nera, to translate words into actions and to reaffirm, on a practical level, \nthat it seeks to strengthen security and stability, and calls for regional and \nbilateral cooperation between the countries of the Arab peninsula. \n \nThe world hears and witnesses on TV screens the human tragedy experienced \nby the brotherly Somali people. Hundreds of men, women and particularly \nchildren die daily in a cruel and sad manner. \n\nThousands of them die of hunger, and thousands of internecine strife. \nThousands of Somalis flee the country daily to escape this hellish, \ndevastating war and to seek their livelihood. The steps taken by the Security \nCouncil to help the people of Somalia out of their plight have come a bit \nlate. We call for the intensification of international efforts to urgently \nprovide the necessary humanitarian assistance and ensure its delivery to all \nthe Somali people who face death in every part of the country. \nIn this connection, Yemen commends the leading role played by the \nSecretary-General, Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in focusing attention on this \ntragedy, which the international community almost lost sight of in the \nmaelstrom of the many crises buffeting the world. \nWhile we commend the recent increasing efforts by the United Nations and \nother humanitarian organizations to help the Somali people out of their \nplight, we call for addressing the root causes of that tragedy. Hence, the \nUnited Nations is called upon to adopt practical measures in cooperation with \nthe League of Arab States, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the \nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, to search for a political solution to \nthe Somali crisis. Without this, all the world's humanitarian efforts will be \nno more than palliatives. \nYemen has participated in the efforts made in the framework of the Somali \nNational Reconciliation Conference, held in Djibouti last year under the \nauspices of President Hassan Gouled. Unfortunately, however, the national \npower groups in Somalia have failed to implement the resolutions adopted at \nthat conference. Therefore, we appeal to the international community to make \nanother attempt to contain the Somali crisis and to arrive at a definitive \nsolution to the conflict. In this connection, I should like to reiterate \nYemen's willingness to participate anew in any efforts that may be deployed, \n \nhopefully in the very near future, to hold another conference for national \nreconciliation in Somalia and to ensure its success. The plight of Somalia \nhas exceeded all bounds. Let us all hasten to save Somalia from \ndisintegration and fragmentation and to save the Somali people from suffering \nand misery. \nWhen we speak of human suffering, we must mention the bloody events in \nBosnia and Herzegovina, where the people are subjected to acts of murder, \ndestruction and displacement at the hands of the Serbian forces, which have \nadopted the heinous policy of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\". Those forces have persisted \nin their acts of aggression. They continue to incarcerate thousands of people \nfrom Bosnia and Herzegovina - men, women, even the elderly - in concentration \ncamps, in a frightening repeat of horrible Nazi practices. We join the rest \nof the world's countries in calling for an end to these acts of aggression, \nwhich are supported by Belgrade. We also support firmly all the steps and \nmeasures adopted by the Security Council with a view to putting an end to \nthese atrocious massacres and restoring peace to the Balkans. \nThe human tragedies that beset this or that nation and overwhelm this or \nthat people are manifestations of political crises that deteriorate to the \nlevel of military confrontation and armed conflict. No matter how varied the \ncauses and motives of such crises may be and regardless of their differing \ncircumstances, they tend to have one thing in common: namely that it is the \ninnocent civilians and especially the most vulnerable among them, who pay the \nprice and bear the brunt of the blunders of others. Invariably, they become \nthe victims of conflicts and wars without reason or justification, and without \nmercy. \n\nThis is the case with regard to the brotherly people of Iraq, whom the \ninternational community seems to have forgotten after having imposed on them \none of the most cruel and intensive forms of comprehensive economic embargo \never an embargo that has deprived them of all the requirements of civilian \nlife, including those of children and medical care. The Republic of Yemen \ncalls upon the international community to lift the embargo imposed on the \nIraqi people. \nOn another level, Yemen has voiced its concern over the actions taken to \nprevent Iraqi aircraft from flying beyond latitude 32 to the south of Iraq \nunder the pretext of protecting the Shiites. We are certainly against any \narbitrary actions or violations of the human rights of any group of people. \nBut we are also against intervention or interference in the internal affairs \nof any sovereign State. The segmentation of the sovereignty of the State of \nIraq over its territories in the north and the south, in our opinion is not \nconsonant, with the principle of respect for the sovereignty of States. It \ncould lead to the fragmentation of the territorial integrity of Iraq. \nThese days, bilateral negotiations continue between the Arab delegations \nand the Israeli delegation in Washington in pursuance of the peace process, \nwhich is designed to establish a just and durable peace in the Middle East \nunder the auspices of the United States of America and the Russian Federation. \nThe Republic of Yemen, which has previously expressed its support for the \nefforts made by the United States of America and the Russian Federation to \npush forward the, peace process in the Middle East through the peace \nconference, expresses its belief that the ongoing negotiations will not be \nsuccessful unless they proceed from a commitment to adhere to the principle of \nland for peace, according to Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and \n\n338 (1973), and unless Israel agrees to withdraw from all occupied territories \nand to renounce completely the policy of expansion and settlement, especially \nin eastern Jerusalem. This must include the halting of settlement building, \nwhether they are called political or security settlements as well as the \nrecognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, \nincluding the right to sovereignty and independence. \nAt the beginning of this month, the Summit Meeting of the Non-Aligned \nMovement successfully concluded its work. The United Nations has been the \nfocus of special interest in the summit meeting. This is not surprising. The \nUnited Nations has regained its rightful place in the heart of the \ninternational community after having been threatened with marginalization and \natrophy. Its role has been strengthened in forging and coordinating \ninternational relations in all aspects of life. The Security Council has \nstarted to exercise its powers in maintaining international peace and security \nafter several years of inertia. \nAfter discussing the situation of the United Nations and its renewed role \nin the light of new ideas and proposals, including the \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" \nsubmitted by the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and his \nimportant address to the conference, the Conference in Jakarta emphasized the \nimportance of the United Nations as the main international forum for the \nactivity of the Non-Aligned Movement. It also called for the participation of \nthe Movement in the formulation of new international relations, as it embodies \nand represents the interests and aspirations of the developing countries, \nwhich constitute the majority of Members of the United Nations. \n\nIn this context, we welcome the fact that the valuable proposals included \nin the \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" will be discussed not only in the Security Council \nbut also in the General Assembly,as the issue of peace in all its aspects is \nof interest to all the countries and peoples of the world. \nAs for the international economic situation, the meeting in Jakarta noted \nthat, despite the positive changes in the area of international relations, the \neconomic situation of the developing countries has deteriorated further and \nthat, consequently, the United Nations must continue to promote cooperation \nbetween the developing countries and the industrialized countries in a manner \nthat may serve the interests of economic integration in an equitable and \nincreasing context. \nThe Rio conference contributed to informing the world of the need for a \nprocess of sustainable development, so that future generations may not be \nexposed to danger. Therefore, the international community is called upon to \nimplement the international agreements approved by the Conference on \nEnvironment and Development, particularly Agenda 21, which will help to \npromote international cooperation. \nThe Charter of the United Nations will remain the meeting-point and \nsymbol of concord between the countries of the world, large and small. It \nwill also continue to represent the most ideal framework for coordination of \ninternational relations in a manner that promotes international peace and \nsecurity. Today, and after the removal of the restrictions that hindered the \nuse of machinery provided for in the Charter - such as the use of force we \nneed, more than ever, the strictest respect for the Charter to avoid its \nadaptation, or interpretation of its provisions, for the purpose of serving the \nnarrow national interests of any one party. \n\nFor all that, it is imperative that the foundations of democratic \ndealings in international relations be deepened and that balance and \ninteraction between the main organs of the United Nations namely, the \nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council and the Secretariat be ensured. \nBalance expresses the very spirit of the Charter. \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of the State of Kuwait, I wish to \ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the \nforty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your election. \nSir, reflects an appreciation of your country, Bulgaria, and your personal \nmerits and skills, which will prove instrumental in guiding our deliberations \n\ntowards the attainment of our common goals. On a bilateral note, it is my \nprivilege to underscore the close ties that exist between our two countries, \nas shown in numerous concrete steps. \nIn your current post, you succeed His Excellency \nAmbassador Samir Shihabi, the Permanent Representative of our sister country, \nthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, who demonstrated outstanding skills and \ncapabilities in his stewardship of the preceding session. His leadership was \neffective indeed throughout his term of office. This was no surprise to us, \nespecially as Mr. Shihabi represented a sister country, the Kingdom of Saudi \nArabia, which has made and continues to make generous and sincere \ncontributions, that are appreciated by all, to the promotion of peace and \nsecurity throughout the world. \nIt gives me special pleasure to commend the outstanding role played by \nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations, His Excellency \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, since his assumption of his office at the beginning \nof this year. The world Organization has now become the true focal point of \ninternational relations and the beacon of hope for the peoples of the world. \nIn less than one year in office, the Secretary-General has demonstrated \nan impressive ability to face up to the evolving challenges on the world \nscene, and has managed to address the varying concerns in accordance with the \nestablished principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the overall \nmission of our organization. The Secretary-General's endeavour to redefine \nthe role, function and orientation of the United Nations is characterized by \nprecise thinking and clear vision, resolve and flexibility, both in concept \nand in enforcement plan, as demonstrated by the set of important \nrecommendations contained in his report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". \n\nIn his approach, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has proved that he truly \nrepresents a symbol of the interface and interaction of various human \ncivilizations, a role that his home country, Egypt, has played throughout its \nlong history. \nIn the same vein, we should not fail to underscore with a deep sense of \nappreciation the great achievements of the former Secretary-General, \nMr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, during his tenure. Mr. Perez de Cuellar should \nbe recognized for his integrity in fulfilling his mandate in accordance with \nthe provisions of the Charter and for his untiring efforts to promote peace on \nthe basis of justice and to enhance the role and effectiveness of the United \nNations. Kuwait recognizes with deep appreciation those achievements, salutes \nMr. Perez de Cuellar and wishes him success in all he does. \nThe international scene has undergone fundamental changes over the past \ntwo years, the most significant of which has been the disintegration of the \nSoviet Union and the spread of democratic orientation across Eastern Europe. \nThat, in turn has led to the creation of States and entities that have joined \nthe United Nations membership, thus consolidating further its universality. \nKuwait takes this opportunity to extend its sincere congratulations to all \nthose States that have been admitted recently to the United Nations \nmembership. We trust that this new membership of the international community \nwill represent a constructive addition to and consolidation of the edifice of \nworld peace. \n\nAs we draw nearer to the twenty-first century, we look forward to the \nemergence of new roles for the United Nations. The United Nations should not \nbe content with peace-keeping, the ending wars that have broken out, and the \ndefusing of volatile situations. Rather, the United Nations must make a more \ndirect contribution to the containment and defusing of disputes in their early \nstages before they erupt into vicious conflicts. It must also shoulder the \nrole of peacemaking. \nThe United Nations should not be content with ensuring stability, despite \nthe vital importance of that role. It must be a force for ensuring peoples' \nwelfare and the fulfilment of peoples' aspirations. In today's world, the \nconcept of peace transcends the framework of peace between states and embraces \nthe peace of whole societies and peoples. \nAs we work together on the formulation of the new world order and strive \nto make it one of the principal stanchions of the stability which we hope will \nreign in our world and imbue international relations, we are called upon to \nensure the rule of international law through the strengthening of the United \nNations role and the scrupulous application of its Charter. In our view, this \nwill provide a genuine framework for the new world order and for the \nachievement of its lofty goals. \nDespite the fact that international relations in our world today are \nanchored in the tenets of the United Nations system, we believe that an \neffective and viable United Nations should be complemented by a more \naggressive role for the regional organizations which would be instrumental in \naddressing many unresolved disputes and issues. The League of Arab States and \nthe Organization of African Unity, for example, should be entrusted with \nsupporting roles in dealing with the problems of Somalia; the European \n\nCommunity should play the leading role in the resolution of the escalating \nproblems in the Balkan region; and the Organization of American States can \nbecome the leading player in dealing with the problems of Haiti and \nEl Salvador. \nIn the context of this desired role for regional organizations the \nCooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) stands out, \nespecially through its firm support of Kuwait's struggle to defeat the Iraqi \naggression. That unprecedented role of the GCC could perhaps be followed as a \nmodel in rallying a larger international effort when necessary. \nKuwait believes that the Non-Aligned Movement, especially in the wake of \nits recent summit in Jakarta, and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, \nas well as the Group of 77, are models of regional organizations whose \ncapabilities should be directed at facilitating the evolution and maintenance \nof world peace. In this sense, they are natural mini-counterparts of the \nUnited Nations, and they represent major dynamic forces that perform a \ncoordinating function among their members. \nFrom this perspective we believe that the efforts undertaken by the \nUnited Nations in the liberation of my country, Kuwait, from the Iraqi \naggression and occupation could perhaps be perceived as a new approach in the \ncrystallization and enforcement of the concept of collective security, which \npreoccupied this world body since its inception, and was a hope in the minds \nof the authors of its Charter. Thus, the Kuwait case established a precedent \nwhen it demonstrated that the Security Council's resolutions can be \nimplemented, as, indeed, they must be implemented. \n\nThe Security Council has clearly succeeded in consolidating the \nunderpinnings of peace and the elimination of many hotbeds of conflict in \nseveral regions of the world, in the aftermath of its successful moves to \nensure the liberation of my country, Kuwait, from an invasion which, by its \nvery nature, represented a challenge to the Charter of the United Nations and \nto the norms of international law that regulate relations between civilized \nnations. \nHowever, certain residual results of the Iraqi aggression still exist, \nand will continue to exist so long as the Iraqi regime persists in its refusal \nto comply fully with the relevant Security Council resolutions and tries to \ncircumvent those resolutions and to renege on its previous formal \ncommitments. For instance, there are still Kuwaiti and third country \nprisoners held hostage in Iraqi jails despite the intensive efforts and \ninternational pressures deployed to secure their release. \nFurthermore, the patently false claims repeatedly made by Iraq, in \ncontravention of international treaties and commitments, continue to shake the \nparameters of stability throughout the region. Iraqi falsehoods also \njeopardize the main objective of the input of the United Nations in providing \nthe technical framework for the Iraq-Kuwait boundary demarcation process. \nThis exercise is a major achievement on the part of the United Nations in \nregard to security and stability in the region. The Security Council's \nrecently adopted resolution 773 (1992) welcomed the decisions of the United \nNations Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission and underlined the \nCouncil's guarantee of inviolability of the international border between the \n\ntwo countries and its decision to take, as appropriate, all necessary measures \nto that end, in accordance with the Charter. \nFurthermore, Iraq continues to refuse to accept legal responsibility for \nits plundering of property owned by the Kuwaiti private sector and by Kuwaiti \nindividuals, and continues to refuse to recognize the need to return all \nstolen property. Iraq also refuses to implement Security Council resolutions \n706 (1991) and 712 (1991) regarding the provision of essential humanitarian \nneeds for the Iraqi civilian population and the payment of its dues to the \nUnited Nations compensation fund. In addition, Iraq, under all pretexts, \nshies away from any businesslike cooperation in regard to the fulfilment of \nits obligation to disclose all its stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction \nand in regard to the elimination of such weapons. \nAll of this places a new responsibility on the international community in \ngeneral to bring further pressure to bear on Iraq, to remain vigilant to its \npractices and schemes, and to ensure its complete implementation of all the \nrelevant United Nations resolutions. The principle of collective \nresponsibility still stands, and the lessons drawn from that painful and \nbitter experience should be fully understood and never forgotten. \nKuwait believes that security in the Gulf region is part and parcel of \nworld security. This means that it is essential that all of us respect the \nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all the States in our \nregion. It also means non-interference in the internal affairs of those \nStates, as well as the non-use of force or of the threat of force in the \nsettlement of any dispute that may arise between them. \nFrom this premise, we have been following with grave concern the recent \ndevelopments, with all their ramifications, in regard to the Abu Mousa island. \n\nIn our view, these developments will have a direct impact on regional peace \nand stability. Hence, we are all duty-bound to work towards averting their \nrepercussions so that the good-neighbourly relations that we already have with \nthe friendly Islamic Republic of Iran may be preserved. While we declare our \nfull support for our sister State of the United Arab Emirates, we hope that \nthe Islamic Republic of Iran will abide by the agreement regarding the island \nof Abu Mousa and will accept the application of international conventions for \nthe peaceful resolution of disputes. We trust that, in the final analysis, \nprudence and wisdom will reign supreme in regard to this issue. \nAs of late last year, we have seen a promising peace process under way in \nregard to the Middle East problem. The new realities and momentum that \nemerged following the Madrid conference should be maintained, with a view to \nsecuring the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and \n338 (1973) on the basis of the exchange of land for peace. \nIt has become clear that land and peace are worth any price. The \ninternational community has thus a special responsibility to nurture the \nongoing peace efforts and to ensure that the current peace talks, in all their \naspects and forms, will bring to fruition the efforts that the United Nations \nhas made with a view to guaranteeing the national rights of the Palestinian \npeople particularly its right to self-determination and statehood - and the \ncomplete withdrawal of Israel from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the holy \ncity of Al-Quds. We call upon the United Nations to prompt Israel to abide \nexpeditiously with its obligations under international law and not to squander \nthis historic opportunity. \n\nThe peace process and the attendant efforts should follow an integrated \napproach in addressing the Arab-Israeli conflict that takes into account the \nUnited Nations resolutions regarding the question of Palestine and the Middle \nEast issue. In specific terms, this means that Israel must withdraw from \nsouthern Lebanon in accordance with Security Council resolution 425 (1978), \nand that the Lebanese people must be supported in consolidating their \nnational-reconciliation efforts and in rebuilding their national institutions. \nIt also means Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Arab Golan and the \nimplementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions in order that a just \nand lasting settlement of this long-running conflict may be reached. \n\n\nThe ongoing plight of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina gives rise to \ndeep fears and apprehensions throughout the Islamic world and in the world at \nlarge. We categorically reject all practices that aim at the liquidation of \nthe identity and existence of a people, a nation and a State on ethnic or \nreligious grounds. We support the struggle of the people of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and demand the implementation of the relevant Security Council \nresolutions. We call upon the United Nations, along with its specialized \nagencies, to expand its role there, and we hold that regional organizations, \nparticularly the European ones, should play a more active role in alleviating \nthe suffering of that people. It is our collective responsibility to contain \nthe ramifications of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina before they spill \nover into neighbouring countries. \nIf the United Nations has been seized of this tragic issue since the very \nbeginning, then we believe that there are other turbulent areas in the world \nthat deserve active involvement on the part of the United Nations together \nwith the competent regional organizations, with a view to containing and \nresolving the disputes afflicting those regions. In our view, this is a sound \napproach to underlining and enhancing the credibility of the United Nations \nand to defining clearly the parameters of the new world order. We are \nduty-bound to support both the United Nations and the regional organizations \nin a concrete fashion that gives real meaning to the concept of common \nsecurity and stability and the principle of common destiny. \nThe tragedy of the Somali people is cause for deep concern on our part, \ngiven the common values we share with them. The fratricidal strife in Somalia \nis extremely painful to us. Despite the slight improvement over the past few \nweeks in the delivery of food and medical supplies and in the control over the \n\ndistribution thereof, Somalia continues to bleed, and it has now become \nincumbent upon all nations to provide more material assistance to Somalia and \nto strengthen their support for the Secretary-General in his endeavours to \nexpedite the attainment of a set of noble goals, namely, the protection of an \nentire people from annihilation and the delivery of adequate supplies of food \nand medical services to that people. \nWe in Kuwait, in view of our solidarity with the friendly peoples of \nBosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia and in line with our humanitarian \nobligations and our commitment to alleviate human suffering, have shipped \nthousands of tons of food, medical supplies and basic human needs to those two \ncountries. Furthermore, we have made direct financial contributions to the \nrelevant specialized agencies in order to ensure their ability to operate in \nthose areas. We shall continue to provide humanitarian relief assistance out \nof our deep belief in social justice. \nWe follow with deep concern the persistent instability in Afghanistan and \nthe continuing strife among the partners in the coalition Government. We call \nupon the Muslim people of Afghanistan to put aside their differences and to \nmove towards national reconciliation. National efforts should in fact focus \non building up national stability and security. \nAny political breakthroughs made by the United Nations will add to its \ngrowing record of achievements. But such accomplishments will remain fragile \nunless followed by more efforts to promote social stability and economic \ndevelopment, with particular emphasis on health, social services and combating \nills of epidemic proportions, especially drug abuse. \n\nMoreover, the United Nations should explore new avenues to ease the \nforeign debt burden on the developing countries and to try to bridge the gap \nbetween wealthy and poor nations by means of a more earnest and constructive \ndialogue between North and South, with a. view to ensuring economic equity \nanchored in social justice. One of the aims of such dialogue should be \nconfidence-building between donor and recipient nations. Such confidence will \nlead to joint efforts in a bid to stimulate the inflow of investments with a \nbetter economic and social return for both sides. This will indeed be yet \nanother manifestation of an interdependent world community of nations. \nIt is against this conceptual backdrop that we view the outcome of the \nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), known as the \n\\\"Earth Summit\\\", held recently in Rio de Janiero. The focus of the Rio \nConference brought to the fore the growing world-wide interest in gaining a \nbetter understanding of the political, economic, and social aspects of human \nlife. Despite the fact that the UNCED did not achieve all its expected goals, \none of its major contributions was that it highlighted for the whole world, in \nan unprecedented manner, the importance of the issue of environment and made \nit abundantly clear that ecological concerns do indeed transcend both national \nand regional disputes. It has deepened our sense of belonging to a single \n\\\"global village\\\". \nThe current changes and new challenges on the international scene are \nbound to cause dramatic transformations in many established concepts and \nassumptions that still dominate international relations. A case in point is \nthe growing interest in the issue of human rights. In an evolving world, not \nonly should human rights be defined in instruments but the concept of human \nrights should be expanded to include the genuine guarantee of the exercise of \n\nthose rights to freedoms and human dignity, in addition to the satisfaction of \nbasic human needs and the liberation of man from fear and want. Guaranteeing \nhuman rights has become a major demand of today's world and the international \ncommunity continues to make it clear, time and again, that it will not condone \nany breech or violation thereof. Respect for State sovereignty should be in \nconsonance with the guaranteeing of human rights. \nIn conclusion, we note that the recent radical, international changes \nhave placed before the United Nations enormous challenges and \nresponsibilities. The growing confidence in its role and in the need for it \nto perform its functions make it imperative for all of us to reaffirm our \ncommitment to the world Organization. It would be both unfair and \ninappropriate for us to keep adding to its responsibilities without providing \nit with sufficient material and political support to enable it to fulfil its \nmandates effectively. This means that the international community should put \nat the United Nations disposal adequate resources and powers, commensurate \nwith its responsibilities. \nThe Secretary-General has shown that while the United Nations is prepared \nto discharge its functions, the Member States are in turn expected to honour \ntheir obligations in full. This complementarity between the United Nations \nsystem and its Members will straighten out the relationship between mandates \nand resources. Thus we can eliminate the imbalance between what is required \nand what is available and the potential causes of friction that go with that \ndisequilibrium. Under such circumstances, the world body would be able to \nlive up to the expectations of the international community in the areas of \npeacemaking and peace-keeping, along with all the attendant profits in terms \nof stability, security, development, progress and welfare."

        "file_text": "Let me begin by expressing my sincere \nappreciation to His Excellency Mr. Samir Shihabi for his wise administration \nand leadership of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. It is also \nmy great pleasure to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev on his \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh \nsession and to wish him a successful term. \nI also want you to know that we, the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, \nare deeply grateful to the United Nations for all of its efforts to achieve \npeace and for providing humanitarian assistance under very difficult \ncircumstances. The courageous troops of the United Nations Protection Force \n(UNPROFOR), with the tenacious leadership of Secretary-General, \nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, deserve special recognition and gratitude. \nAs is well known, I come from a country besieged by barbaric aggression. \nBut, I must emphasize, I have come here today not to talk of war but to \noffer peace. \nIt is an offer of a nation born of ethnic coexistence rather than ethnic \ncleansing. \nIt is an offer of a multicultural and multi-religious Bosnia and \nHerzegovina in which democracy and tolerance prevail. \nIt is not an offer of a unitary or ideological State, as some will have \nyou believe. \nSome have said that the killing and destruction have caused so much \nhatred that my country's peoples cannot live together in peace any more. \nI submit to you that my country has a centuries-old tradition of \ntolerance and coexistence among its peoples. \nJust one week ago yesterday I celebrated, together with Muslims, Croats \nand other groups, the five-hundredth anniversary of the first settlement of \nJews in Bosnia and Herzegovina. \nBecause Muslims, Croats, Serbs, Jews and others have lived together in \nBosnia and Herzegovina for centuries, virtually all of our towns and cities \nare mixed in population some more, some less. \nIt is therefore not possible to draw lines through our Republic to \ndesignate ethnically pure regions. It is not possible to draw lines through \nour towns and cities to designate ethnically pure streets or neighborhoods. \nI submit to you that we, the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, can live \ntogether, and that we must live together, despite what has happened, provided \nthat equality, justice and freedom are secured for all. \nIn recent years, people of many nations have chosen democracy as the best \nmeans to secure their rights, to ensure religious and political liberty, to \npromote cooperation and mutual advancement, to enjoy the fruits of their \nlabours and to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number. \nTheir efforts have changed the world: they have opened doors where once \nthere was an iron curtain. \nThis guest for democracy has made an old world order crumble and a new \none begin. \nSo, too, have we, the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, turned to \ndemocratic government as the means to assure mutual welfare, regardless of \nethnic, religious or other distinctions. \nConsequently we have sought to build a government that represents all of \nthe people of Bosnia and Herzegovina equally and justly. \nI am proposing a constitutional commission for Bosnia and Herzegovina \nwhich includes inter-ethnic and inter-religious representation. The \ncommission will work with a group of international experts to develop a \nconstitutional settlement to the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina which will \nprotect the rights of all citizens. We envision it as encompassing the \nfollowing: \nFirst, a State founded on the principles of democracy, individual rights, \ntolerance, religious and cultural freedoms and a market economy; \nSecondly, a constitutional and administrative framework similar to that \nof modern democratic States; \nThirdly, a decentralized State organized on the principles of \nparliamentary civil democracy; and \nFourthly, a single legislative, executive and judicial framework for the \nwhole territory of the Republic, with decentralized administration in all \nregions. \nWe envision the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as consisting of \nadministrative territorial regions to be formed according to economic, \ncultural, historical and ethnic criteria. \nWe believe it is impractical and immoral to institute administrative \nterritorial regions on an exclusively ethnic basis. Moreover, it is \nimpossible, because we are an ethnically mixed, intermingled country: a \nliving, breathing Jackson Pollack painting. \nGovernment at every level will respect the equal rights of all the \npeoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Government will be based on the \nprinciple of parity of representation among the three constituent nations. \nThe legislative branch the Assembly will consist of two chambers: the \nChamber of Peoples will be based on ethnic parity, being made up of \nrepresentatives of the three largest constituent peoples of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina; the Chamber of Citizens will be based on proportional \nrepresentation. All representatives will be elected in free and open \nelections. \nThe Chamber of Peoples and the Presidency will reach key decisions by \nconsensus, including all decisions that directly affect the equality of the \nconstituent nations. \nBosnia and Herzegovina will seek to establish good relations with all \nneighbouring States, as well as with other States, on the basis of mutual \nrespect and cooperation. \nI have related my offer of peace. I now want to tell the Assembly about \nthe offer made by the Government in Belgrade and its proxies in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. By their actions and by their statements, they have made an \noffer that must be clear to all nations of the world. Their offer is based on \nan entirely different view of Bosnia and Herzegovina: a view that is alien to \ndemocracy, but unfortunately familiar in history. It is a view of people \ndivided, hostile and unequal. \nFirst, they offer \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", which is the extermination or \nelimination of people on the basis of ethnic, national or religious \ndistinctions. \nSecondly, they offer a brutal division of the Republic along spurious \nethnic boundaries created by force and by war. They say that the people \nBosnia and Herzegovina cannot live together in one State. But the only \nevidence they have is the false evidence they have manufactured by their own \naggression. \nAround the world we see diverse peoples living together. How many \nnations represented here have ethnic purity? Look west from this building and \nimagine Belgrade's vision applied, for example, to the United States. Imagine \nBerlin Walls sprouting in every American neighbourhood, separating the French, \nRussian, African-American, Italian, Jewish, Spanish, Japanese, Polish, Korean, \nIrish and other groups until all had been moved to ethnically pure \nneighbourhoods and separated by barbed wire, armed guards and checkpoints. \nFinally, they offer an expanding Serbia. We know that this will be a \nSerbia in which those who are not Serbs are denied fundamental freedoms. \nTheir offer leads to endless insecurity, endless conflict, endless suffering. \nThe question, then, is which offer the world will accept today. \nIf it accepts our offer of peace, equality and justice, and if it rejects \nthe offer of pain and division made by Belgrade and its proxies in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, then I ask the world community to do three things. \nFirst, in front of the entire General Assembly, I ask the members of the \nSecurity Council to implement and enforce fully the existing Security Council \nresolutions and the principles and commitments endorsed at the London \nConference. \nWhile we have abided by the confidence- and security-building and \nverification agreement of the London Conference, the aggressors have not. \nContrary to their commitments, the aggressors have: failed to place all \nmortars and heavy weapons under international supervision; failed to cease \nmilitary air attacks; failed to close concentration camps; failed to allow \nrefugees to return to their homes; failed to allow delivery of relief \nsupplies; and failed to end \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\". \nThis record of broken promises shows that implementation and enforcement \nmust become the next step towards peace. It shows, for example, that a no-fly \nzone over Bosnia and Herzegovina is essential for stopping the massive \ndestruction from air attacks. A no-fly zone should be implemented and \nenforced immediately. Implementation and enforcement are absolutely essential \nif the Geneva session of the London Conference is to have any chance of \nsuccess. \nSecondly, I ask the Assembly to set in motion an international war-crimes \ntribunal that would work closely with the Geneva Conference. It is essential \nthat we investigate, prosecute and punish those who have been responsible for \nwar crimes. Only after the criminals are punished and the victims healed will \nwe have a true peace. Exonerate the innocent and bring a reconciliation of \nour people. \nThirdly, our country has been plundered and razed. Its economic base has \nbeen destroyed. I would like to take this opportunity to request the \nestablishment of an international fund for the reconstruction and development \nof Bosnia and Herzegovina. Considering the massive scale of the destruction, \nit is necessary that the world community help us take the first step in \nemerging from the ruins. \nFinally, if the Security Council cannot implement and enforce fully its \nresolutions and if the London Conference cannot implement its principles and \nagreements, then I ask the world community to allow us to defend ourselves. \nI have offered a vision of a secular and democratic State, a \ndecentralized State and a multi-ethnic society based on peaceful coexistence \nand tolerance. Unfortunately, the offer of peace which I have proposed will \nbecome irrelevant unless this Organization comes resolutely to our defence or, \nalternatively, fully enables us to exercise our right to self-defence. The \ninternational community cannot simultaneously sidestep its commitment to \ndefend us and nullify our means of self-defence. It has become clear that no \none has come resolutely to our aid. We must have the unhindered right of \nself-defence. \nArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter grants us that absolute right. \nThe present arms embargo ties our hands at a time when our country is being \nstrangled. It deprives us of the only effective means of self-defence. By \ndoing so, it helps the aggressor. \nThe arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina must be voided. "

        "file_text": "At the outset, I should like to offer the \nPresident my most sincere congratulations on his well-deserved election to \npreside over the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly and to express \nmy delegation's gratitude and appreciation for the constructive efforts of the \nPresident of the forty-sixth session. It is our earnest hope that the General \nAssembly, drawing upon our President's valuable experience and diplomatic \nskills, will play a significant role in the new international environment. I \nassure him of my delegation's full cooperation to this end. \nI also take this opportunity to offer my heartfelt felicitations to the \nnew Members who have joined us in the United Nations since the last session of \nthe General Assembly, most of whom are neighbours of the Islamic Republic of \nIran. It is a matter of great joy and satisfaction for me and my delegation \nthat the seat of Afghanistan in the Assembly is at long last occupied by the \nrepresentatives of the legitimate Government of that country. \nThis session opens at a time, in the aftermath of the cold war, when \ntumultuous developments in the international arena continue to unfold, facing \nthe international community with opportunities and challenges alike. In the \ncold-war era the global arms race, the arming of client States and the \ninstigation of regional wars sapped the energy and capabilities of countries, \nespecially in the third world, thus debilitating them in their efforts to \nstand up to the challenge of such chronic and endemic problems as poverty. \n\nhunger, illiteracy, drug-addiction and drug trafficking, underdevelopment and \nenvironmental pollution. \nThe collapse of the bipolar world has created a propitious opportunity \nfor mankind to address those problems in earnest. It has also brought to the \nfore new threats to international peace and security, such as the devising of \nnew ways of expansion and consolidation of domination and hegemony, a further \nwidening of the North-South gap and flare-ups of ethnic and racial differences \nand conflicts. \nDue to continuing transformations in geographical, economic, military and \ncultural configurations, the world today is in a vulnerable state of flux, and \nuntil reliable stability emerges the approach of big Powers to the United \nNations and that of the Organization to international issues and problems will \nremain very sensitive and significant. \n\nThe United Nations, as the only universal body, should contribute to the \nsolution of major global problems without resort to short-sighted political \nexpediency. It should do so on the basis of justice and respect for human \ndignity, lofty human values and the rules of international law. Selectivity \nis certain to turn the Organization into a tool for legitimizing the actions \nof powerful Member States. This represents the most formidable challenge to \nthe Organization's integrity, credibility and relevance. \nIn this context I need give just a few clear examples: first, in dealing \nwith international crises, the use of double standards based on the political \ninterests of the powerful, as manifested, on one hand, by the Security \nCouncil's treatment of Iraq's aggression against Kuwait and, on the other \nhand, by the decades-old aggression of the Zionist regime; secondly, the \nnon-application, for reasons of political expediency, of the existing means \nand instruments to certain crises, as witnessed in the Council's half-hearted \napproach to Serbia's blatant aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina; thirdly, indifference to, or total negligence of, certain \nexplosive and tragic situations, such as those in Somalia and Liberia, which, \ndespite obvious disruptive regional ramifications, do not seem to have a \ndirect bearing on the interests of outside Powers; fourthly, the manipulation \nof cherished human ideals in the field of human rights for short-sighted, \nulterior political motives. \nUndoubtedly, a fair, objective and non-selective approach by the United \nNations to international issues and crises will help to ensure that the \nOrganization can play an effective role in the future and, away from the \n\npeddling of big-Power influence, put it in the unique position of being able \nto act as the centre for concerted international cooperation. \nAt this point I must express to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali our \nappreciation for his efforts to make the Organization more efficient and to \nenhance its role in the resolution of chronic and new international problems. \nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has studied with care and keen interest the \nSecretary-General's report of 17 June 1992, entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". \nIt is our considered view that the report deals with a wide range of \ntheoretical and practical issues issues that are very sensitive and merit \nthe General Assembly's careful and in-depth scrutiny. \nIt is incumbent on the General Assembly, as the only universal organ of \nthe United Nations, to formulate and adopt the Organization's future work. \nSuch an endeavour, within the framework of the Charter and based on full \nrespect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence \nof Member States and on non-interference in their internal affairs, will \ncertainly contribute to refinement of the concepts and suggestions embodied in \nthe Secretary-General's report, and this will help him to discharge his \nduties. My delegation is willing to participate actively in a special working \ngroup of the General Assembly on this matter. \nAmong the most sensitive issues dealt with in the Secretary-General's \nreport is the active role of the Security Council in the new international \nenvironment. The Security Council, in accordance with the United Nations \nCharter, bears primary responsibility for the maintenance of international \npeace and security, but, in the discharge of its responsibilities, the Council \ndoes not have unfounded authority. By definition, it must fine-tune its \ndecisions and actions with the principles and objectives of the Charter and of \n\ninternational law. Discriminatory treatment of issues pertaining to \ninternational peace and security, the overstepping of mandated authority and \nmisuse of the privileges accorded to the members of the Council the \npermanent members in particular are among the practices that tarnish the \nCouncil's image and undermine its stature and credibility and, in the final \nanalysis, that of the United Nations. A thorough and vigorous study and \nformulation of well-defined guidelines will help the Council to adopt an \nobjective and non-discriminationary approach, within a specific framework and \nspecific terms of reference, to various issues of international peace and \nsecurity. I must emphasize that the preservation of international peace and \nsecurity is a responsibility entrusted to the Security Council by the \ninternational community. That being the case, the Council, in accordance with \nthe Charter, is accountable to that community, which is represented by the \nGeneral Assembly. \nThe existing international exigencies make especially necessary the \nstrengthening of global efforts to facilitate the overall process of \ndisarmament and arms control - in particular, the elimination of weapons of \nmass destruction. To this end, reappraisal of the military doctrines of the \nbig Powers in consonance with the new international situation, a change in \nattitudes of domination, and rejection of resort to force as a means of \npromoting political objectives constitute the primary prerequisite for the \nsuccess of all disarmament and arms-control schemes. \nThe preparation of a draft convention on the prohibition of the \nproduction, development, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons represents a \nsignificant step in the history of arms control. Undoubtedly, this convention \n\ncrystallizes many years' difficult, even tedious, negotiations between the \nmembers of the Conference on Disarmament. Notwithstanding this obvious fact, \nthe convention - on the one hand, because the Conference on Disarmament acts \non the basis of consensus and, on the other, owing to the supremacy of \npolitical exigencies throughout the process, but especially during the latter \nstages - cannot be regarded as a document that reflects the principled views \nand positions of all members of the Conference on Disarmament. This is \nparticularly true in respect of the composition of the executive council, \nwhich, in our view, lacks balance and proportion. Furthermore, if the \nconvention on chemical weapons is to become universal the developed countries \nwill have to provide for the transfer of chemical technology, materials and \nequipment for peaceful purposes, and the existing unilateral discriminatory \nand ad hoc restrictions will have to be removed. \nIn the field of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the \nnon-proliferation Treaty can indeed acquire a universal character and play an \neffective and efficient role in preventing the vertical and horizontal \nproliferation of nuclear weapons, provided that the nuclear-weapon States \nfulfil their obligations in accordance with article VI of the Treaty. \nIt is highly desirable that the next millennium be nuclear-free, but the \nachievement of that objective depends upon the following: an undertaking by \nall nuclear-weapon States to destroy all nuclear weapons in their territory or \nunder their jurisdiction or control; a new pledge by all States not to acquire \nor proliferate nuclear weapons and not to add to their existing stocks; and a \ngenuine commitment to enhanced cooperation in technology for the peaceful use \nof nuclear energy. \n \nFurther regional endeavours in the field of arms control, regional \ndisarmament and the establishment of zones free of weapons of mass destruction \ncan complement international efforts towards the prohibition of such weapons \nand can contribute to the alleviation of the international community's concern \nabout the dangerous consequences of stockpiling armaments at the regional \nlevel. \n \nMy country, as the initiator of the proposal for the establishment of a \nnuclear-free zone in the Middle East, is fully prepared to participate \nactively in any constructive and comprehensive initiative in this field. It \ngoes without saying, though, that the success of initiatives concerning arms \ncontrol and regional disarmament depends on heeding a number of considerations \nsuch as the political and security characteristics of the regions in question, \nparticipation of the regional countries in defining the principles and \nobjectives of the initiative, the concerns of the countries in the region \nvis-a-vis threats from within and outside the region, including consequences \nof the presence of foreign forces. \nWhat seems more urgent and critical than regional disarmament is the \nnecessity and desirability of searching for a comprehensive and genuine \nsolution to regional conflicts, as an endemic and seemingly intractable source \nof threat to international peace and security. Over and above the chronic \nregional crises, recent developments at the international level have given \nbirth to a series of new crises in various regions, thus further accentuating \nthe need for a new sense of vigilance and vigorous endeavour on the part of \nthe international community to confront these threats. \nIn my brief survey of regional crises and conflicts, I cannot but begin \nwith what is closest to the hearts and minds of the Islamic world - that is, \nPalestine. The legitimate uprising of the Palestinian people in the occupied \nterritories, as a form of resistance against occupation, expansionism, murder \nand unbearable living conditions, is brutally suppressed. Alongside the \nregular armed forces, armed Zionist settlers carry out on a daily and \ncontinuing basis acts of murder and plunder, including confiscation of \n\nPalestinian property. In addition to Palestine, parts of Syrian and Lebanese \nterritory are still under Zionist occupation and innocent people are killed or \nabducted on a regular basis by these forces in South Lebanon. \nThe Islamic Republic of Iran calls on the international community to \nconfront the aggressive and repressive policies of the Zionists in a serious \nand meaningful manner. The bitter experience of the past decades indicate, \nhowever, that peace and tranquillity can be restored to the area only through \nstruggle, full restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people \nand establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the entire territory \nof Palestine. \nAnother crisis which has endangered regional and global security over the \npast year concerns the tragic situation in the Republic of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. The crimes perpetrated against the people in that young and \nsmall Republic have few parallels in the post-Second-World-War era. The \naggression against the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political \nindependence of a Member of the United Nations and the simultaneous torture, \nmass killings and policy of genocide and \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", as pursued by \nSerbia and its ultra-nationalist Serb agents with the objective of forming \n\\\"greater Serbia\\\", have caused deep consternation throughout the world and \ndrawn condemnation from almost all quarters. Nevertheless, Serbia and its \nagents continue to show utter disdain for the international community's \ndecisions, as reflected in numerous Security Council resolutions and General \nAssembly resolution 46/242, continuing their crimes against the people of \nBosnia and Herzegovina, in particular the Muslim population, with a seeming \nsense of immunity and impunity. \n\nIt is therefore incumbent upon the Security Council to adopt the \nnecessary measures provided for in Article 42 of the Charter to put an end to \nthe aggression and to restore the sovereignty, territorial integrity, \npolitical independence and unity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \nThe Islamic Republic of Iran once again emphasizes the inherent right of the \nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to self-defence in accordance with \nArticle 51 of the Charter and expects the Security Council to reconsider its \nresolution on an arms embargo against Yugoslavia in order to enable the \nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to exercise its inherent right to resist \naggression. \nMoreover, I would like to emphasize that in the view of a large majority \nof the Member States, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Socialist \nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia no longer exists and the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia - Serbia and Montenegro - has no right to occupy the seat of former \nYugoslavia in international forums. We strongly believe that the Assembly \nshould send a very clear and unambiguous signal to Belgrade, through the \nexpulsion of Serbia and Montenegro from all organs of the United Nations, that \nto be a Member of the Organization it will be subject to all the criteria for \nmembership and will have to behave accordingly. \nThere are two other continuing crises in the immediate neighborhood of \nthe Islamic Republic of Iran to which my country cannot remain indifferent \nbecause of humanitarian as well as national security considerations. \nExpressing its satisfaction at the victory of the Muslim mujahidin of \nAfghanistan and the establishment of an Islamic State, the Islamic Republic of \nIran welcomes the cessation of fratricidal bloodshed in its fraternal \nneighbouring country. My country extends its support to the legitimate \n\nGovernment of Afghanistan, stresses the imperative of non-interference of all \ncountries in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, and once again draws the \nattention of the international community to the pressing humanitarian needs of \nthe war-stricken Afghan people. For our part, we have made endeavours in this \ndirection and underline our readiness to cooperate with other countries as \nwell as international organizations in the provision of food, medicine and \nother essential needs as well as in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. \nIn regard to the Nogorno-Karabakh region, the Islamic Republic of Iran \nfrom the very outset expressed its concern at the continuation and expansion \nof the conflict and exerted every effort to bring the fighting to an end; this \nresulted in the establishment of a cease-fire and commencement of negotiations \nbetween the Republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia. It is a matter of deep \nregret that owing to the reticence of the international community - and \nparticularly that of the Security Council the opportunity of propitious \nsituation which existed at that time and which could have been further \nsolidified through the dispatching of international observers was lost and \nbloodshed flared up and has continued. In our view, the Karabakh crisis can \nbe resolved only through negotiations and on the basis of mutual respect and \nnon-interference as well as the preservation of the sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of the two countries. \nThe approach of the Islamic Republic of Iran to these two crises and the \nefforts undertaken in regard to them emanate from our overall policy towards \nneighbouring countries, which is based on the promotion and consolidation of \ngood-neighbourly relations, expansion of economic, cultural and scientific \ncooperation, and fostering of regional confidence. For we believe that \n\nsecurity in our region is attainable only through cooperation. As early as \n1986 the Islamic Republic of Iran, on the basis of this policy, underlined the \nimperative need for the creation of a regional security and cooperation \narrangement in the Persian Gulf area. In the General Assembly last year I \nenumerated the principles and objectives of such regional cooperation \nprinciples and objectives that continue to govern our approach to this \nstrategic region. The relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the \nnewly established Republics along our northern borders are based on the same \nprinciples, namely, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, \ninviolability of international borders, non-resort to force in the settlement \nof disputes, non-interference in internal affairs, and dialogue and mutual \nunderstanding. \nCognizant of the fact that the newly established republics of Central \nAsia and the Caucasus are now undergoing the difficult and tumultuous stage of \nstate-building, establishment and consolidation of democratic institutions and \neconomic stabilization and development, and with a view to the primacy of \npromotion of good-neighbourly relations and fostering of mutual confidence \nbetween the countries of this region, the Islamic Republic of Iran has taken \nthe lead in the sphere of expanding bilateral as well as multilateral ties \nwith these countries. We, along with our regional partners - Turkey and \nPakistan have welcomed the Republics of Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, \nTajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan into the Economic \nCooperation Organization (ECO). \n\nWe also pioneered the formation of the Organization of the Countries of \nthe Caspian Sea Basin, along with the Russian Federation, Azerbaijan, \nTurkmenistan and Kazakhstan. \nIn the bilateral field, the foundations of political, cultural and \neconomic cooperation, particularly in the areas of transportation and energy, \nhave been laid with the newly established republics of the former USSR. That \napproach by the Islamic Republic of Iran is founded on the conviction that the \nexpansion of bilateral and multilateral relations among countries of the \nregion is bound to contribute to stability, security and development for all. \nIn today's world instability does not emanate solely from regional crises \nor military conflicts. Economic and environmental problems too threaten \ninternational peace and security. Continued further exacerbation of economic \ndifficulties in most third-world countries in the context, and as a result, of \nthe ever-widening gap between the North and the South is perhaps the most \nserious and most explosive danger threatening the international community. \nAs stated clearly in the World Economic Survey for 1992, world economic \noutput has decreased for the first time since the Second World War; \ninternational trade is also plagued with myriad difficulties. Under these \ndifficult circumstances, many developing countries are still grappling with \nthe problems resulting from the economic recession of the 1980s and its \nsocio-political consequences. Worse still, a decreased flow of financial \nresources to developing countries has made the prospects for recovery and \neconomic growth and development in those countries all the more uncertain. \n \nNotwithstanding numerous problems, the recovery of the world economy is \nnot impossible to achieve. Its attainment, though, requires promotion of \ninternational cooperation and coordination of economic policies, which feature \namong the major purposes of the United Nations. To this end, the \nInternational Development Strategy for the fourth United Nations Development \nDecade, the Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its eighteenth \nspecial session, and Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment \nand Development, which reflect long and intensive negotiations and represent \ninternational consensus on the objectives of development and environment, \nconstitute the necessary framework and basis of future measures. \nYet it is clear that in the absence of concerted international \ncooperation proper economic conditions where all countries enjoy equal \nopportunity for growth and development will remain unattainable. The United \nNations and its specialized agencies provide the most appropriate forum to \nfacilitate international cooperation with the objective of alleviating world \neconomic problems, especially those of the developing countries, thus \npreventing what otherwise seems an inevitable confrontation between North and \nSouth. \nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate the imperative of intensifying \nthe activities of the United Nations in step with international developments, \nwith a view to achieving a higher degree of efficiency and effectiveness. In \nthis context, the Islamic Republic of Iran is of the view that revitalization \nof the General Assembly should be pursued in earnest, and that effective \nmeasures to augment the efficiency, and thus the practical relevance, of the \nAssembly should be adopted. \n\nThe decision of the recent non-aligned summit to convene a high-level \nworking group to study ways and means of increasing the effectiveness of the \nUnited Nations represents a timely, logical and positive step, and can \ncertainly assist the United Nations in that purpose. The General Assembly, as \nthe sole universal, democratic and transparent organ of the United Nations, \nwith the competence entrusted to it by the Charter to address all \ninternational issues and problems, should fully exercise its Charter-mandated \nauthority in practice. To that end, the General Assembly should guide other \norgans of the United Nations on a constant and active basis, and take the \nnecessary decisions and make the appropriate recommendations for the \nrealization of common human ideals, most notably universal peace, security and \nrespect for human rights, and balanced prosperity and welfare. \n"

        "file_text": "Since its inception in 1945, the United \nNations has spearheaded humanity's common yearning for a peaceful, just and \nprosperous world, a world freed at last from war, caprice, greed and other \nabominable human and social impulses. \nThe brilliant and forward-looking authors of the Charter of the United \nNations and the rest of us who are the beneficiaries of their collective \nwisdom and imagination have reason to hope for a firm consolidation of a \ndemocratic, stable and compassionate world order, which would make a clean \nbreak with the past, characterized by two unprecedented and most destructive \nworld wars in this century. \n \nThis world order, the optimists proclaimed, would be governed by the rule \nof law, respect for human rights, universal exercise of the right to \nself-determination, recognition of the equality of all nations, large and \nsmall, and sharing among the members of the human family. On this basis it \nwas fair to expect that the great achievements in science and technology could \ngenerously be utilized to assure the common survival of humanity, protection \nof the environment and the unfettered enjoyment of larger freedoms by every \nindividual on this planet Earth. \nAfter all, the founding fathers themselves made a solemn pledge in the \nCharter \n\\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in \nour lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind\\\". \nTheir vision of a peaceful and harmonious world and peoples' hopes for social \nadvancement and economic prosperity have had a common source: total revulsion \nagainst war, destruction and darkness. \nForty-seven years later, reflecting on the intervening years, we note \nthat the world has witnessed more, not fewer, incidents of just and unjust \nwars, regional conflicts, racial and ethnic strife, acute forms of human \nsuffering, environmental degradation and an unmitigated endangerment of life \nitself. \nNamibia joined other member States of the Movement of Non-Aligned \nCountries at its Summit in Jakarta in stating that \n\\\"the world today is far from being a peaceful, just and secure place. \nSimmering disputes, violent conflicts, aggression and foreign occupation, \ninterference in the internal affairs of States, policies of hegemony and \ndomination, ethnic strife, religious intolerance, new forms of racism and \n\nnarrowly conceived nationalism are major and dangerous obstacles to \nharmonious coexistence among States and peoples and have even led to the \ndisintegration of States and societies.\\\" \nNuclear conflagration, thank heavens, has not occurred, but the world is \nfar from being a peaceful and secure place. History does indeed repeat \nitself, at least some of the time, if not most of the time. \nLet me add to this assessment one more observation made in Jakarta by an \neminent Asian leader. His view, which is consistent with our own, was: \n\\\"We must also ensure that the new world order to which the leaders of the \nindustrialised countries often refer does not turn out to be but a new \nversion of the same old patterns of domination of the strong over the \nweak and the rich over the poor.\\\" \nFor the new world order to be universally acceptable, it should be genuine in \nits import and distinct from the old unjust and undemocratic order, and it \nshould show a way forward towards greater human solidarity and cooperation. \nAt this very moment, in South Africa, Somalia, Liberia, Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, Cambodia and various parts of the former Soviet Union and \nelsewhere in the world millions of victims languish in perpetual tragedy. \nThis carnage includes innocent and defenceless men, women and children who are \nkilled by guns or hunger. The current state of world affairs hardly \nencourages confidence and optimism about our common future. One need not be a \ncynic to hold this view. \nMy delegation is delighted to see our illustrious Secretary-General \noccupying a lofty place in the United Nations Organization at this critical \ntime of a changing global environment. It was Africa's pride and \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali's own crowning personal achievement when he was \nunanimously elected last year as the first African Secretary-General of our \n\nOrganization. We commend him for his courage and initiative and for the manner \nin which he has so ably carried out his daunting tasks. \nNamibia welcomes the Secretary-General's \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\". Many of the \nideas and recommendations contained in it coincide with those emanating from \nbodies such as the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Non-Aligned \nMovement, the Commonwealth and others, notably the Nordic States, which some \ntime ago circulated their views on the United Nations reform process. \nWith this in mind, Namibia is alive to a suggestion made from this \nrostrum, and endorsed by other delegations, that a special meeting of the \nSecurity Council be convened to consider the Secretary-General's proposals. If \nand when this suggestion is carried out and the proposed meeting takes place, \nwe expect the Secretary-General and the members of the Security Council to \ntake into consideration the contributions I have mentioned and to ensure that \nthe intended consultations are inclusive and transparent. There ought to be a \ncareful balance between the need for a renewed commitment to strengthen \nmechanisms for maintaining world peace and security, on the one hand, and a \nfocus on the burning issues of poverty and other forms of socio-economic \ninjustice, on the other. \nIn this context, I should like to refer to a bold initiative taken by the \nSecretary-General of the OAU, Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim. I have in mind his \nproposed creation of an institutional mechanism, within the OAU General \nSecretariat, to deal promptly and effectively with conflict management, \nprevention and resolution in respect of the eruption of major crises, similar \nto those now prevailing in Somalia and Liberia, in any African State. \n \nThere is also a companion set of proposals in a package entitled \\\"The \nKampala Document\\\", which is the product of a meeting held last year in \nKampala, Uganda, devoted to guestions of security, stability, development and \nco-operation in Africa. These proposals, in our view, are serious and \npractical innovations by Africans themselves to confront major political and \nsecurity crises as and when they occur in any part of Africa, and we \nwholeheartedly endorse them. \n \nThe United Nations Charter itself devotes its chapter VIII to regional \narrangements or agencies for dealing with issues such as peace, security and \nconflict, and encourages appropriate action which is consistent with the \npurposes and principles of the United Nations. The current Secretary-General \nhimself lamented the fact that the \\\"cold war had impaired the proper \nactivation of this key provision of the Charter and also the fact that\\\", to \nparaphrase him, rather than helping to resolve regional conflicts super-Powers \nactually managed to exacerbate them for their own selfish ends. \nQuite clearly, there is a linkage between the priority agendas of the \nSecretaries-General of the United Nations and of the Organization of African \nUnity, and this is, as a matter of fact, in keeping with the long-standing \nco-operation between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. \nMr. President, at this juncture I should like to address a few words to \nyou personally. May I begin by stating that your own unanimous election and \nthe critical role required of your office become not only propitious on the \ntime-scale of the global agenda, as evidenced by the items for discussion \nduring the current session of the Assembly, but equally by affording an ideal \nopportunity to you boldly and unambiguously to articulate the concerns and \naspirations of the poor and developing Members of this Organization. \nIt gives me great pleasure, therefore, on behalf of the Government and \npeople of Namibia, to extend congratulations to you upon your brilliant \nelection. I have no doubt in my mind that, given your diplomatic skills and \nvast practical experience, our deliberations will be crowned with success. \nOur two friendly countries enjoy excellent relations, and I extend best wishes \nto you. \nTo your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Shamir S. Shihabi of the Kingdom \nof Saudi Arabia, I say many congratulations for a job well done, and I should \nlike to wish him great success and happiness in his future endeavours. \n\nThe long cherished ideal of the universality of our Organization has been \nfurther enhanced as more and more new nations have joined its membership. As \nthis world becomes unavoidably interdependent and we collectively realize that \nthe world is truly a global village, increasingly high expectations are now \nbeing placed in the United Nations. This is yet another reason why the \nOrganization needs to be further revitalized and genuinely democratized. \nThe world's contemporary challenges stemming from rapidly changing \ninter-State relations and social problems cannot be adequately dealt with by \nthe United Nations without fundamental institutional and procedural reforms, \nincluding the revision of its Charter. It is in this context that Namibia \nwelcomes all the new Members and wishes them well, while assuring them of our \ndesire to promote close co-operation with all of them in a spirit of \nfriendship and peaceful coexistence. \nThe Rio Earth Summit made the matter abundantly clear: that global \neconomic development and environmental protection go hand in hand. \nDevelopment must be based on the sustainable utilization of the environment \nfor the sake of this and all future generations. \nNamibia's Constitution contains a special provision on this crucial \nsubject. It states: \n\\\"The State shall actively promote and maintain the welfare of the \npeople by adopting, inter alia, policies aimed at ... the maintenance of \necosystems, essential ecological processes and biological diversity of \nNamibia and utilization of living natural resources on a sustainable \nbasis for the benefit of all Namibians, both present and future; in \nparticular, the Government shall provide measures against the dumping or \nrecycling of foreign nuclear and toxic waste on Namibian territory.\\\" \n \nMoreover, it further charges the Ombudsman with the duty \n\\\"to investigate complaints concerning the over-utilization of living \nnatural resources, the irrational exploitation of non-renewable \nresources, the degradation and destruction of ecosystems and failure to \nprotect the beauty and character of Namibia.\\\" \nTowards implementing environment-friendly policies which aim at \nsustainable development, the Government had, prior to the Rio Earth Summit, \nadopted a \\\"Green Plan\\\" for Namibia that outlines a comprehensive framework for \ndevelopment in accordance with sustainable environmental principles. The Plan \nelaborates on the Government's approach to our ecological challenges and the \nconscientious management of our natural resources and national assets. \nDuring the days of apartheid colonialism and foreign exploitation, both \nrenewable and non-renewable resources that provided the very basis of the \neconomy were subjected to ruthless plunder mainly for the benefit of \nforeigners. The Government has taken steps to put an end to this disastrous \nsituation. Many in the developing world, Namibia foremost among them, depend \non these resources for daily subsistence, and unless there are going to be \nalternatives for dealing with debilitating problems such as the debt burden, \nthe foreign exchange dilemma and technological backwardness, many of us are, \nsad to say, bound to remain in a perpetual state of poverty and \nunderdevelopment. This would in turn mean further degrading the environment \nand endangering our very existence. \nIt follows that what is required now is an undertaking to speed up \nimplementation of Agenda 21, adopted in Rio. Its financing, it must be \nstressed, is not only to assist the developing countries to fight poverty and \ncreate jobs but equally to protect the ecosystem itself, which is very vital \nfor the survival of humankind. \n \nIn the same vein, let me add that Namibia, being a dry, semi-desert \ncountry, endorses the proposed convention on combating desertification and \nurges that the preparation of the international convention on desertification \nbe undertaken during the current session. \nThis brings me to the next topic, namely the current drought and acute \nsituation of hunger and suffering which has afflicted the whole of the \nsouthern African subregion. Crop production, livestock farming and our \nefforts to become food-sufficient and to achieve security have suffered \nseverely. The Government established a National Committee on Drought to \nensure, inter alia, better coordination and more efficient delivery of water \nand food to the most needy sections of the population and the sustenance of \nthe livestock and game. An initial amount of 120 million rand was budgeted \nfor these vital schemes. \nFurthermore, in addition to these national efforts, we have also made a \nspecial appeal to the international community and, generally speaking, the \nresponse has been prompt and helpful, for which Namibia is exceedingly \ngrateful. \nA regional effort is under way which involves both the sharing of data \nand the coordinating of programmes and communication and transport facilities, \ncoupled with the assistance received from the United Nations system, \nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and individuals around \nthe world. \nIn this connection, I should like to express a special word of \ncommendation and appreciation to Sir Ketumile Masire, President of the \nRepublic of Botswana, and to the secretariat of Southern African Development \nCoordination Conference (SADCC) for having taken timely and decisive steps \n\nwith a view to sensitizing and mobilizing the international community as to \nthe plight of all our peoples in the subregion and for co-sponsoring an \nimportant conference on the situation in Geneva early this year. Of course, \nwe all remain hopeful that there will be early and abundant rains this year, \nand in all subsequent years, as this will, no doubt, mean saving lives. I \nthought I should also add here a point which, with each passing day, is \nbecoming more and more clear to all Namibians. This has to do with finding, \npreserving, planning and distributing water resources, as being perhaps the \nsingle most precious primary commodity needed to keep us going and sustain \nlife itself. \nThe realization that the world is a global village and one market-place \nwith interlocking financial institutions and credit arrangements underlines \nthe internationalization of the world economy. \nNamibia, being one of the poorest countries in the South, must continue \nto raise its voice, in unison with other members of the non-aligned movement \nand the rest of the developing countries, in favour of the creation of a new \nand just international economic order. The call for global economic \nrestructuring and reform is a legitimate demand, which should find its place \namong the top priorities on the agenda of this and other international forums. \nThe ending of the cold war, as it is alleged, and the emergence of a \nso-called new world order, characterized in part by the rapprochement of the \nnuclear Powers, have engendered a peculiar, new culture of economic blackmail \nand sabotage. Powerful and rich countries have lately tended to tamper with \nthe sovereignty of weaker and poorer nations by using the power of the purse \nand by laying down some stringent conditions. This is being done supposedly \n\nto promote democracy, transparency in governance and public accountability a \nsituation which leads to unilateral and often punitive actions just to prove a \npoint. To us, it unfortunately constitutes an arbitrary and precipitous \nexercise of power and judgement. \nAs Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, the former Chairman of the South Commission, \nput it recently on another occasion: \n\\\"these events have had two very important consequences for the South, and \nall the countries of it. First, they increase the urgency of developing \ncountries building national self-reliance and increasing their economic \nco-operation in all fields. Secondly, the triumphant West now believes \nthat its success in the cold war gives it the right as well as the \nuntrammeled power aggressively to promote its economic and political \nphilosophy throughout the South. \n\\\"Directly, and through international finance and trade institutions \ncontrolled by the wealthy States, and sometimes by embargoes or even \npolitical intervention, the North is therefore forcing developing \ncountries of the South to conform to the patterns it designs. \n\\\"At the same time protectionism of different kinds is increasing in \nthe North, and our separate weakness is being used to ride roughshod over \nour opinions in international negotiations as well as in bilateral \nSouth-North discussions.\\\" \nHow can one disagree with this poignant observation? \nThe non-aligned Movement which represents the majority of humankind \nis an ideal forum for the developing countries within which to plan and act \ntogether on issues, including the important issues which preoccupy the United \nNations. \n\nAllow me, once again, to cite Mwalimu's wise and telling words when he \nasserted thus: \n\\\"We need a Movement of the South to speak for the rights of the countries \nof the South. At present what we have is the Non-Aligned Movement, and \nfor United Nations negotiating purposes the Group of 77. Why then is \nthere this talk of the Non-Aligned Movement no longer being needed?\\\" \nThis, I believe, remains the inescapable reality, whether the world was or is \nbipolar or unipolar. \n\nOn the situation in South Africa, Namibia expresses support for and \nsolidarity with the liberation movements and all the democratic forces inside \nthat violence-torn neighbouring country. That is why we felt gratified, and \nparticipated in the debate, when the issue of the raging violence in South \nAfrica was brought to the Security Council last July. \nOur emphasis in our statement was that, now that the United Nations had \nbecome engaged in the situation, its presence should be prolonged and the size \nof its team increased in order to monitor the violence and assist in the \ntransition to a democratic, non-racial and united South Africa. For now, the \nsituation remains explosive and dangerous and, therefore, warrants the \ncontinuation of international pressure on the South African Government. \nIn the meantime, we call upon Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi of the \nInkatha Freedom Party to rejoin Comrade Nelson Mandela, President de Klerk and \nhis other compatriots in the negotiations, with the establishment and \nconsolidation of peace as the first prerequisite, and the adoption of a \ndemocratic constitution as the next step in the transition. \nFor the first time in their history, our Angolan neighbours went to the \npolls on 29 and 30 September, in multiparty elections, to choose a party and \ncandidates who must now install a new Government. It has not been easy, but \nthe sheer will and determination of the voters and monitors alike have \nconfounded many a cynic who believed that it would be impossible to hold free \nand fair elections in Angola. Namibia sees this is a great victory for the \nAngolan people,-and congratulates them. It also congratulates the leaders of \nall the political parties on believing in their people's political maturity \nand accepting the final verdict of the ballot-box. Namibia once again gives \nits assurance that it will continue to work closely with the Government of the \n \nday in that sisterly and friendly country, on the basis of friendship and for \nthe benefit of both countries. \nThe Government of President Chissano and RENAMO finally sat down together \nin Rome and signed a ceasefire agreement to end the fighting in Mozambique and \nrebuild the country. We congratulate both President Joaquim Chissano and \nMr. Afonso Dhlakama on demonstrating political will and for giving the \nMozambican people hope and confidence in their future. They deserve our full \nand hearty congratulations on this momentous achievement, and we wish them \nfurther success as they work for the adoption of a new constitution and for \nthe restoration of peace and order in their country. \nMany helpers and interlocutors made this achievement possible. They \ninclude the Italian hosts and, in particular, the United Nations. But I \nshould like to commend Presidents Mugabe and Masire for their mediation \nefforts, which have paid off, to the great happiness of all Africans and their \nwell-wishers around the world. There was one more key player: Mr. Pik Botha, \nthe South African Foreign Minister, who was very active during the final, \ndelicate hours, thereby securing the signing of the cease-fire agreement. \nNamibia is also pleased to acknowledge his contribution. \nAs regards the situation in Somalia, Namibia supports the request of \nPresident Abdou Diouf of the Republic of Senegal, current Chairman of the \nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), that an international conference on the \nhuman disaster in that African country be convened as a matter of the utmost \nurgency. As the United Nations Secretary-General himself has put it, \n\\\"when it comes to death and misery, no one situation takes priority over \nanother.\\\" (A/47/1, para. 116) \n\nOn the situation in Western Sahara, Namibi supports the principle of \nself-determination for the Saharan people. To this end, we endorse the \nefforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to remove all \nthe obstacles and help resolve disputes about the criteria for eligibility to \nvote in the referendum, and thus to advance the process. \nLikewise, Namibia has always held the view that the political \naspirations, and in particular the right to self-determination, of the \nPalestinian people, led by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), are at \nthe core of the conflict in the Middle East. Here we include the \nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State, in accordance with Security \nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). The season of peace and \ndialogue has arrived. In the present circumstances, that is the only viable \nand sensible game in town. If a face-to-face meeting between the President of \nSyria and the Prime Minister of Israel will give further impetus to the Middle \nEast peace process and pave the way towards a just, comprehensive and lasting \nsettlement, Namibia will strongly encourage such a historic undertaking within \nthe framework of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). \nIran and the United Arab Emirates two sisterly and friendly \nneighbours - ought not to allow the present misunderstandings to be magnified \nbeyond the confines of their bilateral relations. Rather, they should resolve \nthose misunderstandings through dialogue and by peaceful means. \nHappily, Kuwait is going ahead with the consolidation of peace and the \nreconstruction of the country. Namibia expresses its unswerving solidarity \nwith its Kuwaiti friends, and extends best wishes to them. \n\nThe carnage in Bosnia and Herzegovina is but the latest instance of man's \ninhumanity to man. Whether it takes place under the banner of the notorious \n\\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" or as religious retribution, this ugly tragedy cannot be \nallowed to continue. \nIn and around the Korean peninsula, we see steady movement by all the \nparties concerned in favour of dialogue, while de-emphasizing confrontation \nand military solutions. This is indeed good news for world peace and \nsecurity. The reunification of Korea is no longer an unthinkable goal, as the \nNorth and the South of that divided nation earnestly continue to regularise \nhigh-level meetings and to encourage families to interact freely. \n \nWe urge the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, \nwith both of which Namibia maintains excellent diplomatic and cooperative \nrelations, to remain engaged in those critical discussions until an amicable \nand peaceful solution is found. \nPeace and reconciliation in Cambodia are yet to be realized. Inspired by \nthe success of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in \nNamibia, we hope and pray that the ongoing United Nations Transitional \nAuthority in Cambodia (UNTAC) operation in that troubled country, too, will be \ncrowned with huge success. \nIn concluding my statement, I would be remiss if I did not give an update \nto the General Assembly and the Secretary-General on the outstanding dispute \nbetween Namibia and South Africa on Walvis Bay and the offshore islands. As \nthe matter stands now, a joint transitional administration of a limited \nduration will be established over these territories on 1 November 1992. It \nwill be known as the Joint Administrative Authority and headed by two Chief \nExecutives, one Namibian and one South African. In the meantime, the two \nGovernments will keep the negotiations going on the core issue of \nre-integration, in accordance with Security Council resolution 432 (1978). \nFinally, may I also inform the Assembly that Namibia became the one \nhundred and fifth member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) \non 15 September 1992 and also acceded to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty \n(NPT) and deposited the instruments to this effect with the designated \nauthorities. \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Sao Tome and Principe \ndelegation, I should like to congratulate the President on his unanimous \nelection to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly. His election is unquestionably a tribute to his country and \na recognition of his qualities as a diplomat. \nMay I take this opportunity to express our appreciation of the efficient \nmanner in which his predecessor, Ambassador Samir Shihabi, presided over the \nwork of the forty-sixth session. \nWe should like to again express our confidence in and admiration for the \nleadership shown by the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in \n\ndealing with the challenges facing the Organization in this crucial phase of \nits history. \nWe extend our greetings to the new Members of the Organization. Their \nadmission is a confirmation of the universalist calling of the United Nations \nat time when its actions are making themselves felt everywhere in the world. \n\nThe end of the cold war has made it possible to foresee a new era in \ninternational relations, characterized by respect for international law and \nfor the principles inscribed in Charter of the United Nations, and by a search \nfor solutions to the great and complex problems that are on the agenda of the \nhuman community. \nOur hopes for a better world, held hostage for so long by the reductive \nManichaeism of the East-West conflict, have taken form and are reflected in a \ncommon desire to create a new world order based on respect for the legitimate \nrights of peoples, on lasting peace, on a more balanced distribution of world \nresources, and on active solidarity between the rich and poor peoples of our \nplanet, with the United Nations as a focal point and point of reference. \nWhile it is absolutely clear today that important steps are being taken \ntowards making some of these aspirations a reality, it is no less certain that \nthe definition of priorities, the selection of means, the allocation of the \nnecessary resources and, in some cases, the very solutions chosen all reflect \nconditionalities born of the old order and bespeak a selective approach that \ndoes not always match the noble purposes and principles that inspire the \nUnited Nations Charter. While it is not realistic to expect an immediate \nsolution to such complex and difficult problems as those that result from the \nprofound imbalance we find between North and South, the absence of any \nconcrete and serious movement in this direction continues to be a concern. \nThat millions of men, women and children are living in circumstances that \nare a denial of their human condition is not admissible in this century, which \nhas been witness to so many of man's conquests. \n\nThat entire peoples should also find their fundamental rights denied by \nthe forces of occupying regimes, in flagrant violation of Security Council \ndecisions, is clearly anachronistic, especially when the United Nations has, \nin some cases, already mobilized the collective will of its Members and the \nmechanisms provided for in its Charter to impose respect for international \nlaw. That liberation from the oppressor's yoke, which keeps entire nations \nsubjugated, is giving rise to acts of truly suicidal barbarism in various \nparts of the world is a challenge to which we must respond with the greatest \nurgency and determination. That the future of the coming generations on this \nplanet is being menaced by the irresponsible and blind exploitation of limited \nresources in the name of short-term interests reveals an individualism that \ncannot leave us indifferent. \nFor this reason, we would like to associate the Democratic Republic of \nSao Tome and Principe with those who, from this very rostrum, have condemned \nthe violence that threatens the initiatives aimed at seeking a peaceful and \nnegotiated solution in South Africa, within the context of the Convention for \na Democratic South Africa, the path chosen for a peaceful transition to power \nfor the black majority. \nFor this reason too we salute the Angolan people for the maturity it has \ndemonstrated throughout the recent electoral process, which will permit the \nRepublic of Angola to dedicate itself, in an atmosphere of peace and national \nreconciliation, to the tremendous task of rebuilding the country. \nWe cannot but regret that last-minute problems have prevented the \nscheduled signature of the cease-fire agreements between the Government of \nMozambique and RENAMO. We would like to express our solidarity with the \nPeoples of Mozambique and our encouragement to the parties involved to \n\npersevere on the path of a peaceful solution with all the seriousness and \ncommitment that the situation demands. \nWe are following the Middle East negotiations with great anticipation, \nhoping that they will lead to the realization of the legitimate rights of the \nPalestinian people and a solution to the territorial conflicts that separate \nthe peoples of the region, in compliance with the pertinent resolutions of the \nSecurity Council. We hope, likewise, that the self-determination referendum \nin Western Sahara will permit the people of that territory to decide their own \ndestiny. \nIt is for this reason, too, that we lament the fact that the people of \nEast Timor have had their voice silenced and that the massacres of which they \nare the victims are not sufficient evidence that their legitimate right to \nself-determination has been repressed by the force of an occupation that is on \nall counts contrary to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. \nWe would like to believe that the recent meeting between the Foreign Ministers \nof Portugal, the administering Power, and Indonesia, under the auspices of the \nSecretary General, will lead to a serious process of negotiation aimed at \nfinding a peaceful solution to the question that will end the suffering of the \npeople of East Timor. In our view, it is essential that at the appropriate \ntime representatives of the people of East Timor be involved in the \nnegotiating process. \nAt the same time, we cannot fail to repudiate and vigorously condemn \nthose responsible for the gratuitous suffering and human misery imposed on the \npeoples of Somalia, Liberia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. We believe that any \nreluctance to implement the decisions of the Rio de Janeiro Summit will, over \ntime, compromise our common destiny. \n\nToday more than ever before, the United Nations as an organization has a \nrole of fundamental importance to play in defining the new world order that is \nbeing built, assuming responsibility, in the spirit of the Charter and with \nthe participation of all its Members, for translating our collective \naspirations into joint undertakings that will mobilize our energies and \nresources and optimize the potential contributions of each individual Member \nState. Thus, our admiration and encouragement go out to our \nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the efforts he is making to \nrestructure the Secretariat and for the initiatives he is pressing in various \nareas of the Organization's activities. \nWe believe it is essential that the decision-making process within our \nOrganization be in keeping with the democratic principles so dear to us, and \nthat the organs and mechanisms for the promotion of economic and social \ndevelopment be upgraded in order to permit a more effective response to the \nmajor challenges that humanity faces as this century nears its end. \nThe dynamism, breadth and consensus that inspire the activities of the \nOrganization in the areas of conflict prevention and peace-keeping must lead \nus to pay special attention to the effort to restructure the economic and \nsocial sector in order to maximize the effectiveness of the intervention of \nthe various agencies of the system an effort already under way, as we have \nbeen informed in the Secretary-General's report. \nThe establishment of a new, more just and more lasting world order would \nappear to presuppose and assume at the national level a two-fold, fundamental \nchallenge of our times: democratization and development. \n\nOver and above selecting the model most suited to the historical and \nsocio-cultural realities of each country, it is quite clear today that the \nestablishment of institutions that favour the participation of the people in \nthe management of public affairs and respect for basic human rights, including \nthe free and regular choice of leaders, is today a condition for any lasting \ndevelopment. It is also evident that, in view of the high level of dependence \nof the so-called third-world countries on the outside world, no development \nwill be possible unless we see a change in the unequal terms of exchange that \ncondemn the gigantic effort of many peoples to the caprices of a free market \nin which decisions are taken totally without their consent. \nPowerless victims of the imponderables of the world economy, in which \nthey play but a marginal role, the nations of the third world will never be in \na position to meet the development challenge unless fairer and more \nappropriate mechanisms are introduced in international economic relations to \nalter the terms of the involvement of those nations in the process of world \nexchanges. For a growing group of these countries the least developed \ncountries international solidarity must be mobilized through cooperation \nmore attuned to their requirements and better suited to the specific needs of \neach one. \nWe in Sao Tome and Principe are prepared and determined to meet this \ntwofold challenge. Faced with the need to move beyond the state of lethargy \nin which our-country found itself, political forces in Sao Tome turned to the \npath of transformation that led to the establishment of a democratic State \nthrough a process in which the dominant notes are dialogue, tolerance, the \nachievement of consensus and respect for diversity of viewpoints. \n\nThe political aspect of this endeavour found fertile ground, for the \nreasons I mentioned earlier and because it corresponded to the aspiration of \nthe people to a future in which their fundamental rights and guarantees will \nbe duly safeguarded. I must note, however, that major constraints of an \neconomic and financial nature, the precipitous drop in the standard of living, \nand an inability to see light at the end of the tunnel of our deep concerns \nwill surely pose a threat to the new democratic regime, with the whole array \nof consequences this could have. \nThe dilemma posed by a crisis that is unbearable on all counts and by the \nimplementation of democratic principles demonstrates clearly that the \ninsistent calls for the democratization of developing countries will never go \nbeyond a mere Utopian dream unless they are backed by a new international \nvision open to a realistic solution of the debt problem, to a favourable \nchange in the terms of trade and to a gradual transfer of technology to the \nraw-material-producing countries, thus giving them the ability to transform \nthemselves to their own profit. \nThere are few moments in the common history of mankind when, as in our \nown time, the political, economic, defence and security architecture of the \nplanet undergoes profound and significant changes. The diversity, the \ncomplexity and, not unexpectedly, the unpredictability of these changes \nrepresent an opportunity that must not be lost to make decisions towards \ncorrecting the asymmetries and injustices forged by an order which is \ngradually disintegrating before our eyes. For we are all aware of the \nnon-viability of a world whose contrasts shock and whose profound inequalities \nconstitute unequivocal factors of instability and revolt. \n\nWe therefore believe that only an international effort of intelligent \nconvergence will permit responses that can satisfy the legitimate interests of \npeoples all over the world: a task in which the United Nations should play a \nkey role, a role it is already demonstrating it can assume through \nintervention that is increasingly prestigious because it is incisive and \npragmatic, covering the most varied regions of the world. \nDespite the re-emergence of political, religious and ethnic intolerance \nthat all too often degenerates into more extended areas of instability, and \ndespite the persistence of major symptoms of inequality in cooperation among \nnations and the consequent inequality in the living conditions of the \npeoples concerned it is fair to state that we have taken a giant step \nforward. The more skeptical among us will say that one step is not much on \nthe long road ahead of us, but we retain the hope that, together, freed of \nexacerbated and futile self-centredness, we will be capable of progressing \nalong the arduous path to which we are irrevocably committed. \nThe immediate tomorrows may not hear a lot of song, but the future \nbelongs to the world. \n"

        "file_text": "I would like first to join previous speakers \nin extending to Ambassador Ganev my warm congratulations on his election. It \ngives me particular pleasure to see the representative of one of the new \nEuropean democracies, which is also a friendly neighbour of Romania, heading \nsuch an important session. \nI should like also to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros \nBoutros-Ghali, whose tireless endeavours to catalyze our common efforts aiming \nat conferring on the United Nations a new role attuned to a changing world \nenjoy my country's full support. \nWithin a few days, we in Romania are going to experience a historic \nmoment in the post-revolutionary history of our country. On 27 September, \nparliamentary and presidential elections - the first since the adoption of our \nnew democratic Constitution will take place. We see them as a landmark for \na country whose firm choice of political pluralism, the rule of law, democracy \nand a market economy has, for the most part, been undeservedly doubted. I \nwant to inform the Assembly that the Romanian Government has done its best to \nensure a fair electoral campaign, and free and fair elections. In turn, the \npresence of thousands of domestic and numerous foreign observers is a solid \nguarantee of this. \nIt is not my intention to speak here and now about the heavy tolls the \nRomanian people has already paid on the road to a reform process able to \nstrike a feasible balance between legitimate aspirations and the scarcity of \nthe economic resources needed to meet them. But I feel entitled to say that \nthe incidental lapses that have sometimes seemed to jeopardize the steady \ncourse of transition stemmed not from attempts to look back but rather from a \ncertain eagerness to step into the future one day sooner. \n \nLike all the other new Central European democracies, Romania is \nundergoing a test that has no historical precedent, namely simultaneously to \ncreate new political structures and new, workable economic mechanisms. \nHowever, as our Prime Minister recently said, we have already saved ourselves \nfrom five years of perestroika. And we must keep on forging forward while, \nparadoxically, we are still searching for gradualism. Moreover, there is no \nsign that someone has an ideal, fool-proof blueprint for the changes we are \nstriving for. Thank God, it seems that Romania has already left behind most \nof its childhood diseases. Considering that the saying \\\"the sooner the \nbetter\\\" goes for measles too, we might prove in the long run to have been \namong the lucky ones in post-Communist Europe. \nTo cite just one example, I would recall that in the past year \nallegations concerning so-called Romanian anti-semitism have been frequently \nvoiced. Now, that it has become clear that they were groundless, it is our \nturn to be concerned that in neighboring countries and other Central European \ncountries, xenophobic, racist and anti-semitic trends have emerged. \nThe crux of the matter for our country and for other countries in \ntransition is to strengthen the learning capacity of society. We have no \ncomfortable dogmas or patterns to follow. We are courageously taking risks. \nThe whole process of reform has already reached the point of no return: \nanother reason why countries in transition should not be left alone, the more \nso because, in a certain sense, not only post-Communist Europe but the world \nas a whole is in transition. \n\nThe economic, moral and political investments Romania has enjoyed during \nthe last year have already proved that our message has been perfectly \nunderstood by most of our potential partners. I make no secret that such \ninvestments of confidence have followed an ascending curve, one corresponding \nboth to the growing domestic stability of Romania and our ever increasing \ninternational confirmation as a reliable pillar of Central European and \ncontinental security. \nSuch a positive judgement on the last year's developments in Romania is \nconvincingly supported by a series of parallel achievements in our domestic \nand our foreign policy. Let me mention just a few of our domestic \nachievements: the setting up of a new legislative and institutional framework \nable to guarantee the rule of law, political pluralism, free and fair \nelections, transition to a market economy and full respect for human rights \nand fundamental freedoms; the adoption by the Parliament elected in May 1990 \nof the new Constitution approved by national referendum on 8 December 1991; \nand the fact that, according to our fundamental law, the State recognizes and \nguarantees to persons belonging to national minorities the right to preserve, \ndevelop and express their cultural, linguistic and religious identity, to \nwhich one can add a particular feature of Romania's Constitution, whose \narticle 20 states that \n\\\"constitutional provisions concerning the citizens' rights and liberties \nshall be interpreted and enforced in conformity with the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, and with the covenants and other treaties to \nwhich Romania is a party\\\" \n\nand that \n\\\"where any inconsistencies exist between the covenants and treaties on \nfundamental human rights to which Romania is a party and domestic laws, \nthe international regulations shall take precedence\\\". \nAnother achievement is the local elections held in February 1992, \nconfirmed as fair and free by their main outcome: by the fact that the \nopposition parties won an important number of seats everywhere in the \ncountry. As a result, Romanian society enjoys more balanced political \nrepresentation, clearly contradicting allegations pointing to the danger of \n\\\"monolithism\\\" in Romania. The fairness of the elections was confirmed also in \nthe conclusions drawn by the foreign observers who witnessed the ballot. The \ncountry qualifies to be called pluralistic and democratic. \n\nThe unfolding of the current election campaign brings new proof that \npolitical pluralism, the rule of law, free access to the media, and freedom of \nspeech are becoming normal facts of life in today's Romania. All of these are \npromises that they will greatly contribute to the strengthening of both the \ninstitutional framework and its functioning, thereby irreversibly including \nRomania in the family of stable and democratic States. \nThrough adequate legislation, the building-up of economic and financial \nmarket mechanisms, the privatization of the land, industry, trade, services \nand tourism, Romania has succeeded in breaking away from the command economy \nand in becoming more and more attractive to foreign investors. Romania is now \nin its third year of transition. It has laid the foundations of a market \neconomy and is ready to begin structural reform. As part of the reform, the \nRomanian Government adopted an economic stabilization programme supported by a \nstand-by loan from the International Monetary Fund. The programme lays stress \non classical anti-inflationary measures and, at the same time, has specific \nelements conditioned by the need to create a market mechanism. \nAs a matter of principle, Romania aims at developing normal relations of \ncooperation with all States, and in particular with its neighbours. The \nforeign policy of our Government is inspired by the political will to create \nthe necessary conditions leading to Romania's irreversible anchorage within \nthe Euro-Atlantic space and its viable institutions, and, respectively, to \nincrease the country's contribution to the building-up of the Euro-Atlantic \ncommunity of values and of a new continental security order. In this spirit, \nRomania entered into negotiations on an association agreement with the \nEuropean Communities that is about to be concluded, and a cooperation \nagreement with the European Free Trade Association. At the same time, like \nthe other Central European countries, Romania entered into a special \n\nrelationship with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and attaches \nparticular importance to its participation as a partner in the North-Atlantic \nCo-operation Council. \nThe efforts to restore and consolidate democracy in Romania cannot and \nshould not be isolated from the international environment in which we are \nliving. Our major concern about the situation in Yugoslavia has been made \nmanifest in many circumstances. Being in the unique position in this area of \nhaving never waged a fighting war against any of the peoples of the former \nYugoslavia, Romania is its only neighbour whose perception and attitude are in \nno way biased by territorial or other interests of any kind. As a State \nproviding full evidence of balanced conduct and good relations with all the \nYugoslav republics, Romania can afford to take a neutral stand on any related \nmatter and is determined to contribute further to the efforts of the \ninternational community to restore peace and stability in Yugoslavia. \nAs participants in the London Conference on Yugoslavia, we have stressed \nthat a peaceful settlement is the only acceptable alternative for all the \nparties to the conflict. Despite the evolution of the conflict in the \naftermath of the London Conference, we still believe that the relevant action \nprogramme adopted there is comprehensive and realistic, although peace may not \nbe achieved overnight. \nThe concerted efforts of the United Nations and the European Community, \nsupported by all the participants in the Conference, including Romania which \nis the first non-Community neighbouring country represented in the Steering \nCommittee - should not ignore the fact that the specific patchwork of \nYugoslavia has always challenged conventional wisdom. Now it also challenges \nthe application of the basic concepts of international law. There cannot be a \n\nseparate international law for Yugoslavia. Although the conditions are \nhistorically and psychologically peculiar, international law is the same for \nall. \nWe may think of arrangements adapted to the specific situation and \nacceptable to the parties concerned. Whatever their contents, they will \nremain what they are one-time solutions that do not create international \nlaw. Given that Romania's initiative in asking for international monitoring \nof the observance of the embargo along our Danubian frontier with former \nYugoslavia has been confirmed as a positive example to be followed by other \nneighbors, I shall not dwell at length on this matter. But I cannot help \nunderlining that the costly consequences of my country's scrupulous compliance \nwith the resolutions of the Security Council on Yugoslavia have triggered \nlegitimate concerns among the population of the country. It fears that, as in \nthe case of the Gulf War, Romania could again economically and financially pay \nmore than it can afford for being a law-abiding member of the international \ncommunity. \nThat is why we would suggest that the Security Council devise a set of \nmeasures involving the financial institutions and other components of the \nUnited Nations system that can help States to meet the economic difficulties \nentailed by compliance with the regime of sanctions. We envisage a standing \ncompensation fund to be administered by the Security Council in order to \nalleviate, if not fully compensate for, the economic losses of countries \nparticularly stricken by embargoes and other sanctions established by the \nSecurity Council. We are in the process of working out a more detailed \nproposal to this effect, which we are going to submit to the United Nations \ncommunity for consideration. The existence of such a fund would be a way of \nencouraging States to cooperate with the Council in situations of crisis \nmanagement. \n\nIn the case of the conflict in the eastern part of the Republic of \nMoldova, we are seeing a sort of \\\"pacification\\\" that is, in fact, proving to \nbe a kind of blackmail for the independence and territorial integrity of that \nState. It is precisely the same army that generated the conflict and gave \narms and other support to separatist forces that today is performing the role \nof \\\"peacekeeper\\\". This pattern has been resorted to in other newly independent \nStates as well. We sometimes ask ourselves if the independence of all these \nformer Soviet republics is taken seriously by the international community or \nwhether it is only a smoke screen behind which a new imperial structure is \ntaking shape. \nIn any case, we in Romania take it seriously. We cannot remain \nindifferent when we see tendencies to remake the old empire, into which \nMoldova was forcibly incorporated as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. \nOur interest in the independence and democratic development of a State where \n65 per cent of the population is Romanian is natural. We are concerned that a \nwise propensity for compromise from the Moldovan leaders was rewarded with a \npolicy of fait accompli aimed at institutionalizing the separation of the \nTrans-Dniestr region from the Republic of Moldova. The evolution of the \nconflict in the Republic of Moldova, taken in conjunction with the conflicts \ngenerated elsewhere in the newly independent States, shows that nostalgia for \nthe former empire exists and has painful consequences for the peoples that \nhave gained their freedom at so high a cost. \nIt is the common wisdom that the United Nations remains a major actor in \nthe whole process of world change and a flag-bearer of indisputable \nauthority. In this respect, the new lease on life given to preventive \ndiplomacy is crucial. An encouraging and valuable political consensus on this \nissue was expressed during the summit-level Security Council meeting held on \n\n31 January 1992. The report of the Secretary-General \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" \nincludes a set of inspired guidelines which, once adopted and implemented, \nwould bring us closer to the ideals the United Nations pursues in a world of \nturbulence. At the same time, we have to be mindful that we are contemplating \na long-lasting framework and that there is therefore a need to avoid ephemeral \nsolutions and mechanisms inspired by specific and temporary conflicts or \ninfluenced by emotional or short-view approaches. \n \nGiven the tragic situation in Yugoslavia and other lessons drawn from \nrecent history, we must also forgo hasty generalizations and biased views. \nWisdom and patience, an even-handed attitude, and the spirit of compromise are \nthe necessary basic ingredients for any settlement involving the destiny of \npeoples. In this respect, we wholeheartedly endorse the pertinent remarks of \nthe Secretary-General, who says in his report that, if every ethnic, religious \nor linguistic group claimed statehood, there would be no limit to \nfragmentation, and peace, security and economic well-being for all would \nbecome ever more difficult to achieve. \nYet, we would find it extremely useful if the General Assembly were to \nanalyse more thoroughly the concept of the self-determination of peoples in \norder to prevent any distortion of this specific concept in the sense of \nextrapolating it to the case of national minorities. Generally speaking, we \nshould try to avoid a risky tendency towards a \\\"proliferation of principles\\\". \nOf course, some might be tempted to say that the current turmoils in different \nparts of the world are living proof that the principles enshrined in the \nUnited Nations Charter are out of date or at least incomplete. We share the \nview with the great majority of United Nations Member States that it is not \nthe principles that are wanting but the way they are put into practice. \nDisregard or breaches of international law favour conflicts and not a \nso-called \\\"scarcity\\\" of principles. \nThe year 1992 is a milestone year for cooperative measures aimed at arms \ncontrol and disarmament, transparency and confidence, strengthening \naction-oriented dialogue, and cooperation on security issues. The Romanian \nGovernment welcomes the conclusion of the Convention on the destruction and \nprohibition of chemical weapons and is ready to sign the Convention in \n\nJanuary 1993 in Paris. We regard this Convention as a genuine pillar of \ninternational security. \nAt the same time, the set of major agreements that were signed or that \nentered into force this year at the European level the Treaty on \nConventional Forces in Europe, the Vienna Document, the Helsinki Final Act on \nConventional Armed Forces, and the Open Skies Treaty - have laid the \nfoundation for lasting cooperation and stability on the Continent. The \nopening in Vienna, this very week, of the Forum for Security Cooperation \nlaunches a further stage of the dialogue among the participating States of the \nConference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in their joint \nendeavour for increased security and stability for each and every country in \nthe Euro-Atlantic area. In addition, particular mention should be made of the \nhistorical processes within both the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and \nthe partnership established among the Western European Union (WEU) member \nStates and the eight countries of Central Europe, including Romania. \nThus, step by step, the basic components of a new security order in \nEurope are taking shape, taking into account the structural transformations on \nthe European continent. In fact, today the security of any country in the \nEuropean sphere cannot be conceived but as a result of harmonious interaction \nbetween the United Nations, CSCE, NATO and WEU, and also of increased efforts \nat the subregional level. \nWe welcome the decisions to convene the World Conference on Human Rights \nin 1993 and a world summit on social development in 1995. In our opinion, the \n1993 World Conference should represent an important occasion for putting a \nfinal stop to the tendencies to politicize minority issues by taking them out \nof their natural framework - the framework of human rights a framework which \noffers the best and the only viable answers to concerns connected to \n \nguaranteeing and respecting the legitimate rights of persons belonging to \nnational minorities and to the protection of ethnic, cultural, linguistic and \nreligious identity. \nThe health of the world community vitally depends on the health of our \nplanet itself. The Rio Conference proved that mankind is ready to forge a new \npartnership for promoting sustainable development the key concept to \nsafeguarding human civilization. Romania is ready to put its shoulder to the \nwheel with a view to alleviating as soon as possible the actual threats to the \nhealth of our planet and to the wealth of the world community. \nSeeing in this audience representatives of such a great family of \nnations, we realize the immense potential that good will and determination can \noffer to the genuine universality of the world Organization. I am happy to \nwelcome all new States Members of the United Nations and to extend to all of \nthem the best wishes of my Government and the Romanian people. May I address \nour congratulations to the representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of \nMoldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. I am \nconfident that the authoritative voice of the United Nations will be a source \n for action-oriented measures for the sake and well-being of all nations. \nRomania, as a democratic country fully attached to the ideals embodied in \nthe United Nations Charter, in making its own contribution to the achievement \nof mankind's aspirations and to the vital answers we are expected to give to \nthe challenges of the forthcoming century, in which international cooperation \nshould be governed by law. For its cogency with the objectives of the current \nUnited Nations Decade of International Law, I would like to recall the \n \nprophetic words of a great Romanian diplomat, Nicolae Titulescu, who, 55 years \nago, stated: \n\\\"Only when the law shines like the rising Sun in the soul of all men \nas a guiding spirit, an imperative requirement, and a self-imposed \nobligation that is one with organized freedom only then will Mankind \nhave been saved.\\\" \n"

        "file_text": "It is with profound pleasure that my \ndelegation conveys to the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session the \ngreetings and best wishes of the Government and people of Grenada. \nWe wish to extend to you. Sir, warm congratulations on your election to \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at this session. My delegation \ncommends Mr. Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the excellent \nmanner in which he conducted the business of the forty-sixth session of the \nGeneral Assembly. \nWe take this opportunity also to extend congratulations to the new \nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and to commend him for the \nstrong leadership he has brought to the United Nations and for the dedication \nwith which he has carried out his duties since assuming office. \nThe delegation of Grenada is delighted to welcome to the United Nations \nthe 13 new Members: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, \nGeorgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, San Marino, \nSlovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. \nThe current world situation presents a scenario of unmistakable \ncomplexities. The end of the cold war, rapid democratization world wide, the \nemergence of new national sentiments, intolerance towards ethnic, religious \nand cultural differences and the formation of regional economic blocs have \nbrought about a restructuring of programmes and a reordering of agendas \nlocally, regionally and globally. Economic interests now appear to be given \nprecedence in most, if not all, considerations. \nThe proponents of those changes declare their objectives to be the \ncreation of efficient and competitive production systems, free trade and \n \nabsolute freedom from control of market forces. But those objectives, though \nostensibly neutral, are in fact heavily tilted in favour of the \ntechnologically advanced economies and insensitive to the capacities and \npriorities of the developing countries. \nThat there are other equally important, even primary, objectives to be \nachieved by the less developed countries cannot be denied. Indeed, the market \neconomy is being perfected, and the time is right for serious responses aimed \nat eradicating the conditions of poverty and deprivation that are so \nwidespread in the modern world. That process must be activated with the \nurgent aim of ensuring that economic progress is buttressed by social equity, \nfreedom from want, good health and education and the enjoyment of basic human \nrights. Those concerns will no doubt be addressed at the proposed World \nSummit for Social Development, which my Government is pleased to support. If \nwe fail to develop strategies and programmes to address those problems, then \nthe impending conditions of increased hunger, poverty and social deprivation \ncan culminate in very serious global unrest and instability. \nGrenada is dealing with this new cold economic world at both the domestic \nand regional levels. I wish to make it clear that the Government and people \nof Grenada recognize and accept that the responsibility for the advancement of \nour country rests, first and foremost, squarely on our shoulders. \nGrenada has taken steps to restructure its economy in the face of severe \nfiscal deficits, which threatened to erode our credit-worthiness, deny us \nspace for growth and development and pauperize our people. Our self-imposed \nstructural adjustment programme has its social, political and other costs. \nHowever, my Government is convinced that with prudent management of our very \nlimited resources, a willingness to sacrifice, firm and cohesive political \n\nleadership and external assistance, we will in due course restore our economic \nwell-being and place our country on a sound growth path. My delegation is \nhappy to report that some improvements have already been realized, and we look \nforward to achieving all the goals of our structural adjustment programme. \nSmall countries, in particular small developing island countries with all \nthe particular difficulties that development presents to them, can hardly \ncompete in the world arena with developed countries. While demonstrating our \ndetermination to help ourselves, we appeal to donor countries to give renewed \nconsideration to the difficulties confronting small developing island \ncountries; and we appeal to the international community in general for the \nconcessions we need to attain our development goals. \nAs we meet at this forty-seventh session of the General Assembly, a \nnumber of small island States in the Caribbean, highly dependent on the banana \nindustry, are faced with an uncaring call by certain countries to have bananas \nplaced within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \n(GATT). My delegation submits that the outcome of such a campaign could wipe \nout the banana industry in our islands. The resulting social hardships and \npolitical instability are costs which will be ruinous to our societies. These \nsituations can be avoided if present conditions continue to prevail. Grenada \nreiterates is appeal for flexibility on the banana issue and calls upon the \npro-tariff lobby to relax its efforts. \nAt this particular time in the history of the Caribbean region, we are \nseized of the urgency to organize our response to the new international \norder. Earlier this year, regional Governments received with pleasure the \nreport of the West Indian Commission, which was mandated to examine the \nconditions of Caribbean societies and to make recommendations for preparing \nthe region for the economic, political and social challenges of the \ntwenty-first century. The report of the Commission was very inspiring. It \npoints the region along certain beneficial paths, and Grenada looks forward to \nthe full consideration of the Commission's recommendations by Caribbean heads \nof Government in the near future. \n\nThe recently concluded United Nations Conference on Environment and \nDevelopment (UNCED) heralded a new beginning and was undoubtedly one of the \nmost significant undertakings of the United Nations. My Government wishes to \napplaud Mr. Maurice Strong and the entire UNCED secretariat for the successful \nconclusion of that summit and to extend our congratulations to the Government \nof Brazil for successfully hosting the Conference. Its real achievements \nshould become manifest over time through the implementation of the work plan \non sustainable development. Agenda 21, which comprehensively addressed the \ncritical indivisibility of development and concern for the environment. My \nGovernment is also pleased with the conventions on climate change and \nbiological diversity which were opened for signature at the Rio summit. We \nlook forward to an early implementation of both conventions. The Government \nof Grenada urges conscientious efforts to establish the mechanisms, strategies \nand the resource commitments agreed to. From the perspective of small island \nStates in particular, this is an absolute necessity. \nOur overriding concern for the welfare of our people and the \nwholesomeness of our environment, in particular the fragile marine environment \nupon which we are heavily dependent, compels us to register a most vigorous \nprotest against the planned shipment of tons of radioactive material through \nthe Caribbean Sea later this month. \nThe problems of illicit drug trafficking and money-laundering have now \nreached levels that no country is able to combat single-handedly. Indeed, the \nsecurity and sovereign integrity of our State, the rule of law and the \nwell-being of our economic and financial institutions demand that we persevere \nin this fight. My Government wishes to take advantage of this occasion to \nexpress its appreciation for the efforts undertaken by a number of developed \n\ncountries to assist developing nations in the campaign against the drug \ntrade. We appeal for increased multilateral support to institute \ncomprehensive measures aimed at the reduction of demand, interdiction, the \nrehabilitation of victims, and appropriate punishment for the couriers of this \nparticular form of death and destruction. \nIt is distressing to note that, while progress has been made in the \npolitical sphere in terms of the peaceful resolution of certain conflicts and \nthe abatement of ideological tensions, the nerves of the international \ncommunity are being shaken by the situation in the Balkans, most specifically, \nby the evidence of what is being described as \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\". Recognizing \nthat peace and stability are essential to the promotion of social progress, \nthe Government of Grenada wishes to reaffirm its support for United Nations \nattempts to halt the fighting in Yugoslavia, and we call upon the \ninternational community to act in a concerted manner to put a stop to what \ncould escalate into a larger and more intractable conflict. \nMy Government continues to be keenly interested in the situation in South \nAfrica. The persistent violence clearly threatens the negotiating process and \ndelays the transition to a democratic South Africa. We are concerned that \nwhile strides have been made to dismantle the pillars of apartheid, greater \nefforts must be made to accelerate the pace of reforms, so as to enhance the \nclimate for free political activity and genuine democracy. The Government of \nGrenada therefore welcomes recent positive signals pointing to the resumption \nof dialogue between the African National Congress and the Government of South \nAfrica. \nMy Government also welcomes the peace talks currently taking place among \nthe key parties to the Middle East conflict and wishes to counsel continued \n\ndialogue and flexibility in order to bring lasting solutions to that region's \nproblems. \nOver the last year, numerous initiatives to reinstate ousted Haitian \nPresident Jean Bertrand Aristide have been frustrated. Sanctions announced by \nthe Organization of American States have not produced the anticipated results \nbecause of the evident unwillingness of some countries to enforce the \nmeasures. My Government wishes to reiterate its support for the return to \npower of the constitutionally elected Government of Haiti and calls upon the \ninternational community to continue to support the restoration of Haiti's \ndemocracy. \nThe international community is now reasonably expecting greater United \nNations involvement in the maintenance of global peace and security. At the \nsame time, more attention and resources are expected to be focused on the \neconomic, social, cultural and humanitarian needs of the developing \ncountries. My delegation wishes to encourage greater efforts to realize the \nbenefits of peace dividends and to channel them towards those needs. \nThe Government of Grenada is cognizant of the challenging efforts at \nrevitalization being undertaken throughout the United Nations system so as to \nincrease efficiency and cost-effectiveness. We anticipate that this \nrevitalization will emphasize the priorities of the countries most in need \nthe developing countries. We are convinced that the regional economic \ncommissions are in a good position to deal with a wide range of development \nissues and should thus be given greater autonomy in the implementation of \nregional programmes. \n\nThe financial difficulties confronting the United Nations are of deep \nconcern to Grenada, as I am sure they are to many Member States. We recognize \nthe importance of a financially strong United Nations with the capacity to \ndeal effectively with problems of an economic, social, cultural or \nhumanitarian character, to promote peace, security, respect for human rights \nand fundamental freedoms. At the same time, it is true that many Governments \nare experiencing severe difficulties in meeting their primary financial \nobligations. It is hardly the time for additional commitments due to reckless \ncauses and senseless conflicts. \nAs we approach the end of the International Decade of Disabled Persons, \nwe must acknowledge that too little has been done to enable disabled persons \nto see themselves as equal citizens. In this regard my Government takes this \nopportunity to encourage measures aimed at enhancing the fuller participation \nand welfare of disabled persons in their respective societies. \nDespite the tremendous amount of work to be done in order to build and \nconsolidate democracy and improve the standard of living for peoples \neverywhere, Grenada believe that, with the collective efforts of all States \nand the purposeful involvement of the United Nations, our aspirations will be \nachieved. \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Malawi delegation, I wish to \ncongratulate Mr. Ganev on his election as President of the General Assembly at \nits forty-seventh session. We have no doubt that under his leadership and \nguidance, the session will be a success. We also congratulate his \npredecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi, for a job well done. Mr. Shihabi presided \nover the forty-sixth session of the Assembly effectively, and we wish him well \nin the future. \nOn behalf of the Malawi delegation, let me also take this opportunity to \napplaud our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his steady \nstewardship of the Organization as it continues its work of maintaining \ninternational peace and security, as well as the promotion of social and \neconomic development around the world. Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has been in \noffice for less than a year. Yet his laudable achievements in charting the \nOrganization towards the United Nations perceived by its founders, a United \nNations that plays a leading role in the maintenance of international peace \nand security, particularly in preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and \npeace-keeping, are very clear to us all. \n\nHis determined efforts in focusing attention on poverty reduction and \neconomic development in the third world have also been notable. We assure him \nof Malawi's complete support and wish him success. We also pay a tribute to \nall his staff for their dedication to duty, at times in circumstances of \nextreme personal danger. \n\nIt is with great pleasure that we join all those who have spoken before \nus in welcoming to the United Nations the 13 new Members. We wish them well. \nThe near universality that this new membership has brought us will definitely \ncontribute to making the United Nations stronger. \nMy delegation is pleased to note from the Secretary-General's report to \nthe Assembly that the past 12 months have been characterized by general \ninternational peace and security. Certain areas and regions, however, remain \nzones of strife and conflict, posing a grave danger to the efforts of the \nUnited Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security and the \npromotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. \nIn this regard, my delegation is equally concerned at what is happening \nin the Balkans, in particular the suffering and death of innocent civilians, \nespecially young children, women and old people. The fighting and shedding of \ninnocent blood must stop. Malawi supports the efforts of the United Nations \nand the European Community to provide humanitarian relief supplies to Sarajevo \nand other beleaguered parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We also support the \ndetermined efforts now in progress to establish a cease-fire and to arrive at \na peaceful solution to the problems confronting all the parties to the \nconflict. Dialogue between the various parties is the answer and an essential \ncondition to the achievement of peace and stability in that region. \nRegarding the Middle East, Malawi welcomes the landmark developments on \nthe protracted and problematic issues relating to the Palestinian question. \nMalawi welcomes the United States/Russian-brokered peace initiatives. The \nMalawi delegation joins all those who have spoken before us on this issue in \nwishing the peace process success. \n\nThe situation in Somalia is a source of concern to all peace-loving \ncountries. My delegation is pleased to note, however, that through the \ndetermined efforts of the United Nations and in particular of the \nSecretary-General, the mayhem taking place in Somalia before our very eyes is \nat last being addressed by the international community. The deployment and \nthe increase in the number of United Nations security guards from 500 to 3,500 \nwill help curb the serious security problems and make possible the airlift and \ndistribution of desperately and urgently needed humanitarian supplies such as \nfood, medicine and clothing. My delegation commends the United Nations and \nits lead agencies, the donor community at large and non-governmental \norganizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, Medecins \nSans Frontieres, Oxfam and others for their dedication and for their \ntremendous achievements in very difficult conditions. \nSomalia needs peace and reconciliation. In this respect, Malawi applauds \nand supports the combined efforts of the United Nations, the Organization of \nAfrican Unity (OAU) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference in working \ntirelessly towards the achievement of peace and stability in that country. \nOn behalf of the Malawi delegation, I take this opportunity to welcome \nthe peace accord that was signed in Rome on 4 October 1992 between \nPresident Chissano and Mr. Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of RENAMO. It is \ncommon knowledge that Malawi has a direct interest in the establishment of \npeace and stability in Mozambique. Indeed, over the years Malawi has been \ninvolved in the search for peace in that country. The end of the 16-year \ncivil war means the end of untold suffering for the people of Mozambique and a \nwonderful opportunity to focus their energies and resources on the \nreconstruction and development of their beautiful country. For Malawi, this \n \nalso means that the Nacala and Beira corridors, our most cost-effective routes \nto the sea, will begin to function at full capacity. We therefore have every \nreason to rejoice at this welcome development. \nThe international community is also aware that Malawi has through the \nyears been host to more than 1 million refugees from Mozambique. It is our \nsincere hope and prayer that the cease-fire holds and peaceful conditions are \nestablished that will allow the refugees to return to their homes in honour \nand in dignity. Malawi considers the role of the international donor \ncommunity and the United Nations, especially that of the Office of the United \nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, to be extremely important in \nfacilitating the return and resettlement of the refugees as well as the \ninternally displaced people. Massive assistance will be required to enable \nMozambique to forge ahead in its enormous task of reconstruction and \ndevelopment. \nMy delegation wishes to reiterate the Malawi Government's readiness and \ncommitment to assist, within its means and capabilities, in these arduous \ntasks. \nThe situation in South Africa continues to be a source of concern to my \nGovernment. Malawi holds the view that there is no better alternative to \ndialogue for resolving the political problems in that country. That is why we \nwelcomed the negotiations under the Convention for a Democratic South Africa \n(CODESA) process, and were therefore disappointed by the wanton cycle of \nviolence that led to the suspension of CODESA. \nWe believe that peace must be re-established for negotiations to take \nplace. It is in this context that the Malawi Government welcomed the \nappointment of a Special United Nations Envoy on South Africa and fully \nsupports Security Council resolution 772 (1992), which provides for the \n\nincrease - from 30 to 50 in the number of observers to monitor and help curb \nthe violence taking place in that country. Malawi also welcomes the \ninitiative taken by the OAU, the European Community and the Commonwealth to \ncooperate with the United Nations in contributing additional observers. \nThe Malawi Government has been encouraged to note that the people of \nSouth Africa themselves continue to believe in the effectiveness of \nnegotiation as the path towards peace and security. We therefore welcome the \nagreement reached recently between the President of the African National \nCongress, Mr. Nelson Mandela, and the leader of the South African Government, \nPresident F.W. de Klerk, to resume constitutional negotiations. \nIn welcoming the agreement between Mr. Mandela and President de Klerk, my \nPresident, Ngwazi Mr. H. Kamuzu Banda, expressed his hopes for a future South \nAfrica as follows: \n\\\"I do hope that [Mr. Mandela], together with President De Klerk and \nothers, can bring real peace to the South African townships, and put an \nend to the human suffering there. We look forward to the time when a \nnon-racial democratic South Africa will take its place among the nations \nof our region in particular and the world in general.\\\" \nMalawi joins all those who have spoken on the outcome of the United \nNations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), held in \nRio de Janeiro, Brazil, this past June. By all accounts, the Conference was a \nhistoric milestone. Malawi took part in the Conference and was one of the \nmany countries that signed the Convention on biological diversity and the \nConvention on climate change. Although the two Conventions did not meet all \nthe demands and expectations of the developing countries, it is Malawi's view \nthat they generally present a major framework for progress towards the goal of \nprotecting and preserving the environment. \n \nMalawi, as a developing country, looks forward with hope to the \npost-UNCED period. The implementation of the programmes which make up \nAgenda 21 is the key to the success of UNCED. We therefore welcome the \nimpending establishment, during the course of this session of the General \nAssembly, of the commission on sustainable development to oversee the \nimplementation of Agenda 21. We hope that within the framework of this \ninstitutional machinery, supported by the United Nations system as a whole, \nthe new global partnership between North and South will make possible the \ntransfer of technology and, even more critically, the financing of Agenda 21. \nMalawi appeals to the developed industrialized countries to honour their \ncommitment to meet the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for \nofficial development assistance and to honour their pledges to increase their \nassistance in order to ensure the full implementation of Agenda 21. We also \nwelcome the efforts by the World Bank, the United Nations Environment \nProgramme and the United Nations Development Programme to restructure the \nGlobal Environmental Facility to make it transparent and flexible in order to \nachieve a wider coverage and scope in its operations, especially with regard \nto the financing of Agenda 21 programmes. \nThe Malawi delegation would like to add its voice to the debate on the \nrestructuring and reform of the United Nations system. The aims of the reform \ninclude eliminating the duplication of functions and rationalizing and \nrevitalizing the Organization's operations. Malawi supports the initiatives \nwhich the Secretary-General is taking. Change is an on-going process and is \nnecessary if the United Nations is to be able to respond effectively to the \nnew challenges and opportunities that are so evident in this post-cold-war \n\nHowever, Malawi is of the view that these on-going changes should not \nlead to a deviation from the purposes and principles of the Charter. \nIt is in this vein that the Malawi delegation welcomes the measures taken \nto restructure and revitalize the Economic and Social Council as well as the \nestablishment of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs, which is already \nplaying a major role in dealing with the drought emergency situation in Africa. \nMalawi, like the other countries in southern Africa, is experiencing the \nmost serious drought in living memory. The drought situation has had a major \ndebilitating effect on the country's development efforts. National food \nproduction has been severely affected. The country, which is normally \nself-sufficient in food, is now facing a shortfall in maize, the national \nstaple, of more than 690,000 tonnes. There are also shortfalls in pulses, \nedible oils and salt. This serious situation has been compounded by the \ncross-border movements of persons looking for food or running away from civil \nstrife. Even cash crops, which earn Malawi scarce foreign exchange and afford \nthe local Malawians a source of income to live decently, have also been \nadversely affected by this drought. Disease and malnutrition are on the \nincrease. All this is having severe adverse effects on the socio-economic \ndevelopment of our country. \nWe have been encouraged by the many nations and international \norganizations that have come forward to assist Malawi, as they have done in \nrespect of the other countries in our region. However, in spite of this \ngenerosity, the situation in Malawi remains critical. Major shortfalls in \nfood, medicines and water supplies still exist. For example, over 50 per cent \nof our food aid needs have not yet been met. We are also experiencing serious \nproblems in meeting costs for internal transportation, storage, fumigation. \n\nwater supply, health and nutrition. We therefore renew our appeal for more \nurgent assistance to avert any further worsening of the situation. \nIn recent months serious guestions have been raised about Malawi's human \nrights record. As a result, a number of our partners in development have \nwithheld or reduced support for the country's development programmes. In its \nindependence Constitution of 1964 Malawi recognized the sanctity of the \npersonal liberties enshrined in the United Nations Declaration of Human \nRights. Malawi continues to respect these personal liberties. \nMalawi has gone even further. It is party to a number of human-rights \ninstruments, including the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and \nthe United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \nDiscrimination Against Women. Malawi became a party to these important \ninstruments aware of its commitments as a member of the community of nations. \nIn a key address to the nation on the eve of the celebration of Malawi's \n28 years of independence on 5 July 1992, our Life President, \nNgwazi Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda, reaffirmed the emphasis placed by the donor \ncommunity on human rights and good governance for development assistance. In \nkeeping with this commitment, Malawi has recently embarked on a vigorous \nprogramme of action aimed at a transparent demonstration of its continued \nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, at the policy level and in \npractice. \nIt is not possible, in the time available to me, to give a comprehensive \nreview of the Malawi Government's programme of action. I can only give a few \nexamples of the developments that have taken place so far. \nAs I speak, all political detainees in Malawi have been unconditionally \nreleased. In addition, the Government of the Republic of Malawi has amended \n\nthe Preservation of Public Security Act with a view to giving all those \ndetained under the Act the opportunity to have recourse to the legal process \nthrough an open court or a tribunal. \nSecondly, the Malawi Government has invited the International Committee \nof the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit prisons and places of detention and to \ninterview inmates about their conditions and treatment. The Government of the \nRepublic of Malawi has agreed that it will be happy to work with the ICRC on \nits recommendations. In a separate but related exercise, the Government of \nMalawi has set aside funds to improve prisons as well as to speed up the \nhandling of any backlog of untried cases. To improve prison conditions \nfurther, the Government is putting together a project proposal. We hope that \nthis project will receive donor support. \nThe Malawi Government has also recently amended the Forfeiture Act, which \nwas enacted to curb the plunder of the economy by unscrupulous businessmen. \nHowever, in order to ensure that the practical application of the law is \nconsistent with the spirit in which it was enacted. Parliament has recently \npassed an amendment with a view to allowing persons to be heard in their own \ndefence in the High Court before they are declared to be subject to forfeiture. \nThe Government of the Republic of Malawi has also initiated a dialogue \nwith the press to promote the exercise of freedom of expression and freedom of \nthe press. To improve the atmosphere further, last week our President \nappealed to all Malawians to engage in constructive discussion amongst \nthemselves on issues of national importance. \nMy delegation wishes to reaffirm Malawi's continuing commitment to the \npromotion of human rights and individual liberties and to assure our partners \n\nin development and all others that the Malawi Government remains ready to \nmaintain a constructive dialogue with them on these questions. \nFinally, I should like to thank the United Nations system and all the \nfriendly Governments and non-governmental organizations for assisting Malawi \nin all its endeavours towards raising the standard of living of its people."

        "file_text": "Nigeria and Pakistan \nare mourning today. I should like to extend to the Governments and the \npeoples of these two friendly countries the compassion of the people of Benin \nwho understand their sorrow and share their grief. \nI should like to join those who preceded me at this rostrum in \ncongratulating Mr. Ganev warmly, on behalf of the Republic of Benin, on his \noutstanding election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this \nsession. This is a well-deserved tribute to his country, Bulgaria, and to him \npersonally. \nI should also like to congratulate his predecessor, \nAmbassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, who presided over the forty-sixth \nsession of the General Assembly so ably and efficiently. \nI wish also to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General of \nthe United Nations for his courage, his dedication and his readiness in the \nservice of the ideals of the Organization. Less than a year after his \nelection, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has already demonstrated his effectiveness \nand his diplomatic experience, to the admiration of the international \ncommunity as a whole. His tireless efforts to restore peace to the various \nhotbeds of tension throughout the world deserve the active support of all the \nMembers of the United Nations. His recent detailed and well-written report to \nthe membership is eloquent testimony of his endeavours. \nMy delegation would like once again to pay a tribute to his predecessor, \nMr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his invaluable work at the service of our \nuniversal Organization, whose membership has continued to expand over the \nyears. \nBenin welcomes the new Members of the United Nations: Armenia, \nAzerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, \nthe Republic of Moldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and \nUzbekistan. \nAt the last session of the General Assembly, we unanimously welcomed the \nend of an era of confrontation and the advent of an era of international \ncooperation based on a spirit of solidarity and fraternity among the nations \nof the world. \nIn that context, Benin also welcomed the advent and the admission to \nmembership in the United Nations of the independent States that emerged from \nthe former Soviet Union following the signing of the Minsk Agreements. \nThe first ever meeting of the Security Council at the level of Heads of \nState or Government, held on 31 January 1992, marked the end of the cold war; \nat that meeting, they urged the advent of a new, more stable and more \nprosperous world order, for which the United Nations would provide the \nframework. \nUnfortunately, we have to say that this session of the Assembly is \nbeginning at a time when there is an unprecedented reappearance of hotbeds of \ntension throughout the world, resulting in a situation in which peace-keeping \nactivities have become the primary concern of the United Nations over the last \n10 months. These hotbeds of tension demonstrate the fragility of peace and of \ninternational security, at an important turning-point in our history. \nMay I point out here that the Security Council, in its statement of \n31 January 1992, indicated that the development of the democratic movement and \nthe promotion of respect for human rights would help make the world more \nstable and more prosperous. \nMy delegation would like to reaffirm that the international community, \nwhile welcoming the emergence of new nations as a result of the affirmation of \nthe unbreakable will of peoples to regain freedom, dignity and justice through \nrespect for their own cultural and political values, must promote the search \nfor consensus and the spirit of tolerance and dialogue which can still today \nprovide the basis for a peaceful transition. \nNegotiation prevailing over the use of force, trade over exploitation, \nfreedom over constraints: those are the approaches that should guide each of \nour countries so that the capacity of the Organization in the areas of \npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping can be enhanced. \nWe often say that our planet is sick. It is sick because of delayed \ndevelopment resulting from financial, technological, scientific and ecological \nimbalances between the northern and southern hemispheres. It is sick because \nof social injustice and because of extreme poverty that dehumanize so many \npeoples that are referred to as \\\"developing peoples\\\". \nTo all these ills, aggravated today by the resurgence of nationalism, we \nmust add new kinds of illnesses that are decimating our peoples throughout the \nworld. It is therefore essential that States regain control and contribute \nindividually and collectively to the strengthening of international peace and \nsecurity. \nAgainst this backdrop, the Secretary-General's report, \\\"An Agenda for \nPeace\\\", submitted pursuant to the statement agreed by the summit meeting of \nthe Security Council on 31 January 1992, offers us food for thought serious \nthought and it opens up new prospects. We must all contribute to fleshing \nout that report so that our dream of a better world can become a reality in \nthe years ahead. \nAs for Africa, our continent has suffered too much for us not to try \ntoday, together, hand in hand, to join forces and use all that we have in the \nway of intelligence, courage, strength and resources, to lessen suffering, \nalleviate poverty and establish a coherent strategy for sustainable \ndevelopment. \nIt is Benin's hope that all of Africa will be free of fratricidal and \ninternal wars and all other conflicts that hinder our development. It is \nenough to look around us to see the tragedy of our brothers in Liberia, \nSomalia and Sudan, just to mention a few. \nFrom now on Africa can prove, if need be, that it can resolve its own \nconflicts when foreign interference does not complicate matters. To eliminate \ninstability and insecurity in Africa, the international community must offer \nits firm support for the efforts now under way to restore peace to Liberia and \nSomalia. \nMy country, which currently holds the chairmanship of the Economic \nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), has been making intensive efforts \nsince August to bring those involved in the Liberian tragedy to silence their \nweapons so that we can move towards national reconciliation. Benin's only \ninterest in Liberia is peace. President Soglo's efforts deserve the support \nof Africans first and foremost and then of all the major Powers and all other \nMembers of the United Nations. \nBenin hopes that recent appeals from the Conference of Heads of State and \nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), held from 28 June to \n2 July 1992 in Dakar, to those involved in the tragedy in Somalia and Sudan \nwill be heard so that hostilities can cease and negotiations can begin, with a \nview to national reconciliation. That, we believe, is a prerequisite for \npreserving the unity and integrity of those two countries, which are also \nravaged by famine. \nIt is important to emphasize the hope inspired by the humanitarian \nactions of the United Nations to save the people of Somalia from famine. Here \nI should also like to hail the work done by all the countries and humanitarian \norganizations that have taken action in that part of the world, despite the \nthreats they are exposed to in the field by the various parties to the \nconflict. In particular, we hail the efforts of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to \nwhom we are indebted for heightening awareness of that tragedy and its \nhorrors. In addition, his Special Representative, Ambassador Sahnoun of \nAlgeria, deserves our fraternal commendation and admiration. \nJust a few months ago, the international community welcomed the positive \nchanges taking place in the situation in South Africa, changes that were \nexpected to crown with success the tireless struggle of the black people of \nSouth Africa against a system that for more than 50 years had reduced them to \nslavery. Here I should like to reaffirm my country's unequivocal position on \nthe problem of apartheid. That odious and inhuman system must be dismantled, \nin deeds and in law, to allow for the emergence of a democratic and \nmultiracial South Africa, where the principle of one man, one vote, will \nbecome a political reality. \nRecent developments, both political and social in that country, notably \nthe resumption of violence, which has already claimed hundreds of innocent \nvictims, shows, unfortunately, that many difficulties and obstacles still \nhave to be dealt with before apartheid can be totally dismantled. In the \ninterest of international peace and security, we must encourage dialogue among \nthose involved in the political situation in South Africa, who still have to \novercome very deep political differences, while continuing at the same time to \nkeep the pressure on the South African regime so that the reform processes \nthat have been initiated can be continued and speeded up. \nThat is how Benin understands the Security Council's adoption of \nresolution 765 (1992) on the question of South Africa, the appointment by the \nSecretary-General of a Special Representative and the sending of United \nNations observers to that country. \nWe are happy to see that the peace process in Angola, which began with \nthe signing of the cease-fire agreement at Estoril, Portugal, on 31 May 1991, \nis on course. The Members of the United Nations must continue to support that \ncountry, which has been riven by 15 years of fratricidal war, in its efforts \nfor democratization, one important stage of which will be the free elections \nscheduled for 29 and 30 September 1992, that is, tomorrow and the day after. \nThe delegation of Benin welcomes the fact that the peace talks which have \nbegun between the Maputo Government and RENAMO leaders have led to the signing \nat Rome on 7 August 1992 of a peace agreement between the two parties. May \npeace truly and definitively come to Mozambique so that all the sons and \ndaughters of that country can tackle the job of national reconstruction. \nThe Madrid Conference on peace in the Middle East portended a reasonable \narrangement between Arabs and Israelis with a hope for lasting peace. Recent \npolitical changes in Israel may enable the current negotiations to evolve in a \nsatisfactory manner that would be acceptable to all parties to the conflict. \n!t is our duty to encourage that needed dialogue, with a view to achieving a \nlasting peace that would guarantee the existence of the Hebrew State and a \nPalestinian State within secure borders recognized by all. \nThat, of course, would presuppose our listening to both parties. It is \nin that spirit that Benin this year resumed diplomatic relations with the \nState of Israel. We are guided by our firm resolve to use our pivotal \nposition as a traditional friend of the Arab States and a new partner of the \nState of Israel as a point of departure to help bring the two parties together \nas best we can. My country wholeheartedly hopes for success at the peace \nprocess that began in Madrid. \nA solution to the Middle East Problem also involves the consistent and \neffective implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and \n338 (1973), emphasizing the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory \nthrough war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace, enabling each \nState in the region to live in safety within boundaries that are \ninternationally recognized and guaranteed by the international community, \nincluding Palestine and Israel. \nMy country is distressed at the killing and the flagrant violations of \nhuman rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina stemming from the disintegration of the \nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. \nThe continuing tragedy of the peoples of that country threatens \ninternational peace and security and constitutes a new challenge to our \nOrganization. In my Government's opinion, there are three factors that could \nhave a favourable influence on efforts undertaken by the European States and \nthe United Nations to restore peace in the former Yugoslavia. These are an \nimmediate cessation of hostilities; respect for the territorial integrity of \nthe various States that have emerged from the disintegration of the former \nFederation; and the protection of minorities. \nI would add to this our unequivocal condemnation of the intolerable \npractice of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", a practice unworthy of humankind and one of \nwhich each and every human being should be ashamed today. Given the \nuniversality of our Organization, however, my country hopes that the request \nfor admission of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Serbia and Montenegro \nwill encounter no obstacles and that the admission of that country might even \nbe a catalyst for a just and lasting peace in the Balkans. \nThe new spirit of consensus particularly among the permanent members of \nthe Security Council and the end of the cold war have encouraged the present \natmosphere of detente in the international political arena. In that context, \ngeneral and complete disarmament must remain the international community's \nultimate goal at the end of the twentieth century. \nThe Republic of Benin would like to see the enormous resources devoted to \nthe manufacture and purchase of weaponry shifted towards satisfying the more \nurgent need for development of the third world countries. We believe that a \nmajor step in that direction would be the acceptance by the international \ncommunity particularly the arms-producing countries of the \nSecretary-General's proposal on taxing arms sales in order to offset the \nbudgetary deficit of the United Nations and provide it with the resources it \nneeds to carry out the work entrusted to it. My country therefore supports \nthis proposal by Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. Moreover, Benin supports all \nUnited Nations resolutions related to the reduction, limitation, and \nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons. \nIt is often being said that the international community is today at a \nturning-point. The will expressed by Member States to move towards the \nsolution of regional conflicts and the new feeling of urgency in the face of \nglobal threats to the well-being of the planet give us an historic opportunity \nto tackle the real problems we all face. \nOf course, the world economy has developed in a rather remarkable way in \nthe past few years, as demonstrated, inter alia, by the extension of the \nmarket economy and the emergence of major economic groupings in Western Europe \nand North America. However, the international cooperation necessary to the \ncreation of a new world order is not really getting under way. The imbalances \nbetween North and South are being exacerbated. If the current trends persist \nuntil the year 2000, the citizens of the richest nations of the world will \nhave an average annual income of more than $13,600 while those from the least \ndeveloped African countries will have an average per capita income of only \n$217 that is, $12 less than in 1985. This sharp decrease has already been \nseen in many countries. \nWe must therefore acknowledge that the problem of the economic liberation \nof Africa is one that still faces us most acutely. All the efforts made to \nwipe out and reverse this trend towards deterioration in the economies of our \ncountries have been in vain. Africa's economic horizon is darkening daily-\nHere, I should like to broach the question of debt, and more specifically \nin sub-Saharan African. In one report on the debt crisis, the \nSecretary-General stressed that the heavy obligations imposed by debt \nservicing have given rise to serious budgetary problems. Public investment \nand social expenditures have suffered the results of this, and the most \nvulnerable social sectors have therefore been the most seriously affected. \nToday, our continent groans under the crushing burden of debt, which now \namounts to more than $270 billion. In 1990, our States had to pay out \n$23 billion to service this debt. Confronted by these increasingly harsh \nresource problems, most of our States have committed themselves to structural \nadjustment programmes. These programmes do not yet have the resources that \nare truly necessary to the development of our devastated economies. That is \nwhy Benin appeals to the international community to take concrete, urgent \naction to reduce the debt burden of the African countries and increase \nfinancial flows for their development. \nMeasures to ease or cancel debt in some cases debt that our countries \nfind so difficult to bear should be accompanied by detailed and explicit \nprogrammes on the conditions for financing structural adjustment programmes \nand repaying the debt owed by our States. \nOn another level, the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, \nfollowing consideration and final evaluation of the implementation of the \nUnited Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and \nDevelopment 1986-1990 adopted the New Agenda for the Development of Africa in \nthe 1990s. That was an opportunity to refocus the international community's \ninterest in the socio-economic difficulties facing the countries of Africa. \nTo reach the objectives of the New Agenda, it is now time for the \ninternational community to translate into real action the commitments that \nhave been entered into and renewed so many times to support the efforts made \nby the African countries themselves to achieve autonomous growth and \nsocio-economic development. Indeed, the Secretary-General has said that \nAfrica is one of the five United Nations priorities for the 1990s. As to the \nother four priorities the environment, peace-keeping, the fight against drug \nabuse, and humanitarian assistance we have to say that no actual decision \nhas been taken to translate this priority into action. \nMy delegation feels serious concern about the situation that still \nprevails one year after the adoption of resolution 46/151 on the United \nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. First, the \nSecretary-General's programme has not yet really been launched. Secondly, the \nfollow-up mechanisms, for example, the high-level consultative group, the \ninter-agency committee and the steering committee, have not yet been set up. \nThirdly, the study on the need for and the feasibility of establishing a \ndiversification fund for African commodities has not yet been carried out, \neven though it is supposed to be the subject of a report by the \nSecretary-General to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. \nLastly, the setting up of adequate financial resources is still hypothetical. \nI would like to express the ardent hope that no effort will be spared to \nensure that by December 1992, or at the latest by January 1993, the New Agenda \nfor the Development of Africa in the 1990s will emerge from its present \nlethargy and enter a truly active and dynamic phase that will live up to our \nhopes. \nTo a certain extent, the Programme of Action for the Least Developed \nCountries for the 1990s is experiencing the same difficulties as the New \nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. This will hardly help to \nimprove the living and working conditions of the most vulnerable groups in the \nleast developed countries. \nIt is essential to continue and support efforts aimed at ensuring that \nthe number of least developed countries, particularly in Africa, can be cut in \nhalf by the end of the twentieth century. We must thus reverse the tendency \ntowards increasing the number of least developed countries, a trend that has \nbeen noted since the adoption of the Programme of Action in September 1990 and \nthe adoption of the new criteria for classification in 1991. \nMy Government feels that the International Conference on Financing \nDevelopment could provide responses to the difficulties facing the various \nprogrammes and plans of action for the development of the countries of the \nSouth. \nFor that reason, we sincerely hope that the General Assembly will, during \nthis session, adopt a resolution to convene the Conference, which will be \nprepared as part of the process of intergovernmental negotiations with the \nparticipation of all States. The holding of such a Conference will be an \nimportant element in the process of strengthening the role of the United \nNations in promoting international economic cooperation. We welcome the \nJapanese initiative to organize in 1993 an international conference on the \ndevelopment of Africa. The work of that conference should be a good \npreparatory exercise for the Conference on Financing Development. \nBenin believes that economic integration is also a response to the \nmarginalization of Africa. It is essential today for our States that the \nregional economic groupings we have created in order to ensure South-South \ncooperation should be strengthened. \nAfrica, determined to continue with vigour the policy it has been \nfollowing in this sphere for effective regional and subregional economic \ncooperation and integration, is thus particularly committed to the creation of \nthe African Economic Community, whose Constitution was signed by the Heads of \nState and Government on 3 June 1991 at Abuja. \nSuccess for this project presupposes, I believe, a commitment by each of \nour States to promote integration in the various activity sectors of our \neconomies and to ensure the development and maintenance of reliable networks \nof agricultural, road and industrial infrastructures on the continent. \nDespite the economic situation of our countries, many specific actions \nhave been taken to help children as part of the follow-up of the World Summit \nfor Children. \nOn 16 June 1992 Benin celebrated the Day of the African Child, as we had \nin 1991. Although my country had already scored some successes, the \ncelebrations on that day enabled us to place even more emphasis on improving \nthe health of mothers and children through the expanded vaccination programme, \nthe struggle to combat malnutrition and other widespread diseases of children, \nthe provision of drinking water to rural areas, the gradual reduction of \nilliteracy and the securing of access to education for all children. \nAfrica aspires to development of the whole person, and to that end, we \nmust be sure to involve women and children. They are, after all, the majority \nof the people of our countries on the path of progress, which can be achieved \nprimarily through the education and training of young people and adults. \nBenin welcomes the action already taken by the Organization of African \nUnity (OAU), together with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), with a \nview to the holding of the International Conference on Assistance for the \nAfrican Child, to be held at Dakar from 25 to 27 November 1992. \nParallel with its actions in behalf of children, my Government is also \npreparing actively to mark the International Year of the Family in 1994. In \naddition, we stand ready to make a worthwhile contribution to the preparatory \nwork for the World Conference on Women, to be held at Beijing in 1995. \nA few years ago each of our States, particularly the richer ones among \nus, was content to act alone at the national level in order to stop \nenvironmental degradation. \nToday we have to recognize that the major ecological problems we face are \nplanetary in dimension and require an international approach. \nIn that context, Benin welcomes the conclusions of the United Nations \nConference on Environment and Development (UNCED), held from 3 to 14 June 1992 \nat Rio de Janeiro. \nWhile that historic conference, in which my country took an active part, \ndid not fully live up to the hopes placed in it, it did enshrine the concept \nof sustainable development and a recognition of the undeniable link that \nexists between environmental protection and economic development. \nBenin, convinced that dealing with environmental and development problems \nrequires the coordination of activities, initiatives and programmes, welcomes \nthe agreement reached at Rio on institutional mechanisms for following up \nUNCED decisions, particularly the establishment of a high-level commission on \nsustainable development. \nIn our opinion, that commission will play an essential role in the \nimplementation and follow-up of Agenda 21, adopted at Rio by the Conference. \nWith a strong and competent secretariat, which could be headquartered at \nGeneva, the commission on sustainable development should make it possible, we \nbelieve, to coordinate, facilitate and orient intergovernmental action within \nthe United Nations system in the area of environment. \nThe members of the commission, to be elected by the General Assembly, \nshould represent all the regional groups in the United Nations and all types \nof development. \nAs well as supporting the establishment of a high-level commission on \nsustainable development, which will be the subject of a draft resolution at \nthis session, Benin stresses the great importance we attach to following up \nall the decisions and recommendations of the Rio Conference. We welcome in \nadvance the resolutions the Assembly will adopt in this connection, including \nthat by which the Assembly will establish an intergovernmental negotiating \ncommittee to draft by June 1994 an international convention to combat \ndesertification, particularly in Africa. We also look forward to a resolution \non the financing of Agenda 21, whose implementation by developing countries \nwill require new, additional funds. \nThe Rio Declaration on Environment and Development does not reflect all \nthe concerns expressed during the preparatory process for the Conference; the \nGeneral Assembly must therefore adopt a resolution with a view to preparing an \nEarth charter to be adopted during the fiftieth anniversary of the United \nNations in 1995, as proposed by the Secretary-General of the Conference, \nMr. Maurice Strong. \nWhile cruel at times, our age can now be proud of having witnessed the \nemergence of a universal human-rights movement. An awareness of democracy is \nspreading throughout the world, a world where men and women used to be reduced \nto silence and wretchedness. Democracy is slowly becoming a reality that it \nwill be difficult to ignore. \nThe credo of Benin, henceforth to be a State where the rule of law is \nparamount, is respect for, and the promotion and defence of, human rights and \nthe rights of peoples. That is why we support the 1993 convening of a World \nConference on Human Rights and are already participating actively in the \nPreparations for that high-level Conference. \nIt is necessary to promote social development if we are to promote, \nprotect and defend human rights. To the hungry, human rights can mean little \nif nothing is done to improve health care and education, to eliminate hunger \nand wretchedness, and to improve housing and the quality of life in short, \nto achieve greater well-being. That is why my country welcomes the decision \nto convene a world summit for social development in 1995; this will enshrine \nthe human dimension of development. \nI wish on behalf of the Government and the people of Benin to pay tribute \nto all nations, large and small, that have shown unswerving support and \nfriendship for my country, particularly in the past two years, and that have \nsupported and encouraged democratic renewal in Benin: the political, economic \nand moral rebirth of my country. \nI pay a special tribute to friendly agencies, bodies and Governments for \ntheir continued cooperation as we ponder, evaluate, organize and take \ndecisions on all aspects of the lasting economic and social recovery of Benin, \nand for all they did to prepare for, coordinate, organize and hold the \nround-table meeting of partners in the economic and social development of the \nRepublic of Benin, which took place at Geneva on 2 and 3 April 1992. \nIt is my great hope that the forty-seventh session of the General \nAssembly will achieve a consensus acceptable to all in the negotiations on the \nrestructuring of the United Nations system and the strengthening of the \nOrganization's role in promoting international economic cooperation and \nconsolidating our achievements in peace-keeping and international security. I \nalso hope that it will show our peoples that it is still working for \nsolidarity, partnership for development and hope. "

        "file_text": "\nMr. President, the contribution that your country, Bulgaria, is making to the building of a new world order accords with the genius of its people. He are gratified by your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session, and we wish you every success in the discharge of your mandate.\nHe take pleasure in hailing and paying tribute to His Excellency Ambassador Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, who skilfully handled his responsibilities at the forty-sixth session, which was marked by, among other major events, the election of the new Secretary-General of our Organization.\nHe also take pleasure in addressing heartfelt congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros Ghali. The energy and distinction with which he has assumed his new functions reinforce our conviction that he will succeed in lending the necessary impetus to the indispensable transformation that will enable the United Nations system to rise to the growing expectations of a world seeking peace, security and prosperity for all.\nHis Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar of Peru admirably strove towards the same ends during his remarkable term at the helm of our Organization. Cameroon offers him its profound thanks.\nThirteen new States have just been admitted to the United Nations. This is a resounding victory of the inalienable right of peoples to decide for themselves, and we see it as a sign of the times:\tthe beginning of a new page\nin the history of humankind.\nHe therefore take pleasure in welcoming among us the representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and\nUzbekistan.\nThe forty-seventh session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when the international community is still trying to cope with the sweeping changes brought about by the end of the cold war. None the less, there is increasingly gaining ground a convergence of wills in confronting the new kinds of challenges that threaten our collective security, and in meeting old challenges such as poverty and want, whose continued existence in this new day and age seems like a negation of our shared humanity.\nThe historic Security Council summit of 31 January 1992, the very first of its kind, provided a striking illustration of that point, reviving the hope that the collective responsibility of our Organization in the quest for solutions to global challenges will henceforth be based on more effective international solidarity.\nCameroon thus agrees with the rest of the international community as to the need to revitalize the United Nations so as to increase its efficacy, its prestige and its authority to enable it to discharge the responsibilities conferred upon it by the Charter.\nThe shared vision of the Member States as to the central role the Organization must henceforth play in the realm of international peace and security, as also in the equally vital area of development, implies the prerequisite that decisions be taken on the basis of consensus. That being so, the restructuring process now under way must neither tend towards side-lining certain States nor lead to redeployments based on selective priorities.\nIn that context it is appropriate to welcome the pertinent study \\\"Agenda for peace\\\" submitted by the Secretary-General at the request of the Security Council. The bold proposals it embodies will, we are convinced, stimulate joint reflection on all the issues connected with peace, which are priority concerns of the international community. We share in the global vision that emerges from that study. The fact is that the problems of peace cannot be analyzed solely in terms of the prevention and management of conflicts, because peace and security are contingent upon factors that are at once socio-economic, political and military in nature.\nTherefore we welcome the latest spectacular strides taken in the arena of disarmament, as consolidated by the recent conclusion of work on the Convention on Chemical Weapons. But progress remains to be made in checking the risk of the proliferation of nuclear technology and coping with supply and demand in conventional weaponry.\nIn fact, though it is certain that the elimination of weapons of mass destruction does contribute to strengthening international peace and security, the definition of a minimum threshold of weaponry necessary to ensure the security of States reassures the international community as to the desired achievement of general and complete disarmament.\nWe might thus be able to build a lasting peace and release major resources for the building of a new world order that will be more equitable, marked by greater solidarity and oriented towards the advancement and fulfillment of all human beings.\nThat is the rationale that fits the initiative taken by the member States of the Economic Community of Central Africa aimed at the implementation of measures likely 'to build confidence and enhance security and development in our subregion.\nThus, in conformity with General Assembly resolution 46/37 B, adopted by consensus at the forty-sixth session, the Secretary-General has proclaimed the establishment of a standing advisory committee responsible for matters of\nsecurity in Central Africa. Indeed, the 11 States of our subregion, having met at Yaounde from 27 to 31 July 1992 under the auspices of the United Nations, adopted that Committee's action program, which revolves around a set of measures notably involving establishing a center for training peace-keepers; entering into a non-aggression pact; and establishing an international headquarters and staff for crisis management.\nIn this regard I wish on behalf of its promoters to express our appreciation to the Organization for the assistances that has been provided thus far in the implementation of confidence-building measures in Central Africa.\nHe sincerely hope that the United Nations and individual Member States, and governmental and non-governmental organizations alike, will provide assistance to the Committee's action program.\nThe elimination of poverty and underdevelopment must have priority among the present concerns of the international community. To that end, we have decided upon strategies and action programs to be implemented. The same is true of the Declaration that emanated from the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly, on international economic co-operation. The strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade is a part of this trend, as indeed are the conclusions reached at the recent United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development.\nFurthermore, I would observe that our countries have taken a certain number of steps in economic and political terms. Economically, they have undertaken painful reform in the context of structural adjustment, and, politically, they have set in place a process of democratization to ensure their people of advancement and more effective enjoyment of human rights.\nTo meet with success, however, the efforts thus undertaken by developing countries must be accompanied by respect on the part of the developed countries for commitments undertaken so as to seal the new contract of worldwide solidarity in favor of development, a contract that expresses the convergent vision of the international community as to strategies and plans of action to be implemented.\nAgainst that background, the present international economic environment must, especially with regard to raw materials, stop being a jungle in which the ruthless law of speculation holds sway and contempt is shown for the legitimate demands of our countries for more equitable compensation for our commodities.\nBeyond that, it is high time to find a satisfactory solution to the debt problems, the weight of which is paralyzing our economies, in terms of debt-servicing leading to unsustainable investments of net financial flows\ntowards the rich countries and multinational institutions. \nIn this respect/ I should like, in particular, to welcome the Rio resolution with regard to financial resources a resolution that extends the benefit of debt cancellation to medium-income countries. He hope that this major decision will be translated into action.\nIt is hardly necessary to emphasize the extreme seriousness of the situation in Africa, where there is an unprecedented economic crisis, aggravated by natural disasters, civil wars and the social consequences of structural adjustment, which threaten the process of democratization. While this situation devolves, first and foremost, on the African countries themselves, the international community cannot be indifferent to it.\nThe United Nations was therefore fully justified in deciding to give special attention to this situation. All of us have a duty to see to it that the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s does not suffer the same sad fate as the United Nations program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. Thus the plan must be launched urgently and the necessary resources must be provided for the plans of action envisaged by the institutions and bodies concerned with its implementation.\nHe hope that the conference on the development of Africa, to take place in Japan in 1993, will provide an opportunity to mobilize additional resources to relaunch growth and start economic recovery in our continent. The Secretary-General's initiative with regard to the convening of an international conference on finance for development is based on these very concerns and deserves the international community's support.\nThe resources available in the world are commensurate with the great challenges of our time. In fact, the international context has never been so favorable for the beginning of a genuine North-South dialog taking into account the interests of all. In this regard, a global summit on social development would provide an opportunity to embark on an in-depth analysis of human development in all its aspects, in the context of the forthcoming international meetings on human rights, women, and population. Indeed, we must agree to attach to the economic, social and cultural rights of the individual the importance that is now attached unfortunately, too often selectively to civil and political rights. Thus we could conquer poverty and create the conditions for sustainable development, taking into account simultaneously the needs of growth and the imperatives of protection of the environment, in the interest of mankind. The establishment during the present session of a committee for sustainable development would be an important step towards achieving this goal.\nProgress and economic and social development are possible only in a climate of global peace and security. Unfortunately there are still numerous conflicts and hotbeds of tension, which seriously imperil peace. Therefore, we are particularly alarmed at the deplorable violent ethnic conflicts that are tearing apart the peoples in the former Yugoslavia. Cameroon appeals to the sense of reason of the parties to the conflict to halt this war, which is the result of an obsolete and deplorable ideology. He shall continue to support all steps taken by the Security Council, the European Community and other bodies to achieve a satisfactory solution.\nWith regard to the Middle East, the peace process that was launched in Madrid and is still under way must be maintained with a view to keeping alive the possibility of achieving a peace capable of standing the test of time and of men and, once and for all, reconciling the peoples of that region.\nWith respect to South Africa, a harmonious transition to a democratic, non-racial and united country free of violence is in the interests of all.\nThe prospects that emerged from the recent Mandela-de Klerk summit are positive, and we firmly support them.\nWhile welcoming the maintenance of the cease-fire in Cambodia, we call on all the parties involved to cooperate fully with the United Nations Transitional Authority so that it may be enabled to carry out its mission within the framework of the Paris Agreements. Cameroon is proud to have been able to able to contribute to the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) by sending to that friendly country a contingent of civil forces and a group to supervise the cease-fire. We take this opportunity to reiterate our willingness to serve the cause of peace.\nWe also welcome the culmination of the peace process in Angola, where elections have just been held under the aegis of the United Nations. In that fraternal country, there is opening up an opportunity to achieve internal reconciliation and to embark on the work of national reconstruction, which will inject new dynamism into the efforts to attain economic integration in our subregion.\nWe earnestly hope that there will be a similar course of events in Somalia, Liberia, Mozambique, Western Sahara and all other regions of the world that are still torn by conflicts.\nUnfortunately, international peace and security, the environment and development are not the only major challenges of the day. The acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic, drugs, terrorism and other scourges call for ever greater mobilization, and we shall continue to support measures decreed by the international community to counteract them. Action taken in this area must be pursued and strengthened. That is why we repeat our support for initiatives to convene a global summit on social development# the world conference on women# the conference on African children# the conference on population and development# and the conference on human rights.\nFinally# with regard to natural disasters and man-made emergencies# we approve the steps the Organization has taken towards restructuring# rationalization and coordination steps that have led to the establishment of the Office of the United Nations Coordinator for Disaster Relief.\nAs was emphasized last year# Cameroon has opted for democracy and has resolutely begun profound changes designed to establish a more democratic society with ever greater respect for the fundamental human rights and freedoms of its citizens. Following legislative elections# in which transparency and proper conduct were noted by numerous independent observers of various nationalities# Cameroon acquired a multi-party Parliament# in which democracy is given free expression.\nThe pluralist# democratic and adversarial nature of the new society in Cameroon has led to the establishment of a coalition Government responsible to Parliament. In a few days' time on 11 October this process will culminate in the holding of presidential elections involving at least eight candidates. We owe all this progress to President Paul Biya a man of renewal whose attachment to openness and whose commitment to democracy in Cameroon have never been denied.\nCameroon wants to play its part in meeting the needs inherent in the\nembryonic new world order. Clearly this is a long-term objective, which must be pursued at a pace appropriate to our society and which, if it is to be successful, requires the assistance and cooperation of all people of good will. I know that we can count on that.\u2003\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "We ask the President to accept our hearty \ncongratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at its \nforty-seventh session. We pledge to him the fullest support and cooperation \nof the Liberian delegation as he puts forth his best efforts in guiding the \ndeliberations of the Assembly. \nWe offer his illustrious predecessor. Ambassador Samir S. Shihabi of \nSaudi Arabia, our deepest appreciation for the able manner in which he \nconducted the affairs of the forty-sixth session, and we wish him well in his \nfuture endeavours. \n\nWe welcome the advent of Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, a distinguished \nAfrican scholar and diplomat, to the position of Secretary-General of the \nUnited Nations. His stewardship of the Organization since the beginning of \nthis year has witnessed the utilization of the finest diplomatic skills, \nundiminished resolve, and broad vision to address the many challenging \nproblems which now confront the international community. This singular \ncommitment on his part to the cause of global peace and security, social \njustice and economic prosperity has inspired tremendous confidence that the \nUnited Nations will continue to be the appropriate forum for harnessing \nvarious ideas which can promote the betterment of mankind. \nWe also welcome and extend a hand of friendship to the newly admitted \nMembers of the United Nations. We entertain the fervent hope that their \nparticipation will contribute to the achievement of its lofty ideals and \nobjectives. \nThe cessation of the ideological antagonism which characterized the \ncold-war era aroused great expectations that our global village would be \nvisited by a climate of international peace, tolerance and goodwill whereby \nour energies could be devoted to grappling with the myriad problems of \nunderdevelopment. Unfortunately, with apocalyptic premonition, there are wars \nand rumours of war casting grim shadows throughout our one world. In Somalia, \nBosnia and Herzegovina, in some of the nations emerging from the former Soviet \nUnion, and even in my own country, Liberia, wars are raging, brought about by \neither nationalistic yearnings, ethnic and religious rivalries, or by sheer \ngreed for wealth and power. \n\nAlthough the United Nations does respond, sometimes much too belatedly, \nto such crises, there is an urgent need for the Organization to employ its \nmoral authority in a more effective and non-selective way at the early stages \nof conflicts to prevent the human tragedies which so frequently revisit \nmankind. \n\nIn this connection the Liberian delegation notes with appreciation the \ncomprehensive and insightful report of the Secretary-General entitled \\\"An \nAgenda for Peace\\\", in which he outlines specific measures and proposals to \nenhance, in a more vigorous and non-selective way, greater United Nations \ninvolvement in preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and peace \nenforcement. \nWithin this context Member States that are better endowed must exercise \nleadership to ensure that the United Nations becomes ready, willing and able \nto engage constructively in humanitarian intervention in internal conflicts, \nconsistent with the guiding principles annexed to General Assembly \nresolution 46/182 of 19 December 1991 and Article 2, paragraph 7, of the \nUnited Nations Charter. \nAt this juncture we would wish to apprise delegations of developments in \nLiberia and of Liberia's continuing quest for peace. \nSince 24 December 1989, when rebel forces effected an incursion into \nLiberia from a neighbouring country, Africa's oldest republic has been \nembroiled in a tragic civil strife replete with atrocious mayhem, murder and \nmadness. In a three-way armed struggle for power in which the \\\"enemy\\\" was \ndefined with scarce exactitude, each faction preyed on the civilian \npopulation, whose cries for help were heard by a largely indifferent world. \nLiberia, a beacon of hope in Africa as a sovereign expression since 1847, \na country which welcomed and assimilated into its society thousands of other \nAfricans from neighbouring countries and elsewhere, was rapidly reduced to a \nland of grief and desolation. This fratricide impelled about 800,000 of our \ncitizens to seek sanctuary in neighbouring countries. \nAfter the disintegration of the Government and the attendant breakdown of \ncivil authority, and in order to avert further bloodshed, the Economic \n\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) undertook a mediatory initiative by \nadvancing a plan that secured the concurrence of all the interested parties. \nThe ECOWAS peace plan required, inter alia, the deployment of a peace-keeping \nforce, the ECOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), as well as the \nformation of an interim Government of National Unity to include the warring \nfactions, the political parties and the interest groups of the country. \nIn August 1990 ECOWAS facilitated the convening of a national conference \nso that Liberians could deliberate on the future of their country, form an \ninterim government and undertake the initial plans for free and fair elections \nto be conducted under international supervision and monitoring. The National \nPatriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), the main rebel faction, led by \nMr. Charles Taylor, failed to attend, apparently opting for a military \nsolution that was still vainly expected to arise from what was already a war \nof attrition. \nAt the Conference, the delegates worked within the scope of the peace \nplan that had been accepted by the warring factions as the basis for \nmediation. It required that none of the leaders of the armed groups would \nserve as interim President and that the interim President would be a caretaker \nand not participate in the elections. Accordingly, the Conference reserved \nfor the NPFL leader the position of Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, the \nhighest position in the interim government, from which he could still seek the \npresidency of the country in a free and fair election. The NPFL was also \nawarded a majority seating in the interim Legislative Assembly. However, this \noverture failed to induce the NPFL and its leader to find some common ground \nwith other Liberians. \nThe Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS, meeting at an extraordinary \nsummit at Bamako in November 1990. negotiated a cease-fire declaration and \n\nurged Liberians to continue the search for peace by holding another national \nconference at which the NPFL could be present. \nECOWAS convened a second national conference at Monrovia in March 1991, \nat which an NPFL delegation participated in the negotiation of an arrangement \nfor the governance of the country along the lines of a framework it advanced. \nThe euphoria that attended chose preliminary results were short-lived, as the \nconclusions reached were summarily rejected by the NPFL leader. \nA few months thereafter the NPFL alerted some of the leaders of ECOWAS \nthat it was not prepared to participate in an interim government that would, \nalternatively, be disposed to negotiating, under the auspices of ECOWAS, \nanother proposal of its own. The NPFL proposed a snap election, to be held \nwithin six months, to be preceded by the encampment and disarmament of all \narmed combatants. \nECOWAS established the Committee of Five, headed by His Excellency \nPresident Felix Houphouet-Boigny of Cote d'lvoire, to work with Liberians and \nhelp us reach an understanding. The negotiations took place in four different \nmeetings, producing an agreement which, because of the venue, has become known \nas the Yamoussoukro Accord. This Accord has aroused declarations of support \nfrom the Organization of African Unity, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries \nand the United Nations Security Council. \nBut how has the NPFL reacted to the commitments it undertook? At the \nfifteenth session of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS, \nheld at Dakar in July 1992, the 16 West African leaders reached a clear \nconsensus and observed: \n\n\\\"The Authority determined that the uncooperative conduct by the \nNPFL, especially with regard to the encampment and disarmament of the \ncombatants and the insertion of a buffer zone along the Liberia-Sierra \nLeone border, continued to pose a serious threat to the peace, stability \nand security of the West African region.\\\" \n\nThe Authority therefore mandated the Field Commander of ECOMOG to \ncomplete the implementation of the programme contained in the Yamoussoukro \nAccord not later than 30 days from the conclusion of the summit meeting. \nFurthermore, the West African leaders decided: \n\\\"That unless Charles Taylor and the NPFL comply with the implementation \nof the said programme, the Authority shall impose comprehensive sanctions \nagainst Charles Taylor and the NPFL-controlled areas of Liberia and any \nother party that fails to comply with the implementation of the \nprogramme; that all the Member States of ECOWAS shall take all necessary \nmeasures to give full effect to this decision; that the Committee of \nFive, in consultation with the Standing Mediation Committee, shall seek \nthe assistance of the Security Council of the United Nations to make \nwhatever sanctions are imposed effective and binding on all members of \nthe international community in accordance with the provisions of the \nUnited Nations Charter.\\\" \nIn support of the decision taken by the ECOWAS Heads of State, the Tenth \nConference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, meeting \nin Jakarta in September 1992, said, inter alia, in its Final Documents: \n\\\"if ... there are parties still frustrating the efforts to create the \nrequired climate for the holding of free and fair elections in Liberia, \nstringent economic sanctions as proposed by the ECOWAS Summit ... [shall) \nbe imposed on such parties and the areas they control.\\\" \nIt also \\\"appealed to the international community to support said sanctions, if \nand when invoked, as well as provide necessary assistance to Liberia and the \nEconomic Community of West African States Ceasefire Monitoring Observer Group \n\n(ECOMOG).\\\" We expect that the Security Council of the United Nations will be \nequally supportive. \nConsistent with the spirit of its responsibilities, the Interim \nGovernment of National Unity has taken several measures aimed at enhancing the \nNPFL's capacity to cooperate in the implementation of the undertakings into \nwhich it willingly entered. \nWe have successfully contributed to sensitizing those countries that can \nprove helpful in assisting with funding for demobilizing and rehabilitating \ncombatants. An amnesty has been offered to enhance the prospects for \nreconciliation. We have secured food for the NPFL to help alleviate the \nstrains incidental to the encampment of its troops, which, to use its leader's \nwords, are currently \\\"living off the land\\\". To give confidence to the NPFL \nwith respect to the pending elections, we offered it the position of Chairman \nof, as well as majority seating on, the Elections Commission. This we did \neven though the political party that it is now forming is only one grouping to \nenter an election with at least six other parties. \nIt should be recalled that Dr. Amos Sawyer, President of the Interim \nGovernment of National Unity, will not be a candidate in these elections and \nthat therefore the advantages of incumbency are not a factor here. Moreover, \nDr. Sawyer has announced that, in order to ensure a unified country, if \nMr. Taylor would concede his forces' being encamped and disarmed, and if he \nwould renounce his claims to a bogus presidency in the area he controls. \nDr. Sawyer would resign in favour of another Liberian acceptable to both \nsides, who would hold the country together through the remaining months \nleading to elections. \nWe, the people of Liberia, know what we want. We want an end to the \nwar. we want a unified country. We want free and fair elections. While we \n\nconcede the existence of some deep-seated problems clouded by suspicion and \ndemanding circumspection, our difficulties are being compounded by the \ninfluence that external factors and forces wield over the NPFL. This is not \nto suggest that Liberians are not ultimately responsible for the havoc we have \nwrought on our country, but it is important for the international community to \nunderstand and appreciate the variables which tend to make peace elusive in \nLiberia. \nThe Liberian crisis was planned abroad. Many of the insurgents were \ntrained outside the country. Those who initially provided the training, arms, \nand finances have tried to explain to us their motives, couched in spurious \narguments of revolutionary duty to their oppressed African brothers. We must \nremember, too, that the insurgents crossed an internationally recognized \nboundary and appear still to be receiving the cooperation and support of some \nof our would-be brotherly peoples. We remain aware that as the NPFL advanced \nthere was a systematic plundering of the country, with the extraction from \nLiberia of movable capital assets, from earth-moving equipment to power \nplants, from computers to automobiles, primarily by the route by which the \ninsurgents came. \nWe are also cognizant of the fact that a few multinational corporations, \nsome with investments in the country, provided material and financial \nassistance to the NPFL, with the intention of hastening its advance. There \nare others which, acting on the presumption of an imminent NPFL victory, \nprovided similar assistance to secure concessions in natural rubber, iron ore \nand timber resources. We are aware that some of these foreign corporations \nbelieve they have become too involved to disengage now, and they have sought \nthe support or acquiescence of their countries in what is transpiring in \nLiberia. \n \nWe Liberians are concerned about the causes underpinning our present \ndilemma. We do not wish to see our country go the way many small countries \nhave gone by being embroiled in a protracted civil conflict over the spoils of \nwar. Liberia need not be destroyed in a quest for economic advantages. There \nis no reason for the pitting of Liberians against each other in a zero-sum \ngame and the transformation of the country into a mass grave. \n \nWe recognize that we live in an interdependent world and accept the fact \nthat economic ends or objectives will be pursued in our country. However, we \nare dismayed by the senselessness of the manner and the means. Results which \ncan be achieved in an organized, civilized and equitable way need not be \npursued in a manner replete with disorder, carnage and confusion. \nAs we Liberians want to reconstruct our lives the future being all we \nhave left we affirm here and now that all the signs of good neighbourliness \nwe are already demonstrating are sincere and genuine and that they will \ncontinue to be a sustained national policy. In the same vein, corporate \nentities that were lured into errors of judgement will be expected to \nparticipate in time in open-minded discussions with the intent that they \nshould become actual partners in progress with the people of Liberia. \nThe intransigence and negative attitude of the NPFL has led to the \nemergence on the scene of a fourth force, the United Liberation Movement for \nDemocracy in Liberia (ULIMO), which has declared itself to be a group of \nLiberian refugees trying to find their way home. They also claim that their \nprimary objective is to compel the NPFL to adhere to the Yamoussoukro accord. \nThe ULIMO has engaged NPFL forces and recently, in a rapid advance, captured \nseveral areas that had been under NPFL control. \nWe, the Interim Government, will continue our efforts to have a \ncease-fire arranged between these contending forces. There is an urgent need \nto avoid escalation through the likely involvement of the other forces, which \nhave been encamped for more than a year, awaiting the encampment of the NPFL \nfor the commencement of general disarmament. \nUnder cover of the security blanket provided by ECOMOG, the Interim \nGovernment of National Unity has succeeded in re-establishing an acceptable \n \nlevel of civil administration. We are pleased to note that since last year \nschools have been open, with banking, mercantile and other commercial \nactivities resumed. Residents are being provided with basic social services \nwithin the limits of our resources. We wish to observe that, despite the \nemergency situation, we have been able to operate under the rule of law with a \nconstitutional Government which respects human rights. We take pride in the \nfact that the people of Liberia have demonstrated both a spirit of cooperation \nand the tenacity and the will to reorder their lives, in spite of tremendous \nhardship. \nMonrovia, which had a pre-war population of less than 500,000, has grown \nto about 1.2 million as hundreds of thousands of our citizens continue to seek \nrefuge in the relative safety and normalcy of the capital. This mass \nmigration is placing a serious strain on the Government's meagre resources, \ntaking into account that the principal sources of revenue are under NPFL \ncontrol. As such, there is still a need for continued humanitarian assistance \nto the country. \nConcurrent with the effort to bring peace to Liberia and secure \nappropriate conditions for holding free and fair elections, Liberia and the \nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have invited the United \nNations to assist with the electoral process. The Secretary-General has \nalready sent consultants to Liberia to evaluate the availability of population \ndata and the situation of constituency maps, and to provide support to the \nElections Commission. \nWe wish to register our appreciation to the States Members of the United \nNations for the several resolutions adopted by the General Assembly in \nresponse to the critical humanitarian and other needs of Liberia since the \n \ncivil strife began. We wish to thank all the countries, especially the United \nStates, Japan, the European Community, the Nordic countries and others, which \nhave made significant contributions in response to the appeals of the \nSecretary-General both for the United Nations emergency programme in Liberia \nand for assistance to the neighbouring countries which host Liberian refugees. \nWe also express our gratitude to the United Nations system, and to all \nthe non-governmental and private volunteer organizations which have continued \nto provide assistance to our people. We trust we can rely on the \ninternational community for its continued empathy and support as Liberia goes \nthrough the most difficult period of its history. \nThe timely initiative of the Economic Community of West African States to \nmediate in the Liberian conflict was a laudable response by a subregion to a \nsubregional problem, consistent with Chapter VIII of the United Nations \nCharter. This initiative is most deserving of the encouragement and support \nof the international community. We therefore call on the United Nations to \nplay an active role in mobilizing financial and other support for ECOWAS as it \nresponds to the Liberian crisis, which continues to pose a threat to regional \npeace and security. \nOn behalf of the Government and the people of Liberia, we wish once again \nto extend our heartfelt appreciation to all the member States of ECOWAS, \nparticularly the Governments and peoples of Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, Guinea, \nSierra Leone, the Gambia and Mali, which are participating in ECOMOG. We \nthank all of them for the many sacrifices they are making to restore peace to \nLiberia. \n\nWhile we are preoccupied with domestic considerations, we have firm views \nwhich we would like to advance with respect to some of the issues on the \ninternational agenda. \nThe painful and tragic situation in Somalia is a grim reminder to the \npeople of Liberia of the ethnic strife, the wanton destruction of life and \nproperty, the grave refugee problem and the disintegration of the country that \nwe ourselves experienced. The appalling human condition of the Somali people \nmakes them deserving of treatment equal to, if not greater than, that given \nany other country experiencing a civil conflict. That is why we are most \npleased with the recent initiative taken by the Secretary-General in arousing \nthe conscience of the international community to the plight of Somalia. We \nalso applaud the active role he is playing to resolve the conflict. \n\nWith respect to developments in South Africa, the Government of Liberia \nviews with serious concern the gruesome sectarian violence in that country. \nIn view of the positive steps that the South African Government, yielding to \ninternational pressure, was taking to end apartheid, it is most distressing to \nreceive indications of that Government's apparent collusion with the appointed \nleaders of homelands to unleash unprovoked violence and death on defenceless \ncivilians engaged in a legitimate exercise of protest. Such action can only \nput at risk the gains that have been made by all South Africans. \nWe therefore urge the South African authorities to take speedy action to \narrest black township violence and exclude from the security apparatus those \nresponsible for the recent atrocities. My delegation is encouraged by the \nreports that the leader of the African National Congress, Mr. Nelson Mandela, \nand President de Klerk have resumed talks on the country's political future. \nWe appeal, however, to Chief Gatsha Buthelezi of the Inkatha freedom movement \nto rejoin his compatriots in the negotiations for the establishment of a \nnon-racial, democratic society. \nThe tragic story of Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of continuing \nsuffering, destruction and death. It heightens profound fears that if the \nsituation is not urgently arrested the world could find itself involved in a \nmajor effort to prevent the extinction of a national group due to the \nhorrendous policy of \\\"ethnic cleansing.\\\" Liberia deplores that inhumane \npractice and calls for enforcement action in keeping with the relevant \nresolutions of the Security Council. \nWith regard to the situation in the Middle East, Liberia welcomes the \nrenewed efforts by the parties to the crisis and others to move the peace \nprocess forward. It is our continuing belief that only a negotiated \n \nsettlement within the parameters of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) \nand 338 (1973) can bring a just and lasting peace to that troubled region. \nOne of the perennial issues before the Assembly has been the need to \nameliorate the poverty and underdevelopment that plague the developing \ncountries. The mounting debt burden, the decline in commodity prices and \nincreasing protectionism are some of the factors contributing to the economic \nstagnation in many developing countries. My Government is therefore concerned \nabout the delay in concluding the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. We \nentertain the hope that the negotiations will be completed before the end of \n1992, as envisaged. \nIt was in appreciation of the disturbing economic trends that I have \nmentioned that the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly adopted a New \nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. Liberia calls upon the \ninternational community to support the Agenda wholeheartedly in order to grant \nrelief to African countries. \nAnother important task of this session of the General Assembly is to \nfollow up the decisions taken by the United Nations Conference on Environment \nand Development, which was held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. The decision \nby most countries to sign the Conventions on climate change and on \nbiodiversity, as well as to adopt a comprehensive programme for sustainable \ndevelopment. Agenda 21, reaffirmed awareness of the fundamental relationship \nbetween development and the environment. As the Secretary-General observes in \nhis report, Agenda 21 constitutes the centrepiece of international cooperation \nand coordination activities within the United Nations system for years to \ncome, it is therefore Liberia's sincere hope that at this session the General \nAssembly will take appropriate measures to ensure the full implementation of \nthe historic decision that has been reached. \n\nThe rapid pace of change and the shrinking of our planet by faster means \nof travel and communication have combined to make more relevant the \ninterdependence of nations. As such, Liberia reaffirms its abiding faith in \nand commitment to the principles of the United Nations that have stood mankind \nin good stead. Like those whose vision led to the birth of the Organization \nat a time of great upheavals and challenges, we too must call forth the best \nin us to ensure that we bequeath to posterity a world safe from pockets of \nwars and the attendant dreadful consequences. \nIn pursuit of that attainable goal we must banish from our minds all \nforms of mistrust, suspicion, fears and prejudices which, more often than not, \ndefine our behaviour in national and international affairs. If we muster the \ncourage and the will to face squarely the new realities of the post-cold-war \nera, then the chances will be enhanced of a stable international environment \nin which the United Nations can promote social progress and development while \nkeeping the peace. \n"

        "file_text": "I have the pleasure to extend to Mr. Ganev the \nwarm congratulations of the delegation of Nepal on his unanimous election to \nthe presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We are \nhappy to have an eminent person like him, with wide experience and skill, to \nguide our deliberations at this particularly important stage in the history of \n\nthe United Nations. I take this opportunity to express the great appreciation \nof my delegation to Mr. Samir Shihabi, who presided over the forty-sixth \nsession with great distinction. \nI should also like to pay a tribute to our Secretary-General, \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his dedication to the ideals of the United \nNations. His statesmanship and wise leadership are crucial in our collective \nefforts towards realizing the vision of the Charter. \nThe pace of change in the world has presented humanity both with promises \nand with challenges. The events of the last few years have underlined the \nuniversal applicability of the Charter of the United Nations. Its validity as \na universal guide has withstood the test of time and flux. Confidence in the \nOrganization as the central agency for upholding the rule of law and as a \nforum for harmonizing the actions of nations has never been greater. We have \nseen a united international community, acting on the precepts of the Charter, \novercome an act of aggression. After decades of paralysis, the Security \nCouncil is functioning as envisaged in the Charter. Efforts to revitalize the \nrole of the United Nations in the economic and social fields have gained \nmomentum. This unparalleled resurgence of faith in the United Nations is best \nsymbolized in the admission of 20 new Members in a single year. We are closer \nthan ever before to the cherished goal of universal membership. \n \nA period of rapid changes is also a period of uncertainties. The old \nglobal order has passed but the new order is still very fluid. At this \nthreshold of a new era in international life, we have a broad framework for a \nbetter future in the Charter of this Organization. The challenge before the \nUnited Nations is to harness the new mood and dynamism in international life \nand bring them to bear on the global problems facing mankind. It is the \nchallenge to seize the opportunity to end war, to protect the dignity and \nworth of the individual, to ensure freedom and the rule of law and to promote \neconomic development. In an interdependent world, the United Nations is \nindispensable for international cooperation. \nThe task is by no means simple. In one single year, there have been \nupheavals of epic proportion: the break-up of political entities of long \nstanding and brutal ethnic and religious wars. Narrow nationalism is \nthreatening the norms of a stable international order. The cost in terms of \nhuman suffering has been appalling. The horrors of Somalia and of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina force us to ask if we, the peoples of the United Nations, are \nreally determined to combine our strength to maintain international peace and \nsecurity. The persistence of widespread poverty and destitution forces us to \nask if we are indeed resolved to employ international machinery for the \neconomic and social advancement of all peoples. \nThe historic summit-level meeting of the Security Council in January this \nyear was an important landmark in the search for answers to these and other \nquestions. That meeting launched a serious search for new ideas and provided \nan impetus to meet new situations in the world. As the Secretary-General has \npointed out, the tumultuous events of the last few years have already driven \nhome several lessons: the need for democratization at the national level with \n \na corresponding process at the global level; the defence of human rights, \nincluding minority rights and the right to development; the need for new ways \nto prevent internal and inter-State confrontations, including the increasing \nuse of regional arrangements; and universal acceptance of the rule of law \ntranscending changing perceptions of expediency. \nThese observations form the core of the Secretary-General's report, \\\"An \nAgenda for Peace\\\". Several of the Secretary-General's recommendations can and \nshould be implemented immediately. These relate to the more effective use of \nthe traditional forms of peace-keeping, the safety of peace-keeping personnel, \nand the finances involved. His recommendation for greater resort to \nfact-finding missions is equally pertinent. Some other recommendations raise \nfundamental issues related to the perception of an international organization, \nits role vis-a-vis State sovereignty, and the role of the Secretary-General \nhimself. My delegation looks forward to a full-scale discussion of this \nimportant document during the present session. \nIt is obvious that there is today a greater need for the United Nations \nto address itself more seriously to the great divide between the rich and poor \nnations. This, along with the universalization of a human rights regime, is a \nfundamental issue of the new era. \nAs a least developed country, Nepal accepts the principal responsibility \nfor its economic and social development. Our development policies are \ndirected towards creating a basic infrastructure for development. Human \nresources development is a priority with us. We consider it extremely \nimportant to improve the living conditions of our people, to raise the level \nof literacy, improve basic health and nutrition, and reduce the rate of infant \nmortality. We are committed to these goals because we believe that it is the \nhuman being and not the State which has the ultimate right to development. We \n\nfully share the view that these goals can be attained only in a society that \nis committed to the inalienable right of its people to elect their own leaders \nin free and honest exercise of their will. We have already put in place the \nfoundations necessary to achieve these objectives. Principal among them are \nthe constitutional guarantee of political pluralism, the rule of law, the \nindependence of the judiciary, and safeguards for human rights. We now have \nthe legal framework to enable people locally to take primary responsibility \nfor their own development. With the basic political and legal grounds in \nplace, I wish to reiterate our appeal for measures to reach the targets set \nout in the programme of action adopted by the Second United Nations Conference \non the Least Developed Countries. While expressing deep gratitude for the \ngenerous assistance we have been receiving from donor countries and \nmultilateral agencies, we look forward to increased cooperation to complement \nour own efforts to meet the needs of the poorest of our poor. \nIt is now universally recognized that, if development is to be possible, \nthe life-sustaining ecological systems must be preserved, and that development \nalone can make it possible to safeguard the environment. It is imperative to \nimprove the living conditions of the poor in developing countries so that they \nare not forced to destroy the ecological basis of their children's future to \nmeet the immediate challenges of sheer survival. The United Nations \nConference on Environment and Development held in June this year was the most \npotent expression of global interdependence. The Conference has established \nthat developing countries need to mobilize their own resources for sustainable \ndevelopment. It obliges developing countries to take global environmental \nconsequences into consideration in their development planning. It has also \nestablished the right of developing countries to development. It has \n\nunderscored the need for the transfer of additional resources and technology \nfrom industrialized countries to enable developing countries to fulfil their \nresponsibility to safeguard the environment for present and future \ngenerations. Equally important, the Conference has established that developed \ncountries need to reduce the great burden they impose on the environment. The \nRio Declaration and Agenda 21 place people at the centre of concern. \nAgenda 21, with its far-reaching implications, can be the centerpiece of a \nmutually beneficial international cooperation. Nepal sincerely hopes that the \nphilosophical commitment of Rio will be followed through and strengthened. We \nhope that establishing a high-level commission on sustainable development will \nreceive the utmost priority it deserves during this session of the General \nAssembly. \nWhile speaking of international cooperation in economic and social \nfields, I appreciate the ongoing efforts to enable the Economic and Social \nCouncil to play the role envisioned in the Charter. Political justice will \nmean little if the health and happiness of people, especially those in \ndeveloping countries, are ignored. Indeed, global economic and social \ndevelopment alone can constitute the lasting foundation of international peace \nand security. We welcome the serious and out-of-the-ordinary approach of the \n1992 session of the Council as the first tangible move towards restructuring \nset in motion by General Assembly resolution 45/264. The holding of the first \nhigh-level segment of a regular session of the Council was a promising \nbeginning. Also important was the examination of operational activities \nincluding the workings of organs and agencies of the United Nations family in \neconomic and social fields. The times call for an integrated approach to \neconomic and social issues in the field as well as at headquarters. They \n\ndemand that we avoid inter-agency competition, duplication and waste of \nlimited resources by improving coordination among agencies, including the \nBretton Woods institutions. My delegation has noted with appreciation the \nSecretary-General's determination to pursue restructuring of the Secretariat \nto meet these larger goals. \nOne of the most satisfying reforms undertaken during the last year has \nbeen in the area of coordinating humanitarian assistance. My delegation \nwelcomes the establishment of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs and \nexpresses its warm appreciation to Under-Secretary-General \nAmbassador Jan Eliasson for his good leadership. We have already seen several \nexamples of effective balance between principles and operational guidelines, \nimproved coordination and governance. The situations in Somalia and the \nformer Yugoslavia present unique tests of international commitment in this \narea. Indeed, it might not be too far-fetched to visualize the operation of \neffective humanitarian emergency assistance and the equally important roles of \nfollow-up rehabilitation and development phases as new arms of the United \nNations in preventive diplomacy and peacemaking. \n\nThe relationship between freedom and democracy, on the one hand, and \npeace and stability, on the other, needs no reiteration. Nepal rejoices in \nthe resurgence of democracy in various parts of the world in recent years. We \nstrongly support this trend, which we believe to be in full conformity with \nthe purposes of the United Nations. Developments in recent years have made it \nclear that, without respect for human rights, other achievements will have \nlittle meaning. The starting-point of democracy is the recognition and worth \nof each human individual. Respect for human rights alone makes freedom \nmeaningful. The protection and promotion of human rights are becoming a \ncommon basis for international cooperation. Respect for human rights is an \nessential condition for the conduct of international relations in a spirit of \nopenness, trust and confidence. The realization by many peoples within \nwell-established political entities of their right to self-determination has \nraised the complex question of the rights of minorities. Clearly, absolute \nself-determination of each minority would have unforeseen consequences for the \nsystem of international relations. Clearly, multi-ethnicity, cultural and \nreligious pluralism would continue to enrich most of the nations of the \nworld. However, it is a duty incumbent on governments to ensure that members \nof minority groups are guaranteed the full enjoyment of the basic human rights \ncommon to all. It is also a duty incumbent on governments to ensure special \nprotection when needed. The current upheavals in various parts of the world \nunderscore the need for the United Nations to work out principles that can \nserve as common points of reference for the peaceful resolution of conflicting \naspirations. \nThe historic Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, unilateral disarmament \ndecisions taken by the United States and the Russian Federation, and the \nagreement reached between the two countries this summer are crucial steps \n\ntowards lower levels of armaments and greater security. There is an \noverwhelming consensus today that the opportunity provided by the uniquely \nfavourable international relations must be seized in order to achieve a \ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. Events in the Persian Gulf have made the \nnon-proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction the subject \nof global focus. My delegation sincerely hopes that at this session the \nGeneral Assembly will be able to adopt the long-awaited Convention on chemical \nweapons, the first comprehensive international instrument to outlaw a whole \nclass of weapons of mass destruction. In this context, Nepal welcomes the \nrecent agreement between our two neighbours, India and Pakistan, on chemical \nweapons. \nWe have been following events in the territory of the former Socialist \nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia with utmost concern. The use of brute force \nagainst the civilian population, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina, has \nbeen appalling. We find the policy of forced mass expulsion abhorrent. We \ncannot accept the use of force to change internal or external borders. Nepal \njoins in the international demand that parties to the conflict respond \nimmediately to the successive resolutions of the Security Council. We appeal \nto the European Community to redouble its efforts, in cooperation with the \nUnited Nations, to seek a negotiated settlement of the crisis in the Balkans. \nNepal welcomed the extraordinary session of the Commission on Human Rights \ndevoted to Yugoslavia. We look forward to the report of the Secretary-General \non the findings of the Special Rapporteur on allegations of grave violations \nof human rights throughout the former Yugoslavia. We pay a tribute to the \npersonnel of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), the United \nNations humanitarian agencies and the International Committee of the Red \n\nCross, which have been doing an outstanding job in the most difficult \ncircumstances. \nMy delegation reiterates its full support for the territorial integrity \nand non-aligned character of Cyprus. We hope that the October round of talks \nunder the good offices of the Secretary-General will produce the desired \nresults. \nNepal has welcomed the implementation of the United Nations plan for \nCambodia. We reiterate our appeal to all Cambodian parties to cooperate fully \nwith the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) for the \nsuccessful conclusion of this important United Nations mission. I take this \nopportunity to express my Government's appreciation to Mr. Yasushi Akashi, \nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General, for the great efforts he has \nbeen making to ensure the successful implementation of the plan for Cambodia. \nWe are following with keen interest talks between North and South Korea, \nnow fellow Members of the United Nations. We sincerely hope that these \nbilateral talks will facilitate the fulfilment of the wishes of the Korean \npeople for peaceful national reunification. \nNepal is gravely concerned over the violence and the deaths of innocent \ncivilians in Kabul. We appeal to the various Afghan factions to end the cycle \nof violence and to engage in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the \nwar-torn country. \nEvents of the past year have not diminished the urgency of finding a \nsolution to the Middle East conflict on the basis of Security Council \nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Israel and the Palestinian people must \nrecognize each other's rights: the right of the Palestinian people to \nself-determination, including their right to form a State of their own, and \nthe right of Israel to exist within secure and internationally recognized \n \nborders. The Government of Nepal strongly supports the continuing efforts of \nthe sponsoring Powers of the Middle East peace process to bring about a \nnegotiated settlement of the crisis. \nSouth Africa is today at a critical juncture. Negotiations thus far have \nindicated that difficulties in the establishment of a united non-racial \ndemocratic South Africa are not insurmountable. Violence should not be \nallowed to dampen hopes for a peaceful end of apartheid. \nMy delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-General and the \nendorsement by the Security Council of his proposal for involvement of the \nUnited Nations in order to put the dialogue on track again. My delegation \nhopes that the Pretoria regime will respond positively to the proposals \ncontained in the report, expecially those relating to ending the violence. \nAs I said at the beginning of my statement, the vision of the Charter is \nmore valid today than ever before. It is, however, clear that models and \npolicies of the past are not adequate to meet today's global issues. The \nmagnitude and severity of economic and social problems in many countries of \nthe world today are unprecedented. The emergence of the Security Council as \nthe central instrument for the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity, as intended by the Charter, is a welcome development. The United \nNations must seize this historic opportunity to promote with equal vigour and \nurgency international cooperation in the economic and social fields. The \nprecepts of the Charter should be our guide in bringing in a new era of \ninternational relations. This family of nations must strive to create a world \nwhere all people are entitled to political freedom, economic and social \njustice, a clean environment and full human rights. \n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, \non behalf of the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, I wish to \ncongratulate you on your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh \nsession of the General Assembly. I am convinced that you will brilliantly \nfulfil the important mission conferred upon you by the Assembly. \nI also wish to express sincerest congratulations to the \nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has assumed \nhis office and high responsibilities at a time when the world situation \nrequires that the United Nations play an important role. \nWe cannot miss this opportunity to pay a special tribute to his \npredecessor. His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his active \ncontribution to the defence of our Organization's cause. \nWe warmly welcome the presence among us of new Members: the Republic of \nArmenia, the Azerbaijani Republic, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the \nRepublic of Croatia, the Republic of Georgia, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the \nRepublic of Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, the Republic of San Marino, \nthe Republic of Slovenia, the Republic of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan. Their admission is an important step towards the \nuniversality of our Organization. \nThe global situation is in a state of profound change, both complex and \nfull of new promise. With the breakup of the Eastern bloc, military and \nnuclear confrontation have progressively waned. None the less, numerous civil \nconflicts, ethnic struggles, religious clashes and border conflicts continue \nto disturb many countries of the world, thus seriously threatening \ninternational peace, stability and security. \nAll of this notwithstanding, it must be noted that the world climate is \nevolving towards co-operation, development and the settlement of global \nproblems, including those related to poverty, to misery and to the environment. \nIn the changing world in which the new international order is beginning \nto take shape, the United Nations must play a central role in the collective \neffort to define this new order, which should respond equitably to the rights \nand interests of all countries and peoples without discrimination and must be \nbased on the principles of peaceful coexistence and those of the United \nNations Charter. It is therefore necessary to revitalize, restructure and \ndemocratize the United Nations if we want the Organization to be capable of \nthe tasks that lie ahead in this new era. \nWe are still in an uncertain world characterized by many problems and \nconflicts in different regions. \nIn Europe, the situation prevailing in former Yugoslavia continues to \ndeteriorate dangerously. It is a major source of concern for the \ninternational community, as well as a threat to regional and global peace and \nsecurity. The international community must take appropriate measures to put \nan end to that ethnic conflict in order to restore peace, security and normal \nlife to that part of the world. \nIn South Africa, despite certain political reforms the foundations of the \napartheid system remain intact. The Pretoria regime continues to resort to \nviolence to repress the black population, while the African National Congress \nof South Africa (ANC) is forcefully and constructively pursuing its struggle \nfor the triumph of its just cause. The Lao Government fully associates itself \nwith the international community in its efforts to support the struggle of the \ngreat majority of that people in order to make South Africa a democratic and \nnon-racial country. \nIn the Middle East, the situation remains tense and precarious. Israel \nis perpetuating its occupation of Palestinian territory and of the other Arab \nterritories. We reaffirm the view that every effort for peace now under way \nwith a view to a just, comprehensive and lasting solution in the Middle East, \nat the heart of which is the question of Palestine, should work towards rapid \nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and \nthe other resolutions of the United Nations calling for Israel's withdrawal \nfrom all occupied Arab lands, as well as recognition of the Palestinian \npeople's right to self-determination. \nIn the Persian Gulf, following the end of the war peace and security have \nnot yet been established because of threats of and attempts at further \nhostilities. \n \nIn Western Asia, Afghanistan remains a theatre of civil war. The \ninternational community must appeal to all the parties concerned to put an \nimmediate end to their conflicts in order to achieve national harmony among \nAfghans and to establish political, economic and social stability. \nIn the Korean peninsula, the signing of the North-South Accord on \nReconciliation, Non-Aggression and Exchanges and the Joint Declaration on the \nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula by the Democratic People's Republic \nof Korea and the Republic of Korea has contributed to promoting mutual \nunderstanding and trust. It has opened up a new prospect for peace, stability \nand cooperation in the Korean peninsula and strengthened peace and security in \nthe North-East Asian region and in the rest of the world. \nIn the South-East Asian region, in spite of certain factors of \ninstability, the situation as a whole is moving towards peace, stability, \ncooperation and development in the interest of the peoples of the entire \nregion. In this context, inspired by the desire to strengthen relations of \nfriendship and cooperation with neighbouring countries, the Lao Government, \napplying its consistent foreign policy based on the five principles of \npeaceful coexistence, signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation with the \nKingdom of Thailand, became a party to the Treaty of Bali of 1976. It has \nalso become an Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) observer. It \nwill continue to work firmly for fruitful cooperation in South-East Asia, with \na view to promoting the progress and prosperity of the region, thus \ncontributing to promoting peace and development the world over. \n \nAs regards the question of Cambodia, the signing of the Paris Agreements \nof 23 October 1991 laid the foundations for a comprehensive political \nsettlement to the conflict, making it possible to put an end to the suffering \nendured by the Cambodian people during a long period of civil war and to \nestablish peace and tranquillity in the noble land of Angkor. Complete \ncompliance with, and implementation of, these Agreements is required to meet \nthe aspirations and the interests of the Cambodian people. \nIn my own country, the implementation of our policy of renewal has led to \nimportant successes. Political stability and social order are solidly \nguaranteed. Democracy and the right of collective decision-making by the \npeople have developed steadily in accordance with our level of economic and \nsocial development and the customs of the country. The adoption last year by \nthe National Assembly of the first Constitution of the Republic makes it \npossible for our country to move progressively towards a State of law. In the \nframework of that policy we are focusing all our efforts on freeing the \ncountry of underdevelopment. To this end we have encouraged foreign \ninvestment, intensified cooperation with other countries and taken advantage \nof all economic sectors employing market-economy mechanisms in order to tap \nall our national potential and to improve the physical and spiritual living \nconditions of our people. \nThe world economy is in a state of uncertainty. Last year it experienced \nthe first global recession since the 1940s. Moreover, the recovery remains \nweak and precarious. The developing countries continue to suffer from \ncoercive economic policies and practices. The stifling burden of foreign \n\ndebt, the decline in resources allocated to development, the deterioration of \nthe terms of trade, the worsening of the outflow of capital, the drop in \ncommodity prices, the rise in protectionism and limited access to modern \ntechnology all obstruct their economic progress at a time when reforms and \nreadjustments are under way. Since the world economy is a single entity whose \ncomponents are interdependent and interrelated, it is urgently necessary \nindeed, crucial to develop a new world consensus and to obtain a commitment \nto the strengthening of international cooperation, and in particular the \nrevitalization of the economic growth and development of the developing \ncountries, in order successfully to implement the economic strategy of the \nFourth United Nations Development Decade, 1991-2000. \nOne of the most important issues related to development is that of the \nenvironment, which is at the forefront of our international concerns. Climate \nchange, air, sea and ocean pollution, desertification and the depletion of the \nozone layer have all had a negative impact on our lives and on the future of \nmankind. In this respect, we believe that the recent United Nations \nConference on Environment and Development, which was held in Rio de Janeiro, \nlaid the foundations of international agreement on cooperation aimed at \nintegrating the environment into all development activities. It will \ntherefore be up to the United Nations and its specialized agencies to \nimplement effectively Agenda 21. \nAt the same time, the aspirations of the international community to a \nbetter quality of life and social progress have become more pressing and \nincreasingly important. In fact, protection of the environment, promotion \n\nof economic growth and development, and the eradication of poverty are \nmutually reinforcing and require a new global partnership. In this framework, \nwe are awaiting with interest the planned convening of the World Summit for \nSocial Development. \nThe problem of the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs remains a source of \nglobal concern. The struggle against this scourge requires concerted, strong \naction by all countries. For its part, in order to contribute to the \ninternational effort the Lao Government has cooperated in the sphere of \nintegrated rural development with certain interested countries, especially \nneighbouring countries, as well as with international organizations, including \nthe United Nations International Drug Control Programme, and we are prepared \nto continue this cooperation. \nIn conclusion, the Lao delegation wishes to assure the President, \nMr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, of its complete cooperation. We will work in a \nconstructive spirit with other delegations to contribute to the success of \nthis session of the General Assembly. \n"

        "file_text": "I should like to extend sincere congratulations to you, Sir, \non your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its \nforty-seventh session. \n\nI am especially pleased to see in this high post a representative of \nBulgaria, a country that is linked to Ukraine by geographical and ethnic \nproximity and by centuries-old ties of friendship, cooperation and \ngood-neighbourly relations. \nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to your \npredecessor, Mr. Shihabi, who made tireless efforts to strengthen the role of \nthe General Assembly. \nWe greatly appreciate the contribution that was made to the \nimplementation of radical transformations in the United Nations by \nMr. Perez de Cuellar, the former Secretary-General. His successor, \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has embarked on the course of deepening the \nreforms, with the firm intention of enhancing the role and authority of the \nOrganization, in response to the needs of our time. We will support these \nundertakings in every possible way. \nThe current session of the General Assembly is being held during a period \nof profound and truly epoch-making transformations on our planet, which have \nincluded in the formation of a new world order the potential of the new States \nbuilt on the ruins of the last empire in the history of mankind. \nThe disintegration of the bankrupt totalitarian system, resulting in the \nlargest increase in the membership of the United Nations in recent years, \nopened the way for the triumph of genuine freedom and democracy in vast areas \nof Europe and Asia and for the realization of the inalienable right of peoples \nto self-determination and has made it possible to place human rights at the \nfocus of the policies of many newly emerged States. \nThe people of Ukraine demonstrated through the centuries its firm desire \nfor independence and its aspiration to a national, political and economic \n \nrenaissance. For hundreds of years Ukrainians' drive for freedom was subdued \nby giving them miserable pittances or by the use of violence and repression. \nBut today, for the first time, our people have set out on the path leading to \nthe temple of independence, and no one will ever make our people deviate from \nthat historic path. \n \nIn August of this year we solemnly marked the first anniversary of our \nindependence. That pivotal event in the life of our people was celebrated as \nthe triumph of democracy and freedom. And today we are facing a task of great \nproportions: to build a democratic Ukraine governed by the rule of law, to \nrevive the strength and intellectual potential of our people, to be worthy of \nthe memory of our ancestors who sacrificed their lives in the struggle for \nindependence. \nThe fresh winds of change make it necessary to take a new look at the \nCharter of the United Nations, to activate fully its enormous creative \npotential and to free international relations from the burden of suspicion, \nhostility and the renewal of violence. The shortest way to that goal is \nthrough international relations based on common sense and on respect for \nfreedom of choice, in keeping with the centuries-old principles of \ninternational law which are clearly understood, widely recognized and \nconsistently applied. \nAs early as the seventeenth century the celebrated Spanish theologian and \nphilosopher Francisco Suarez observed that although States are not combined \ninto a single political body, they are obliged to help one another and to \nmaintain and defend law and peace, since that is imperative for the benefit of \nall mankind. A State that violates the law and disregards international \nagreements is thereby undermining the foundations of its own future \ntranquillity. \nThe same vital philosophical ideas were also expounded by \nHryhory Skovoroda, a Ukrainian philosopher, writer and thinker of the \neighteenth century who stood for purity in public order and who inspired \nbelief in the inevitable triumph of truth and justice. \n\nWe attach great importance to strengthening the role of the United \nNations in settling conflicts and resolving disputes. Although the threat of \ntotal military confrontation has receded, the tragic developments on the \nterritory of former Yugoslavia, in Nagorny Karabakh, in Georgia, in the \nDniester region and in other areas give us warning that local conflicts are \nfraught with serious danger. \nWe believe that joint efforts by the international community can \neliminate the deep-rooted causes of these conflicts, which are linked to \nunresolved national issues, to irresponsible appeals for the review of \nexisting State frontiers, to economic hopelessness, to political egocentrism \nand to the messianic ambitions of some States seeking to create zones of their \nown special interests in certain parts of the world. The task of the United \nNations is to establish a structure for interaction that would guarantee the \nsecurity of every Member State. \nOur country can contribute to the attainment of that goal. In the year \nthat has passed since the proclamation of our independence, Ukraine has \ntraversed the road from a quasi-State within the former USSR to a universally \nrecognized European State. Having joined the leading international political, \nhumanitarian and monetary-financial institutions, our country has assumed full \nresponsibility for securing its own foreign-policy interests and its external \neconomic interests. \nWithout claiming any special status in the world, we want to occupy a \nplace in the international community worthy of our people, our history and our \npotential. We can make and we want to make a constructive contribution to \ninternational cooperation. \n\nUkraine welcomes the changes in the political and military structure of \nEurope, where we are seeing the key role in maintaining peace and stability \nshift from military deterrence to political mechanisms. These changes have \nensured the success of the process of the Conference on Security and \nCooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the possibility of shaping a new security \nmodel on the continent based on close interaction between the European \nStates. I would like to emphasize that the orientation towards Europe is one \nof the main driving forces of our foreign policy; we intend to intensify the \ndynamics of our relations with European States and with their regional \nstructures. \nWe intend to pursue a serious, pragmatic and result-oriented policy with \nrespect to the United Nations. That is why the Ukrainian Parliament decided \nto send a military contingent to take part in the United Nations peace-keeping \nmission in the territory of former Yugoslavia. Today Ukrainian soldiers are \ncontinuing to do their duty with honour and dignity in that suffering land. \nTheir mission has won universal support and recognition. \nThe transition of the contemporary world to a system of global \nintegration, multipolarity and partnership demands the creation of a new \nconcept of strategic stability based on a substantial and balanced reduction \nof existing arsenals of weapons to the dimensions of reasonable sufficiency \nfor defence. The results achieved so far in bilateral efforts to limit \narmaments should be supplemented by new multilateral agreements, whose \nuniversality would provide the necessary level of confidence, strengthening \ntrust in their implementation. \n\nWe welcome the completion of the convention on the complete prohibition \nand destruction of chemical weapons. For Ukraine, which does not possess, \nproduce or stockpile chemical weapons in its territory, signing the convention \nis one of the priorities in the field of disarmament. \nThe question of eliminating all nuclear weapons is of fundamental \nsignificance for us. We are convinced that, with a well-adjusted system of \ncollective security based on the Charter of the United Nations, it will be \npossible to prevent any aggression or, if necessary, to suppress it through \njoint efforts. \nUkraine, which suffered the full effects of the Chernobyl disaster, is \nsupporting with even greater determination the international campaign for the \ncomplete renunciation of nuclear testing and for the assumption by every \nnuclear-weapon State of an obligation not to be the first to use nuclear \nweapons. \nSimultaneously with its proclamation of independence, Ukraine opted to \nbecome a State possessing no nuclear weapons. Of course, Ukraine is not the \nonly country in the world which has chosen non-nuclear status. But our \nuniqueness lies in the fact that we voluntarily took on the burden of \neliminating hundreds of strategic and tactical nuclear warheads inherited from \nthe USSR, a choice which has huge financial implications. \nHaving set out on the path of reducing and eliminating nuclear weapons, \nwe count on strict international guarantees of our national security against \nthe possible threat or use of force by any nuclear State. I should point out \nthat this is by no means a rhetorical question for our newly independent \nState, and we consider it in our own special context. Naturally, we count on \nunderstanding for our position. \n \nUkraine intends to accede in the very near future to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; it will place all its nuclear power \nplants and all fissionable materials under the supervision of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). \nWe actively support the idea of creating a nuclear-free zone in the Black \nSea basin. As is known, in the agreement between Ukraine and the Russian \nFederation, signed on 3 August of this year at Yalta, the two major Black Sea \nStates officially declared the desirability of pursuing a policy aimed at \nmaking the Black Sea a nuclear-free zone and a zone of peace and cooperation. \nWe regard the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe as the most \nimportant element of a new security system in Europe. The entry into force of \nthe Treaty will make it possible to accelerate the process of European \ndisarmament, to remove the remaining imbalances in armed forces and to \neliminate unpredictability from the military and strategic situation on the \nContinent. \n\nThe successful conclusion of negotiations on reducing the numbers of \nmilitary personnel and on implementing the provisions of the Vienna Document \non Confidence- and Security-building Measures opens new opportunities for \nstrengthening stability in Europe. Together with other European countries, we \nwelcome the conclusion of the \\\"open skies\\\" agreement as an important step \ntowards mutual trust in military activities. \nAgainst the background of definite changes for the better in the area of \narms limitation and disarmament, issues of strengthening international and \nregional stability take on special importance. \nUkraine greatly appreciates the contribution made by the United Nations \nto the settlement of conflicts in the \\\"hot spots\\\" of the planet and its \nendeavours to restore peace to the Balkans and to normalize the situations in \nCambodia, Cyprus, Central America and southern Africa. \nThe experience acquired in this sphere proves that the most efficient \nactions are preventive actions aimed at lessening tension before it is \ntransformed into open conflict between the opposing parties. The use of the \nmethods of preventive diplomacy must become a priority feature of United \nNations activity today. We support the ideas of the Secretary-General in this \nregard and the pragmatic proposals set forth in his report \\\"An Agenda for \nPeace\\\" (A/47/277). \nThe normalization of the situation in the Persian Gulf, with the direct \nparticipation of the United Nations, is facilitating the intensification of \nefforts aimed at settling the Arab-Israeli conflict. Ukraine believes that a \nconstructive dialogue on this problem at the current session of the General \nAssembly can foster the process of forging specific agreements that started in \nMadrid. \n\nUkraine welcomes efforts aimed at stopping the violence in South Africa, \nand calls upon the Government and the representatives of all political forces \nin South Africa to continue resolutely the process of peaceful settlement. \nA few words about Ukraine's economic situation. The imperial system \ncompletely exhausted Ukraine's economy and unbalanced our economic \nmechanisms. Ukraine inherited a predominantly obsolete technology, a backward \ninfrastructure, the burden of foreign debt, a lack of skilled managerial \nstaff, low living standards for the population and galloping inflation. \nHowever, we are convinced that independence, the development of democracy and \njuridical institutions and the implementation of far-reaching political and \neconomic reforms will enable us to weather the transition to a market economy \nwithout critical social upheavals during the transition period and will create \nthe necessary conditions for the integration of Ukraine into the system of \nworld economic relations. \nIn carrying out the tasks before us, we must rely primarily on our own \nstrength, on the talent and industriousness of our people. But at the same \ntime, we greatly appreciate outside support for our efforts: foreign \ninvestment, and the furnishing of financial and advisory assistance and \nexpertise by the most developed countries of the world and by international \norganizations. \nWe call for concerted action to overcome the consequences of the \nChernobyl disaster, a tragedy unprecedented in the history of mankind, and for \njoint efforts by various countries in solving the complex and unparalleled \nproblems it caused. We hope that the present session of the General Assembly \nwill yield solutions appropriate to the scope of that tragedy. \nOur economic difficulties, the foreign debt inherited from the former \nSoviet Union and the Chernobyl factor make it impossible for Ukraine to meet \n\nfully its financial obligations to the United Nations. However, I wish to \nstate that this problem is constantly being given attention by the Parliament \nand Government of Ukraine. \nAt the same time, Ukraine cannot agree to a merely mechanical approach to \nthe question how the contribution of the former Soviet Union is to be \napportioned. We strongly object to the decisions taken at the last session of \nthe Committee on Contributions that, contrary to the existing criteria, \nrecommended increasing Ukraine's contribution for the next year by over \n50 per cent. We shall strive for a radical revision of the system used for \nformulating the scale of assessment, bringing it into conformity with the \npresent-day realities, levels of development and ability to pay of Member \nStates. \nThe pressure of economic problems is naturally bound to influence the \nsocial situation in our country. However, our efforts to promote respect for \ninternational standards in the field of human rights and protection of the \ninterests of national minorities were instrumental in avoiding ethnicity-based \nconflicts in Ukraine. At the same time, we understand the concerns expressed \nfrom this rostrum regarding \\\"discriminatory practices\\\", against Ukrainians and \nall other non-indigenous nationalities, which are growing stronger in some of \nthe new States that have emerged in the territory of the former USSR. We hope \nthat all States in whose territory Ukrainians reside will demonstrate genuine \nconcern and consideration for their cultural, linguistic and religious needs. \nThat hope was voiced with full force in the statements of the \nparticipants in the World Forum of Ukrainians, which recently brought to Kiev \nthousands of representatives of the Ukrainian diaspora, who had been forced to \nlive far from their native land. \n\nAt a time when human lives are at stake and people are dying of famine in \nsome parts of the world, the problem of humanitarian aid should play a key \nrole in the activities of the United Nations and of its social and economic \norgans. Our country, in the light of its own past, is devoting special \nattention to this question. \nAnother humanitarian problem requires special attention because unless it \nis resolved, it will stand in the way of strengthening the principles of \ncivilized relations in international life. I am referring to the question of \nprisoners of war. While supporting the steps taken by the new leadership of \nAfghanistan in establishing peace and reconciliation in that country, I should \nlike to appeal to it to do its utmost to ensure an immediate search for and \narrange the unconditional return of Ukrainian nationals who are still being \nkept prisoner or are missing in action. At the same time, we call upon all \nStates in whose territory prisoners of war are being held to make the humane \ngesture of releasing the victims of military conflicts. This would also \ncontribute to the success of the forthcoming World Conference on Human Rights. \nIn my statement, I have touched upon some unresolved issues that are \npreventing us from moving ahead. However, none of these problems, we believe, \ncan impede the renaissance of the United Nations stimulated by the end of the \ncold war and the resulting favourable changes in the world. I can assure \neveryone present in this hall that Ukraine is determined to participate in the \nwork of the United Nations which will continue to remain a crucial element of \nour foreign policy, and we will do everything possible to ensure that the \nOrganization enters the next millennium as an effective instrument in building \na better world.

        "file_text": "First \nof all, permit me to express to you. Sir, my congratulations and best wishes \non your election to the presidency of the General Assembly in its work at the \nforty-seventh session. We are sure that under your intelligent guidance, our \nendeavours will achieve the results we all desire. \nAlso at the outset, allow me to extend to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, \nSecretary-General of the United Nations, cordial greetings from the Government \nand the people of the Republic of Paraguay, and to express our commitment to \nsupport him at all times in the difficult task of leading this Organization in \nits efforts for peace and international security. \nIn welcoming the admission to membership of the United Nations of \nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, \n\nKyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan and Uzbekistan, we hail the triumph of freedom and of mankind's \nuniversal desire to live in peace and democracy, while retaining the \nindividual's own identity. Ancient banners have come to wave proudly again \nover their homelands. \n\nA new order is emerging in our universe. On the one hand, we see the \nrebirth of old nationalisms. On the other, we see plans for the integration \nof countries which are seeking, by this means, the right direction for \nachieving better economic development and trying to find, as in the case of \nthe Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), the proper response to the \nrequirements of their peoples for a better quality of life. \nThe integration of our countries Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and \nParaguay through MERCOSUR is something more than a mere strategy for \ndevelopment: it is a commitment of peoples with the same origin, with common \ncultural, historical, linguistic and religious identities, to share the common \ndestiny of nations that were born in a territory of equality and hope. \nThe timetable for our fledgling integration process is being met. The \nLas Leilas meeting of Presidents on 26 and 27 June 1992 approved and is \nimplementing a programme of measures which sets out a process of alleviating \nand eliminating customs duties and non-tariff barriers and of requiring the \ngradual coordination of macroeconomic and sectoral policies. The recent \nsigning of an agreement with the European Community is an important element of \nextraregional cooperation for MERCOSUR. \nAs part of this same commitment to integration, Paraguay is moving ahead \nwith the necessary legal instruments for making better uses of the \nParaguay-Paran waterway. This communications link, which has the support of \nthe Organization and other international communities, is designed to be one of \nthe major river transport routes and an effective instrument for development \nby the MERCOSUR countries and our sister Republic of Bolivia. \n\nThe danger of a nuclear conflagration that would jeopardize the very \nexistence of mankind has disappeared. Common sense and moral values have \nprevailed. Today there are very few cases of armed confrontation in the \nworld. Never, perhaps, in its history has mankind enjoyed so much peace as \nnow. But history has not come to an end: hunger, disease, lack of education, \nintolerance and prejudice continue to affect most parts of the world. If we \nlove liberty, if we love democracy, we must find a solution to these \nproblems. No state of politics can endure when people do not have the minimum \nthey need for a life of dignity. If there is no tolerance, there will be \nhatred and resentment. If there is no education, the future of the world \ncannot be certain. \nNow is the time for continental solidarity. Now is the time for doing \naway with prejudices and egoism. Now that the arms race is over, it would \nseem that the most powerful countries are preparing for another war, the \neconomic war. Alliances are forming; they are trying to improve their \ncompetitiveness. The winner will be the one who produces and sells the most, \nwithout regard to the social cost, without regard to the fact that the \nproducts of the less developed countries are constantly losing value and that \nas a result it is more and more difficult for them to achieve development. \nThe expectations the developing countries had for free trade are being blocked \nby the barriers of protectionism set up by the industrialized countries, \nwhich, paradoxically, are proclaiming the triumph of the free market. \nWe need to .seek solutions that will alleviate the tragedy of the \ncountries suffering the scourge of poverty. We are confident that, thanks to \nthe welcome initiative of Chile in calling for the holding of a summit \nconference for social development, this will be a suitable opportunity for \nachieving world planning to promote the development of the poorest countries. \n\nThe hatred, the intolerance and the constant violation of human rights in \nformer Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in Somalia \nremind us that the battle for peace has not ended. Peace is a gift, and its \npreservation requires constant work. Paraguay will support in the strongest \npossible terms any action by the Security Council designed to seek a final \nsolution to this grave situation, as indeed we voted in favour of resolution \n46/242 of the General Assembly. Exacerbated nationalisms, racisms, religious \nhatreds and prejudices must disappear from the world if it wants to be more \nfraternal and humane. \nWe are regarding with particular interest the continuation of \nnegotiations to find a final solution to the Palestine question. It is our \nhope that these talks will contribute positively towards finding a peaceful \nand negotiated, final and lasting solution which would provide, as we have \nalready said, for the right of the State of Israel to live in peace within its \nown borders and the right of the Palestinian people to its own homeland. \nThe United Nations has lent its assistance to the peace process in South \nAfrica through the Security Council. It is now up to the Government and the \nopposition to find appropriate solutions which provide, courageously and \nrealistically, for the possibility of coexistence in a climate of peace, \njustice and security. \nAs the United Nations enters the new world order that is the fruit of \nEast-West detente, its structure and agenda must be reorganized. Social \ndevelopment and the maintenance of peace must be its major concerns. It will \nbe vital for it to find appropriate machinery to fulfil these aims, and for it \nto have the unreserved support of those who can provide their decisive \ncooperation. \n \nThe \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" proposed by the Secretary-General deserves all our \nsupport: it could be the starting point for the search for new structures and \nnew paths towards lasting and constructive peace. \nWe believe, along with the Rio Group, that international peace and \nsecurity will be truly guaranteed only in so far as the underlying causes of \nconflicts are eliminated. We therefore reaffirm the vital importance of \neconomic and social development in the process of consolidating peace. The \ngap reflected in the disparity in wealth between the North and the South must \nbe narrowed if we want to avoid a chain reaction of unsatisfied needs leading \nto profound crises in developing countries, with the danger of returning to \nsystems which we have abandoned and which have caused our peoples so much \nsuffering. \nWe cannot talk about a future of peace or of sustained development \nwithout total respect for human rights. The dissemination of these rights and \ntheir constant observance is also a task for the United Nations. Respect for \nhuman rights must underpin any process of change. Hence, we welcome the World \nConference on Human Rights, to be held in June 1993 in Vienna, and are pleased \nat the timeliness of its convening. \nFlagrant violations of human rights, such as terrorism, still persist. \nOnce and for all we must accept that terrorism is on of the most serious \nviolations, attacking as it does fundamental human rights such as the rights \nto life, security and patrimony. \nJust a few days ago, in this very Hall, we were moved by the words of the \nPresident of Colombia about the battle being waged by his people and \nGovernment against drug trafficking. Murder, extortion, kidnapping and \ncorruption all have their - roots in the traffic in drugs. Magistrates, civil \n\nservants and anyone opposed to this criminal traffic are under constant \nthreat, and many have paid for their ideals, their courage and their dignity \nwith their lives. \nWe agree with stress laid by the President of Colombia on the \nresponsibility of the major consuming centres, and on countries' obligation to \nparticipate in a total war against drug trafficking. As the President said, \nwe must have determined, collective international and multilateral action to \ncombat this scourge on all fronts. \nFive hundred years ago, the imagination and daring of Columbus ushered in \na new era. America, a continent of hope, was incorporated into the adventure \nof mankind, and it was destined to have a profound effect on the future. \nToday, as a coincidence, the world is entering into a new stage that is also \npromising and full of hope. It is for this generation to consolidate the \nfuture, and for our Organization to ensure that there is peace and to promote \nsocial development. \nTo mark the quincentenary, the countries of Ibero-America met last year \nin Guadalajara, Mexico, determined to make the strength of our community count \nin the future. The response was positive, and at the second summit of Heads \nof State and of Government of Ibero-America, held this year in Madrid, \neffective projects designed to help the Ibero-American peoples were approved. \n\nJoint efforts such as those we have mentioned and those promised in the \nAmericas Initiative, as well as the solidarity and support that my country has \nreceived from other countries such as Japan and Germany, give us hope for a \nfuture of concerted effort for the development of those who need it most. \nIn the course of this year, my country attended the Earth Summit in Rio, \neager to add its efforts to those of the other countries committed to \npreserving the environment. We announced measures adopted in this area, such \nas the declaration as a protected ecological zone of an area covering about \n60,000 hectares of woods, with an indigenous population and natural fauna. \nBut what is more, we are currently studying a draft project for the \ndevelopment of the western region of my country, with the support of the \nEuropean Community, paying particular attention to the preservation of the \nenvironment in an area of more than 240,000 square kilometres, which \nrepresents more than half of our territory. \nThe Rio Conference made it possible for the whole world to become more \naware of the relationship between development and the environment. It will be \ndifficult to achieve lasting success in the endeavour of bringing about \nsustainable development of the Earth if the countries that bear the major \nresponsibility for polluting the planet do not make available the necessary \nresources. \nThe process of democratization in Latin America in this new era was, in a \nsense, what triggered the liberation movements in other parts of the world. \nToday, in America, with a few exceptions. Governments enjoy a legitimacy \nconferred upon them by free and unchallenged elections. The last flickers of \nviolence are dying out, and peoples are living in freedom and democracy, with \nrespect for human rights. \n\nThe civil war in El Salvador is now history. That country, together with \nHonduras, has set an example for the international community by taking its \ninternational conflicts to the International Court of Justice for settlement. \nPeru is once again taking the path of restoring its constitution. In \nNovember, it will be holding constituent elections with the participation, at \nits request, of an observer mission from the Organization of American States. \nWe hope that Peru will find solutions to the grave problems it is confronting \nand that we will shortly be able to welcome it back to the Rio Group. \nThe Rio Group showed that it is a reliable mechanism for political \nconsultation and cooperation, as it demonstrated when the crisis which \nendangered the constitution of Venezuela occurred and when it sent a \ndelegation which took an active part in seeking to restore full democracy in \nPeru. \nFurthermore, through the Rio Group, meetings were held and a treaty of \ncooperation with the European Community was signed, and meetings were also \nheld with countries of the Persian Gulf, Japan, China and Canada. \nThe process of regional integration, whose ultimate objective is that of \ncreating a vast common economic zone throughout the American continent, has, \nin addition to MERCOSUR, made great progress in the form of the Andean Pact, \nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and, first and foremost, the North American \nFree Trade Association (NAFTA), which is a blueprint for integration that has \nalready been agreed upon by the United States of America and by Mexico and \nCanada. On behalf of my country, I should like to extend my congratulations \nand best wishes for success to those countries. \n \nPermit me to speak to you, however briefly, about Paraguay, my own \ncountry, which was reborn to democracy and recovered its freedom just four \nyears ago. Our President, Andres Rodriguez, in this very Hall, addressing the \nGeneral Assembly during the forty-fourth session, said: \n\\\"Paraguay has set its feet firmly on the path of political \ndemocracy.\\\" (A/44/PV.6. p. 21) \nToday I can say, with legitimate pride, that the Government of Paraguay \nis keeping its promise. My country is living in a legitimate, genuine and \nfruitful democracy based on boundless respect for human rights and fundamental \nhuman freedoms. \nA new national Constitution, effective since 20 June 1992, is now \ngoverning the destiny of my country. This is the result of a democratic \ndebate in a constituent national convention elected by popular will in free \nelections with the participation of all political forces, and was observed by \nmembers of international organizations, both governmental and non-governmental. \nIn the economic and social realm, my country has continued to make \nprogress in consolidating its economy through the process of adjustment and \nstabilization. We have liberalized trade, and we are giving priority \nattention to regional integration. \nOur whole policy of consolidating democracy, accompanied by the necessary \nprocess of stabilizing the economy and finances, has been made possible by the \ndetermination of the Paraguayan people, who made clear to their rulers that in \ntheir country there is no longer room for dictatorship or totalitarianism. \nBut just as the Paraguayan people have become the masters of their new \ndemocratic and free destiny, we must recognize the determined support of the \ninternational community for our process of democratic consolidation and \n\neconomic and financial stabilization. In particular, we should like to thank \nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Organization of American \nStates (OAS) and the European Community for their cooperation and confidence. \nIn conclusion, a few words about the United Nations. As it reaches what \nwe might term the first stage of its existence, the balance sheet is \nfavorable. Its work for peace has been effective. The near-unanimous opinion \nin recommending structural changes to strengthen it and to endow it with \ngreater dynamism has as its sole cause the profound changes occurring in the \nworld, which call for an Organization more in keeping with new requirements. \nTo preserve peace will continue to be its principal task, but with a more \nresponsive structure that will help reduce the causes of conflict. The whole \nworld, longing as it does for a future of liberty, justice, peace and \nsecurity, has placed its trust in the United Nations and its effectiveness. \n"

        "file_text": "It was exactly four months ago that for the first time I had the \nhonour of addressing you, the representatives of sovereign States members of \nthe global community, in our common House, the General Assembly of the United \nNations. Membership in the United Nations is the crowning international \nconfirmation of the sovereign statehood of a State, \n(spoke in English) \nTo the Republic of Croatia it meant the final realization of the just \naspiration of the Croatian people to self-determination and freedom, which \nthat people although one of the oldest European nations succeeded in \nregaining only after nine centuries of life in multinational state communities \nin which, to be sure, they preserved their national identity and the identity \nof their state but did not enjoy internationally recognized sovereignty. \nThe creation of our independent State was the outcome of the \nindestructible moral strength of the Croatian people, based on a firm national \nawareness that has burned for centuries as an eternal fire in our hearts. A \n \nnation may have existed from time immemorial, but if it lacks the moral \nstrength and an awareness of its unique individual being, of its nationhood \nand statehood, it will disappear from the stage of world history. The \nCroatian people yearned for their State and rallied to achieve it. \nIn their relatively long history from the seventh century to this very \nday the Croatian people have taken pride in authentic testimony in stone and \nin the written word to their existence and to their unquenchable yearning for \nfreedom and for their own place among the nations of the world. It was in \nthat very spirit that the great seventeenth-century Croatian poet \nIvan Gundulid wrote in his city of Dubrovnik, that jewel of the heritage of \nCroatia and the world which in our time has suffered barbaric destruction \nhis ode to freedom, which starts with the following lines: \n\\\"O liiepa, o draoa. o slatka slobodo,. \nPar u kom sva blaga vis'n-ii nam Bog je do ...\\\" \nThose verses express the eternal faith in freedom that has been granted \nus as a supreme gift by the Almighty, a gift man has cherished, lived for and \ndied for since time immemorial, as an independent, cultured and civilized \nbeing not only as an individual, but also as a member of his people and of \nmankind as a whole. Just as the individual wants to live as a free, rational \nand unique being, a people can be recognized and appreciated only if it is \naware of itself and of its uniqueness in the world. \nThe Croatian people had their own independent kingdom in the Middle \nAges. Today they have again achieved full State sovereignty, demonstrating to \nthe world their deep faith in and allegiance to freedom, their respect for \njustice, and their wish for peace and the development of their State within \nthe international community of peace-loving, equal and independent States. \n \nWhen it joined the United Nations the Republic of Croatia solemnly \ncommitted itself to respect the principles embodied in the Charter of the \nUnited Nations and the system of values and undertakings on which the global \ncommunity is based. On this occasion, let me once again solemnly reiterate \nour profound allegiance to the principles of the United Nations. \nWe are faced with the historical responsibility to establish a new \ninternational order, an order of equality and the protection of the rights of \nall States and nations, national minorities and individuals. At the same \ntime, this poses the challenge of building a world without war, a world with a \nhealthy environment, a world of progress for all the inhabitants of the Earth. \nFor the first time in the history of mankind, the conditions have been \ncreated for achieving those noble goals. After the disintegration of the \ncolonial empires following the Second World War, and after the appearance of \nnew nations capable of forming States but also of so-called ahistorical \nnations on the global scene, we have finally seen the end of division into \nblocs and the collapse of numerous despotic regimes throughout the world. \nObviously and by no means accidentally the collapse of such regimes has \nbeen associated and has coincided with the collapse of some multinational \nStates in which nations were held together through repression by totalitarian \nregimes or through domination by single nations. \nHuman society has entered a period in its historical development of the \noverall integration of civilizations, but also of national individualization. \nIn other words, the world has become immeasurably interdependent in terms of \n\ndevelopment, technology, transport, ecology, culture and the exchange of \ninformation, but the number of independent international entities has been \nincreasing continuously. Reconciling this contradiction imposes the necessity \nto seek mediation, and even the firm involvement of the entire international \ncommunity, to resolve outstanding and new local and regional crises. \n \nOver the past two-year period, in which Croatia gained its sovereignty, \nthe United Nations has reaffirmed its fundamental principles and tenets: \npeace and democracy as the foundations of international relations. This \nOrganization has resolutely and efficiently opposed attempts to resolve \ninternational disputes by force or to infringe, through aggressive wars and \nthe provocation of regional crises, on the right of nations to \nself-determination and on the territorial integrity of sovereign members of \nthe international community. The determined military action in the Gulf war \nand the peace operations in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Cambodia are \neffective proof that the United Nations, with its active role, is becoming \nincreasingly capable of countering aggression and of bringing about peace. \nHowever, the experience acquired by the United Nations through peacemaking and \npeace-keeping operations and in controlling aggression indicates that the \nprocess of international agreement and the achievement of consensus in the \ninitiation of peace operations is still slow and is not efficient enough. \nThe Republic of Croatia welcomes and fully supports the activities so far \nundertaken by the United Nations to extinguish crises throughout the world, \naware of the fact that a passive attitude or compromise towards the exponents \nof aggression and a new deterioration in international relations would be much \nmore costly and involve substantially greater loss of human life and \nsuffering. Nevertheless, it is the view of the Republic of Croatia that the \nfuture international peace-keeping activity of the United Nations will have to \nbe expanded to include adequate preventive diplomacy, peacemaking efforts and \npost-war confidence building, precisely in order to keep human suffering and \nthe danger of the spread of aggression to a minimum. \n\nMoreover, the Republic of Croatia perceives the need to channel the \nimmediate future involvement of the international community, and thereby the \nprogrammes of the United Nations, along the following main lines of activity. \nFirst, the global economy must pull itself out of the deepening \nrecession, and then an accelerated development cycle should be promoted, \ninvolving a higher degree of coordination and economic cooperation between the \ndeveloped North and the developing countries. Our generation and the global \ncommunity would bear a heavy responsibility to posterity if they permitted the \nrecently ended opposition of East and West to be replaced by new barriers and \na lack of trust between the industrially developed West and North and the \nthird world. \nSecondly, an equally important task of the United Nations concerns the \npersistent and firm promotion of democratic freedoms and human rights \nthroughout the world. This is a necessity because economic and overall \ndevelopment can no longer even be imagined, much less realized, merely on the \nbasis of economic categories and criteria; it can be brought about only with \nthe parallel establishment of human rights and a democratic order encompassing \npolitical liberties and social rights alike. \nIn this respect, Croatia welcomes the decision to convene the World \nConference on Human Rights in September next year. Croatia will actively \ncontribute to the preparations for this important - I should say \\\"historic\\\" \nmeeting, first by resolutely strengthening democratic institutions in our own \ncountry, which has only recently got rid of its totalitarian regime and alien \ndomination. Moreover, within the scope of the Conference on Security and \nCo-operation in Europe (CSCE), Croatia has offered to host the CSCE seminar on \nminority problems which, we hope, will be held in the historic setting of \nBrijuni Island next May. \n\nThe Republic of Croatia resolutely endorses the conclusions of the Rio \nSummit, convinced that sustainable development is the proper answer to the \nrequirements of the global community and to the environmental balance of our \nplanet. The protection of the environment is an important strategic issue in \nCroatia's long-term development. The Gulf war and the war operations in the \nformer Yugoslavia have posed major threats to ecological systems. Because of \nthis, the protection of the environment is not only a developmental issue, but \nalso a major political and security issue. \nLast but not least, the future activity of the international community \nand of the United Nations should also be focused on in addition to the \neffective prevention of aggression as a means to settle international \ndifferences eliminating all sources of crises world-wide in order to \nestablish a permanent and just peace. This complex task will involve a \npainstaking process of agreement and reconciliation of objectively differing \nviews and interests, taking due account of the limited resources of the \ninternational community. However, the stakes and anticipated results for the \nentire international community are so great and historically far-reaching that \nthey deserve every possible effort and the use of all resources in order to \nachieve humanity's supreme goal: permanent peace and general welfare in a \nstable international order. \nThe role of the United Nations has been, and will remain, irreplaceable \nin ensuring the rights of nations to self-determination and the civil and \nhuman rights of ethnic communities and minorities. The United Nations can and \nmust play an important role in controlling changes in societies that are \nridding themselves of totalitarian systems on their way to democratic \npolitical and economic transformation. \n\nIn line with such ideas, Croatia has already enacted - in wartime \nconditions, and in spite of the aggression waged by the Yugo-communist army \nand Serbia and Montenegro and of the externally incited revolt of part of the \nSerbian population in its territory a constitutional law on the protection \nof minorities that is more liberal than many similar pieces of legislation \nanywhere in the world. Croatia is prepared to contribute actively to the \ndevelopment of an international code and standard for the protection of the \nrights of ethnic communities and national minorities, to be used as guidelines \nin the development of national legislation and rules for the settlement of \nfuture controversies. \nWe support enhancement of the role of the General Assembly as a global \nadvisory parliament and of the Security Council as the body most responsible \nfor international peace and security. This implies a higher responsibility \nfor the members of the Security Council, and the permanent members in \nparticular. We therefore support the initiative to expand the Security \nCouncil with new permanent members, because this would reflect the new global \nreality and allow for more harmonious regional representation. We also \nbelieve that the role of the Economic and Social Council in the solution of \nproblems within its sphere of competence should be strengthened. \nLet me take this opportunity to stress in particular that Croatia fully \nagrees with the statement of the Secretary-General on regional conflicts as o \nthreat to global peace and progress, made at the Department of Public \nInformation's Annual Conference for Non-governmental Organizations, on \n9 September. The regional conflicts of our time are no longer comparable to \nthose of the cold war, when the warring sides represented conflicting \nideologies. Present-day regional conflicts are the expression of purely \n\nimperialist or conquest-minded policies. They are not only the cause of \nterrible tragedy - because of the casualties suffered predominantly by the \ncivilian population, the destruction of property and the displacement of \npeople from their homes but also a threat to peace in a wider area, and even \nglobally. \n\nAlthough one of the main principles of the United Nations Charter entails \nnon-interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign States, many current \nconflicts occurring within the borders of particular States have shown that \nsuch developments should become the concern of the United Nations when general \nhuman principles are violated and international peace is threatened. As the \nSecretary-General has stated with a profound feeling of moral responsibility, \nit is the duty of the United Nations to support the dignity of human beings \nand to ensure the safety of their lives, regardless of the type of conflict, \nbe it general, regional or confined to a specific country. \nWhen chaos within a State threatens to bring down civilized and \ndemocratic order, when tyranny crosses the boundaries set by moral standards \naccepted by humankind, and when a regional conflict may jeopardize the \nfoundations of international order, peace and security, the United Nations \nmust be able to take action. Most States, if not the entire international \ncommunity, are also threatened when the existence of a single United Nations \nMember is placed in jeopardy. The examples of Cambodia, Somalia and, \nunfortunately, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina suffice to confirm the \ncorrectness of this view. \nLet me remind the Assembly of the contribution of the struggle of the \nCroatian people for freedom to the establishment of the rights of small \nnations, to the collapse of totalitarian regimes and to a new democratic \natmosphere in international relations in central and south-eastern Europe. \nThe awakened-national awareness of east and central European nations made the \nmajor contribution to the dissolution of the totalitarian communist system. \nTheir struggle against communist socialism, particularly in multinational \nState communities, was a struggle for national emancipation and for civil \n\nrights. Initially it was mistakenly understood, and, in some cases even today \nit is mistakenly understood, as retrograde nationalism or autarchic \nseparatism, or has simply been put down as ethnic conflict and struggle for \npower. \nThe processes of regional and worldwide integration on the one hand and \nthe disintegration of multinational States on the other are only seemingly at \nodds. The newly emerged States in the area of the former Yugoslavia or the \nformer Soviet Union do not aspire to autarchy. It is precisely such countries \nthat most require purposeful integration and openness to cooperation. \nHowever, within the new post-communist democratic atmosphere small nations \nwant to preserve their own identity and the right to their own States so that \nthey may be subjects, and not objects, within the scope of the epoch-making \nchanges taking place in the modern world. \nAt the very beginning of the national and political emancipation of the \nCroatian people we were aware of the complexities and possible risks \nunderlying the collapse of the past regime within a multinational State \ncommunity. Therefore, we patiently tried to resolve the crisis of the former \nYugoslav federation by political negotiation and by proposing a confederal \nagreement in order to avoid war. From the very\\\" beginning we supported the \ninternationalization of the crisis, and by such an approach we have succeeded \nin turning international democratic public opinion to our advantage. \nToday, having achieved military and moral victory in the war that was \nforced upon our country, we are still ready for a political solution of all \ninternal and international problems in order that the conditions necessary for \npermanent internal and regional stability and cooperation between the newly \nemerged States may be created. \n\nThe recent just struggle of the Croatian and other peoples for their \nsovereignty has contributed to the development of a different attitude towards \nthe rights of small nations to independence and to their own States. This \nunequal struggle has, in fact, affirmed the superiority of the democratically \nmanifested right to self-determination of nations over the principle of the \nintegrity of existing multinational States, and in this connection it has also \nbrought about new changes in international law and international relations. \nThe position of small or less developed nations and States within the \ninternational order is the key to regional and international stability and \ncooperation and to just international relations. Without the confirmation of \ntheir right to State individuality the United Nations would now consist of \nabout 50, and not 179, Member States. Our recent experience has shown that \nstable peace and a firm international order are not possible in the \npost-cold-war world without the security and sovereignty of small nations. It \nis for these reasons that we believe that the international community is \nentitled to interfere in the internal affairs of countries in cases involving \nthe control of aggression, humanitarian intervention, the protection of the \nrights of individuals and of national minorities and the preservation of the \nenvironment, in accordance with the principles of, and through mechanisms \nendorsed by, the international community. \nAccordingly, we would welcome such a new role for the United Nations, as \nwell as for such regional organizations as the Conference on Security and \nCooperation in Europe (CSCE), which would guarantee the protection of the \nsecurity of all Member States in a process ranging from peace mediation to the \nimposition of peace. Without such a role the United Nations could not handle \nsuch crises as the one affecting the former Yugoslavia. The chief \n\nresponsibility for international security rests with the Security Council, but \nthe regional organizations should assume the main burden of implementing \npolicy, based on United Nations principles. For this reason we support the \nestablishment of permanent regional military forces capable of rapid peace \nmediation and action to prevent conflict or repel aggression. \nFurthermore, Croatia firmly supports the Secretary-General's \\\"Agenda for \nPeace\\\" and the process of establishing permanent United Nations military \nforces. In the post-cold-war world, when regional conflicts present the major \nthreat to world security, international peace-keeping and peace-making forces \nare emerging as the watershed between chaos and stability. Croatia is ready \nto participate in these forces and to help to bring peace to troubled areas \naround the world. \nHad such mechanisms existed, the disastrous Yugo-communist and \nSerbo-Montenegrin aggression against Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina might \nhave been averted. This crisis has obviously reaffirmed the equal right of \nall nations, particularly young or small nations, to security and has enhanced \nthe need to create such mechanisms. \nIn view of what I have said, we would support the development of a \nregional security system in our area, a system that could also serve as a \nmodel for other crisis areas. Because of their geopolitical importance, \nethnic mix and painful historical experience, it is precisely the Balkans and \nsouth-eastern Europe that would necessarily require the development of such a \nmodel of international regional security congruent with the general system of \ncommon security in order that the stability of the global order might be \nachieved. \n\nThis implies consideration of all steps to bring about \nconfidence-building and mutual guarantees, the establishment and maintenance \nof the balance of power and the creation of security zones and protected \nareas, along with the adjustment and supervision of defensive and other armed \nforces and doctrines. \n\nIn order to achieve stability in this part of Europe, in which the \nprocesses of both stabilization in the Eastern Mediterranean and in \nsouth-eastern Europe and the establishment of stable relations among the newly \nemerged States are still to be completed, Croatia is prepared to take the \ninitiative in convening an international conference of the countries in the \narea in order to consider the future model of regional security and \ncooperation based on common interests and principles embodied in the United \nNations Charter and CSCE documents. \nThe Republic of Croatia endorses the coordinated process of regional and \ngeneral disarmament and welcomes the results already achieved in \nheavy-armament reduction by the big Powers. Croatia is prepared to cooperate \nwith other countries in reallocating military expenditures to the \nreconstruction of war-ravaged areas and to peacetime development. \nThis concerns in particular the new States which require international \ncooperation in the implementation of their democratic and market reforms in \norder to bolster their domestic stability. The role and the responsibility of \nthe international community are to be seen in the light of the fact that these \nsocieties are not strong enough to be able rapidly to become part of the \nintegration processes. Because of this the speedy integration of new States \ninto financial and other institutions should be promoted. \nWe endorse automatic international intervention and other punitive \nmeasures when the territorial integrity of other countries is seriously \nthreatened. The United Nations should also envisage a way to prevent the use \nof military force against the peaceful expression of political will in the \nsolution of domestic political issues. The brutal use of military force \n\nagainst one's own people should not in our time be regarded as merely an \ninternal political problem. \nWe endorse the establishment of a permanent international court for the \npunishment of war crimes and all actions involving the deliberate violation of \npeace and international conventions and endangering the lives of the civilian \npopulation. \nIn support of an open economy and market principles we propose, within \nthe scope of international development strategies, identifying ways and means \nto favour and facilitate the transfer of technology, knowledge and the \nnecessary resources to less developed countries or countries destroyed by \nwar. To our mind, it is precisely the United Nations and its agencies that \nought to play an important role in this process. The United Nations and its \nagencies ought to take the lead in handling the return of refugees and the \nreconstruction of their homes, destroyed cultural monuments, industrial plants \nand infrastructural facilities processes that are of particular importance \nto our country. \nThe earliest solution of all issues regarding the succession of States in \naccordance with international law is of the highest importance for Croatia and \nother States that have emerged in the area of the former Yugoslavia and the \nformer Soviet Union. In supporting the solution of these issues we are \nprepared, especially for economic reasons, to make an additional effort in \norder to codify the experience and norms of international law in this sphere. \nOn this occasion I cannot but add a few words of criticism concerning the \ninadequate action by international factors to solve the crisis in the \nterritory of the former Yugoslavia, more precisely in preventing the brutal \naggression waged by Serbia and Montenegro against Croatia and Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. Croatia appreciates the efforts of the international community -\nfrom the United Nations, the European Community and the CSCE to all those \ninternational factors that have helped us to stop a mindless and most brutal \nwar waged at the expense of the civilian population before the eyes of the \ncivilized world. We express our deepest sympathy for the human losses the \nUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has suffered in the Republic of \nCroatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the performance of its \nnoblest task. \nWhat is really happening there is the sustained aggression of Serbia and \nMontenegro, now acting under the new name of the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia, against two sovereign and independent States Members of the United \nNations - Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Unless stopped, this aggression \nmay mushroom into a conflict on a much broader scale which could spread the \ndisaster of war to the entire European continent, maybe even to the rest of \nthe world. Unfortunately, in spite of that situation the global community has \nnot yet identified a sufficiently efficient mechanism to stop aggression or an \neffective way to stop brutal destruction, such as Europe has hardly ever \nexperienced, associated with the most barbaric form of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\". \nThe implementation of the Vance plan, created with the authority of the United \nNations, is also falling behind schedule because of constant Serbian and \nMontenegrin sabotage. \nThe mission of UNPROFOR must be seriously speeded up and fully \nimplemented within the mandate of the peace-keeping force. Otherwise it will \nbecome meaningless and produce the justified indignation and frustration of \nthe Croatian people who continue to suffer the consequences of aggression. \nCroatian authorities find it increasingly difficult to control the justified \ndiscontent of people displaced from their homes in their own homeland, people \nwho have accepted the role and the intentions of the United Nations and the \nEuropean Community with optimism and the firm conviction that the wrongs they \nhave suffered would be redressed. These people find it difficult to \nunderstand why the international community cannot show, in this particular \ncase, the necessary determination that was shown in the instance of an \nidentical aggression against another sovereign and independent State. The \nUnited Nations must summon the will and the power to use all the resources at \nits disposal in order to bring the war in Croatia to a close and to stop the \naggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the opposite case, if the \naggressor is permitted to continue to implement his plan of conquest, the \nreputation of the United Nations will suffer badly. \nFinally, let me express my conviction that the United Nations will fulfil \nits historical task. For its part the Republic of Croatia is prepared to \ncontribute its share in every respect as a full member of the global community. \nWith the holding of multi-party parliamentary elections for the second \ntime in the past two years, in spite of the war forced upon the country, \nCroatia has severed all links with its communist past and strengthened its \ndemocratic order and international position. \nHaving committed itself in its Constitution - in political and economic \nterms and in all spheres of spiritual and material development - to those \nprinciples of democracy and pluralism which also underlie the United Nations, \nCroatia has declared its openness to cooperation with all its neighbours and \nother countries in Europe and world wide. Croatia wants to be a factor of \npeace and stability in the international order in its part of the world. \n"

        "file_text": "May I first. Sir, \non behalf of my delegation and on behalf of the Government and people of \nGabon, convey to Ambassador Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria our warm congratulations \non his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its \nforty-seventh session. His personal qualities and experience in international \naffairs undoubtedly guarantee the success of our work. \nOur congratulations also go to the outgoing President, \nAmbassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, whom we thank for the dynamic and \nexemplary way in which he discharged his duties. \nTo the Secretary-General, whose recent election to head our Organization \nhonours all of Africa, we should like to reiterate our full support for \neverything he is doing to promote preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and \npeace-keeping, and particularly the peaceful advent of a new world order. His \ngreat diplomatic experience is a guarantee of the fulfilment of his commitment \nto carry out to the best of his ability his delicate and noble mission in the \nservice of the entire world community. \nFinally, we welcome all those new States which have come upon the \ninternational political scene recently. Their arrival, we are certain, will \nstrengthen the universality of our Organization and contribute to \nstrengthening the bonds of solidarity between Member States. \nSince the end of the East-West confrontation our Organization has been \ndemonstrating its ability fully to play the role assigned it by the Charter \nwhenever Member States act collectively. It has demonstrated this \nparticularly in Afghanistan, Central America, Cambodia, Kuwait and Namibia. \n \nThis solidarity should be even more effective in settling other conflicts \nwhich, regrettably, we witness elsewhere. \nAt the very opening of this session, the situation in Somalia is \nparticularly disquieting. How can we remain unmoved when we daily see on our \ntelevision screens faces bearing the imprint of war, disease and hunger? How \ncan we remain indifferent to the pain and tragedy of millions of women and \nchildren whose only aspiration is to live in peace in their own environment \nand to seek better development? \n\nIs it not indeed scandalous that in our day and age war and the use of \nforce are still the means preferred by some to settle intercommunity \nproblems? Undoubtedly, this is a challenge to our collective intelligence. \nIn Somalia, as elsewhere, in a tremendous upsurge of human solidarity we \nmust make a collective effort to put an end to the fratricidal confrontations \nin order to rebuild trust between communities linked by history and geography \nthat perforce must live in harmony. \nFor its part, and particularly in the case of Somalia, Gabon has taken \nconcrete steps along these lines. \nThis appeal equally applies to Mozambique, where natural catastrophes \nhave seriously exacerbated the complexity of a conflict on which discussions \nare now under way. In this connection the Government of Gabon very much \nvalued the meetings in Rome on 7 August and in Gabarone on 18 September \nbetween President Chissano and the leader of RENAMO, Mr. Alfonso Phlakama. \nIn another region of the continent, the situation in Liberia is also a \nmatter of grave concern. For two years now efforts to bring about peace on \nthe part of the Economic Community of West African States have encountered \nobstacles despite the presence among the belligerents of 7,000 \\\"White Helmets\\\" \nof the disengagement forces of the Economic Community of West African States \nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG). \nApart from subregional action, which is highly commendable, the United \nNations has provided welcome aid to the Liberian population. \nThe international community clearly provides the necessary means for all \nthose who, despite their own difficulties, are making a contribution to \nbringing about peace in those countries. \n \nWith respect to the situations in the Sudan, Rwanda, Niger, Mali and \nChad, the Government of Gabon will support all initiatives to bring about a \npeaceful settlement of the disputes between members of the same family. \nWith respect to the situations in the Sudan, Rwanda, Niger, Mali and \nChad, the Government of Gabon will support all initiatives to bring about a \npeaceful settlement of the disputes between members of the same family. \nIt is in this spirit that Gabon has often offered its good offices in the \nsettlement of conflicts in Africa. \nThe case of South Africa is of deepest concern to us. Indeed, the system \nof apartheid has still not disappeared from the South African political \nlandscape. To be sure, a few months ago, under unprecedented international \npressure, the Government in Pretoria committed itself to a policy of reform \ndesigned to eradicate this odious system. But for some months now we have \nbeen witnessing an intensification of violence as a means of political \nexpression. The Boipatong massacre and the Ciskei events are unfortunate \nexamples which undermine the efforts to promote dialogue, which Gabon and the \ninternational community at large so earnestly seek. \nThe promises of the South African Government gave some comfort to all \nthose who want a positive outcome to the situation in that country so that it \ncan join the comity of nations through the resumption of the Convention for a \nDemocratic South Africa (COPESA) talks. But nothing at the present time would \nallow the international community to relax its pressure nor to reduce its \nvigilance with-respect to Pretoria, particularly as our Organization, whose \nrecent initiatives deserve to be encouraged, is urgently demanding the \napplication of the principle one-man, one-vote. \n\nWith respect to the Arab-Israeli conflict, at the core of which is still \nthe question of Palestine, the new spirit now pervading international \nrelations, as well as the desire to reach a diplomatic solution voiced by the \nparties involved, are conducive to giving a fresh and lasting impetus to the \npeace process begun in Madrid in October 1991 which is currently continuing in \nWashington. \nHow can we remain indifferent to the tragedy we are witnessing in the \nformer Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina? Quite clearly, \nwhat we have here is a major challenge where humanitarian assistance, even \nwith the help of military logistics, is not sufficient. Gabon, which wishes \nto see a speedy peaceful outcome to this conflict, highly commends the leading \nrole now being played by the United Nations. \nGenerally speaking, all Member States expect our Organization to play a \ndecisive role in peace-keeping and in maintaining international security, as \nwell as in the eradication of poverty and in the struggle against famine. \nThat is why my country wholeheartedly supports the recommendations of the \nSecretary-General contained in his \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\". \nIf it is to serve its purpose the Organization must restructure its main \norgans in the light of the current international situation. To this end, the \npolitical role of the General Assembly and the supervisory functions of the \nEconomic and Social Council should be further strengthened in order to make \nthe entire United Nations system more dynamic. \nFurthermore, as President Bongo requested from this rostrum, first in \n1977, when he was President of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), and \nthen during the fortieth session of the General Assembly, the countries of the \n \nthird world should now be represented in the Security Council as permanent \nmembers, in order to make decision making at that level more democratic. \nInternational law is being completely rethought. Hallowed concepts of \nyesteryear, such as \\\"national sovereignty\\\", \\\"territorial integrity\\\" and, above \nall, \\\"non-interference in the internal affairs of States\\\", behind which the \ninternational community was finding it more and more difficult to hide its \nuneasy conscience, are now being given a new normative content. \nHence, for some years now, a new concept has appeared on the \ninternational scene, and that is the \\\"right to interference\\\". It would \nappear, a priori, to be contradictory with these very principles of \\\"national \nsovereignty\\\", \\\"territorial integrity\\\", and particularly \\\"non-interference in \nthe internal affairs of States\\\", which underlie peaceful relations among \nStates. \nBut to assure that this right is not selective or abused, its exercise \nshould be the exclusive responsibility of the United Nations. Furthermore, \ncalling into question certain of these principles is not necessarily a \nnegative step. That step should be taken whenever these principles themselves \nhave led to crises. \nIn so doing, the United Nations could acquire more extended powers, and \nhence given the appropriate means, which would enable it to exercise that \nright, if need be, without any discrimination whatsoever. \nIn his most recent report on the work of the Organization, in 1991, the \nformer Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, wrote: \n\\\"No system of collective security will remain viable unless workable \nsolutions are sought to the problem of poverty and destitution, \nafflicting the greater part of the world.\\\" (A/46/1, p. 12. VIII) \n\nThat is why United Nations action would also stand to gain if it were \nsimilarly strengthened in the economic and financial fields. In this way, it \nshould continue in the direction it has already taken in order the better to \nadapt itself to the new challenges facing mankind. \nEconomics now has a more prominent place in international relations. The \ncreation of an increasing number of subregional and regional economic \ngroupings, as well as the globalization of international trade, have turned \nour world into one immense market whose working rules should be equitable. \nThe international community very quickly realized this requirement for \ncomplementarity and solidarity when, in 1974, it established a new \ninternational economic order. \nSimilarly, multilateral organizations, such as the European Economic \nCommunity, by creating machinery to regulate world trade, have clearly \nevidenced their desire to come to the assistance of the poorer countries by \ncreating the STABEX and SYSMIN systems. \nIn the same vein, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has \nadvocated for some years now constructive negotiations between producers and \nconsumers in order to strike a better balance between world supply and \ndemand. The efforts of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development \n(UNCIAD) are along the same lines. \nIn this struggle for development, we realize that the United Nations has \ntaken a number of initiatives, the most recent of which are: the International \nDevelopment Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade, the \nUnited Nations Programme for the Economic Recovery of Africa, the Cartagena \nConsensus and the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. \n\nWe can therefore say that, generally speaking, in recent years the world \nhas progressed to some extent towards greater solidarity among all peoples. \nBut there are still serious grounds for concern. Despite the progress made on \nthe debt problem, through the so-called Toronto, Houston and London measures, \nthe question of cancelling the debts of the least developed countries, and \nconsiderably reducing them for the other developing countries, remains a \nburning issue, particularly for the so-called middle-income countries. \n\nUp to now Gabon, which falls into that category, has not benefited from \nany of these measures, whereas at the same time it has seen a sharp drop in \nits per capita income. It would be in the interests of no one, especially the \ninternational community, if the African countries were to go into a downward \nspiral of economic decline and indebtedness. Today everyone knows that the \nmeasures that have been advocated with a view to enabling our continent to \nescape from this impasse have, for the most part, proved to be inapplicable \nbecause they are inappropriate. The balance of payments of some of our \ncountries has been affected by the international monetary system, which \ninfluences international exchanges. Therefore, it is urgent that the \ninternational community give much more backing to the developing countries, so \nthat they and the African countries in particular may participate in world \ngrowth. \nAfrica, 70 per cent of whose exports consist of prime commodities, has \nbeen hard hit by the detrimental effects of the fall in the prices of those \ncommodities, and it faces economic problems in addition to that of \nindebtedness. Again, Africa has undertaken a programme of economic reform, \nwhose results because of the need simultaneously to implement political \nreforms and the desire of Governments to achieve consensus in respect of these \nprogrammes - have been very slow to emerge. \nFor all these reasons the international community should promote action \nin three directions. First, it should stabilize, at a remunerative level, the \nprices of non-petroleum products; secondly, it should readjust the \ninternational monetary system by rationalizing policy on interest and exchange \nrates; finally, it should provide a substantial increase in public aid to \nAfrican countries. In other words, we are advocating the creation and \n\nimplementation of a sort of \\\"Marshall plan\\\" for the African continent. \nGenerally speaking, the problem of combating underdevelopment is of central \nconcern to all of mankind. This is why solidarity should not be selective. \nNor should it be confined to mere declarations of intent the purpose of which \nis to ease one's conscience. It should, for example, take the form of a \nre-initiation of the process of negotiation on commodity agreements. The \nsuccess of this new form of cooperation effective solidarity between \npeoples will affect the future of our planet and facilitate improvement of \nthe human condition. \nI am quite certain that no delegation present at this meeting would like \nthe cold war to be replaced by North-South confrontation. That being the \ncase, it might seem illusory to pose certain problems albeit major problems \nconcerning the environment - if, at the same time, solutions are not proposed \nfor the benefit of those countries that have to exploit their raw materials in \na more or less intensive way. \nLet us not be hypocritical. This is a requirement for survival, as was \ndemonstrated recently at the Rio summit on the environment and, quite \nrecently, at the summit of non-aligned countries. The conditions that are \nnecessary for the preservation of the environment, which is the real heritage \nof mankind, should not be one-sided. The new concept of international law and \nthe new international order, to which I have referred already, can be reviewed \nand corrected, and should take into account the new terms of world \nequilibrium. Otherwise, economic growth and democratic development will be \njeopardized. \nDespite the acute nature of the various problems to which I have just \nreferred, our Organization has a very gratifying record in the political and \ndiplomatic fields. It should also demonstrate its ability to meet the new \n \nchallenges facing mankind today. These include the questions of the \nenvironment, AIDS and drugs. These subjects have introduced a new set of \nproblems into international thinking, and they require urgent and innovative \nsolutions. In this connection, the United Nations Conference on Environment \nand Development has proved correct the vision of solidarity of those who have \nalways felt that the well-being of nations comes from consultation rather than \nconfrontation. \nThat Conference was a striking illustration of the ill-adaptedness of the \neconomic choices imposed here and there in the world, by comparison with the \nresources available on the planet, and, I am quite certain, by comparison with \nthe real needs of our populations. The fact that this coincided with the end \nof the cold war should make development as important a concept as that of \ncollective security, which has always been one of the main concerns of the \nUnited Nations. \nUndoubtedly development was one of the main objectives that the founding \nfathers assigned to the Organization, but security needs have pushed \ninternational cooperation in this area into the background. Its reinstatement \nshould take the form of a crusade against underdevelopment. I should like to \nrefer here to the concept of sustainable development, which was mentioned at \nRio in connection with my country's rational use of its forest lands. Gabon, \nwhich has long since advanced from the stage of simple harvesting to that of \necological management of its forest lands, could not fail to adhere to the two \nconventions of Sio the conventions on biodiversity and on climatic changes. \nTherefore, we shall be very pleased to host, in Libreville in \nJanuary-February 1993, the first African meetings as a follow-up to the Rio \nConference, and we extend a cordial welcome to the representatives of \nparticipating States, and wish them a pleasant stay in Gabon. \n\nI should like to conclude my remarks by calling for more solidarity -\nsolidarity in the settlement of disputes, in international security, in \nco-operative relations between States and peoples, in relations between \ninternational financial institutions, and in relations between all our \ncountries, without discrimination. In his report on the activities of the \nOrganization the Secretary-General says: \n\\\"We need a new spirit of commonality, commitment and intellectual \ncreativity to transform a period of hope into an era of fulfilment.\\\" \n(A/47/1, para. 8) \nWe are talking here about the advent of this new international order a world \nthat is better and more human, one in which there is real solidarity. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, \nMr. President, at the outset, to express to you my sincere congratulations on \nyour election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General \nAssembly and to salute your friendly country, Bulgaria. In wishing you \nsuccess in conducting the proceedings of this session, it gives me pleasure to \nassure you of our readiness to cooperate closely with you in furthering the \nOrganization's objectives and upholding its principles at a time of rapid \nchange in the world order marked by an increasingly important role for the \nUnited Nations in addressing world problems is gaining new momentum. \nI also seize the opportunity to extend our thanks and appreciation to \nyour predecessor, Ambassador Samir Shihabi, the Permanent Representative of \nthe sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the able and judicious manner in \nwhich he guided our work as president of the forty-sixth session of the \nGeneral Assembly. \nIt is also my pleasure to voice our appreciation of the efforts of \nHis Excellency Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United \nNations during the short period since he took office, both in restructuring \nthe Organization and in strengthening its role in the maintenance of world \npeace and security. \nIt is gratifying indeed to witness the emergence, this year, of a large \nnumber of independent States and their accession to membership of the United \nNations. The emergence of those thirteen States, is telling proof of the \nstrength of their people's nationalist sentiments and aspirations, which have \nsurged with the end of the cold war. My country's delegation has the pleasure \nto welcome the new Member States. We are convinced that they will contribute \nconstructively to the enhancement of the United Nations role and the \nfurtherance of its goals and objectives. \nThis session is convened at a time the likes of which the world \nOrganization has rarely witnessed throughout its history. The winds of change \nhave swept away the very foundations of an international system which, for \nnearly half a century, was based on the foundation of the cold war's \nprecarious balance of power. The ideological barrier between East and West \nhas been brought down and, with it, the strategies of nuclear deterrence upon \nwhich the leaders of the bipolar world political order depended throughout the \npost-Second World War era. \nOur world today is in a state of flux. It is emerging from a past that \nis now collapsing under our eyes and is moving towards a future that has not \ntaken shape yet. Intimations of that future are being brought home to us on \nthe crests of mighty waves and the winds of heavy storms that have brought \ndown the Berlin wall, caused the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the \n\ndismantling of the Soviet Union side by side with the many developments and \nconflicts we now witness on the international arena. \nAlthough the features of the new world order broke forth sharply in waves \nof violent and profound transformations, the winds of change have not been \nable to uproot the problems of the cold war. For in the wake of the fall of \ncertain States, there was the eruption of severe national and ethnic disputes \non which the lid had been kept by the bipolar balance of power. Scrutiny of \nthe changes witnessed by the world today clearly reveals that the threads of \npast and present are interwoven even though developments are taking place so \nfast towards the creation of a delicate and precarious balance between the \nstatus quo and change as the new world order unfolds. \nThe gap between the realities of the present and forecasts of the future \nis engulfed in ambiguity and uncertainty at this historic juncture which we \nwatch with apprehension and with hope and expectation, for it is our \naspiration that man will finally achieve on this planet what he failed to \nachieve during the cold-war-era. It behooves us to watch out for developments \nand be prepared for them in a manner conducive to the creation of a climate in \nwhich the rights of States, both small and large, are safeguarded, their \nsecurity strengthened and a role ensured for each and every one of them in \ndetermining the future course of humanity. Therefore, we should all endeavour \nto come to grips with the world in this new stage and identify the role each \nof us should play in the formulation of that world's features and the laying \nof its foundations. Without such a collective partnership on the part of all \nmembers of the international community, the world will continue to lack \nequilibrium and stability and remain vulnerable to upheavals and setbacks that \ncould undermine the very foundations of the future. \n\nIn the context of those international changes, the United Nations has \nbeen able to regain some of its vitality and effectiveness in the \ninternational arena over the past few years. It has exerted commendable \nefforts to end the Iraq/Iran war, bring about the liberation of Kuwait, solve \nthe problem of Afghanistan and bring about the independence of Namibia. Its \nefforts continue in connection with the questions of Western Sahara, Cyprus, \nCambodia, El Salvador, South Africa, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia. \nThe future role of the United Nations should be one that rises to the \nlevel of contemporary international challenges so that the Organization may be \nable to influence the course of international politics and deal with \ntransformations that involve interaction of regional and international factors \nand controversies. Consequently, it is our view that the role of the United \nNations should evolve to embrace the following three major tasks: \nFirst, the creation of an advanced mechanism that would enable the United \nNations to carry out the tasks of achieving international peace and security \nin a manner that would be compatible with transformations in the international \narena; \nSecondly, the creation of a modus operandi for cooperation between the \nUnited Nations and regional organizations in the maintenance of international \npeace and security, the peaceful settlement of international disputes and \nrespect for States' sovereignty and territorial integrity; \nThirdly, adequate development of the role of the United Nations in \ndealing with world problems that constitute a common concern for the \ninternational community as a whole and are sources of anxiety to people \nthroughout the world, such as the problems of development, the environment, \nrefugees, famine, poverty and a host of other international questions. \n\nThe question of world peace and security with its economic and social \nroots has given rise to a new multifaceted vision of international security. \nUndoubtedly, the overlapping and intertwining of such issues require serious \naction on our part to coordinate policies and develop programmes for United \nNations organs so that they may be able to meet changing world needs. \nIn response to the recommendation by the Security Council in its meeting \nat the level of Heads of State and Government, held on 31 January 1992, the \nSecretary-General of the United Nations presented his report \\\"An Agenda for \nPeace\\\". It contains important recommendations and ideas that aim at \ndeveloping the international Organization's political performance through \npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping. The concept of \npreventive diplomacy is a new strategy based on good forecasting and early \nintervention by the United Nations to prevent the eruption of conflicts and to \nprevent the escalation to the level of hostilities of existing conflicts. \nIn this context, we should like to commend the role played by United \nNations peace-keeping operations, a role that has proved to be effective in \ncontaining conflicts, defusing tensions and maintaining peace in various \nregions of the world. Since 1987, 13 peace-keeping operations have been \nundertaken. It is incumbent upon the international community, especially now, \nto bolster and enhance the United Nations financial and operational capability \nin this field so that it may be able to maintain its leadership in \npeace-keeping, bearing in mind that the cooperation of States Members of the \nUnited Nations is the key factor that would enable those forces to achieve \ntheir objectives and the only guarantee that they will be able to do so. \n\nPeacemaking, peace-keeping, and preventive diplomacy are undoubtedly \ninterrelated and mutually complementary. We believe that the concept of \npost-conflict peace-building introduced by the Secretary-General, together \nwith the preceding concepts, form an important stanchion of the Organization's \nfuture role in the area of promoting peaceful solutions and preventing the \nrecurrence of conflicts. In this context, the United Nations can cooperate \nwith and benefit from the potential and abilities of regional organizations \nand arrangements in the peaceful resolution of disputes among Member States, \nbearing in mind that most of the disputes that threaten international peace \nand security are of a regional nature. \nThe role of regional organizations in peace-keeping is consonant with the \nobjectives of the United Nations Charter. It is also called for by current \ninternational developments. And yet, for four decades now, the United Nations \nhas not been able to benefit from the capabilities of regional organizations \nbecause of the cold war. That cooperation is of singular importance. Its \nimportance is highlighted now by the aggravation of discord in parts of \nEastern Europe and other parts of the world under the influence of ethnic \nsentiments, territorial claims and border disputes. It is in this area that \nthe United Nations, in cooperation with the appropriate regional \norganizations, could use the tool of preventive diplomacy to prevent the \neruption of tragic ethnic conflicts, futile border hostilities, the occupation \nby force of other peoples' territories, or the changing of existing boundaries. \nIn concert with the principles and objectives which we seek to \nconsolidate within the framework of the United Nations, our responsibility \nlies in maintaining the momentum generated by the new international climate of \nrespect for international legality with a view to achieving stability in \n\nsensitive regional situations, foremost among which is that in the Gulf area. \nIn this respect, the State of Bahrain reiterates its demand that United \nNations resolutions relating to the situation between Iraq and Kuwait be \ncomplied with. \nThe State of Bahrain has been following with deep concern the recent \nunfortunate developments in the Gulf area as a result of the actions by the \nIslamic Republic of Iran on the island of Abu Mousa. While we emphasize the \nsovereignty and territorial rights of the United Arab Emirates, our adherence \nto the good-neighbourliness principle and our desire to avoid any further \ntensions in the area, we call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to abide by \nthe memorandum of understanding it has signed with the United Arab Emirates. \nFor the past several years, international relations have undergone \nenormous transformations in the political and economic fields that herald a \npattern of new economic cooperation among countries. There are expectations \nthat with the end of confrontation between the two super-Powers, the world \nwill enter an era of fruitful cooperation between States. Yet an escalation \nof the confrontation in the economic arena, a widening of the gap between the \nNorth and South, and the prevalence of extreme poverty in a number of \ndeveloping countries continue to endanger world security and stability. \nPeace and development are the most important foundations of our \ncivilization at present. It is therefore incumbent upon the United Nations, \nwhich has had about half a century of experience in international \norganization, to undertake side by side with the task of peace-keeping, the \ntask of promoting development in the developing countries. The United Nations \nis qualified to be the forum for the elaboration of international development \nstrategies and the provision of appropriate political impetus for a number of \n\nsuch interrelated economic issues as the problems of debt, the transfer of \ntechnology, trade, finance, commodities, and the environment. It is thus \nessential to reactivate the role of the United Nations in the field of \neconomic development for the peoples of the world. Although the United \nNations designated the 1970s and the 1980s as the second and third Decades for \ndevelopment, it has failed to achieve the objectives thereof due to lack of \nfunds to finance the plan. \nIf rich industrial countries are to fulfil their global responsibilities, \nthey ought to respond to the needs of developing countries in terms of \ndevelopment assistance so that the cold war between the East and West may not \nbe replaced by another cold war between the North and South or, as the \nSecretary-General put it, so as not to erect an iron curtain between the North \nand South similar to the one that used to exist between the East and West. \nIn the light of this situation, the State of Bahrain, as a member of the \nEconomic and Social Council, a major organ of the United Nations, believes \nthat the Council's role should be reinvigorated if it is to fulfil its mandate \nas provided for in Article 65 of the Charter, and if it is to furnish the \nSecurity Council with comprehensive reports on the economic situations in the \nworld's different countries. It is clear that if such situations were left to \nfester and deteriorate, they may indirectly threaten international peace and \nsecurity. \nA number of important international conferences have been held this year, \nmost significant of which \u00ac\u00aaere the Eighth United Nations Conference on Trade \nand Development held in Colombia, and the United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development which was held in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and \nwhich culminated in the issuance of the Rio Declaration, Agenda 21, and other \n\ninternational agreements relating to environment and development. The Rio \nDeclaration, with its 27 principles, recognizes the integral interrelated \ncharacter of the Earth and links sustainable development to environmental \nprotection. Agenda 21 reflects a global consensus on cooperation in the areas \nof environment and development and aims at addressing urgent problems in that \nrespect and at equipping the world with the means to rise to the challenges of \nthe next century. \nThe fact that these two Conference were held in relatively quick \nsuccession demonstrates the enormous capability of the United Nations to \nconduct political dialogue in the areas of development and international \neconomic cooperation. In order for the United Nations role to be strengthened \nin that respect. Member States should provide the Organization with the \nwherewithal to enable it fully to perform its mandated tasks. For \nwherewithal, read: the political will. \nIn the midst of international transformations, many peoples look forward \nto a secure future for themselves and for their future generations. I must \nvoice here the hope of my delegation that peace may prevail in the Middle \nEast. We welcome the signs that may lead to a just settlement of the question \nof Palestine in particular and of the Middle East conflict in general. The \nrounds of talks, which started in Madrid late in October 1991, have vividly \ndemonstrated the earnest nature of Arab positions and the commitment of Arab \nnegotiators to achieving a comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East on \nthe basis of the land-for-peace formula in accordance with Security Council \nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and other relevant United Nations \nresolutions. \n\nIt is imperative to intensify international efforts to induce Israel to \nforswear its policies of expansion and settlement-building in the occupied \nArab territories, to recognize the inalienable rights of the Palestinian \npeople, to withdraw from the Syrian Golan Heights, to withdraw from southern \nLebanon in accordance with Security Council resolution 425 (1978), and to \nrespond to all constructive disarmament proposals which, if implemented, could \nbring about parity in military capabilities qualitatively and quantitatively \nand ensure security through equal commitments applicable to all Middle East \nStates, including Israel. \nIn this connection, I would like to reiterate our support for freeing the \nMiddle East region from all weapons of mass destruction, and reaffirm our \nreadiness to deal with the proposed convention on the prohibition of chemical \nweapons, to the extent that other States in the region are willing to respond \nto international demands by acceding to that convention, to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to the international system of \nsafeguards and inspections on the basis of equity and equality, in the \ninterests of the security of all States of the region without discrimination. \nThe human tragedy that has befallen the Somali people, and the \ndegradation of their human dignity, call for immediate mobilization of the \nconcerted efforts of the international community to put an end to that \ntragedy. Medical assistance and food supplies should be provided urgently to \nsave the Somali people from their painful plight. We welcome the United \nNations efforts in Somalia, and are of the opinion that an appropriate \npolitical mechanism should be created to put an end to the bloodshed, to \neffect national reconciliation, to eliminate the causes of strife between the \nwarring factions and to help achieve security and stability in Somalia. \n\nWe also wish to express our deep concern over the tragic situation in \nBosnia and Herzegovina, whose people are the targets of mass annihilation and \nhuman-rights violations. At a time when the world looks forward to the \nemergence of a new world order in which peace and security would prevail, we \nbelieve the United Nations is duty-bound to act resolutely to put an end to \nthis tragic situation and to preserve the integrity of the Republic of Bosnia \nand Herzegovina, a State Member of the United Nations. \nSouth Africa, which is going through a delicate phase of its history, \nrequires special attention on the part of the international community. \nDespite the positive reforms initiated last year by the Pretoria Government \nwith a view to drawing up a new constitution for South Africa, it is urgent \nthat apartheid be completely eradicated by means of constitutional reforms \nguaranteeing the participation of the majority of the people of South Africa \nin building a non-racial State. In that connection, we support United Nations \nefforts to put an end to violence and to help create favourable conditions for \nnegotiations on transforming South Africa into a non-racial, unitary State. \nThe Cyprus problem has eluded solution for a long time. However, there \nhave been signs recently that may lead to a solution. We welcome the new \npositive movements as well as the Secretary-General's efforts in that \ndirection. \nThe peoples of the world look forward with full confidence to a new world \nin which security and prosperity prevail. Yet, despite our hopes for the \nfuture, threats to the human race and the environment abound. Unless we all \nwork to overcome those threats and to address their causes, we will be opening \na Pandora's box, releasing all its evils while leaving hope locked inside. \n\nThe success of the United Nations in dealing with the new challenges will \ndepend on its ability to build confidence among nations and, with the help of \na broad creative vision, to mobilize efforts, resources and knowledge with a \nview to bringing them to bear on the transformation of world society into a \nsociety in which real security, peace, tranquility and equality may prevail. \nIf we may liken the desired world order to a ship, then peace, security \nand economic development are the canvas of which its sails are made; \ninternational legality is its pennant; and only through stability can it sail \nto safety. It behoves us to work together in weaving the yarn to make the \ncanvas of the sails, and to steer our ship toward a secure future for all our \npeoples. \n"

        "file_text": " I am pleased to extend to you. Sir, and to your \ncountry, Bulgaria, the sincere congratulations of my delegation on your \nelection to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly. I have no doubt that under your able leadership this \nsession will be a great success. \nIn the short space of time since he assumed office at the beginning of \nthe year, our new Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has more than \njustified the confidence reposed in him and his prodigious qualities and \nabilities by his election to the highly demanding office of \nSecretary-General. He has been, during these nine turbulent months, more than \na match for the daunting crises that have so far characterized the so-called \nnew world order. We salute him and his equally dedicated colleagues in the \nSecretariat. \nThe forty-seventh session of the General Assembly is being held at a rare \nmoment in history. It is a moment so brilliantly captured in the language of \nArticle 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, wherein are written \nthese words: \n\\\"The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of \ngovernment; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine \nelections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage ...\\\". \n(resolution 217 A (III), article 21, para. 3) \nPeoples across the globe are marching triumphantly to seize control of \ntheir own destinies through the ballot. This has been clearly manifested in \nthe admission of seven new Members during the forty-sixth regular session of \nthe General Assembly and many more at its resumed meetings. The membership of \nthose new States enhances the universality of the United Nations. We warmly \nwelcome their presence in our midst. \nThe end of the cold war has triggered an avalanche of demands on the \nUnited Nations at a time when the Organization is tottering on the verge of \nbankruptcy. The Organization is being called upon to be everywhere where \nthere is a problem and to carry out activities ranging from peace-keeping and \npeacemaking in areas ravaged by civil wars to fighting natural disasters. It \nis also required to play a role in areas where democracy is being embraced. \nThe financing of both the United Nations activities under its regular \nbudget and its peace-keeping operations has never been more crucial to the \nrole and function of the Organization. For many years the Organization was \nparalysed by ideological confrontation, and it is unfortunate that it should \nnow be hamstrung in the performance of its functions by financial emergency \nand crisis in an era when there is so much good will. \nThe issue is simple: the machinery of the United Nations cannot be \nexpected to function effectively and efficiently when it has run out of \nfinancial steam. We can all bear testimony to the success of the United \nNations system when there is a common desire and will to put the system to \nwork. The assessed contributions have to be paid in full and on time, in \naccordance with the Charter. All arrears have to be paid as a demonstration \nof our commitment to the process of renewal and revitalization currently going \non in the world and within the United Nations itself. \nBotswana has followed with grave concern the tragic events in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, the senseless killing and brutality visited on innocent men, \nwomen and children. It is indeed unfortunate that while many States in \nEastern and Central Europe have experienced relatively peaceful transitions to \ndemocracy and political pluralism, the people of the former Yugoslavia, the \nfounding champion and leader of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, should \nbe bleeding so hopelessly. Yugoslavia was a critical factor for stability in \nCentral Europe during the lark days of super-Power rivalry and military \nconfrontation. \nHowever, we cannot be distracted from present reality by the past. The \ninternational community has been rightfully outraged by acts of barbarism in a \nworld increasingly characterized by civilized conduct in inter-State \nrelations. The agreements reached at the London Conference, which enjoy the \noverwhelming approbation of the international community, must be implemented \nin full by all the parties involved in the brutal conflict. No effort should \nbe spared in ensuring the restoration of lasting peace in the Balkans. \nIn South-East Asia, the brave and courageous men and women of the United \nNations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) continue to work quietly \nand tirelessly to bring about peace and stability in that country. It is \nhoped that all parties to the Agreement on a Comprehensive Political \nSettlement of the Cambodia Conflict will honour their obligations. The people \nof Cambodia have long awaited the day when they can return to their homes, \nwalk in the streets and till the soil without fear of land mines. \nThe implementation of the peace agreement is a monumental task the likes \nof which this world body has never before undertaken. It is vitally important \nthat the efforts of the United Nations succeed in timely and effective \nfashion. A situation in which the United Nations Transitional Authority in \nCambodia (UNTAC) might be marooned in Cambodia, with the financial burden that \nwould entail, must be avoided at all cost. \nThe Middle East peace talks which opened in Washington, D.C., on \n24 August 1992 and which have now been suspended have given us cause for \noptimism. The atmosphere which has been created at the talks augurs well for \nserious negotiations for a comprehensive political settlement. We fully \nsupport the process under jay and encourage the parties to the negotiations to \nensure that this historic opportunity is not squandered. \nIn Afghanistan, it is our sincere hope that the establishment of a \ntransitional Government will silence the guns, which for 14 years wreaked \ndeath, misery and disaster on innocent civilians and on belligerents alike. \nThe international community, in particular those Member States that have \nstrong ties with the parties to the conflict, should bring maximum pressure to \nbear on the parties to refrain from resorting to the use of force in settling \ntheir differences. \nIn Somalia, a human tragedy of unspeakable dimensions is unfolding before \nour very eyes. According to a report of the Secretary-General contained in \ndocument S/24480 of 24 August 1992, famine threatens the lives of 4.5 million \npeople. On a daily basis, many are dying a slow and painful death. It is \nregrettable that the response of the international community was painfully \nslow at the beginning of the tragedy. However, there were, and there continue \nto be, men and women whose devotion to humanitarian service and reverence for \nhuman life are unparalleled in their quality and dimension. The International \nRed Cross was there when no one else was. Its dedication to alleviating human \nsuffering is truly extraordinary. The great son of a Lutheran pastor and 1952 \nNobel Peace Prize laureate. Dr. Albert Schweitzer, once said \n\\\"There is no higher religion than human service. To work for the common \ngood is the greatest creed.\\\" \nThe Red Cross deserves our gratitude and commendation. \nIn equal measure, we commend the efforts of the Secretary-General in \nsecuring the agreement and approbation of the parties to the conflict, in the \nface of immense difficulties, so that humanitarian assistance could reach the \nsuffering people. We also welcome the decision of the Security Council to \ndeploy an additional 3,000 observers in Somalia. \nIn South Africa, at the time of their suspension three difficult months \nago, the negotiations conducted within the framework of the Convention for a \nDemocratic South Africa (CODESA) had undeniably achieved positive results. A \nsubstantial degree of consensus had been achieved within a relatively short \ntime, considering that less than two years ago the apartheid edifice was still \nvery much intact, barely shaken, and prospects for change in South Africa were \nas bleak as they could be. Now, we have seen what the three-month hiatus has \nwrought more massacres as brutal at that at Boipatong, which caused the \nbreak-up of the negotiations in June. The recent one at Bisho in the \nBantustan of Ciskei, however, seems to have had a sobering effect on the South \nAfrican leaders. If anything at all, these massacres have shown that \nnegotiations are the only hope for South Africa, and it is with a sigh of \nrelief that we welcome the resumption of the negotiation process. \nWe welcome the keen interest the world community has shown in the South \nAfrican crisis, as evidenced by the adoption by the Security Council of \nresolution 772 (1992) of 17 August 1992. The involvement of the international \ncommunity in the process of change in South Africa is a very crucial element. \nIt is our sincere hope that the United Nations observers mentioned in \noperative paragraph 4 of that Security Council resolution- will be deployed in \nfull and kept in place throughout the process of negotiation, or as long as it \nis deemed necessary and vital to keep them there. \nProgress, if any, towards the resolution of the Western Sahara issue has \nbeen too slow, to say the least. The people of Western Sahara should be given \nthe opportunity to exercise their right to national self-determination freely \nand fairly under international supervision. No obstacles should be placed in \nthe way of the settlement plan. \nRecent developments in Angola and Mozambique mark the dawn of a new era \nin southern Africa. A situation of peace and stability is now gaining \nmomentum. The signing of the General Peace Agreement by the President of \nMozambique, Mr. Joaquim Chissano, and by the leader of RENAMO, \nMr. Afonso Dhlakama, is a major development in the process of bringing peace \nto Mozambique. Botswana contributed in its small way to the process, and I \nhad the honour to witness the signing of the Agreement in Rome on 4 October. \nI hope that the international community will extend political, diplomatic and \nmoral support to Mozambique in order to ensure that the Agreement is \ntranslated into solid peace. Millions of Mozambicans face starvation and \ndeath because of the war and drought. The signing of the General Peace \nAgreement opens the door for the United Nations agencies and other \ninternational relief agencies, and the international community as a whole, to \nalleviate the suffering of the people of Mozambique, as well as to assist with \nthe means to reconstruct their country. \nFor the first time since it acceded to independence in 1975, Angola held \nmultiparty elections last week. The high turn-out for the elections indicates \nthe readiness of the Angolan people to use the ballot rather than the bullet \nto resolve their differences. I hope that this high turn-out, coupled with \nfree and fair elections, will bestow legitimacy on the new Government. What \nis of paramount importance however, is the agreement made by the Popular \nMovement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the Union for the Total \nLiberation of Angola (UNITA) to form a Government of national unity \nirrespective of whichever party wins the elections. \nThis is the second time the United Nations has successfully supervised \nmultiparty elections in southern Africa. The role of the United Nations in \nthe peace process in Angola is therefore truly commendable. \nThere is an intricate relationship between peace and security and \neconomic and social development. There can be no doubt that the problems of \npoverty, unemployment, huge foreign debt, budget deficits, lack of market \naccess, high interest rates and the environment are not the problems of any \none country or group of countries. No one country can solve them in isolation. \nThe macroeconomic management of the global economy should now be guided \nby the need to serve common interests. There should be an end to the \nperception of problems as being exclusively those of the North or of the \nSouth. A new approach is required, one that will identify the common problems \nof humanity and build on the consensus. We should put an end to mutual \ndistrust, and move away from perceiving the economic concerns of countries as \nbeing mutually exclusive and permanently at loggerheads. This is not a \nzero-sum game. \nThe lessons of our recent past should guide us. The world was united in \nits opposition to aggression against Kuwait, and concerted efforts were made \nto mobilize resources in support of the countries of Eastern Europe and the \nCommonwealth of Independent States; all of this showed an acceptance of the \nvalidity of the concepts of interdependence, partnership and the \\\"global \nvillage.\\\" \nIn 1993 a World Conference on Human Rights will be held, followed by the \n1994 Conference on Population and Development. And in 1995, as the United \nNations celebrates its golden jubilee, the World Conference on Women will take \nplace. This attests to the fact that these are shared human problems and \ntherefore require our collective endeavours. There should be a move away from \nthe temptation to accord the highest priority to human rights and democracy, \nto the detriment of other areas of primary concern. It serves no useful \npurpose to have priorities based solely on political considerations and what \nare perceived as strategic national interests. \nDemocracy is threatened when the legitimate expectations of the people \nare frustrated by economic deprivation. In this regard, we strongly support \nthe proposal to convene a world summit for social development in 1995. It is \nour fervent hope that a consensus decision will be reached on this matter of \ncritical importance to the world as a whole. The Summit should afford the \ninternational community the opportunity to address in an integrated manner the \nproblems of poverty, illiteracy, disease, unemployment and poor living \nconditions. \nThe economic situation in Africa is still bleak. Africa continues to \nexperience a crushing debt burden, falling commodity prices and painful \nstructural adjustment programmes. The economies of many African countries \nhave stagnated or retrogressed during the past year. The African economic \ncrisis is a development challenge to mankind's collective conscience. \nConcerted efforts should be made to translate the United Nations New Agenda \nfor Africa into concrete programmes and projects that can put our continent on \nthe path to economic recovery and development. The Global Coalition for \nAfrica (GCA), which I have the honour to co-chair on behalf of Africa, has \nmade a significant contribution to the new consensus-building process since \nits inception in Maastricht in 1990. As a forum that brings together, at the \nhighest level, policy makers from Africa and its international partners, the \nGCA has great potential in the search for solutions to Africa's most critical \ndevelopment issues. \nThe GCA is a forum for equal engagement, for openness to policy decisions \nand for great seriousness. Our partnership with the North requires our most \ndetermined leadership. It is important that the GCA be Africa-driven, and it \nis in the interest of Africa to have a forum based on equal partnership. \nAs Chairman of the former Southern African Development Coordination \nConference (SADCC), I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the member States \nrecently signed in Windhoek, Namibia, a Treaty and Protocol establishing the \nSouthern African Development Community (SADC). This historic development is \npart of the overall efforts of the countries of the subregion to enhance and \nintensify inter-regional cooperation. \nSADCC had been in existence for 12 years as a loose arrangement between \nmembers. Those very fruitful years armed us with the courage, wisdom and \nexperience to transform the loose arrangement that was the SADCC into the \nformal entity that is the SADC. The establishment of SADC is part and parcel \nof continental efforts to create an African economic community; it is without \na doubt one of the community's building blocks. \nThe establishment of SADC takes place against the backdrop of a serious \ndrought crisis ravaging southern Africa. The response of the international \ncommunity has been very positive, but the magnitude of the crisis is \ndaunting. The scope and extent of its impact continue to unfold, \nnecessitating a revised estimation of the resources needed to alleviate the \nplight of the most seriously affected populations. We appeal to the members \nof the international donor community who have not yet done so to convert their \npledges into concrete contributions to avert a human tragedy. \nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development adopted a \nnumber of important decisions which are now before the General Assembly for \nfollow-up and implementation. We attach the utmost importance to the Rio \nDeclaration on Environment and Development and the Programme of Action \noutlined in Agenda 21. In this regard, we fully support the recommendation to \nthe General Assembly on the establishment of a high-level commission on \nsustainable development. The Rio Summit was the beginning of a process which \nshould now find concrete expression in the form of the commitment by Member \nStates to honour their obligations. Of particular importance is the need for \nresources to implement Agenda 21. \nDrought and desertification threaten the economic prospects of many \ndeveloping countries. It is imperative that urgent measures be taken to find \nan integrated solution to the problem. We strongly believe that this can be \ndone within the framework of negotiations on a convention on desertification. \nThis is a matter of critical importance to many African States, and a positive \ndecision will contribute substantially to the search for solutions to the \neconomic malaise facing our continent. \nI should like to conclude by reaffirming Botswana's abiding faith in the \nUnited Nations and its Charter. We are ready to play our part in our common \nendeavour to strengthen the Organization to enable it to face the challenges \nof the twenty-first century. "

        "file_text": "Allow \nme, Sir, to congratulate Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its forty-seventh session and to assure him that he will \nhave the full cooperation of my delegation in the discharge of his important \ntask. \nI should like also to congratulate Mr. Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia on \nthe efficient manner in which he discharged his duties as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its forty-sixth session. \nI extend fraternal and cordial greetings to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, \nwho, as Secretary-General, has headed the Organization since the beginning of \nthe year. We realize that during this initial stage he has had a difficult \ntask. He has undertaken the job of restructuring and reforming the system to \nadapt the Organization to the new international context. \nIn this joint effort, in which mankind has placed its highest hopes for a \nbetter and more just future, it is positive and comforting to have new friends \nin our midst. In that spirit, I extend the warmest welcome to the nations \nthat joined the Organization this year. Guatemala offers them its friendship, \nrespect, solidarity and cooperation. \nThe nations of the world are gathered in this forum with mixed feelings \nof uncertainty and hope uncertainty because, following the dramatic changes \nin the international order, we find ourselves on the eve of a new era, whose \nfundamental features have yet to be defined; hope because, despite a history \nof sterile confrontations, an opportunity is opening up for a just and \nequitable international order in which cooperation between nations would be \ngeared to the solution of the fundamental problems of the international \ncommunity: extreme poverty, sustainable development, peace, security and the \nenvironment. \n\nWe Guatemalans view these changes with great hope, and we fully \nunderstand their historic implications, as our country too is involved in a \nfar-reaching and ambitious process of transformation, which we trust will \npositively change the course of our history. Guatemala is making great \nefforts to overcome the confrontation that, for years, has riven our society \nand afflicted thousands of Guatemalan families. \nOthers took advantage of the problems of our political and economic \ndevelopment to transplant their hostilities to our soil. Therefore, for more \nthan 30 years our country was involved in foreign and alien confrontation that \nleft only suffering in its wake and led to neglect of the central problems of \nour society. \nAs a small country, Guatemala suffered from the ups and downs of an \ninternational system based on ideological confrontation. As was the case on a \nworld-wide scale, economic resources necessary to give impetus to the process \nof our people's socio-economic well-being were earmarked to finance a sterile \nand cruel confrontation. The attention of the various sectors of our society \nwas distracted from genuine questions of development and obfuscated by an \nideological polemic whose outcome was violence and stagnation. Problems of \nhunger, education, social well-being, health and poverty are among those that \nwere left unattended and unsolved throughout these irretrievably lost \ndecades. \nThe whole Central American region found itself in a similar situation \nso much so that it became the focus of international attention as a result of \ninternal armed clashes and military tensions. As a region, however, we have \nbeen able to take our historic destiny in hand and, by an approach that we \nourselves designed, often in the face of the scepticism of people who thought \n\nus unable to solve our problems other than on the basis of external formulas, \nhave managed to overcome the spiral of violence and, at the same time, \ninitiate a process of democratization and pacification, which is now bearing \nfruit and is transforming our nations with the promise of a better future for \nour peoples. \nAs Central Americans, we Guatemalans are aware that the challenge of our \nfuture is entirely in our own hands. The process of democratization, begun \nsome years ago, is the start of a much broader process one aimed at \ntransforming our social, economic and cultural structures and at securing the \nwell-being of all Guatemalans. The effort that is needed to generate a \nprocess of overall improvement in the standards of living of our people \nrequires that the funds used for armed confrontation be reallocated for social \ninvestment. \nPresident Serrano Elias Lanzo, at the beginning of his administration in \n1991, launched a peace plan for the whole nation, conscious of the fact that \nprogress towards democratization of the country is the only means of achieving \neven higher goals. Under this plan, peace is conceived of as a source of the \nbasic conditions that will allow for the harmonious development of the \nindividual in society and for peaceful and respectful coexistence between \npeople, rather than simply as the absence of violence or the ending of \ninternal armed confrontation. \nIn this framework, the Government of the Republic has begun a dialogue \nwith the URNG with the air.i of securing an end to the internal conflict and of \ninvolving the groups taking part in it so that, within the constitutional \nframework of the State's laws, they will renounce the use of arms and \nparticipate in the political life of the country in a constructive rather than \na destructive manner. \n\nUnfortunately, the pace of the initial talks was slowed by unconstructive \nattitudes on the part of the representatives of the insurgents, attitudes that \ncan be understood only as an attempt artificially to delay the peace process \nand thus to gain special benefits not justified by the realities on the \nground. The Government's goodwill has been shown by its acceptance of an \nagreement on human rights proposed by the conciliator who presides over the \nNational Commission for the Reconciliation of Guatemala. The insurgents have \nnot accepted this proposal. \nThe Government of Guatemala deplores and rejects this delaying approach \nwhich results in unnecessary prolongation of the sufferings of Guatemalans and \nlimits the possibilities of action by the Government to deal with the real \nproblems of the people who elected it. We appeal to the international \ncommunity to condemn these delaying tactics, support the continuation of \nnegotiations and appeal to the insurgents to adopt a positive and realistic \nattitude. \nThe Government of the Republic trusts that in the next meetings with the \nmediation of the Conciliator and the participation of the Personal \nRepresentative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, these obstacles \nwill be overcome and the talks will continue in order soon to reach the \ncomplete peace for which all Guatemalans yearn. \nThe transformation of Guatemalan society, however, goes well beyond \nputting an end to internal armed confrontation. For this reason my Government \nhas developed important initiatives aimed at substantively modifying some of \nthe structures of our society. Central to these efforts is the decision to \nput on a solid footing a State where the rule of law is paramount, \nguaranteeing the effective administration of justice for all citizens, without \ndiscrimination. \n\nA renewed and revitalized State under the rule of law, guaranteeing fully \neffective human rights, is the central aim of the Administration of \nPresident Serrano Elias. In that context, important achievements have been \nmade, perhaps the most important being the restoration, through a struggle \nagainst impunity, of the individual's trust in democratic institutions. \nThe Government is aware that much remains to be done in order to ensure \nfully effective human rights, but we believe that it must be recognized that \nover the past two years important advances have been made in this respect. \nAt the same time, significant efforts are being made to create conditions \nthat will permit the return to their homeland of refugees who have gone to \nother countries, fleeing the violence that affected their population groups in \nthe past. The National Peace Fund (FONAPAZ) and the National Land Fund \n(FONATIERRA), both created by the present Government, are participating \njointly with the Special Commission for Refugees, Returnees and Displaced \nPersons (CEAR) in creating conditions appropriate not only for the return of \nrefugees but also for the effective reintegration of returnees and displaced \npersons into society, providing them with conditions to engage in productive \nactivity that will allow for their social and human development. \nI have taken the liberty of drawing attention to some of the important \naspects of my country's internal politics in order to give the background to \nthe points that I shall now make concerning the international scene and our \nforeign policy. \nGuatemala has followed with close attention the important world \ndevelopments of recent years. We are certainly witnessing the formation of a \nnew international order, which springs from the ashes of a confrontational and \nbipolar world. We should take advantage of the new international environment \n\nto seek peaceful solutions to conflicts and confrontations that still persist, \nand thus allow the Governments concerned to apply to development and peace \nresources formerly earmarked for financing those confrontations. \nAt the same time the dividends of world peace should be channelled to \ninvestment for the social well-being of peoples. Nuclear disarmament, a major \ngoal in itself, should also be used to generate a surplus with which to \nfinance programmes to resolve the most serious world problems hunger, \ndisease, illiteracy and poverty. The new climate of confidence among nations \nand new patterns of global security should be based not only on an absence of \nimmediate military threats, but on real efforts to resolve the central \nproblems of mankind. \nMore than ever before, we have a historic opportunity today to make \nsignificant advances towards the creation of a truly just world order, based \non cooperation, not domination. To achieve this, however, we need above all \nto recognize the errors affecting the international system and to establish \nnew rules permitting truly harmonious coexistence. \nIt is necessary to carry out promptly an exhaustive, in-depth revision of \nrelations between the developed and the developing nations. There are \nenormous imbalances which if present trends continue will lead to a deepening \ngap between the two. \nThe industrialized countries and the developing countries must jointly \nagree on an agenda of matters that should be given priority attention by the \ninternational community and discuss and explore machinery and methods that \nwill allow us better to face the challenge of development in all its aspects. \nThe World Summit for Social Development gives us the opportunity to discuss \nthese problems at the highest level. \n\nMultilateralism has taken on a renewed and vigorous impetus in the task \nof building a new world order. The importance of multilateral forums as \ncentres of discussion, analysis and the adoption of generalized policies for \nthe international system is a significant opportunity for developing nations \nto participate actively in the process of constituting the new rules of the \ninternational system. \nThe experience gained in organizing approaches that allowed us to \nformulate proposals and present our interests to the industrialized nations, \nat a time when ideological confrontation relegated our countries' fundamental \nproblems to the background, should be used to advantage today to ensure that \nthe international agenda suitably reflects our interests and needs. \nHowever, those interests and perspectives will be reflected in \ninternational forums only to the degree that we fight for it. To that end, \nSouth-South cooperation is a fundamental vehicle and the efforts to achieve \ncoordination between developing nations should be stepped up. \nIn Guatemala's view, the world order that emerges from the \ntransformations under way should be built upon deep respect for the norms and \nprinciples of international law. The possibility of harmonious, stable \ncoexistence between the nations of the world depends on unconditional respect \nfor States' sovereignty, independence and equality before the law. Therefore, \nthe international community must reject any State's attempt to extend the \napplication of its own law5 beyond its own borders. \nWithin the context of the emerging world order, encouraging efforts are \nnow under way to reach a peaceful settlement of the Middle East conflict. \nThose encouraging deeds are in contrast to the tragic events taking place in \nthe former Yugoslavia and the equally tragic situation prevailing in Somalia. \n\nThe international community must renew its efforts to find peaceful, \nnegotiated solutions in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. \nMy country has viewed with great interest the measures taken by the \nSecretary-General to adapt the United Nations for the better fulfilment of its \nfunctions, and we support all efforts that enable the Organization to attain \nthe objectives of the Charter. \nIn particular, I wish to emphasize the active role the Organization has \ntaken in peace-keeping in various regions of the world. In the resolution of \nconflicts that originated before the end of the cold war and in cases of new \ntensions emerging from the geopolitical processes resulting from that historic \ndevelopment, the peace-keeping forces under the flag of the United Nations \ncarry out a fundamental role by opening the way to truce, dialogue and \nnegotiation, thus preventing the prolongation of confrontations that can be \nsatisfactorily resolved by peaceful means. \nWe should, however, re-examine the criteria used in financing those \nforces. The cost of peace-keeping operations could prove overwhelming for \nboth the Organization and its Member States, especially those, like Guatemala, \nthat have limited resources. In this regard, we welcome the \nSecretary-General's report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" as a contribution to those \nefforts. \nAlong the same lines, there is no doubt about the need to reform \nstructures that emerged and functioned within the framework of a \nconfrontational order. Such reform should not be limited, however, to the \nmere streamlining of the bureaucracy, but should aspire to the creation of a \nsystem that ensures satisfactory representation for all its members. As part \nof those efforts, we should deal without delay with the composition of the \n\nSecurity Council of the Organization. The current structure and procedures of \nthe Council are the result of a political order that we have left far behind, \nand we need to revise them, adapt them to the current situation and prevent \nthe creation of patterns of political tutelage that go against the principles \nof equitable participation and juridical equality among States. \nIn fact, a new problem is beginning to take shape within the structure of \nthe Organization, and it is nothing more or less than the reflection of a \nglobal issue: the privileged position enjoyed by some nations encourages \nmonopolistic structures in various multilateral forums. \nThe United Nations will be an effective and efficient forum to the extent \nthat each and every one of its Members can feel that its interests are \nadequately represented in the policies and programmes of the various \ndepartments of the Organization. Attitudes of political and economic tutelage \nwill be very unlikely to strengthen it; nor will they facilitate the \nestablishment of international patterns of cooperation. \nWe believe that in the protection and promotion of human rights we have a \nclear example of such a situation. At this time Guatemala has the advisory \nservices of an expert adviser from the United Nations, who has received a \nbroad mandate from the Commission on Human Rights to assist my country in its \nefforts to achieve the full realization of human rights. The mandate has been \naccepted by my Government in the spirit of openness and cooperation that it \nhas maintained in dealing with the Commission. \nIn addition, my country also unreservedly supports the United Nations \nobjective of promoting those rights internationally and will continue to \ncooperate with all its organs in that task. \n\nAt the same time, we feel we must express our concern at what we see as \nthe application of apparently selective criteria by some members of the \nCommission on Human Rights in its work. \n\nNevertheless, disturbing phenomena such as xenophobia, racism, \ndiscrimination against migrant workers and ethnic and religious \ndiscrimination, which have become more acute in recent years in certain \nnations as a result of the changing international system, have not been given \nsufficient attention by the Committee during its recent deliberations. \nFrom the work of the Commission on Human Rights and the Subcommission on \nPrevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, it would appear \nthat it is only in some developing countries that one finds obstacles to the \nfull application of human rights, disregarding the serious problems that exist \nin other nations. In both of these forums, it would appear that the \ncredibility of democratic, freely elected Governments is being questioned, \ngiving greater validity to the arguments presented by politically compromised \norganizations that favor sectarian movements which seek, through the use of \nforce and by causing suffering to peoples, to alter lawful democratic \ninstitutions. \nIt is urgent and necessary that the Committee dealing with \nNon-Governmental Organizations engage in a review of the non-governmental \norganizations that cooperate in the work of the Economic and Social Council \n(ECOSOC) and that participate in particular in the work of the Commission on \nHuman Rights, in order to ensure that their participation is positive and does \nnot answer to sectarian political interests that might tend to discredit them. \nAt the same time, it is necessary to review the working procedures of \nboth forums so that organizations that participate as observers will not \nreceive preferential treatment over that of members of the Organization who \nare not on the Committee. \n\nThe Government of Guatemala will continue to cooperate with the United \nNations in the field of human rights, and we hope in this respect to continue \nto receive the advisory services that enable the Government to fulfil the \ncommitment of President Serrano Elias to promote the full enjoyment of human \nrights in our country. However, I appeal to the relevant organizations to \nguard against abuse of this spirit of openness and cooperation by groups \nseeking the destabilization of the State, an unjust and selective situation \nthat would ultimately oblige the Government to review, analyse and reformulate \nits position on these matters. \nThe World Conference on Human Rights, to be held next year, should \nprovide an opportunity to examine the present situation and to plan the \nOrganization's future policies in a matter that is of pivotal importance to \nthe well-being of humankind. \nWe are in the process of analysing, proposing and establishing a new \nworld order based on cooperation and coexistence. The new role that falls to \nthe United Nations implies growing functions of coordination and discussion \nbetween nations. To that end, the principle of universality should prevail \nover other interests. \nIn this context, the Republic of China (Taiwan), one of the largest \neconomies in the world, is in a position to contribute significantly to \nseeking solutions to problems that nations of the world must face. Its \npresence in the United Nations would strengthen our Organization and permit \nmore appropriate treatment of topics with global implications, such as that of \nthe environment. Consequently, Guatemala appeals for consideration of the \nneed for participation by the Republic of China (Taiwan) as a Member of our \nOrganization, in addition to the People's Republic of China. We believe, \n\nmoreover, that this attitude would make a suitable contribution to the spirit \nof cooperation and conciliation that should characterize the new world order. \nThe structural reform undertaken by my Government includes a strategy for \neconomic openness designed to bring our economy into the flow of international \ncommerce. \nIn addition to the effort at integration in the Central American region, \nwhich we support with deep conviction and whose aim is to shape a community of \nnations in the Central American isthmus, Guatemala at this time is also \nnegotiating its participation in various regional economic-integration \nprogrammes. \nThis strategy is in line with our conviction that more active and open \nparticipation in the international market is a central element in achieving \neconomic growth and development for our population. We have signed the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in the belief that eliminating barriers \nto international trade creates better opportunities for our economies. \nHowever, we are concerned by the fact that the liberalizing theories \noriginating in the industrialized nations are giving way to clearly \nprotectionist attitudes precisely at a time when our products are becoming \ncompetitive in their markets. Rules and regulations are emerging as an excuse \nto prevent the inflow of commodities and manufactured products, upon which our \ncountries' economies largely depend. \nThese attitudes can hardly provide a stimulus to trust and understanding, \nand they also give rise to questions about the sincerity of principles that \nare publicly proclaimed but only partially practised. However, we should not \nbe thought of as ingenuous. We are aware of the fact that every country will \npromote its particular interests to the extent allowed by other nations. We \n\nare convinced, however, that for the sake of higher and more long-term \ninterests, nations must set aside some of their more immediate and narrow \ninterests. That concession should be general and reciprocal, however; \notherwise dialogue becomes but a theoretical and sterile exercise. \nThe activity of our Organization and the contribution that Member States \nmake to its work are aimed at improving the quality of life and promoting the \noverall development of human beings. That makes it imperative that we \nstrengthen the mechanisms of cooperation among nations. \n\nThis session of the General Assembly is being held on the eve of a new \nera in international relations, whose principal features are yet to be \ndefined. I express the hope that we, the participants in the Assembly, will \nprove equal to the challenge posed by the future peaceful coexistence and \nwell-being for all mankind. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, at the \noutset, to congratulate Mr. Ganev, on behalf of my delegation, on his election \nto the presidency of this important session of the General Assembly, and to \nextend to his predecessor, through him, our thanks and appreciation for the \nskilful manner in which he conducted the work of the previous session. From \nthis rostrum, I also extend our sincere congratulations to the States that \nhave joined the membership of this Organization since the previous session. \nWe welcome them as a new driving force that contributes to the various efforts \ndeployed in the international arena with a view to bringing about prosperity, \ndevelopment, and stability for the peoples and communities of the world. \nThis session, we have before us an important agenda at all political, \neconomic, social, humanitarian, and security levels. All of us must be aware \nthat, today, the world faces a new set of international phenomena that were \nnot active before the Gulf war and its consequences whose impact is being \nincreasingly felt on the international arena from one day to the next. \nFor our part, we recognize that new and different international \ncircumstances emerge with the dawn of every day. The barrier of the \nideologies which, in the past, immersed the world in conflict, confrontation \nand competition for the sake of narrow interests, has collapsed. The \nimprovement in East-West relations has opened up new vistas. However, the \nperiod of transition we are living through has spawned new contradictory \ntendencies, the most conspicuous of which is an intense acerbity in the \nrelations of the wealthy North and the poor South under the circumstances of \nthe so-called new world order. On the other hand, unipolarity has led the \nworld into a new security system controlled by a handful of major Powers in \nthe complete absence of active participation on the part of the rest of the \ninternational community. \n\nThe era of international detente we hear so much about nowadays, is no \nmore, in our view, than detente between those major Powers with their economic \nand military muscle. That detente has yet to address the closing of the wide \ngap between North and South, it has yet to reform international economic and \ncommercial relations and it has yet to address the issues of overriding \nconcern to the South, such as the debt burden, poverty, illiteracy and \ndisease. On top of all that, the States of the developing world are being \nsubjected now to the practices of the so-called new international legality \nwhich means, inter alia, interference and intervention in the internal affairs \nof those States and pursuance of the policies of diktat which deprive them of \nthe right of making their own decisions. \nIn the tenth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, which concluded its \nmeetings in Jakarta a few weeks ago, the Presidents and Heads of Government of \nthe Movement deliberated over the current international situation and the role \nof the Movement therein. They have voiced their conviction that the \nNon-Aligned Movement, being the representative of the largest grouping of \nStates and peoples in the world, has a role to play in the context of the \nunipolarity that reigns in the world today and, therefore, should be included \nin a flexible mechanism that would aim at a new world balance in which the \ndeveloping countries of the world should have an effective role in the \nformulation and setting up of a new world order that must replace the rampant \ninternational chaos of today, and put an end to the present marginalization of \ninternational covenants and agreements which must be binding to us all. The \nPresidents and Heads of Government of the Non-Aligned Movement have set for \nthemselves anew the target of ensuring a full presence for the Movement in \naddressing all the international issues on the world's agenda. They also have \n\nset the target of becoming genuine partners in all decisions to be taken \nparticularly within the framework of the United Nations and its Security \nCouncil. \nThe international mechanism governing relations between States should, in \nour opinion, continue to be the United Nations and its agencies. However, in \norder for this important Organization fully to discharge its duties, the \nfollowing must be achieved. \nFull commitment and adherence to the United Nations Charter, which must \nbe developed in a manner that would be compatible with the changes that have \ntaken place in the world since it was signed. \nThe General Assembly must be enabled to play a full role in the \nmaintenance of peace and security. The General Assembly's role should be as \nimportant as that of the Security Council's. \nSelectivity and double standards must be abandoned with respect to the \nimplementation of the Charter's provisions. \nThe Security Council'\\\", activities should be characterized by \ntransparency. The Council should adopt a democratic approach in the area of \ndecision-making. \nThe United Nations Secretary-General should be able to play his role \nfully,. without diktat from certain States, and should deal with all States on \nan equal footing. While appreciating the responsibilities of the \nSecretary-General, we are if the opinion that he should have the time to meet \nthe delegates and representatives of Member States and listen to what they \nhave to say on issues of importance to their countries and their regions. \n\nThe permanent membership of the Security Council and the right of veto \nwhich is the prerogative of the few should be reviewed. It is worth mentioning \nin this respect that the veto has been cast 279 times since the inception of \nthe Security Council, in relation to issues most of which were of special \nimportance to countries of the developing world. \nThe new world order being heralded nowadays should not violate the \nsovereignty, territorial integrity, or independence of States nor deprive them \nof their right to make their own decisions. Preventive diplomacy relating to \nthe making and maintenance of peace should proceed from a basic principle \naimed, first and foremost, at the complete eradication of regional and \ninternational tension, and at seeking out and uprooting the root causes of \npolitical, social and economic conflicts so that the countries involved may \nlive in peace and enjoy stability and prosperity. \nThe type of preventive diplomacy that is accompanied by the use of \nmilitary force must not be used against the smaller States alone. It is worth \nwondering here how military force can be used against countries which possess \nlarge or medium military capabilities. This is a legitimate question and we, \nthe smaller States, should look for an answer to it that would meet our urgent \nconcerns. If preventive diplomacy is to proceed initially from the principle \nof fact-finding, such fact-finding should be based on information-gathering \nfrom original sources and should avoid selectivity and hasty conclusions that \ncould become the justification for specific actions which may well be military \nin nature. We in the developing world have suffered a great deal from the \nunfair communication of facts on issues concerning our countries, either \n\nthrough mass media networks or governmental and non-governmental organizations \nwhich may be active in our countries. We hope that the United Nations and its \nvarious agencies, in all cases, will act impartially and not fall prey to \nnarrow political opportunism. \n\nIn the midst of international changes, we in the Sudan are striving to \nspread the principles of Shura meaning consultation and participation in \ndecision-making - and democracy, and to find a peaceful and lasting political \nsolution to the problem of the southern Sudan. We have so far achieved \nconsiderable progress, at the Abuja talks, which took place in May this year \nunder the auspices of President Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria. \nWe look forward with optimism and hope to the forthcoming second round of \nthe Abuja talks, which will soon take place. We expect to reach, with the \nrebel movement, a final solution to the problem of the south, by the end of \nthis year. It is our sincere hope that the peace efforts by the Sudan \nGovernment will attract the support and blessings of all friendly and \nfraternal States and of the international community as a whole. \nAllow me to mention here specifically, an important issue that weighs a \nlot on many minds these days, namely the issue of human rights. The \nprotection and maintenance of human rights is a sacred obligation that all \nreligions and human laws call for. The causes of instability and problems of \nsecurity and peace are directly and organically linked to the maintenance of \nthese rights, for individuals and for peoples alike. Therefore, it is our \nconviction that human rights are linked to the right of individuals and \npeoples to dignity, physical and mental health, the freedom to make their own \ndecisions without diktat, the right to have access to the fruits of scientific \nadvancement, namely progress and technology, the right to be free from \npoverty, disease and hunger and the right to education as well as to material \nand psychological stability. \n\nHowever, we notice that the principles of human rights, just like many \nother ideals, are being exploited and misused as a pretext for interference \nand intervention in the internal affairs of smaller States. Regardless of the \nclaims of interference and intervention for the protection of minorities, such \nbehaviour is, in essence, no more than using the issue of human rights as a \nweapon against those countries which do not submit to foreign diktat, and as a \nmeans of shrugging off moral obligations towards the developing countries. \nWe also notice that while the lofty ideal of human rights is being \nwielded as weapon, its use is characterized by a double-standard. The crimes \nand violations by allies are ignored, while accusations of human rights \nviolations are trumped up against those countries that do not surrender their \nright to independent decision-making. \nWe notice too that certain countries have set themselves up as the \nself-styled protectors of human rights even though they lack any moral grounds \nthat may qualify them for such a role. Such States give themselves the right \nto dictate norms of human rights according to their own cultures, customs and \nsocial conceptions, and pass judgement on others accordingly. \nThe promotion of human rights and basic freedoms will be properly \nachieved, as envisaged by those who wrote the United Nations Charter, only \nthrough international cooperation and not through confrontation or coercion. \nThe upholding and implementation of those rights within national frameworks \nremain within the jurisdiction and responsibility of each Government \nindividually so long as that Government properly performs its duties towards \nits citizens. It is the right of all peoples to freely establish their own \npolitical and economic systems and institutions on the basis of respect for \nthe principles of national sovereignty, self-determination and \nnon-interference in the internal affairs of others. \n\nIn this context, reference should be made to the fact that the \nfundamental principles of human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights embody two components that balance out each other: the first \nrelates to the rights and basic freedoms of the individual, while the second \nstipulates duties of the individual towards society and State. \nThis balance between rights and duties is important, inasmuch as its \nabsence leads to the negation of the rights of society as a whole and to \ninstability, especially in developing countries. We agree also with the view \nthat the political, civil, economic, social and cultural dimensions of human \nrights are indivisible, and cannot be selectively denied for contingent \npolitical motives. \nAt the same time, we reject every attempt to use the human rights issue \nas a precondition for the provision of economic and social assistance as this \nleads to the marginalization of such rights on the economic, social and \ncultural levels. We emphasize that development and human rights are \nconcomitant and interdependent. Hence the need for cooperation and \nmultilateral assistance in the implementation of social and economic \ndevelopment programmes in the developing countries on the basis of the fact \nthat the right to development is a valid, legitimate right that constitutes an \nindivisible part of fundamental human rights. We hope that the World \nConference on Human Rights that will be held next year will deal \ncomprehensively with the issue in all its aspects. \nAnother important issue that requires urgent attention is the situation \nin Somalia. The people of this sister country are victims of a bitter civil \n \nThey have suffered its ravages. Since the convening of the minisummit of \nthe States of the Horn of Africa on humanitarian issues, those States have \nperformed and continue to perform their duty in searching for a peaceful \nsolution to the differences between the warring factions in the dispute in \nSomalia. \nWe look forward to the support of the international community for that \nrole in order for it to achieve the goals spelled out at the Bahr Dar \nmeeting. We had expected the international community to recognize that role \nand develop it, as stability in the region is important, especially to its \ncountries and for the welfare of its peoples which cannot be ensured without \nthis desired stability. \nHowever, what happened instead was that a decision to send international \nforces to Somalia was taken, and the numbers of those forces have started to \nincrease from one day to the next. It was our opinion that such forces should \nhave been composed of contingents from the countries of the region itself, \nbecause we are worried that some countries from outside the region may pursue \ntheir own interests there by supporting one faction or another against the \nothers and thereby enabling it to win the war. Stability in Somalia cannot be \nachieved without comprehensive national reconciliation; one faction cannot \nhave sole power, and we hope that the faction of Mr. Ali Mahdi will come to \nrealize this fact. \nSeveral tragic multifaceted situations continue to beset the world such \nas the refugee problems and the plight of displaced and homeless persons. \nThese problems are clearly manifest in Africa and the Middle East. \nThe Palestinian people continue to struggle and strive for the \nestablishment of their own independent State on their own soil at a time when \nbilateral and multilateral negotiations are being obstructed by procedural \n\nhurdles that have held back those talks and prevented the negotiators from \naddressing the substance of the conflict. The new Israeli Government has not \nyet proved its serious intent or demonstrated the political will to restore \nthe rights of the Palestinian people and consequently restore peace and \nsecurity to this sensitive region of the world. We consider that the \nconvening of an international conference on the Palestinian question under \nfull United Nations supervision is the only viable alternative. \nWe further believe that the attempts being made with the aim of \nfragmenting the territorial integrity of Iraq are negative acts and examples \nof the unjust improper application of international norms. Moreover, those \nattempts will eventually jeopardize the balance of power in the region, ensure \nabsolute Israeli hegemony and open wide the doors to Israel's belligerent and \nexpansionist intentions which aim at ingathering all the Jews of the world in \na greater Israel. \nAnother human tragedy that needs close attention is the question of the \nMuslim people of Bosnia and Herzegovina who are being subjected to genocide \nand liquidation under the very noses of those who call for the preservation of \nhuman rights and the protection of minorities. This situation, in our view, \nis the result of ancient and anachronistic ethnic and religious hatreds which \nshould have disappeared by now. All countries agree that the massacres, \ngenocide, detentions and summary executions that are taking place there have \nno precedent other than what took place in the days of the Second World War. \nWhile the changes that swept over the countries of Eastern Europe have \nresulted in the emergence of new republics, we would have hoped that, in due \ncourse, those republics were going to join the world community of independent \nStates and ensure the enjoyment to the full, by a'l their peoples, of \nreligious and cultural freedoms. \n\nThe appeasement of a belligerent majority is a clear case of bias in \nfavour of the creed and cultural affiliations of that majority as opposed to \nthe Islamic faith of a considerable number of the peoples of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. The actual handling of this issue has been flawed by the \nselectivity of the major Powers, especially the five permanent members of the \nSecurity Council. It is definitely short-sighted to deal with the problem \nonly from a limited humanitarian perspective. What the people of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina need above all is the preservation of their identity side by side \nwith freedom and protection from acts of displacement and extermination. We \ntherefore consider that the resolutions of the Security Council on this issue \nare inadequate because they do not address the issue in its wider political \nand ethical context. Proceeding from this view, the Islamic Group has \ncondemned Security Council resolution 770 (1992). \nIn our opinion, complete military intervention by the United Nations is \nthe only viable solution. If this does not take place, our nagging doubts \nthat there is a scheme to erase the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from \nthe map of Europe will only grow. In addition, the policy of depriving the \npeople of Bosnia and Herzegovina of the means to defend their very existence \nwhile the Serbian aggressors continue to receive arms without any interference \nfrom the United Nations, will cast strong doubts on the integrity and \nneutrality of the international Organization. \nRecently, a minor crisis has flared up between the two sisterly States of \nIran and the United, Arab Emirates over certain disputed islands. We are \ndisturbed by the fact that that dispute has been transferred from the \nbilateral context to regional and international forums. This will only \nexacerbate the conflict. The parties that are now engaged in promoting the \n\nescalation of that dispute especially in the mass media, are trying, in fact, \nto aggravate tensions in the Gulf region, which has suffered the unfortunate \neffects of the sad events that have swept over it during the past few years. \nWe urge most strongly the containment of this dispute which should be \naddressed at the bilateral level in line with the operation of the old \nmechanism that was agreed upon in 1971 between the two parties. \nThe Persian Gulf area has suffered a series of wars that have obstructed \nits development. The present agonies of the people of Iraq under the \nconditions of an unjust economic blockade and the unending attempts to \nfragment their country's territorial integrity have resulted from disputes \nwhich, in our view, should have been settled by peaceful means within the \nregional framework, in order to prevent foreign interests from infiltrating \nthe region and capitalizing on differences and disputes to serve their own \nstrategic and economic designs. \nThe international economic situation remains static. Indeed, its \nprincipal feature continues to be the unending deterioration of the economies \nof the countries of the South and the widening gap between those countries and \nthe industrial countries. The major cause of that deterioration lies in the \nnegative and dangerous effects on international trade of the drop in exports \nof the developing countries as a result of the deterioration of prices of \ntheir primary commodity exports to the industrial countries. \nThe horrendous negative effects of the debt crisis have been aggravated \nto the point where they not only threaten the prospects of economic and social \ndevelopment of the developing countries but also the very existence of those \ncountries. \nIt is important at this point to mention the failure of the industrial \ncountries to honour their commitments, as embodied in international treaties \n\nand strategies pertaining to the flow of development assistance to the \ndeveloping countries, and particularly in implementing the resolutions \nembodied in the the international strategy for the decade of the 1980s, which \ncalled for allocating 0.7% of their gross national income to official \nassistance to the developing countries. Instead of implementing those \nresolutions, the developed countries have blocked every attempt to adopt a new \nstrategy for the decade of the 1990s. Furthermore, the industrial countries \nhave failed to implement the programme for the 1990s, which was adopted in \nfavour of the least developed countries in the 1990 Paris Conference. This. \nfailure has caused a grave setback to the economic and social development of \nthe least developed countries. \nAfrica, with its feeble infrastructures, is the continent that has been \nmost affected by that imbalance in the world economic situation. It is the \ncontinent that suffers most, because of the considerably diminished flow of \neconomic assistance and investment and the imposition on its countries of \nunjust conditions that are not imposed upon the other groupings of the \ndeveloping world. Moreover, the attempts to destabilize some regions of the \ncontinent aim, in our view.- at creating a geopolitical climate that would be \ncompatible with the strategies of certain major Powers. We all know the \npotentials of Africa, a continent with a great wealth of untapped human and \nnatural resources. \nThe real challenge that now faces the international community is \nnarrowing of the ever-widening gap between the wealthy countries of the North \nand the poor countries of the South. It is that gap which is the real threat \nto world peace and security. The debt crisis is one of the products of the \npresent international economic order. It is a phenomenon that resulted. \n\nessentially, from the structural imbalance of that order, and its failure to \ngenerate an appropriate developmental climate. \nWe have an unshakable belief in the necessary collective interdependency \nand the organic interrelatedness of the international economic order, if it is \nto be an order whose aim is to mutually benefit all mankind. This cannot be \nthe case, however, unless comprehensive and integrated solutions are found to \nthe existing problems on the basis of equality, justice and interdependency. \nThe dialogue required for the achievement of that objective cannot take place \nwithout the political will, courage, wisdom and far-sightedness of all \nconcerned. \nIn conclusion, we should like to express our absolute conviction \nregarding the necessity of collective action in the current period of detente \nin international relations. That means, in our view, developing the \nactivities of all the organs of the United Nations and giving those organs the \nrequired importance. In order to reach that objective, we need to cooperate \nand work together, hand in hand. \nMay Allah lead us to our noble objectives and grant us the vision to see \nthem clearly. \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of my Government, I should like \nto congratulate Mr. Ganev upon his unanimous election to preside over the \ndeliberations of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. I am \nconfident that his diplomatic skills and statesmanship will bring additional \nimpetus to our work and contribute to the success of our current deliberations. \nI should also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation \nfor the manner in which his predecessor. His Excellency Ambassador Shihabi of \nSaudi Arabia, stewarded the last session of the General Assembly. \nMy Government wishes to pay special tribute to the Secretary-General of \nthe United Nations, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his \ncommitment and tireless dedication to the ideals of the Organization. Though \nhe has been in office less than one year, he has demonstrated great political \nability and diplomatic skills in dealing with a wide range of delicate tasks \naround the globe. The Secretary-General's superior judgement and his ability \nto understand better the fragile nature of the emerging problems of today's \nworld have won him high respect, confidence and admiration in the \ninternational arena. We pledge to him our continued full support. \nMay I also avail myself of this opportunity to extend our most fraternal \nfelicitations to the newly admitted Members of the United Nations. Their \npresence among us today reinforces our common objective to make the United \nNations a universal instrument of peace, understanding and cooperation among \nnations. \nThe current session of the General Assembly takes place against a \nbackdrop of continued and ever-growing changes in international relations. We \nare witnessing a new political reality where the super-Powers' confrontation \n \nand rivalry, in their numerous manifestations, have ceased to threaten our \nfragile world, a world in which an arms race between two competing blocs is no \nlonger the main concern in the daily life of nations. A new political reality \nin which the problems resulting from the division of the world into spheres of \ninfluence, which had characterized international relations since the birth of \nthis Organization, has now given rise to new hope in the search for conflict \nresolution. \nHowever, this new political reality brings new challenges. Although the \ndanger of nuclear war has diminished drastically, the gap between rich and \npoor nations continues to widen. Uncertainty about the future continues to \nworry many nations and peoples; the proliferation of regional conflicts \ncontinues unabated and shows the fragility of the new political landscape. \nMoreover, the international economic environment remains extremely \nunfavourable to developing countries. We are still faced with the \nincommensurable problems of debt burden, deterioration of commodity prices, \ninsufficient flow of financial resources and inadequate transfer of \ntechnology. The Uruguay Round negotiations are deadlocked, thus further \nexacerbating economic uncertainty worldwide. \nAs a result, today more and more nations see the United Nations as the \nprimary instrument for the promotion of international peace and security and \nof development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. This is \nillustrated by the growing number of countries that have turned to the United \nNations and received assistance in their quest for democratization and their \ndesire to strengthen respect for human rights in their respective territories. \nWe strongly believe that the end of the cold war and of rivalry and \nbipolarity should serve as a catalyst for the promotion of international \npolitical, economic and social stability. \n \nThe tremendous resources, both human and material, that for over 40 years \nhave been devoted to the purposes of self-destruction can and must now be used \nfor peaceful purposes and economic development. History has proved that it is \nmuch easier and less costly to work for peace than it is for war. The \nproblems ahead are still considerable, but they can be tackled and dealt with \nprovided that there is commitment to the purposes and principles of the United \nNations Charter at the highest political level. \nIn these endeavours, the United Nations should be entrusted with renewed \nresponsibilities in redirecting the use of available resources, in building \nconfidence and trust among nations and in allocating further resources for \npeace-keeping, peacemaking and peace-building. \nIt is high time for the international community to redouble its joint \nefforts in order to tackle with determination existing long-term problems and \nmake the world safer for all. \n\nWe live in a world full of diversity but also of similarity among \npeoples. While in the North man has made significant progress in mastering \nseemingly intractable natural phenomena and advanced sciences, such as genetic \nengineering, biochemistry and physics, in the South man still remains the \nvictim of illiteracy and backwardness and depends on the will of mother \nnature. There are further examples which reveal our common identity as human \nbeings - the inability to control our instincts and to manage and exercise \npower in a responsible manner. \nIt is within this context that we are assembled here today as \nrepresentatives of our peoples and nations in order to reflect on how to \nreverse the events that made it possible to devote more than $20 trillion \nduring the past 30 years to military expenditures, to the detriment of the \nfundamental concerns of all mankind. In our view the root causes of the \nenormous problems we face today lie essentially in the utilization of the \ndestructive capacity of man and not in the positive use of his extraordinary \ncreativity. \nAs has been well documented, we are currently living in a world where \nmore than 1 billion people, or nearly one fifth of the world's population, are \nestimated to live in poverty. More than half of these people are believed to \nlive below internationally accepted minimum living standards. This state of \naffairs has made the situation in developing countries, particularly in \nAfrica, even more dramatic. \nWe hope that the ending of the cold war and the confrontation between \nconflicting political systems will allow the international community to work \ntogether in the search for common solutions to the international problems \nfacing us today. \n\nWe come from southern Africa, a region struggling to build and reaffirm \nits political, economic and social identity. For many years now the peoples \nof the region have made tremendous sacrifices and gone through tremendous \nhardships in order to address the difficult problems facing the region, \nproblems of self-determination, decolonization, destabilization and war. We \nhave made tangible progress in this regard. Nevertheless, much more remains \nto be done and additional sacrifice will be required. \nIn this connection my delegation is particularly concerned about the \nrecurrence of violence in South Africa. The recent waves of violence in South \nAfrica, in particular the massacres of innocent civilians in Boipatong last \nJune and in Ciskei early this month, constitute a serious setback to the \nongoing efforts aimed at creating a climate conducive to a negotiated \nsettlement. \nWe trust that with the support of the international community the people \nof South Africa can find common ground for a solution to the problems \noriginating from the policies of institutionalized racial segregation. My \nGovernment welcomes the current efforts aimed at bringing about a resumption \nof talks leading towards a political settlement of the conflict in that \ncountry. \nWe pay special tribute to the manner in which the international community \nas a whole, and the United Nations in particular, has promptly responded to \nthe issue of violence in South Africa. We welcome the recent adoption of \nSecurity Council resolution 765 (1992). We wish to encourage the \nSecretary-General to continue to work towards the implementation of that \nresolution and to help avert the current deadlock in the negotiating process. \n\nWe also urge all peace-loving forces in South Africa to join ranks and \nwork together in order to find a political settlement to the problems that \nhave resulted from nearly 50 years of apartheid, so as to ensure a smooth \ntransition to a democratic, non-racial and united South Africa. \nWe congratulate the Angolan people on their success in maintaining the \ncease-fire and in creating conditions for the holding of the first multiparty \nelections. It is our hope that the international community will continue to \nassist Angola and ensure that the elections on 29 and 30 September are held in \na climate of tranquillity so that the Angolan people can freely choose their \nrepresentatives. \nThe southern African region has been stricken by an unprecedented drought \nwith no parallel in living memory. This dramatic situation has already \nresulted in the destruction of this year's crops and in the devastation of the \nfauna and flora in large areas of the region. Important rivers have been \nreduced to almost a trickle of water, or even to large areas of dry sand. As \na result about 20 million human lives are seriously affected; the entire \nregion is threatened with the spectre of famine and deprivation. Last June a \njoint emergency appeal for relief and other emergency assistance was launched \nby the United Nations and the Southern African Development Co-ordination \nConference (SADCC). We seize this occasion to thank the international \ncommunity for its prompt response to the appeal, without which the human \nconsequences of this natural calamity would have been dramatic today. We \nreiterate our appeal for increased and urgent assistance in order fully to \nmeet the needs of the joint emergency appeal. \nIn spite of the number of difficulties facing our peoples in southern \nAfrica, joint efforts are under way with a view to revitalizing the economic \n\nand social fabric of the region. It was within this framework and with the \naim of strengthening regional cooperation that we decided to establish the \nSouthern Africa Development Community (SADC). The newly born Community is a \nresult of 12 years of experience of fruitful cooperation within the Southern \nAfrican Development Co-ordination Conference. The new Community bears \ntestimony to the common willingness of the States of the region to have a \ngradual and balanced economic integration, based on the utilization of \nregional resources without, however, neglecting necessary external cooperation \nas a complementary factor in the prosecution of our objectives. We therefore \ncall upon the international community to continue to extend its support in \norder to help the peoples of the southern African region to address the \ncombined effects of man-made disasters and natural calamities, especially the \nprolonged drought. \nIn this respect, the case of Mozambique is particularly grave as war has \nbeen ravaging the country for 16 years. The economic cost of this horrendous \nwar, which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and resulted in the \ndestruction of property and the economic and social infrastructure, has been \nestimated to be about $20 billion. \nThe Assembly will recall that in order to find a political settlement to \nthe conflict in Mozambique, and taking into consideration the highest \ninterests of the nation, direct negotiations between the Government and RENAMO \nhave been under way for two years now under the mediation of the Italian \nGovernment, the Santo Egidio Community and the Catholic Church of Mozambique. \nSince last June the United Nations, France, Portugal, the United Kingdom and \nthe United States of America have been participating as observers in the peace \nprocess. We believe their contribution, together with that of other \nParticipants in the peace process, has brought new impetus to the process as \n\nillustrated inter alia by the signing of the Declaration on the guiding \nprinciples to facilitate the distribution of humanitarian aid in the country. \nThe ongoing peace process in Rome has been complemented by other \nimportant high-level initiatives at the regional level. These initiatives \nculminated in the convening of a high-level meeting on 7 August in Rome \nbetween His Excellency President Chissano and the RENAMO leader. The \nhigh-level meeting resulted in the signing of a Joint Declaration. The \ndocument contains the solemn commitment by the Government of Mozambique and \nRENAMO to work for the completion and approval by 1 October 1992 of all \noutstanding issues in order to make possible the signing of the general peace \nagreement and to bring about an immediate cessation of hostilities by that \ndate. \nThe Joint Declaration outlines general principles and specific guarantees \npertaining to the attainment of peace, democracy and national unity based on \nthe overall goal of national reconciliation. It binds both sides to \nguaranteeing conditions allowing complete political freedom in accordance with \ninternationally recognized democratic principles, as well as personal security \nfor all citizens of Mozambique and all members of political parties. \n \nThe Joint Declaration further stresses the need to honour the principles \ncontained in Protocol No. I, calling upon the Government of Mozambique \n\\\"not to act in a way that is contrary to the terms of the Protocols that \nare established, not to adopt laws or measures and not to apply current \nlaws that may eventually be contrary to these Protocols\\\". \n(S/24406. annex, p. 4. para, (iv)) \nThe Declaration also requires that \n\\\"RENAMO undertakes not to combat by force of arms after the entry into \nforce of a cease-fire, but to conduct its political struggle observing \ncurrent laws, within the framework of the existing State institutions, \nand respecting the conditions and the guarantees laid down in the General \nPeace Agreement\\\" (ibid.) \nThe Joint Declaration underlines the role of the international community, \nin particular the United Nations, in monitoring the implementation of the \nGeneral Peace Agreement and the cease-fire and the conduct of the electoral \nprocess. \nMy Government has solemnly declared its readiness to abide by the \nprovisions of the Joint Declaration and to work towards peace and tranquillity \nin our country. Even as I address the General Assembly, the Assembly of the \nRepublic, the parliament of Mozambique, is in session in order to legislate on \nall the issues pertaining to the implementation of the Declaration. \nMore recently, on 18 September, the Head of State of Mozambique and the \nRENAMO leader met once again in Gaborone, Botswana, in order to address the \nissues on the agenda of the Rome negotiations which caused a deadlock. The \nmeeting reaffirmed 1 October as the deadline for the signing of the General \nPeace Agreement in Mozambique and an agreed solution was found to those issues. \n \nNever before in the history of this conflict have peace and conciliation \namongst all Mozambicans been so close. We therefore believe that RENAMO must \nshare the historical responsibility in order to respond to the hopes of our \npeople and turn 1 October into a historic landmark in the annals of Mozambican \nhistory. \nThe Government of Mozambique is fully prepared to open a new chapter in \nour history, a chapter characterized by an atmosphere of tolerance, \nreconciliation and understanding among all Mozambicans. My Government long \nago stated that there was no justification whatsoever for the continuation of \nwar in Mozambique. In this connection, it should be recalled that since the \ncoming into force of the new Constitution, in November 1990, more than 10 \npolitical parties have emerged and have been performing freely and peacefully \ntheir political activities in Mozambique. We continue to believe that all \npolitical forces inside the country should pursue their political objectives \nthrough democratically accepted norms of conduct, without resorting to \nviolence. \nFrom this rostrum, I wish to commend the Secretary-General's personal \ncommitment to peace in my country. We are particularly gratified to note that \nthe United Nations stands ready to assist my country in this time of need. We \nalso commend the Secretary-General for his recent initiative to dispatch a \ntechnical team of civilian and military experts in order to assess the needs \nof the country during the implementation of the General Peace Agreement, in \nparticular the monitoring of the cease-fire and electoral process. We look \nforward to seeing the United Nations further involved in the peace efforts in \nMozambique in the days to come. \nFollowing the signing of the General Peace Agreement, the people of \nMozambique will need massive international assistance in addressing vital \n\nissues, such as the implementation and monitoring of the cease-fire, the \norganization and supervision of the electoral process, demobilization of both \narmies and the reintegration of former soldiers into civilian life, creation \nof the new national army, the repatriation and resettlement of refugees from \nneighbouring countries and assistance to displaced persons. \nMost important, however, it will be crucial to assist Mozambique in its \nnational reconstruction efforts and ensure the non-recurrence of violence and \ndestruction in the country. Such assistance will call for the creation, \nexpansion and strengthening of democratic institutions and the maintenance of \nlaw and order, so as to deal with the growing challenges facing the nation \nunder conditions of multi-party democracy. \nIn Rome the Government delegation and RENAMO agreed that in order \ncomprehensively to address the political, economic and social situation in \nMozambique the convening of a donor conference immediately after cease-fire \nappeared to be the most viable way to complement our efforts in the important \ntask ahead of the Mozambican nation. The United Nations and the entire \ninternational community are therefore once again called upon to extend their \nsolidarity to the people of Mozambique at this moment, the most critical of \nits history since national independence. \nAs for elections, which will take place one year after the signature of \nthe General Peace Agreement, many efforts are being made, and there is a \nnational political will to turn the elections into a real success, as the \ninternational community expects. However, because of the difficulties that \nthe electoral process will encounter, we shall appreciate and acknowledge \nevery possible material and financial assistance from the United Nations and \nthe international community, so that the process may be conducted without \nmajor bottlenecks and be truly just, free and fair. \n\nThe end of the cold war has offered good new prospects for the \nstrengthening of North-South cooperation. The year 1992 already stands as an \nimportant landmark for the United Nations and for the future of \nmultilateralism and international cooperation for development. \nIn Cartagena de Indias the eighth session of the United Nations \nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) brought about a new partnership \nfor development based on the recognition of sovereign equality, mutual \ninterest and shared responsibilities for the goals of sustained growth of the \nworld economy and the reactivation of development in the developing \ncountries. My delegation welcomes the Conference's decision to redirect \nUNCTAD activities and to strengthen its mandate in accordance with the demands \nof the post-cold-war period. We wish to reaffirm our support for the \nCartagena Commitment, and in this context we call for the intensification of \nUNCTAD assistance to the least developed countries. \nThe Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro constituted a historic and universal \ngathering which set in motion a long-term process of international cooperation \naimed at saving the planet and future generations from environmental \ndestruction. It led to important and unprecedented policy agreements, a broad \nprogramme of action and two Conventions. The outcome of the Summit embodies \nthe highest level of political commitment to sustainable development policies \nand practices calling for the integration of environment and development. \nThe critical question now is the implementation of the Rio commitments \nand their effective follow-up and review, especially with regard to \nAgenda 21. In this connection, my delegation stands ready to participate in \n\nthe forthcoming discussions on the establishment of the commission on \nsustainable development. In our view, that commission should serve as an \neffective mechanism at a global level for the follow-up of the United Nations \nConference on Environment and Development and for promoting dialogue and \ncommon approaches on environment and development matters, while giving \nadequate attention to the diversity of situations and experiences of Member \nStates and regions of the world. In this regard, it is our firm conviction \nthat the composition of the commission should take into account the principle \nof equitable geographical distribution and provide for close working links \nwith all agencies of the United Nations system, especially with the United \nNations regional commissions and other international development \ninstitutions. Bearing in mind the follow-up of the Earth Summit, the \ncommission should give the utmost priority to the question of the means of \nimplementation of Agenda 21, namely, financial resources, capacity-building \nand technology transfer. \nDuring the past months the process of reform in the economic and social \nsectors of the United Nations system has evolved to the present critical \nstage. My delegation is encouraged by the growing consensus on, and renewed \nefforts to revitalize, the Economic and Social Council as a central and \ncredible forum for dialogue and formulation of international strategies as \nveil as for a more effective coordination and harmonization of actions of the \nunited Nations system. I should like to underline the great importance of the \ncurrent reform exercise, which should ultimately lead to enhancing the \neffectiveness and efficient functioning of the United Nations system, in order \nto be more responsive to the current needs of international economic \ncooperation and to promote the development of developing countries. \n\nLikewise, we attach great importance to the reform measures aimed at \nimproving the capacity of the United Nations to coordinate and deliver in a \ntimely manner humanitarian assistance to refugees and displaced persons, in \nsituations both of conflict and of natural disasters. \nThe evolving world situation has opened a new window of fresh \nopportunities and challenges to the whole international community and to the \nUnited Nations in particular. In this regard, my delegation has carefully \nstudied the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization \n(A/47/1), as well as his report entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277). \nWe think that the Secretary-General's assessment is very timely and \npertinent in the current United Nations history. We have learned from our own \nexperience that both an agenda for peace and an agenda for development \nconstitute important and inseparable issues in today's world. We therefore \nstrongly believe in the role of the United Nations as the most appropriate \nforum for the harmonization of the global interests of all nations and for the \npromotion of an appropriate political atmosphere of understanding, consensus \nand international cooperation among the peoples and nations of the world. \nMay I invite, from this floor, all Member States jointly to rededicate \nand commit ourselves to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations, \ngiving it the necessary thrust, so as to enable it to fulfil with zeal and \nconfidence its tasks as the guardian of international peace and security, as \nprescribed in the Charter.

        "file_text": "At the outset, I \nwould like to express to you. Sir, my sincere congratulations as you assume \nthis high post. Your election is an expression of the confidence you enjoy. \nIt also emphasizes the role your country, Bulgaria, plays at the regional and \nworld levels and reflects the relations of friendship and cooperation it has \nmaintained with other countries of the world. \nI would like, in this connection, to commend your predecessor in the \npresidency of the General Assembly, Ambassador Samir Shihabi, who conducted \nthe work of the previous session of the Assembly with high efficiency. \n\nOur current session, the first to be held since our present \nSecretary-General, Ambassador Boutros Boutros-Ghali, assumed his high office, \nis convened at the threshold of a new era of profound change with which the \nworld Organization must come to grips in a manner that would enhance its \neffectiveness and credibility, now that the old bipolarity has disappeared and \nthe burdens faced by the United Nations in every field have increased. There \nis a great deal of hope set by the peoples of the world on our Organization. \nIn this context, I would like to pay tribute to the former \nSecretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, whose term ended with the \nconclusion of our last session. \nIn this hall 179 delegations are meeting. Our Organization started with \n51 Member States in 1945. This increase in membership reflects the success of \nthe United Nations in eliminating colonialism, and upholding the right of \npeoples to self-determination and independence. By so doing, the United \nNations has achieved the aim of universal membership. This is an achievement \nwe should be proud of and we look forward to seeing it become a launching pad \nfrom which the Organization would proceed to translate the noble principles \nand objectives of the Charter from the realm of ideas to the world of \nreality. \nThe State of Qatar shares with all Member States the desire of \nreactivating and developing the United Nations in a manner that would be \ncompatible with the new world situation and which would strengthen the \nOrganization's role in maintaining peace and stability in the world. \n \nWe believe that that desired stability will be achieved only through the \ncreation of effective mechanisms for resolving disputes that arise between \nStates either by diplomatic means, such as direct dialogue and mediation, or \nby recourse to international law as applied by the International Court of \nJustice. \nDespite the end of the cold war and the bipolarity which were among the \ncauses of the arms race, arms limitation continues to be one of the main \nconcerns of the United Nations. It was hoped that the end of the cold war \nwould mean a significant and speedy reduction in the magnitude of that arms \nrace. However, this has not been the case. In 1990, experts estimated that \n15 per cent of the aggregate of all Government budgets in the world is still \nbeing spent on armaments and military preparedness. This is a much higher \npercentage than that of expenditure on education or on health care. The \nburden of military expenditure weighs more heavily on developing countries \nthan on industrialized countries because of the discrepancy between the two \ngroups of countries in the area of disposable resources. \nIf we look carefully into the new developments in nuclear armaments we \nfind that the situation is much worse. For while we go on wasting the \nvaluable resources which should be used for development and the building of a \nbetter future for man, we endanger that very future with nuclear armament. \nTherefore, the problem of arms control will remain one of the central issues \nwhich the Organization will continue to address in the near future just as it \nused to do in the past. \nWe in the Gulf region, because of what we went through during the war of \nliberation of our sister State of Kuwait, have a special interest in \nprohibiting chemical and other weapons of mass destruction and we attach the \ngreatest of hopes on the success of the Conference on Disarmament in rapidly \n\nconcluding a convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons and preventing \nthe spread of research and production techniques in this field in accordance \nwith General Assembly resolutions, particularly those adopted in the course of \nits last session. \nIn this connection, I should like to point out the necessity of \ncompliance by Israel, and by all other States of the Middle East, with this \nconvention, both the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and \nwith the regime of international inspection. This should in adherence to the \nprinciples of equality and justice and the need to ensure the security of all \nStates of the region without bias or discrimination. Failure by any State in \nthe region to comply with both agreements, or the accordance of special \ntreatment to any of those States would render the whole endeavour void of \nseriousness and effectiveness. Therefore, we call upon the international \ncommunity to ensure compliance therewith by Israel. \nThe question of Palestine is one of the questions that have been with the \nUnited Nations since its inception and still awaits a solution. My country \nattaches great importance to this question and hopes for rapid progress \ntowards its solution in the framework of the ongoing peace process. \nThe question of the Palestinian people and the denial by Israel of the \ninalienable rights of that people is the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict and \nonce the solution of the question of Palestine has been achieved in a manner \nthat would be acceptable to the Palestinians, we will also accept it. If \nIsrael wants to live in peace it should withdraw, not only from the West Bank \nand the Gaza Strip, but also from all the occupied Arab territories, including \nEast Jerusalem, the Golan and southern Lebanon, in accordance with the United \n\nNations Charter and relevant resolutions which stipulate the inadmissibility \nof the acquisition or annexation of territories by force, and that it is \nillegal to occupy the territories of others by military force. \nThe State of Qatar welcomes the resumption of negotiation between the \nconcerned parties in Washington and reaffirms its commitment to support the \npeace effort and expresses its hope that a lasting, equitable and \ncomprehensive solution will be reached to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the \nquestion of Palestine on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) \nand 338 (1973). \nThe delegation of my country wishes to voice in this world forum its deep \nconcern over the continued suffering of the brotherly people of Somalia and we \nappeal to all Somali factions to put an end to the bloodshed, set aside their \ndifferences and put the national interest first. My country commends the \nincreasing efforts made by the United Nations at present to alleviate the \nsuffering of that people in a bid to move towards restoring stability to that \nafflicted country. \nAs for the situation in the Gulf, my country reaffirms its commitment to \nthe joint political position of its sister countries, members of the Gulf \nCooperation Council (GCC) with a view to preserving security and peace in the \nregion, which in turn would contribute to achieving the desired peace in the \nworld. \nWith regard to the island of Abu Mousa, it is regrettable indeed that at \nthis historic stage through which our region is passing such a dispute should \narise between the two neighbours, the State of the United Arab Emirates and \nthe Islamic Republic of Iran. Out of our deep concern for the safety and \nstability of the region, we believe that this dispute should be resolved by \npeaceful means, through dialogue or by recourse to the law. \n\nThe disintegration of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has led \nto serious consequences that have shaken the conscience of humanity. My \ncountry is especially concerned over the acts of aggression committed against \nthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and characterized by extreme violence, \nparticularly against the Muslim population of that Republic, with the aim of \ndriving the Muslims out of their homes and country under the slogan of \\\"ethnic \ncleansing\\\". \nIt is the duty of the international community to stand up to this \naggression so that the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is a Member \nState of the United Nations, may preserve its right to freedom and \nindependence. \nIn his statement made in December 1991 after his election as \nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali cited the indebtedness of \ndeveloping countries as one of the more complicated problems which face the \nworld economy and which all States must address effectively and decisively. \nThe former Secretary-General, also, had often drawn attention to this problem, \nthe existence and gravity of which is not hidden from experts and from the \nStates that suffer from its worsening burden which weighs heavily on the \ndeveloping countries and often makes them unable to meet their economic \nobligations, with dire social consequences. \nIt is self-evident that meeting the burden of foreign debt in every \ndebtor country would be at the expense of its social programmes and its \nefforts to raise the-standard of living of its people and thus those poor \ncountries become even poorer. The problem of foreign debt must be dealt with \ndecisively. \nThe United Nations has shown its great concern over the problems of the \nenvironment by convening the Rio de Janeiro Conference in mid-1992. Even if \n\nthat Conference did not rise fully to the level of the hopes set on it, it \nmarked, nevertheless, a positive beginning that could serve as a point of \ndeparture for more effective efforts to protect the environment without \nunnecessary shackles that may impede economic development in developing \ncountries in the name of the protection of the environment which no one \ndisputes. \nThe peoples of the world look forward to the formulation of a new world \norder which would ensure world peace and rest on the foundations of \ninternational law, the principles of justice and equality and of cooperation \nand brotherhood. That new world order should not inherit the negative \nattributes of the old order that led to the creation of blocs, conflicts and \npolarization with all the attendant evils of underdevelopment, poverty, \nbackwardness, hunger, ignorance and disease. The concept of the new world \norder should be wide enough to embrace international cooperation and \nunshackled trade and should address the problems of economic development, side \nby side with the issues of disarmament, indebtedness, environmental protection \nand social problems. \nIf the new world order is to govern the political, economic and social \ninternational relations between States, all States must share, on an equal \nfooting, in its formulation so that it may become an equitable world order \nthat truly represents the joint will of the international community and thus \nenable the human race to build a safe and happy world, for the present and \nfuture generations.\n"

        "file_text": "Forty-seven years ago I was a young man of 21, and, \nlike thousands of others of my generation, I had gone off to war to help keep \nfreedom alive. Forty-seven years ago this month the war was finally over, and \nI was looking forward to peace and the chance to begin my life in earnest: \n1945 marked a moment of promise, not just for me, but for all of mankind. A \ngreat struggle against dictatorship had been fought and won. Across the \nglobe, we all looked forward to a future free of war, a world where we might \nraise our children in peace and freedom, and this institution, the United \nNations, born amidst the ashes of war, embodied those hopes and dreams like no \nother. \nBut the hopes and dreams of 1945 remained unfulfilled: communist \nimperialism divided the world in two, our hopes for peace and our dreams of \nfreedom were frozen in the grip of cold war, and, instead of finding a common \nground, we found ourselves at Ground Zero. Instead of living on Churchill's \nThe President returned to the Chair. \n\n\\\"broad, sunlit uplands\\\", millions found that there was, as Arthur Koestler so \nchillingly wrote, \\\"Darkness at Noon\\\". Instead of uniting the nations, this \nbody became a forum for distrust and division among nations and, in a cruel \nirony, the United Nations, created to free the world of conflict, itself \nbecame conflict's captive. \nI too lived through those disputes; I sat where you sit, proudly so; I \nserved in this Assembly and I saw, in my time, the consequences of the cold \nwar's hot words on the higher missions of the United Nations. Now, 47 years \nlater, we stand at the end of another war, the cold war, and our hopes and \ndreams have awakened again. Driven by its own internal contradictions and \nbanished by the peoples' undying thirst for freedom, imperial communism has \ncollapsed in its birthplace, and today Russia has awakened democratic, \nindependent and free; the Baltic States are free; and so too are Ukraine, \nArmenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and the other independent States joining the \nnations of Central and Eastern Europe in freedom. \nThe fear of nuclear Armageddon between the super-Powers has vanished, and \nwe are proud to have done our part to ensure that our schoolchildren do not \nhave to practise hiding under their desks for fear of nuclear attack, as the \ngeneration before them did. I am proud also to salute the courageous leaders \nwith nuclear responsibilities Presidents Yeltsin, Kravchuk, Nazarbayev, \nShushkevich who joined me in ending the super-Power stand-off that risked \nnuclear nightmare. This is the first General Assembly session to seat you as \ntruly independent and free nations, and to you and the leaders of the other \nindependent States, I say welcome home: we are now truly united nations. \n\nWith the cold war's end, I believe we have a unique opportunity to go \nbeyond artificial divisions of a first, second and third world to forge \ninstead a genuine, global community of free and sovereign nations, a community \nbuilt on respect for principle, on peaceful settlement of disputes, on \nfundamental human rights and on the twin pillars of freedom: democracy and \nfree markets. Already, the United Nations, especially the Security Council, \nhas done much to fulfil its original mission and to build this global \ncommunity. \nUnited Nations leadership has been critical in resolving conflicts and \nbrokering peace the entire world over, but securing democracy and securing the \npeace in the century ahead will be no simple task. Imperial communism may \nhave been vanquished, but that does not end the challenges of our age, \nchallenges that must be overcome if we are finally to end the divisions \nbetween East and West, North and South, that fuel strife and strain and \nconflict and war. \nAs we support the historic growth of democracy around the world, I \nbelieve the community of nations and the United Nations face three critical, \ninterrelated challenges as we enter the twenty-first century. \nFirst, we face the political challenge of keeping today's peace and \npreventing tomorrow's wars. As we see daily in Bosnia, Somalia and Cambodia, \neverywhere conflict claims innocent lives; the need for enhanced peace-keeping \ncapabilities has never been greater; the conflicts we must deal with have \nnever been more intractable, the costs of conflict higher. \nSecond, we face the strategic challenge of the proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction, truly the fastest growing security challenge to \ninternational peace and order. \n\nThird, we face the common economic challenge of promoting prosperity for \nall, of strengthening an open, growth-oriented, free-market international \neconomic order while safeguarding the environment. \nMeeting these challenges will require us to strengthen our collective \nengagement; it will require us to transform our collective institutions; and, \nabove all, it will require that each of us look seriously at our own \nGovernment and how we conduct our international affairs. We too must change \nour institutions and our practices if we are to make a new world of the \npromises of today, if we are to secure a twenty-first century peace. \n \nWith you today I would like to discuss these three challenges: \npeace-keeping, proliferation and prosperity. And I should like to use this \nopportunity to begin to sketch how I believe the international community can \nwork together to meet these three challenges and how the United States is \nchanging its institutions and policies to catalyze this effort. \nLet me begin with peace-keeping. The United Nations has a long and \ndistinguished history of peace-keeping and humanitarian relief. From Cyprus \nand Lebanon, to Cambodia and Croatia, the blue beret has become a symbol of \nhope amid all that hostility. And the United Nations has long played a \ncentral role in preventing conflicts from turning into wars, and strengthening \npeace-keeping capabilities can help buttress these diplomatic efforts. But, \nas much as the United Nations has done, it can do much more. \nPeace-keepers are stretched to the limit while the demands for their \nservices increase by the day. The need for monitoring and preventive \npeace-keeping putting people on the ground before the fighting starts - may \nbecome especially critical in volatile regions. This is especially the case \nbecause of the rapid and turbulent change that continues to shake Eastern \nEurope and Eurasia. Across the lands that once were imprisoned behind an iron \ncurtain, peoples are reasserting their historical identities that were frozen \nin communism's catacomb. \nWhere this is taking place in a democratic manner with tolerance and \ncivility and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms, this new \ndemocratic nationalism is all to the good. But, unfortunately, we need only \nlook to the bloody battles raging in places such as the former Yugoslavia to \nsee the dangers of ethnic violence. This is the greatest threat to the \ndemocratic peace we hope to build with Eastern Europe, with Russia and \n \nEurasia, even more than economic deprivation. We fully support the efforts of \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Conference on Security and \nCooperation in Europe (CSCE), the Western European Union (WEU), the \nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and other competent regional \norganizations to develop peace-keeping capabilities. \nWe are convinced, however, that enhanced United Nations capabilities are \na necessary complement to these regional efforts, not just in Europe and \nEurasia, but across the globe. \nI welcome the Secretary-General's call for a new agenda to strengthen the \nability of the United Nations to prevent, contain and resolve conflicts across \nthe globe. Today I call upon all Members to join me in taking bold steps to \nadvance that agenda. I will therefore be discussing with my colleagues the \nmerits of a special meeting of the Security Council to discuss the \nSecretary-General's proposals and to develop concrete responses in five key \nareas. \nFirst, robust peace-keeping requires men and equipment that only Member \nStates can provide. Nations should develop and train military units for \npossible peace-keeping operations and humanitarian relief and these forces \nmust be available on short notice at the request of the Security Council and \nwith the approval, of course, of the Governments providing it. \nSecondly, if multinational units are to work together, they must train \ntogether. Many nations for example, Fiji, Norway, Canada and Finland have \na long history of peace-keeping and we can all tap into that experience as we \ntrain for expanded operations. Effective multinational action will also \nrequire coordinated command and control and inter-operability of both \nequipment and communications. Multinational planning, training, field \n\nexercises will be needed. Those efforts should link up with regional \norganizations. \nThirdly, we also need to provide adequate logistical support for \npeace-keeping and humanitarian operations. Member States should designate \nstockpiles of resources necessary to meet humanitarian emergencies, including \nfamines, floods and civil disturbances. This will save valuable time in a \ncrisis. \nFourthly, we will need to develop planning, crisis management and \nintelligence capabilities for peace-keeping and humanitarian operations. \nFifthly, we must ensure adequate equitable financing for United Nations \nand associated peace-keeping efforts. \nAs I said, we must change our national institutions if we are to change \nour international relations. So let me assure you that the United States is \nready to do its part to strengthen world peace by strengthening international \npeace-keeping. \nFor decades, the American military has served as a stabilizing presence \naround the globe. And I want to draw on our extensive experience in winning \nwars, in keeping the peace, to support United Nations peace-keeping. I have \ndirected the United States Secretary of Defense to place a new emphasis on \npeace-keeping. Because of peace-keeping's growing importance as a mission for \nthe United States military, we will emphasize training of combat, engineering \nand logistical units for the full range of peace-keeping and humanitarian \nactivities and we will work with the United Nations to best employ our \nconsiderable lift, logistics, communications and intelligence capabilities to \nsupport peace-keeping operations. And we will offer our capabilities for \njoint simulations and exercises to strengthen our ability to undertake joint \npeace-keeping operations. \n\nThere is room for all countries, large and small, and I hope all will \nplay a part. \nMember States, as always, must retain the final decision on the use of \ntheir troops, of course. But we must develop our ability to coordinate \npeace-keeping efforts so that we can mobilize quickly when a threat to peace \narises or when people in need look to the world for help. \nI have further directed the establishment of a permanent peace-keeping \ncurriculum in United States military schools. Training, plainly, is a key \nelement. The United States is prepared to make available our bases and \nfacilities for multinational training and field exercises. One such base, \nnearby, with facilities is Fort Dix. America used these bases to win the cold \nwar and today, with that war over, they can help build a lasting peace. \nThe United States is willing to provide our military expertise to the \nUnited Nations to help the United Nations strengthen its planning and \noperations for peace-keeping, and we will also broaden American support for \nmonitoring, verification, reconnaissance and other requirements of United \nNations peace-keeping or humanitarian assistance operations. \nAnd, finally, the United States will review how we fund peace-keeping and \nexplore new ways to ensure adequate American financial support for United \nNations peace-keeping and United Nations humanitarian activities. I do \nbelieve that we must think differently about how we ensure and pay for our \nsecurity in this new era. \nWhile the cold war may have ended, the super-Power nuclear arms \ncompetition, regional competition, weapons of mass destruction continue. Over \n20 countries have, or are developing, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons \n \nand the means to deliver them. At a time when the United States and its \nformer adversaries are engaged in deep, historic cuts in our nuclear arsenals, \nour children and grandchildren will never forgive us if we allow new and \nunstable nuclear stand-offs to develop around the world. \n\nWe believe the Security Council should become a key forum for \nnon-proliferation enforcement. The Security Council should make clear its \nintention to stem proliferation and sanction proliferators. Reaffirming \nassurances made at the time the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons was negotiated, I propose that the Security Council reassure the \nnon-nuclear States that it will seek immediate action to provide assistance, \nin accordance with the Charter, to any any non-nuclear-weapon State party to \nthe non-proliferation Treaty that is a victim of an act of aggression or an \nobject of threat of aggression involving nuclear weapons. \nI also call for the indefinite renewal of the nuclear non-proliferation \nTreaty when it is reviewed in 1995. I believe we must explore ways we can \nstrengthen linkages between the suppliers \\\"clubs\\\", the nuclear-suppliers \ngroup, the Australia Group, the missile-technology control regime and United \nNations specialized agencies. \nHere I would like to note the productive efforts of the United Nations \nSpecial Commission (UNSCOM) to dismantle the Iraqi weapons-of-mass-destruction \nprogramme, and the continuing good work of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency (IAEA). But as the United Nations organizations adapt to stop \nproliferation, so too must every Member State change its structures to advance \nour non-proliferation goals. \nIn that spirit I want today to announce my intention to work with the \nUnited States Congress to redirect the United States Arms Control and \nDisarmament Agency (ACDA) to refocus its talents on providing technical \nsupport for non-proliferation, weapons monitoring and destruction, and global \ndefence conversion. Under the direction of the Secretary of State, ACDA \n\nshould be used not only in completing the traditional arms-control agenda but, \njust as importantly, in providing technical assistance on our new security \nagenda. \nEven as we work to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \nwe must be realistic and guard ourselves against proliferation that is already \ntaking place. Therefore, we are working towards a cooperative system for \ndefence against limited ballistic missile attacks. We fully intend to have \nother nations participate in this global protection system. \nWhile expanded peace-keeping capabilities and improved non-proliferation \nefforts will be critical for building an enduring peace, shared economic \ngrowth is the long-term foundation for a brighter future well into the next \ncentury. That is why I stated yesterday, during a moment of international \nuncertainty, that the United States would be strongly engaged with its global \npartners in building a global economic, financial and trading structure for \nthis new era. \nAt the same time, I urged that our global responsibilities lead us to \nexamine ways to strengthen the Group of Seven (G-7) coordination process, and \nI affirmed America's support for a European integration that opens markets and \nenhances Europe's capability to be our partner in the great challenges that we \nface in this new era. While the exact form of integration is, of course, for \nEuropeans to determine, we will stand by them. \nEconomic growth is not a zero-sum process. All of us will benefit from \nthe expanded trade and investment that comes from a vibrant, growing world \neconomy. To ensure that the benefits of this growth are sustained and shared \nby all, fair and open competition should be the fuel for the global economic \n\nengine. That is why the United States wants to complete the Uruguay Round of \nthe negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as \nsoon as possible, and to create a network of free-trade agreements, beginning \nwith the North American Free Trade Agreement. \nAt the same time, we need to recognize that we have a shared \nresponsibility to foster and support the free-market reforms necessary to \nbuild growing economies and vibrant democracies in the developing world and in \nthe new democratic States. This should be done by promoting the private \nsector to build these new economies, not by fostering dependency with \ntraditional Government-to-Government foreign aid. \nAfter the Second World War, foreign assistance often served as a weapon \nin the cold war. Obviously, we will still use critical foreign-assistance \nfunds to meet legitimate security needs. And, as our humanitarian operations \nin Somalia and northern Iraq, Bosnia and the former Soviet Union will testify, \nwe will continue our robust humanitarian assistance efforts to help those \nsuffering from man-made and natural disasters. \nBut foreign aid as we have known it needs to be transformed. The notion \nof the handout to less developed countries needs to give way to cooperation \nand mutually productive economic relationships. We know this: the more a \nnation relies on the private sector and free markets, the higher its rate of \ngrowth; the more open to trade it is, the higher its rate of growth; and the \nbetter a country's investment climate, the higher its rate of growth. \nTo move from what I would call aid-dependency to economic partnership, we \npropose to alter fundamentally the focus of United States assistance \nprogrammes to building strong, independent economies that can become \n\ncontributors to a healthy, growing global economy. That means that our new \nemphasis should be on building economic partnerships among our private sectors \nthat will promote prosperity at home, and abroad also. Working with our \nCongress I will propose a top-to-bottom overhaul of our institutions that plan \nand administer foreign assistance, drastically reducing the bureaucracy that \nhas built up around Government-based programmes, streamlining our delivery \nsystems and strengthening support for private-sector development and economic \nreform. \nThe Agency for International Development (AID), another institution born \nduring the cold war, needs to be fundamentally and radically overhauled. \nPromoting economic security, opportunity and competitiveness will become a \nprimary mission of the State Department. Our assistance efforts should not be \ncharity. On the contrary, they should promote mutual prosperity. Therefore, \nusing existing foreign-affairs resources, I will propose creating a $1 billion \ngrowth fund. The fund will provide grants and credits to support United \nStates businesses in providing expertise, goods and services desperately \nneeded in countries undertaking economic restructuring. \nI will also support significantly increasing the programmes of the \nExport-Import Bank to ensure that United States products and technology \npromote investment in world-wide economic growth. \nThe United States will work with its global partners, especially the G-7 \nnations, to enhance global growth at this key point in world history, as we \nend one era and begin another. \nNone of us can afford insular policies. Each of us must contribute, \nthrough greater coordinated action, to building \u00ac\u00a3 stronger world economy. \n\nI realize that what I have outlined today is an ambitious agenda. But we \nlive in remarkable times: times when empires collapse, ideologies dissolve \nand walls crumble; times when change can come so fast that we sometimes forget \nhow far and how fast we have progressed in achieving our hopes for a global \ncommunity of democratic nations. \n\nAnd in the face of today's changes, with the loss of so much that was \nfamiliar and predictable, there is now a great temptation for people \neverywhere to turn inward and to build walls around themselves walls against \ntrade, walls against people, walls against ideas and investment, walls against \nanything at all that appears new and different. \nAs the Berlin Wall fell, these walls too must fall. They must fall \nbecause we cannot separate our fate from that of others. Our peace is so \ninterconnected, our security so intertwined, our prosperity so interdependent, \nthat to turn inward and retreat from the world is to invite disaster and \ndefeat. \nAt the threshold of a new century we can truly say a more peaceful, more \nsecure, more prosperous future beckons to us. For the sake of our children \nand our grandchildren, for the sake of those who perished during the cold war \nand for the sake of every man, woman and child who kept freedom's flame alive \neven during the darkest noon, let us pledge ourselves to make that future \nreal, and let us pledge ourselves to fulfil the promise of a truly United \nNations. \nThank you and may God bless you all. \n"

        "file_text": " I take this opportunity warmly to \ncongratulate you. Sir, on your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh \nsession of the General Assembly. We know that we are in capable hand as we \nface the important tasks ahead of us. I should also like to express my \nappreciation to your predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, \nfor the distinguished manner in which he guided the General Assembly during \nthe last session. \nIt was one year ago that the General Assembly honoured the Republic of \nthe Marshall Islands by granting it membership in the United Nations. On this \nanniversary, as we reflect on our times, we note that a central feature of the \ninternational political landscape of the past several years has been the \nemergence or the re-emergence of the nationalities. \nIt is our grave responsibility to serve our nations during this \nchallenging period of transition and development. Throughout the world we are \nseeing the advent of self-government by nations. The sovereignty and dignity \nof indigenous peoples are coming to be recognized as the basis for effective \ngovernment. In the Marshall Islands, as in other developing countries \nthroughout the world, we have set high aspirations for our nation and we seek \nexpanded opportunities for our people. Our children will no longer be denied \n\nachievement of their potential because of the time and place into which they \nwere born. They will be the hope and the pride of our nation, and our future. \nWe are grateful to the United Nations for its steadfast commitment to \nfostering the self-government and self-determination of peoples. For many \npeoples, it has been a long time coming. \nLike so many countries, large and small, the Marshall Islands was for \nfour and a half decades relegated to one camp of the great cold-war struggle. \nIn the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, the residents of Bikini \nand Enewetak Atolls in the Northern Marshall Islands were relocated from their \nancestral homes so that the United States Government could conduct an \nextensive and widely publicized programme of testing atomic and nuclear \nweapons. Even though the testing programme was discontinued in the late \n1950s, our Government and people are still coming to terms with its effects on \nour health and way of life. We have many good reasons to applaud the end of \nthe cold war. \n \nThe breakdown of the two contending camps has left a world in which we \ncan no longer conveniently apply the simple classification of nations into the \nEastern bloc or the Western block. It is a time fraught with uncertainty and \nrisk, but it is also a time for rethinking our concepts of government and its \nrelation to individual citizens. And with this rethinking we must see that \ngreater responsibilities are opened to mankind. \nWe are finding that the expediencies that once worked in the cold war \ncentres of power are too broad, too large in scale, too impersonal, for the \nsmaller nations. Development is now taking place on a more human scale. The \ngrowth of nations is providing the context for human ingenuity to assert \nitself with fewer restraints. The progress of the past decade has resulted in \na greater portion of mankind than ever before living in situations of \npolitical and economic freedom. Increasingly, the human spirit has been able \nto soar unfettered by restraints and regulations imposed by authorities too \ndistant from individuals' circumstances. \nIn a setting of liberty, the individual is empowered to advance to the \nextent of his ability. For many years teachers in the Marshall Islands have \nsought to implement the wise insight of Marcus Aurelius: \n\\\"Give a man a fish and you have fed him for a day. Teach a man to fish \nand you have fed him for ever.\\\" \nSome of our teachers have even convinced themselves that this is Marshallese \nfolk wisdom! But at least they recognize that the most effective help is \nself-help. \nThe exchange of ideas and the reduction of trade barriers have served to \ndraw mankind together. People throughout the world are now cooperating in the \ndevelopmental process. In no nation do people live in the isolation that our \n \nancestors did only a century ago and that some people endured until the end \nof the cold war. But, in the face of modernization, the people and places of \nthe world have retained their particular attributes, and these are now giving \nforce and cohesion to their national characters. \nThe past year has seen the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. At this \nhistoric gathering the nations of the world agreed to pursue their \ndevelopmental goals in a manner that will sustain the ecological diversity of \nour planet. We in the Marshall Islands, living on low-lying coral atolls and \nislands, have been following with great interest the scientific debate over \nglobal warming. The same careful approach that we have applied to evaluating \nthe impact of nuclear testing in our islands is also being applied to the \npossible dangers of a rise in sea level. In this regard, I am pleased to \nreiterate the call that President Amata Kabua of the Marshall Islands made at \nthe Rio Summit for the United Nations to convene a follow-up Earth Summit in \n1995, coinciding with the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. \nIf global warming endangers certain regions and certain modes of life, we \nhave to confirm the risks and inform our citizens about them. An environment \nat risk will be a significant constraint for the developing nations in the \nlate twentieth century. Nevertheless, our concern for environmental quality \nneed not put a halt to the developmental process. Instead, it will be part of \nthe overall situation to which individuals will respond with creativity and \nproductivity. \nWith the assistance of the United Nations, the people of our countries \nwill continue to benefit from the international structure of trade, cultural \nexchanges, environmental studies and the resolution of disputes. \n\nThe heart of the United Nations consists of the many Member \nnation-States. The rich mix of nationalities is certainly complicating the \nmap of the world. Our challenge is to find collective benefit in this \ndiversity. \nAs a primary obligation, of course, we must meet basic human needs that \nare beyond local capabilities: collectively, we can help feed the starving \nrefugees of Somalia; we can commit our manpower and financial resources to \nhelp bring peace to the Middle East and in the Balkan States; we can provide \nemergency assistance to the victims of natural disasters; we can continue to \nwork towards the eradication of the great plagues. In these situations, where \nthe human need is greatest, the United Nations is admirably serving its \npurposes. In addition, the techniques and processes made available by the \nagencies of the United Nations have helped provide our citizens with security \nand basic public services. \nOn the other hand, the preservation of cultural diversity, and probably \nthe preservation of environmental diversity, will require the direct \ncommitment of nations and individuals. In an era of national consciousness, \nmost matters of public policy, even those with international consequences, are \ngoing to be worked out at the national level - and frequently locally and \nindividually. \nLet us celebrate the diverse nationalities, and do everything in our \npower to nurture our peoples and enable them to lead lives that are full and \ncontented and peaceful."

        "file_text": " Once again the nations of the world meet \nin full assembly in this Hall to discuss the state of our world, to report on \nour actions of the past year, and to express the focus of our intentions in \nthe coming years. Many of us had hoped that this might be a time for \ncelebration, a time for rejoicing, as the deep freeze of a lengthy cold war \ngave way to the soothing warmth of a new era of enlightenment, understanding, \ncaring and purpose. \nBut we have little joy, and our celebration was certainly short-lived. \nWhatever insights we may have gained from the cruel and terrible events of the \npast half century are sorely needed now, in a world that breeds new forms of \ntyranny, hatred and brutality almost on a daily basis. Many people in this \nHall have seen the evidence up close: the bullets, the bodies, and the fear \nin ordinary men and women, frequently in their own countries. \nThere is, however, no need to lose hope: we have the capacity, and we \nmust continue to build for the future. What we need is the collective will, \nand I believe that it is in this United Nations, this global forum, that we \nmust dedicate ourselves to securing the peace and stability which have evaded \nmany generations before us, and must build a new world, individual by \nindividual, nation by nation. \nBut, we must remove the double standards that are everywhere. What good \nare words spoken in this Hall if people at home are unable to speak freely? \nWhy exercise the art of diplomacy here, if it is not supported at home by the \nscience of justice and the skilful application of the rule of law? Can we \nhope to manage, together, an ever more challenging world when many of our own \nhouses are in disorder? \nWe in Canada, at this very moment, are engaged in our own process of \nrebuilding, rededication and renewal, a continuing process in real \ndemocracies. In four weeks, millions of Canadians will exercise the ultimate \ndemocratic right by deciding, through their votes, whether to accept or reject \na proposal for fundamental reform of our Canadian Constitution. If accepted, \nand I have no doubt that it will be, this reform will build on the values and \nrights which are already a proud part of the Canadian reality. It will \nstrengthen existing guarantees and protection for the rights of minorities, \nimprove the functioning of our already highly regarded democratic \ninstitutions, bring greater social and economic justice to our native peoples, \nand reallocate fundamental roles and responsibilities between levels of \ngovernment, \nI am confident that the vast majority of Canadians will support this \nreform because it is based on fundamental values to which every Canadian \nsubscribes: unswerving respect for the rights of the individual, supported by \nthe rule of law; a strong and deep attachment to democracy, its values and its \ninstitutions; a passionate commitment to social justice and economic progress \nfor all; respect for national and international obligations; and a will to \nresolve differences peacefully through conciliation, compromise and consensus.* \nAs Canadians, we have learned that democracy and freedom can be \nmaintained only by vision and constant vigilance. New ideas for the future \nmust be grounded in the fundamentals that were the original basis for our \nunity. As Prime Minister Brian Mulroney told Canadians in introducing our \nConstitution: \n\\\"What Canada's leaders have produced is a series of constitutional \nreforms that strengthen the bonds that brought us together in 1867. \nThese reforms renew the concepts that are at the core of Confederation. \nThey provide a strong framework, a solid foundation, to let us move \nconfidently into the future together.\\\" \nObviously, a strong and united Canada is important for Canadians, but it is \nalso of fundamental importance to the nations of the world. \nThe values which Canadians hold, and which we have brought to the world \nthroughout our first 125 years as a nation, are also the values which are \nfundamental to the Charter of this Organization. \nIt is our belief that here at the United Nations we are not in need of \nbetter principles; the drafters of the original Charter have served us well. \nWhat we need from this Organization and its Members is the will to act. And \nwe need deeper understanding of the root causes of conflict between nations, \nso that together we can \n\\\"break the chain of violence,... defuse the lust for revenge,... voice \n[the peoples\\\"] needs,... affirm their dignity\\\" (A/40/PV.47. p. 23) \nas our Prime Minister said in this Assembly on the fortieth anniversary of the \nUnited Nations seven years ago. \nI believe that the United Nations has taken up that challenge, and I \nsalute the Secretary-General for his vision and leadership and for his courage \nin making the Organization more relevant in and to our time. His report, \\\"An \nAgenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277), lights our path to the future. \nThe Secretary-General also made the important link between peace nations \nand peace within nations when he pointed out: \n\\\"There is an obvious connection between democratic practices such as \nthe rule of law and transparency in decision-making and the \nachievement of true peace and security in any new and stable political \norder.\\\"(A/47/277, para. 59) \nThere are within nation-States three fundamental weaknesses which can \ncause disputes that go beyond their borders. Primary among these is the \nabsence or abuse of fundamental human rights. If people have no rights, they \nhave no hope; if they have no hope, eventually they will have no fear; and if \nthey have no fear, they will seek any possible means to restore their rights, \neven killing and dying in the trying. It is a pattern for instability, a \npattern for failure, one that has been repeated all too often in the past. \nThe United Nations must lead in the field of human rights. In El \nSalvador, Cambodia, Croatia, Bosnia, and Somalia efforts to protect human \nrights are of fundamental importance in attempts to bring peace to these \ntroubled lands. Canada, by the way, is currently serving in all of those \nplaces. \nThe 1993 World Conference on Human Rights offers a unique opportunity \nfor all Members of the United Nations to work in a constructive and \ncooperative spirit to strengthen the foundation of universal respect for human \nrights. \nParticularly insidious among the forms of human-rights abuse is \nsystematic discrimination, whether based on gender, race, or ethnic origin. \nViolence against women remains one of the most serious forms of \nhuman-rights abuse. Canada initiated and strongly supports the current work \nin the United Nations for the adoption of a universal declaration on violence \nagainst women, \nIn another context, to eliminate employment discrimination we must also \nensure the election and appointment of more women to senior positions in \nnational and international decision-making bodies, including the United \nNations. This has been a cornerstone of my Prime Minister's domestic and \ninternational appointments policy. \nBut no group should be marginalized; all views, all experiences are \nimportant. To this end, Canada is proud to be at the forefront of efforts to \nprepare for the International Year for the World's Indigenous People, 1993, \nwhen the international community will turn its attention as never before to \nthe rights of the world's indigenous peoples. Our recently concluded \nconstitutional negotiations in Canada include major advances for indigenous \npeoples in our own country, which will end years of injustice and inequality \nin some aspects. \nAs this special Year begins, we also mark the end of the Decade of \nDisabled Persons. We must continue to remove barriers to the full \nparticipation and integration of persons with disabilities. It is our \nhope that a consensus for ongoing collaboration can be reached in Montreal, \nwhere on 8 and 9 October my colleague, the Honourable Robert de Cotret, \nCanada's Secretary of State, will host an international meeting of Ministers \nresponsible for persons with disabilities. \nThis past year has seen the resurgence of a particularly vile form of \nabuse of human rights. Canada protests in the strongest possible terms the \nabhorrent practice of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\". Whatever reason for it, wherever it \nexists, it represents the basest form of inhumanity and abuse of the \nindividual, and cannot be tolerated by the world community and this \nOrganization. \nIn this connection, Canada calls for the drafting of a statute by the \nInternational Law Commission to establish an international criminal court. \nFor this purpose, Canada will shortly convene an international meeting of \nexperts to mobilize legal expertise on this important matter. \nA second major weakness within many nation-States is the absence of a \ndeveloped system of democratic values and institutions, and this, too, may \nultimately lead to conflict, \nOne should not be fooled by the outward trappings of democracy. How can \npeace flourish when a democratically elected leader is placed under house \narrest, as in Myanmar, or a democratically elected Government is violently \noverthrown, as in Haiti? \nA true and lasting democracy requires time and understanding, like a \ntrue and lasting friendship. And it requires two-way trust between a nation's \npeoples and its leaders. \nWe recognize the enormous challenges facing countries where democracy is \nin its early stages. We must all promote a climate of trust within these \nemerging democracies, so that new ideas have time to flourish and take root. \nCanada is doing this through its aid programmes and by its participation in \nthe social and economic agencies of the Organization. \nA third major weakness within nation-States is the inability to make \nresponsible choices in the management of public policy. Good governance is \nimportant, because it ensures that in the provision of government programmes \nand the distribution of government resources adequate attention is paid to \nsocial justice, health and education. It also promotes equitable economic \nopportunity through the development of a free market system. Ultimately, \nthese are the means to defeat poverty and to ensure that arms purchases and \nspending on the military are not excessive. \nCanada's own assistance to developing countries is increasingly focused \non and tied to their efforts to protect basic human rights, to develop \ndemocratic values and institutions, and to undertake good governance in their \npolicies and programmes. \nWe urge other Member States and the General Assembly to adopt a similar \nphilosophy and similar practices if we are to eradicate the seeds of conflict \nfrom within nation-States. \nThese are, of course, resolutions for long-term prevention of conflict. \nIn the meantime, however, we cannot ignore the current state of the world, and \nthat is why the Secretary-General's report, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", is such an \nimportant and pivotal document for this General Assembly. \nCanada is no stranger to the process of bringing peace to, and keeping \npeace, in all the regions of the world. \nOf the 45,000 peace-keeping forces currently serving under the United \nNations flag, close to 4,300, or almost 10 per cent, are Canadian. No other \nnation has made a greater commitment to United Nations peace-keeping than \nCanada. Canada has served in virtually every United Nations peace-keeping \nmission, and Canadians currently serve in such varied missions as those in \nEl Salvador, Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia, Somalia and the Middle East. \nOur experience in these and other missions has taught us that no two \nmissions are the same, and our experience has also taught us that \npeace-keeping, which is not even mentioned in the United Nations Charter, is a \ndynamic concept that must be further refined to meet the challenges of the \n1990s and beyond. Consequently, we are very pleased that the \nSecretary-General consulted so broadly on this matter, and we are also pleased \nthat much of our own experience and many of our suggestions are reflected in \nhis final report. \nWe commend the Secretary-General's emphasis on preventive diplomacy and \npeace-making as the preferred options. We encourage him to continue to use \nall of the means at his disposal to defuse crises, from fact-finding missions \nto mediation. We consider it the duty of all Member States to share with the \nSecretary-General all information that can help him to fulfil his role. \nWe strongly support the concept of preventive peace-keeping, and we urge \nthe Security Council to adopt this option when lives can be saved, \nconfrontation averted or democracy stabilized. In Kosovo, for example, \npreventive diplomacy by the Security Council and the Secretary-General may \nwell prevent bloodshed and anarchy such as is seen in much of the rest of the \nregion. \nIn the area of peace-making, we agree that the Secretary-General should \ncontinue to use mediation and negotiation to facilitate the process of peace, \nand that the Security Council should avail itself of the provisions of the \nCharter that permit it to recommend appropriate measures for dispute \nsettlement. \nWe also agree that there is a broader role for the International Court of \nJustice and that pursuant to Article 96 of the Charter, the Secretary-General \nbe authorized to take advantage of the advisory competence of the Court. \nI have already alluded to the 4,300 Canadian men and women, 20 per cent \nof our military forces, who are currently committed to United Nations \npeace-keeping operations. Canada has for many years maintained a battalion on \nstand-by for United Nations peace-keeping operations. We also have a \nlongstanding policy whereby members of other Canadian forces can be and have \nbeen called upon for peace-keeping duties. We are prepared to confirm \nCanadian arrangements through an exchange of letters with the Secretariat, as \nsuggested in the Secretary-General's report. We urge other countries to do \nthe same. \nWe agree with the need to make available human-rights monitors, electoral \nofficials, refugee and humanitarian specialists and police whatever the \nsituation calls for. We have committed, for example, 45 members of the Royal \nCanadian Mounted Police to serve with United Nations civilian forces in the \nformer Yugoslavia. And let me add, we believe that countries that make \navailable such civilian experts to the United Nations should have their \nsupplemental costs reimbursed. \nWhereas \\\"peace-keeping\\\" has become very much central to United Nations \naction and philosophy, the concepts of \\\"peace enforcement\\\" and \n\\\"peace-building\\\" are less familiar. We in Canada believe, however, that both \nwill have an increasing role in the future, if the international community is \ntruly dedicated to ending conflict and to enhancing democracy. \nOf the two, the use of \\\"enforcement\\\" is the more controversial. Recent \nevents demonstrate that the use of force may be a necessary option, and we \nurge full consideration of the Secretary-General's views in this regard. For \nour part, we insist on the right of Member States to take part in any decision \ninvolving their nationals. We also believe that further work is required on \nan urgent basis to determine the circumstances under which enforcement \nactivities should be undertaken and the limits of potential enforcement action. \n\\\"Peace-building\\\", on the other hand, has been undertaken, most notably in \nthe multidimensional United Nations activities in Cambodia and El Salvador. \nThese operations are long, difficult and costly. \nBuilding lasting peace is critical despite those obstacles, not only \nbecause of the stability, opportunity and safety it brings to the people most \ndirectly affected, but because in the long run it is less difficult, less \ndisruptive, and probably less costly than continued hostilities. \nCanada, while active in both El Salvador and Cambodia, is fully prepared \nas well to assist the United Nations in expanding and shaping its approach to \npeace-building in the future. \nWe support the Secretary-General's proposals for improving the \neffectiveness and timeliness of peace-keeping operations, and, most notably, \nfor the establishment of a peace-keeping start-up fund of $50 million, and the \nother proposals in his report. \nAll Member States must pay their dues fully and on time. In May of this \nyear, in the presence of the Secretary-General, Prime Minister Mulroney noted \npublicly that money is the clearest measure of political will. He went on to \nsay: \n\\\"The Secretary-General of the United Nations, the holder of one of \nthe most important offices in the world, should not be treated as a \nmodern-day mendicant, forced to wander around wealthy capitals imploring \nthe decision-makers to pay their bills so that the United Nations can do \nits job the next day. He must be free to devote his entire time and \nenergy to running the United Nations and solving global problems, rather \nthan passing the hat for peace and security.\\\" \nFinancing a la carte will, over time, erode the United Nations financial \nbase and also weaken the commitment of Member States to the broad range of its \nactivities. \nCanada is opposed to the recent decision of the Security Council to \nenlarge the mandate of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) at no \ncost to the United Nations, with the cost to be borne by the participating \ncountries. This sets an unfortunate precedent, and it goes against the United \nNations principle of collective responsibility. \nWe also have serious concerns about certain long-standing missions, such \nas the one in Cyprus, where Canadians and others have served for 28 years. In \nCyprus an entire generation has grown up regarding the presence of \npeace-keepers as part of their everyday norm. \nWe cannot allow the parties in any dispute to institutionalize permanent \npeace-keepers so that they are just another aspect of the status quo. This is \nsimply unacceptable. The parties involved must accept their responsibility \ndirectly and work with the Secretary-General to find a resolution without \nfurther delay. \nWe are interested in the Secretary-General's suggestion for increasing \ncooperation with regional arrangements and organizations in functions such as \npreventive diplomacy, peace-keeping, peace-making and peace-building. I \nmyself have encouraged the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to \ndevelop some of these mechanisms, and Canada, working within the Organization \nof American States, remains dedicated to a return to democracy in Haiti. \nThere is no doubt in my mind that regional efforts in preventive \ndiplomacy and peace-making should be encouraged. I hope that future \ndevelopments in those institutions will enable them to carry out peace-keeping \noperations under certain circumstances. But it is the United Nations which \nwill continue to have the ultimate authority. \nExpanding the circle of peace-keeping and peace-making organizations may \nserve to reduce some of the disproportionate burden that in the past certain \ncountries, such as Canada, have willingly assumed. Future needs, however, \nwill require a broadening of participation by Member States. \nMember States also have a direct responsibility to reduce the numbers and \nkinds of weapons that are available for conflict. Last year we in this \nAssembly took a major step to increase transparency in arms sales and to \ninhibit excessive build-ups of conventional weaponry, with the establishment \nof the United Nations arms register. This year we can take two even more \nimportant steps. The General Assembly, at this session, will launch the \npreparations for the extension of the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty in \n1995. An indefinite extension is the only option. \nFrance and Russia have declared nuclear-testing moratoriums. Other \nnuclear Powers the United States, the United Kingdom and China have no \nreason not to join them. All nuclear-weapon States should observe an \nimmediate moratorium on nuclear testing and should summon up the political \nwill and energy to negotiate a comprehensive test-ban treaty. \nWe are seeing some progress. After many years of difficult negotiations, \nour negotiators at the Conference on Disarmament have succeeded in producing \na chemical-weapons Convention that, when implemented, will ban all chemical \nweapons for ever. I urge all Member States to join Canada as original \nsignatories when that Convention is opened for signature in Paris next year. \nThere are other substantive issues that I should have liked to discuss in \ngreater detail before the General Assembly today - notably, the follow-up to \nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in \nRio de Janeiro, where Canada's Prime Minister expressed his strong support for \nconventions on climate change and on biological diversity, in a ringing call \nto action: \n\\\"As political leaders\\\", \nhe told his fellow nation-builders, \n\\\"our job is to force the pace and stretch out the limits of international \ncooperation. Nations ... have the human genius to create a world free \nfrom deprivation and secure from degradation. What remains is for \nGovernments to provide the leadership the world so desperately needs.\\\" \nThe job of the General Assembly is to continue to stretch those limits and to \ndemonstrate that leadership through the establishment of a commission on \nsustainable development and a conference on the high seas. \nThere are as well, of course, many issues of process, such as reform of \nthe United Nations development system, that require our immediate time and \nattention. Canada put forward detailed proposals in this regard in July in \nthe Economic and Social Council, and will continue to take an active role and \ninterest in this matter. \nWhat a large task we have set for ourselves. But one of the lessons that \nwe have learned in the post-cold-war era is that there is no breathing space, \nthere is no long pause for contemplation and reflection. Decisions must be \nmade on a timely basis, and when those decisions are made, all Member States \nmust vigorously support and abide by them. \nLast month, at the London Conference on the former Yugoslavia, I made it \nclear that Canada is losing patience with much of the posturing that, \nhistorically, has masqueraded as international diplomacy. I know that others \nin the Assembly share this frustration. But, as we speak, the body count \nrises in what is left of Bosnia and Herzegovina not to mention the thousands \nof men, women and children who are facing starvation in Somalia. The United \nNations needs the commitment of its Member States, it needs well-thought-out \nand timely decisions, and it needs follow-up action. Anything less is failure. \nLet us not spend the next four or five years debating the niceties of \nthis principle or that concept; let us all get on with the everyday job of \nbuilding peace and security. No one should be here who is not prepared to \nwork towards those noble objectives, and no one should leave here without \nconfirming his or her commitment to working together for the benefit of all \nthe peoples of the world.

        "file_text": "Allow me at the \noutset to extend to you the congratulations of the delegation of the Kingdom \nof Morocco on your election as President of the forty-seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly. We are confident that your presiding over our deliberations \nwill yield the best of results. \nI should like to assure you of our full cooperation so as to facilitate \nyour mission and render successful your endeavour, bearing in mind the \n\nimportance of the items on our agenda in these critical times and taking into \naccount the good relations that exist between our two countries. \nI should like to commend your predecessor, Mr. Shihabi, Permanent \nRepresentative of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for the wise manner in \nwhich he conducted the work of our last session at a time of grave crises and \nrapid developments. \nI am also pleased to welcome the new Secretary-General of our \nOrganization, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and wish to extend to him our highest \nregard and assure him of our support for the tireless efforts he has exerted \nsince he assumed his new post at the beginning of this year. We should also \nlike to commend him for the brilliant work entitled \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\", which \nhe submitted to the Security Council for its consideration and which our \nAssembly will have to reflect upon in the coming days. \nI also wish to pay tribute to his predecessor, \nMr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, former Secretary-General of our Organization, and \nto commend the praiseworthy efforts and successful initiatives he undertook \nthroughout his 10 years in office as Head of the United Nations. Thanks to \nhis wise and skilful handling of disputes between Member States, \nMr. Perez de Cuellar earned the sympathy, esteem and cooperation of all. The \nsensitivity and caring he showed toward the developing countries in defending \ntheir rights and interests is highly appreciated. \nI am also pleased to welcome the delegations of the friendly countries \nthat, in recent months, have become Members of the United Nations. Morocco \nwas among the first countries to extend its recognition to those States, and I \nam pleased to greet the representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and \n\nHerzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, San Marino, \nSlovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. We hope that these \ncountries will make progress, be successful and enter into an era of peace and \nsecurity so as to allow the international community to benefit from their \npolitical, intellectual and economic capabilities. \nThe events of the last two years produced radical changes that have put \npaid to one era in the history of international relations and ushered in a new \none, which we are still trying to come to grips with. The ideological, \npolitical and economic gap between East from West has disappeared with the \nending of the cold war and the emergence of a group of newly independent \nstates which are trying to find a. foothold in the international arena. In the \nmeantime, the other States of the world, large and small, are trying to \nreassess their positions in the new and unclear political equation of the \nworld. \nAt the same time, attempts are being made to create a new world order of \nunclear outlines and unknown objectives. \nNevertheless, upon reflecting on what is being said from time to time \nregarding these attempts, one can surmise that the new world order might be \nbased on the principles of democracy, a market economy and respect for human \nrights. \n\nThese are principles which, we believe, are quintessentially positive. \nHowever, we have certain queries regarding the terms of their application and \ntheir real content. Indeed, the world is made up of States and peoples whose \npolitical, economic and economic stages of development vary and whose material \nconditions, natural resources and cultures are vastly different. This fact \nleaves no room for a mechanical application of the aforementioned principles. \nSystems that may be appropriate for a developed rich country may not \nnecessarily be suitable for a developing third world country without proper \nadjustment to its particular circumstances or the assurance that the \napplication of such principle would be beneficial in its case. \nWe fully support scrupulous respect for human rights and believe that no \none with any common sense can deny such rights. We believe that human rights \nissues, in their political context based on respect for individual liberties \nand the rule of law, will inevitably prevail. \nIn other words, the social and economic aspects of human rights are of \nfar-reaching importance and should be carefully addressed by every State. It \nis regrettable, however, that the developing countries cannot fully control \ntheir economic issues in today's circumstances. Recent economic trends have \nintegrated the economies of all countries into one global entity. That is why \nthe recession that recently hit the economies of some developed countries has \nhad a negative and harmful impact on the economies of the developing world. \nIt has aggravated their debt burdens, reduced the prices of their basic \ncommodities, and compounded their economic and social problems. \nThe integration of local economies in a global framework and the \ninterdependence of societies and interests underline the need for a global \ndialogue in which we can all engage before a just and equitable new world \norder can be established. \n \nIt is no longer feasible to exclude the overwhelming majority of States \nfrom the participation in the decision-making process in relation to issues \nthat affect the entire international community on the political, economic, and \nsocial levels. \nWe believe that the United Nations is the best forum in which to conduct \nsuch a dialogue with a view to laying the foundations of what the \nSecretary-General, in his latest report on the work of the Organization, \ncalled an international partnership for development based on the principles of \nequity, sovereignty, common interest, and mutual responsibility. \nWithout such dialogue, it would be difficult if not impossible to ensure \nthe stability of the world economy or to alleviate the difficulties facing the \ndeveloping countries. Starvation, debt burden, shortages of economic and \nsocial needs, and the illegal immigration of the unemployed to the developed \nworld would remain hardships afflicting not only the countries of the South \nbut the countries of the North as well. \nIn saying this, we do not wish to engage in any negative diatribes of \ncriticism or accusations. We simply want to highlight certain facts that \nshould not be forgotten at a time when numerous signs indicate that the \nformulation of a new world order is at hand. In other words, the North and \nthe South are today linked by mutual interests mere than ever before, and \nshould therefore shoulder their shared responsibilities in a world that is \nundergoing profound changes. \nIt is in this spirit that we have invited our partners in the European \nCommunity to reconsider the traditional approach to their cooperation with \nMorocco. The understanding with which they have received this proposal is a \nsource of special satisfaction to us. Morocco has long enjoyed a special \nrelationship with the European Community, the framework of which has been made \n\nredundant by current and future stakes. Consequently, we are happy that both \nparties are now convinced that it is in their mutual interest to carry out \nqualitative and radical changes in their relations through the establishment \nof a free-trade zone and a partnership in various fields. We look forward to \nthe extension of this kind of positive cooperation to relations between the \nEuropean Community and the other members of the Arab Maghreb Union so as to \nopen new prospects for a. more balanced and beneficial relationship. \nThe dialogue initiated between the States of South-Western European and \nthe States of the Arab Maghreb Union was an encouraging start in which a \nclimate of mutual understanding prevailed. A series of principles were laid \ndown with a view to enhancing cooperation between the two shores of the \nWestern Mediterranean basin, where traditions of close historical ties have \nexisted for centuries in various fields. We therefore hope that the Five plus \nFive Group will soon be able to overcome the present obstacles and to resume \nits dialogue, which we believe will contribute positively to the consolidation \nof the foundations of stability and cooperation in the region. \nMorocco firmly believes that the establishment of the emergence of the \nArab Maghreb is inevitable and that its setting up on sound and solid \nfoundations is more than necessary and beneficial to the countries of that \nregion, the Mediterranean, and the entire world. This is a conviction that is \nshared by all peoples of the Maghreb, linked as they are by history, religion, \nlanguage, and culture. \n\nTo be sure, the Maghreb Arab Union encountered some obstacles at the \noutset, as has been the experience of others in similar circumstances. \nHowever, we are determined to overcome such obstacles and to move forward with \na view to implementing the agreed principles and, in particular, to bring \nabout the economic integration which would revitalize the economies of our \ncountries and reinforce the foundations of our development. \nNot far away from the Arab Maghreb, the Middle East region continues to \nbe in the grip of tensions which have persisted for over 40 years, as a result \nof the Palestinian question and the attendant Middle East crisis. However, \nour consideration of this question at this session is accompanied by certain \nfavourable indications as it takes place in the wake of the ever face-to-face \nmeeting between Arabs and Israelis, in Madrid in 1991, and the subsequent \nmeetings of the parties to the conflict, with participation by the States \ninvolved. \nWe welcome this tendency. Morocco has always advocated dialogue, in the \nconviction that there can be no peace without it. It was in this spirit that \nMorocco took several initiatives towards that end, both at the Arab summit \nmeetings it hosted and at other international forums. \nAlthough the process that was initiated at the Madrid Conference has run \ninto a number of difficulties, recent political changes in Israel are \nencouraging indications with regard to the implementation of Security Council \nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), and the land-for-peace principle, as a \nbasis for a settlement of the Israeli-Arab conflict. \nThe very fact that dialogue has been initiated is a positive and \nconstructive step which, we hope, will lead to the implementation of the \naforementioned principles and thus make it possible to achieve progress \ntowards the desired equitable and definitive solution to these problems. \n\nHenceforth, the peoples of the region, who have for too long suffered the \nvicissitudes of colonialism, instability and cold war will be able, like other \npeoples of the world, to enjoy a new era of cooperation and prosperity. \nAnother source of concern is the continued state of tension in the Gulf \nregion in the wake of the Gulf war which has left deep scars in the Arab \nworld. We understand the bitterness engendered by that war, just as we \nappreciate the sensitivities of the peoples and officials in the region \nbecause of the tragedies that afflicted them. We also realize the gravity of \nthe decisions which have left the Arab world torn asunder. \nHowever, we are convinced that the wisdom and far-sightedness of our \nbrethren will prevail, and that reason will overcome passion in order to \nallow outstanding problems to be solved and the Arab world to return to \nsolidarity, cooperation and understanding. In this regard, the Kingdom of \nMorocco, as is its custom, is engaged in sustained efforts to unify Arab ranks \nand to seek common positions. \nThe events of the past few years in Europe have diverted world attention \nfrom the situation in Africa. Thus, a whole continent has been forgotten and \nmarginalized, regardless of its deepening economic crisis, the aggravation of \nits foreign debt problems and the collapsing prices of its export raw \nmaterials. It is regrettable to note that the special session of the General \nAssembly in 1986 devoted to the economic situation in Africa has not helped \nthe African economies, which since them have noticeably deteriorated. \nIt is equally regrettable that the aid provided to Africa by the \ndeveloped countries has been limited to meagre humanitarian aid to the \nvictims of natural disasters and other endemic scourges such as famine and \ndrought. The African economic crisis is cause for great concern, as stressed \nby the Secretary-General, in his latest report on the activities of the \n\nOrganization (A/47/1). We believe it is the duty of the developed countries \nto pay particular attention to the problems of development in Africa with a \nview to rebuilding the foundations of the African economy through a special \nprogramme that should be set up for that purpose as has been done recently in \nthe case of Central and Eastern Europe. \nMorocco, which has always paid particular attention to the problems of \nour continent, remains faithful to the bonds of brotherhood, friendship and \nsolidarity which bind us to our sisterly African countries. In this context, \nMorocco wishes to reaffirm its solidarity with the states of Africa, which \nhave been adversely affected and would recall that, despite the difficulties \nof the Moroccan economy, it earmarks 95 per cent of its international \ncooperation budget to the assistance of brotherly African peoples. \nWhile we welcome the imminent end to a number of African political \ncrises, we are still concerned by the persistence of hotbeds of tension caused \nby internal problems and by civil wars and their tragic consequences. \nMy country welcomes the recent developments in Angola which have led to a \nprocess of accommodation under United Nations auspices following the signature \nof an agreement between the parties to the conflict. Therefore, Morocco has \ncontributed a national contingent to the United Nations Angola Verification \nMission II, and hopes that the implementation of this agreement will help \nre-establish peace and harmony in this friendly country. \nThe international community has been shocked by the Somali tragedy, which \nis unprecedented in the annals of history. The civil war and tribal rivalries \nhave effectively torn that country apart, destroyed its institutions and its \neconomy and have led to utter anarchy. Furthermore, they have caused a famine \nthat has resulted in thousands of deaths, mainly amongst the very young and \nthe very old. \n \nWe are grateful to all those who send humanitarian assistance to the \npeople of Somalia and welcome the decision by the Security Council to dispatch \nthe United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) to monitor the situation and \ncoordinate the distribution of humanitarian assistance. We appeal to the \ninternational community to continue to send such assistance to this afflicted \npeople. \nAs for South Africa, we have noted with satisfaction the resumption of \nthe dialogue between the Government of Pretoria and the African National \nCongress (ANC) despite the recurrence of violence and actions of reprisal \namong brothers. We urge all parties to stop the violence and to show the \nspirit of tolerance and sense of responsibility which, in the past two years, \nhave helped to overcome many an obstacle. We also hope that the continuation \nof dialogue on constitutional reforms will lead rapidly to the abolition of \napartheid and to the emergence of a multi-racial, democratic and united South \nAfrica. \nSince the end of the cold war, rising extremism, nationalism and ethnic \nconflicts in some parts of the world have created hotbeds of tension and \nviolence, the most dangerous of which is Bosnia-Herzegovina. Massacres, the \nmass killing of innocent people, the terrorization of children and elderly \npeople, the incarceration of civilians in concentration camps and the \nso-called \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" perpetrated by the Serbian forces are heinous \ncrimes that offend our conscience and are a setback to the international \nefforts aimed at the elimination of practices which, we thought, had become \nthings of the past. \n\nThe Kingdom of Morocco strongly condemns those acts and calls upon the \ninternational community to stand by the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina in \npreserving their national unity, independence, territorial integrity and \ncultural identity by resorting to all the coercive measures provided for in \nthe United Nations Charter to force compliance with its decisions on this \nissue. \nThe recent recommendation of the Security Council to the General Assembly \nregarding the succession of the former Socialist Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia should be understood by the two republics of Serbia and Montenegro \nas notice served on them that they should behave as members of the \ninternational community, cooperate fully with the United Nations and desist \nfrom their heinous practices and unacceptable behaviour. \nThis year, Morocco has assumed its seat as a non-permanent Member of the \nSecurity Council. This happened at a very important juncture, when the tasks \nand responsibilities of that organ have increased substantially. \nMorocco, being an Arab and an African nation, spares no effort in \ncoordination with the countries of the two groups in bringing the \n\u201a\u00c4\u00a2 sensitivities of both groups to the deliberations of the Council. In so \ndoing, Morocco is guided by the desire to give precedence to the logic of \ndialogue, understanding and persuasion in trying to achieve the best solutions. \n! The historic events which have taken place over the past year and altered \nthe course of international relations have prompted the Members of the \nt Security Council to hold a high-level summit meeting on 31 January 1992 in \norder to consider the important developments that have taken place on the \ninternational scene, to define new priorities for the international community \nand to devise a strategy aimed at revitalizing the role of the United Nations \nand reinforcing its effectiveness. \n\nThe Kingdom of Morocco, represented by His Majesty King Hassan II, took \npart, along with other leaders of the Members of the Security Council in that \nhigh-level meeting. On that occasion, they reiterated their determination to \nuphold the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international \nlaw as well as their commitment to the preservation of international peace and \nsecurity, to disarmament and arms control, and to economic and social \ndevelopment. \nMy country wishes to commend the increasing role of our Organization in \npeace-keeping operations. That role is reflected in the many successful \noperations carried out recently throughout the world, operations in which \nUnited Nations forces have been able to effect disengagement, stop hostilities \nand bloodshed and protect people and property. \nOn the basis of the Paris Agreement signed by all parties and endorsed by \nthe Security Council, we hope that United Nations efforts in Cambodia, where \nthe United Nations has mounted the largest and most ambitious peace-keeping \noperation in its history, will lead to a lasting peace in that country. \nMorocco takes pride in its participation in the United Nations \npeace-keeping forces in Angola, Cambodia and Somalia, pride which is equalled \nonly by its commitment to fulfil its international duties and its strong \nbelief in the role of our Organization in the maintenance of international \npeace and security. \nIn spite of these accomplishments, we believe that some aspects of our \nOrganization need to be reformed if we are to make the United Nations more \neffective in serving the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of \nits Member States and to regain the desired balance between its organs. \n \nIn this regard, it is inconceivable that while we commend the increasing \nrole of the United Nations in preserving international peace and security, our \nOrganization remains inadequately funded for the achievement of that objective. \nIn his report entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", the Secretary-General made \nsubstantive proposals and recommendations, in particular on preventive \ndiplomacy and peace-keeping, peace-making and peace-building efforts. We \nfirmly believe that those recommendations deserve careful consideration by the \ndifferent organs of our Organization with a view to their adoption and \nimplementation. \nThe setting up of a new world order requires a new reading of the \nprovisions of the Charter - a Charter which was written in 1945 under \ncircumstances which differed completely from the situation in 1992. Indeed, \nthe number of Member States has increased from 51 in 1945 to 179 Member States \ntoday. The political map of the world has underwent radical changes and the \ncentres of power shifted and international economic relations have become more \ncomplex. \nThe question of so-called Western Sahara has entered its final phase \nfollowing the adoption of the United Nations peace plan in 1988 and following \nthe establishment of the cease-fire in September 1991. \nSince that time, the Security Council has given firm and complete support \nto the implementation by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative \nof the settlement plan and of the instructions devised for the organization of \nthe United Nations referendum. \nIn spite of the numerous delays which interfered with the holding of the \nreferendum - something which my country deplores the Kingdom of Morocco has \ncontinued to adhere firmly to the settlement plan and to the commitments it \nhas undertaken. \nMoreover, as underlined by the Secretary-General in his report contained \nin document S/24464 of 20 August 1992, my country continues to extend its full \ncooperation to the establishment of the mechanisms envisaged and the \nimplementation of the rules agreed upon with a view to organizing the \nreferendum as soon as possible. \nIn this context, Morocco hopes that realism will prevail over \nobstructionism and procrastination. \n\nFollowing the progress achieved recently in disarmament and the increased \nawareness of the international community of environmental issues following the \nEarth Summit in Rio this year, we should like to express our hope that those \npositive indications will be consolidated by yet another success. We hope \nthat this will be the start of a process that will rid humanity of the ills \nthat beset it in this, the last decade of the twentieth century. \nWe believe that our Organization should be the catalyst that directs all \nefforts towards the achievement of such goals. In so doing, we will pave the \nway for the generation of the next century to live in a world which is worthy \nof mankind: a haven of peace, tranquillity and prosperity. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow \nme first of all to convey to you. Sir, my most sincere congratulations, on my \nown behalf and that of my delegation, on your election to the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. I wish you every success \nin the execution of your tasks during the coming months. I also wish to pay a \ntribute to your predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia. \nI should like to give a warm welcome to all those countries that have \njoined the Organization this year, and I hope that their active participation \nin this forum will contribute to the efforts of the international community to \npreserve peace and promote justice and progress among nations. With the \nadmissions of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, \nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, San Marino, Slovenia, \nTajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, the Organization's goal of \nuniversality has been promoted. \nI should also like to convey to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali \nthe respect of the Spanish Government for his efforts and dedication in \ncarrying out the important responsibilities with which he is entrusted. You \nmay rest assured, Mr. Secretary-General, that you can count on the full \ncollaboration of the Spanish authorities. \nDuring the general debate at the forty-sixth session, the common \ndenominator of many statements heard in the General Assembly was the \ntremendous changes that had taken place in the world since the middle of the \nprevious decade. Far from abating, the pace of that trend to transformation \nhas significantly accelerate over the last 12 months. \nAt this stage of the process, it would be no exaggeration to say that we \nhave before us a new pattern of international relations. After the \ndisappearance of the East-West confrontation and its replacement by dialogue \nand cooperation, decisive progress has been made in disarmament agreements and \narms control, at both world-wide and regional levels. Long-festering regional \nconflicts have been settled or may well be on their way towards settlement. \nTo the progress made along the road to peace in Angola and Cambodia we must \nadd the process begun last year in Madrid with the opening of the Middle East \npeace conference, which constituted an invaluable point of departure for the \nsolution of the Palestinian problem and for achieving the necessary and \ndefinitive harmonious relations between Arabs and Israelis. \nLikewise, the current peace plan for Western Sahara should culminate soon \nin the holding of a referendum on self-determination under the auspices of the \nUnited Nations. \n\nI also wish to stress the progress made in the eradication of the policy \nof apartheid in South Africa. We fully support the efforts of the \nSecretary-General to put an end to violence and to encourage the resumption of \nthe internal negotiations that must lead to the total eradication of apartheid \nand to the establishment of a truly democratic regime in South Africa. \nSimilarly, the Peace Agreement signed in Chapultepec, on 16 January of \nthis year, between the Government of El Salvador and the Farabundo Marti \nNational Liberation Front constitutes a milestone of paramount importance for \nthe peace process in Central America, a region that has been in a constant \nstate of conflict for the past decade. Spain, which has so many links to that \nregion, has been and is still actively collaborating in that process through \nits participation in the Group of Friends of the Secretary-General for peace \nin El Salvador.. \nIn that connection, Spain welcomes the exemplary manner in which the \nGovernments of El Salvador and Honduras have settled their territorial, \ninsular and maritime disputes. \nThe map of Europe has undergone a profound transformation over the past \nyear. The unification of Germany now appears fully consolidated. Russia and \nthe formerly subjugated countries that recovered their independence and \nfreedom are struggling to consolidate their democracies and to overcome the \nserious economic difficulties brought on by their transition to a market \neconomy. The European Community, on its way towards union, is acquiring a \ngreater political role, in accordance with its undoubted economic strength. \nDemocratic ideals and practices and the recognition of human rights have \nreappeared vigorously not only in Eastern Europe but also in Latin America and \n\nmany African countries, despite the grave economic situation now prevailing on \nthat continent. \nThose auspicious events should not lead us to forget that the collapse of \nthe former system has opened up a great void fraught with risks in which \ndisorder may find a natural home. In some extreme cases, we are witnessing \nthe exacerbation of previously repressed or latent nationalist forces which \nare giving rise to such bloody conflicts as those at present dividing the new \nCaucasian Republics and the new States that emerged after the dissolution of \nthe former Yugoslavia. Such situations reveal that the horrors of the past \ncan always be repeated if we do not keep looking to the future. This is \nsomething that neither Europe nor the rest of the international community can \nor should allow. \nThe seriousness of the conflict now taking place in the territory of the \nformer Yugoslavia is a good example of what I have just said. In the \nConference that started in London, the many efforts of the international \ncommunity converged in an attempt to put an end to that complex conflict by \nhelping the parties to resolve their differences through the negotiations \ncurrently taking place in Geneva. Aggression, the use of force, and the \nviolation of human rights will only generate destruction and hatred and will \nmeet with the continued condemnation and determined action of the \ninternational community to put an end to them. \n \nMeanwhile, the gap between the developed and the developing countries \npersists and, in many cases, has even widened. Old conflicts have intensified \nand new ones have appeared. The tragedy presently afflicting Somalia is \npalpable proof of the terrible effects that underdevelopment, poverty, natural \ndisasters and violence can have when they coincide in time and place. This \nsituation demands greater solidarity and a swift collective response such as \nthe one decided in the framework of the United Nations, which was aimed at \nputting an end to such terrible suffering and making possible a peace process \nthat will lead to national reconciliation in that country. \nFor all these reasons, after the initial moments of surprise and \neuphoria, of perplexity and optimism in the face of what seemed to be the \nemergence of a new world order, we are now coping with the need to incorporate \nthese new changes, so as jointly to build a more just and secure international \nsociety. \nThis is the great task confronting the United Nations today. The choice \nis very clear: we cannot allow the Organization to trail behind events, \nletting itself be moulded by them. On the other hand, we can make the United \nNations an active forum and the foremost centre in the transformations \naffecting us all, capable of influencing and shaping these transformations. \nThis alternative, this leading role, which is the one desired by Spain for the \nUnited Nations, is the choice that seems to have been made by the \nSecretary-General when he drew up his excellent report entitled \\\"An Agenda for \nPeace\\\" (A/47/277),' and when he reported to the General Assembly on the work of \nthe Organization. \nI referred earlier to changes in the international climate that have made \nit possible to defuse various deeply-rooted regional conflicts. The United \n \nNations has contributed to this objective to a large extent through the \npeacemaking activities of the Secretary-General carried out in the framework \nof the peace-keeping operations. The results obtained over recent years have \nmade it possible to speak, truly, of a process of revitalization of the \nOrganization. \nHowever, the present momentum behind this process has proven \ninsufficient, as demonstrated by the persistence of some old conflicts and the \noutburst of new forms of violence. From this perspective, the Spanish \nGovernment believes that the set of suggestions put forward by Mr. \nBoutros-Ghali represents a very useful basis for a systematic and effective \nresponse by the Organization and the international community to any kind of \nconflict, whatever the causes and outcome. It is essential, to this end, to \nsecure the cooperation of all Member States in the complex tasks ranging from \nconflict-prevention to the consolidation of peace. \nThe increase and enhancement of peace-keeping operations requires a \ngrowing effort on the part of us all. Spain is aware of this and, after \nparticipating in a noteworthy manner in the United Nations Transition \nAssistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia and in the United Nations Observer Group \nin Central America (ONUCA), is contributing with a large number of army and \npolice officers to the work of the United Nations Operation in El Salvador \n(ONUSAL). Moreover, Spain is participating actively in the United Nations \nAngola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II) and is collaborating with the United \nNations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). Spain is also \nprepared to participate with a military contingent in the task of the United \nNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Finally, Spain \nprovides aid - mainly humanitarian within the framework of other operations \nestablished by the Security Council. \n\nThe peace-keeping operations have also undergone a qualitative change, as \nnew and different activities have been undertaken that go beyond their \ntraditional limits. These new dimensions require special training and a rapid \nresponse that can hardly be obtained if we do not follow the \nSecretary-General's suggestion of establishing special national units ready to \nbe rapidly deployed at the service of the Organization. Spain is prepared to \nconsider this proposal seriously after appropriate consultations with the \nother Member States and with the Secretary-General. \nNevertheless, we must bear in mind that peace cannot be made and cannot \nbe consolidated with the use of military means alone. It is necessary, \nwhenever possible, to resolve conflicts before they degenerate into armed \nhostilities, using all the means for peaceful settlement of disputes provided \nfor in the Charter. In this context, I would like to underline the \nSecretary-General's statement that greater confidence on the part of States in \nthe International Court of Justice would contribute significantly to the \nOrganization's task of peace-seeking. Spain has already given proof of this \nconfidence by recently accepting the Court's compulsory jurisdiction and by \nsupporting the possibility of authorizing the Secretary-General to request \nadvisory opinions of the Court on legal questions arising within the scope of \nhis activities. \nSpain has firmly supported the strengthening of the United Nations role \nin the field of preventive diplomacy. That is why we decided to co-sponsor \nthe initiatives leading to the approval, in 1988, of the Declaration on \nconflict-prevention and, in 1991, of the Declaration on Fact-finding by the \nUnited Nations in the Field of the Maintenance of International Peace and \nSecurity. These efforts should be enhanced, and in this connection, such \nmeasures as fact-finding missions, an early-warning system and the \n\nreinforcement of the role of regional organizations can be very useful in \npreventing conflicts which, if allowed to start, might later require the \nlaunching of a much more costly exercise for the reestablishment of peace. \nIn this sense, we also believe that all efforts that could contribute to \nthe consolidation of peace once it has been reached, should be promoted in \norder to avoid the resurgence of new conflicts over the not yet extinguished \nflames of a pre-existent conflict. In this regard, I would like to underline \nhere the considerable increase in the Organization's efforts in the field of \nhumanitarian assistance, as well as the tasks recently carried out in the \nfield of electoral assistance in countries where democracy and peaceful \ncohabitation are threatened or insufficiently established. The role of the \nOrganization on behalf of refugees has also been of great importance for the \nconsolidation of peace, as has its work in the field of disarmament and the \npromotion and defence of human rights. \nThe Member States of the Organization must be aware that the new tasks \nthat we are entrusting to the United Nations are increasing in number and \ncomplexity day by day, and are without precedent in its history. In order for \nthe Organization to be prepared to meet these new demands for international \naction, the unconditional financial backing of each of its Members is required. \nThis year, we have completed the drafting of the text of the Convention \non chemical weapons, which envisages the prohibition of the development, \nstockpiling and use of these weapons, as well as their destruction. The \nelimination of this type of weapon is a long-sought objective that should now \nbe attained. Spain decidedly supports the adoption of this Convention at this \nsession of the General Assembly, and hopes that it will soon enter into force. \n\nWe welcome the proposal of the Twelve, adopted by the General Assembly \nlast year, to create in the Secretariat a Register of Conventional Arms with \nregard to the international transfer of such arms, which envisages the \ntransmission of information by all Member States. It is necessary for all of \nus to cooperate, so that this Register may be established as the \nclearing-house for the exchange of information on all flows of conventional \narms, and in the near future to include information on other types of weapons \nand other data concerning the military capacity of States. \nTo the achievements of the Organization in the field of disarmament and \narms control must be added this year other important progress made at regional \nand world-wide levels aimed at reinforcing the stability and security of our \nplanet and thus the purposes of the United Nations. \nI am referring to the withdrawal of all tactical nuclear weapons, from \nareas where they were deployed until very recently, to the territories of the \nUnited States and the Russian Federation. We must underscore as well the \nagreements reached recently by President Bush and President Yeltsin on a \ndrastic reduction of the nuclear arsenals in their respective countries. We \nalso welcome the initiatives taken by several nuclear Powers to declare \nmoratoriums on their nuclear tests, or to reduce them to a bare minimum. \nIn the European region, one must underscore the significance of the \nTreaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and its complementary Act on \npersonnel strength, both already in force, as well as the conclusion of the \nOpen Skies Treaty and the adoption of a new series of confidence-building \nmeasures. \n\nSpain welcomes all these achievements and hopes that they will lead to \nfurther progress in this field. \nThe ultimate beneficiary of the United Nations efforts to achieve a more \npeaceful, just and secure world is undoubtedly mankind as a whole. \nThanks to a large extent to United Nations action we have made \nsignificant advances in the defence and protection of human rights and \nfundamental freedoms internationally. However, we are living in a period of \ninstability and uncertainty, in which not only economic inequalities but also \nthe resurgence of intolerance, xenophobia and exacerbated nationalism, among \nother factors, are endangering personal freedom and security. That is why it \nis necessary to intensify our efforts in this area, so as to encourage \nunderstanding and respect for the rights of individual members of minorities \nand for the needs of the most vulnerable groups of society. In this respect, \nwe consider particularly important that this Assembly approve by consensus, as \nthe Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council have \nrecently done, the draft declaration on the rights of persons belonging to \nnational, ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities. \nMy country places great hopes on the World Conference on Human Rights \nscheduled for next year in Vienna. This Conference should, on the basis of \nexisting universally accepted standards, draw the basic guidelines for our \nfuture activity in this field, so that individuals and peoples may, through \ndemocracy and development, fully enjoy the benefits of human rights and \nfundamental freedoms. \nThe achievements of the United Nations in the field of international \npeace and security contrast with the limited progress in the sphere of \neconomic and social development. The world gap between rich and poor has been \nwidening in an alarming way. The United Nations Development Programme's Human \n\nDevelopment Report for 1992 shows that the richest 20 per cent of the world \npopulation receive 82.7 per cent of total world income, whereas the poorest \n20 per cent receive only 1.4 per cent. \nThe international community cannot remain passive in the face of these \ngrave and growing disparities. The Organization, owing to its universal \nmembership and the breadth of its purposes and principles, must play a leading \nrole to guide and stimulate the establishment of guidelines for the United \nNations system as a whole, in order to find solutions to the important issues \nrelated to the development and well-being of all peoples. \nIt is necessary in this respect to strengthen the Economic and Social \nCouncil. Some progress has already been made in its restructuring, but it is \nnecessary that such restructuring be continued and deepened in order to \nrevitalize this principal organ of our Organization. It also seems necessary \nto envisage the reform of the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment (UNCTAD) in order to adapt it to the new realities, as was \nunderscored at its eighth session, held in Cartagena de Indias last February. \nWe support the establishment by the Assembly during its current session \nof a high-level Commission on Sustainable Development that was agreed to at \nthe Conference on Environment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro last \nJune, where the concept of sustainable development was identified as a central \nelement that should inspire the theory and practice of development policies in \nthe coming years. \nWe should look for new ways of dealing with the main task of attaining \nsustainable development and assign greater financial resources to this task, \nin particular by those countries that are in a position to do so. My country \nis aware of the fact that it must make an effort in proportion to its economic \ncapacity. For this reason, the President of the Spanish Government at the \n\nsummit meeting at Rio de Janeiro, after recalling that Spain had tripled its \nofficial aid over the past 10 years, made a commitment to triple its aid again \nin the course of the coming decade. This is a difficult challenge that we \nhave taken upon ourselves but one that we are ready to fulfil. \nThe world population has more than doubled over the past 40 years, and \naccording to recent estimates it will double again in the next 30 years. This \nastounding growth demands a serious analysis on the part of the international \ncommunity as well as a careful study of the consequences that it generates, \nsuch as migratory flows, the problems of large urban concentrations and the \nenormous demands it creates in the areas of food, housing, health care and \neducation. These are all issues that should be studied in depth at the \nConference on Population and Development, to be held in Cairo in 1994. \nIt is not surprising that social problems are gaining importance at the \npresent time, when many economies are undergoing tough processes of adjustment \nand others are going through difficult transitions from a central planning \nsystem to one of market economy. The summit conference on social development \nto be held in 1995 is therefore a timely initiative. Proper preparation is \nthe best guarantee for its success. The basic guiding principle for its work \nshould be the concept of human development; it should examine the necessary \nmeasures to provide greater opportunities for education, medical care and \nemployment to the world's inhabitants. It is becoming daily more obvious that \neconomic growth in itself does not automatically improve people's living \nconditions, neither within nations nor internationally. Therefore, it is \nessential to give a social dimension to the concept of economic development. \nAllow me to refer now to two great threats to society today: drug \ntrafficking and terrorism. \n\nThe drug-trafficking business is so grim and complex and has so many \nramifications that efforts to combat it must be based on the strengthening of \nnational measures and on effective international coordination and cooperation. \nThe producer countries must receive the assistance needed to grow \nalternative crops and to enable them to confront the powerful and well-armed \ndrug-trafficking organizations. Those countries producing substances likely \nto be used in the manufacture of drugs should inspect and control the exports \nof those substances. Consuming countries also responsible for the \ndrug-trafficking must strengthen programmes and measures aimed at decreasing \ndomestic demand. Moreover, perseverance is necessary in inspecting bank \naccounts used by drug traffickers and in reporting money-laundering when \nsuspicions of its connection with this illegal activity exist. Concealing \ninformation on the drug-trafficking business amounts to complicity in criminal \nactivity. \nTerrorism, for its part, continues to pose a threat to human life and to \ncoexistence between nations. It is a threat of an international character and \nas such requires international efforts for its eradication. General Assembly \nresolution 46/51, adopted by consensus last year, was a further step in United \nNations work aimed at developing greater international cooperation for this \npurpose. \nThose two threats, especially that of terrorism, are interrelated with \nillegal arms dealing, which must be combated just as firmly by the \ninternational community. \nThere is one issue whose importance for Spain is well known: the \ndecolonization of Gibraltar. I wish to restate my Government's determination \n\nto continue, with dedication and in a constructive spirit, the negotiating \nprocess with the United Kingdom established by the Brussels Declaration of \n27 November 1984, bearing in mind the doctrine of the General Assembly that \nthis is not a case of self-determination but a situation that affects the \nterritorial integrity of Spain. I trust that the negotiating efforts of both \nGovernments will soon lead to a definitive solution that, while taking into \naccount the legitimate interests of the people, will put an end to the \ncolonial status of Gibraltar a status that is clearly anachronistic and \ninappropriate to the times in which we live, especially since the General \nAssembly's proclamation of the International Decade for the Eradication of \nColonialism until the year 2000. \nLast July, in Madrid, the Heads of State and Government participating in \nthe Second Ibero-American Summit adopted a document of conclusions reaffirming \ntheir aspirations to a free, open and pluralistic society directed towards \nprogress and social justice, a society in which free rein is given to the full \nexercise of individual freedoms and in which no one is excluded or \npersecuted. I am certain that this is an ideal we all share. \nThe Ibero-American Summit declared itself in favour of reforming the \nUnited Nations system and stressed the need to give it momentum so that it \ncould respond more efficiently to the will of all its Member States. The \ncelebration, in 1995, of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations will \nbe a good occasion for the attainment of this objective, which will enable the \nGeneral Assembly to undergo renewal and revitalization, following on that \nalready experienced by the Security Council. The Organization would then more \nfaithfully reflect the important changes that have taken place in \ninternational society during the last 50 years. \n\nWe are all well aware that in today's world no nation can stand on its \nown. The fate of each and every one of our countries is linked to the fate of \nthe others. I wish therefore to conclude my statement by expressing the firm \nconviction that in the new global and integrated society that is emerging at \nthe end of this century no intelligent action can be taken that is not based \non the exercise of the most resolute solidarity. \n"

        "file_text": "It gives \nme pleasure, at the outset of my statement, to congratulate you warmly on \nbehalf of the Mauritanian delegation on your unanimous election to the \npresidency of our Assembly. We are confident that your ability, political \nexperience and diplomatic skills will enable you to guide this session to its \ndesired goals. \nWe should like to extend our thanks also to your predecessor. \nAmbassador Samir Shihabi, the Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for \nthe judicious manner in which he conducted the work of the past session. \nI should also like to take this opportunity to extend to \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali our warmest congratulations on the occasion of his \nelection to the post of Secretary-General of our Organization. We should like \nto pay tribute to his efficiency and the positive results he has been able to \nachieve in the short period he has spent in office. I should like to reaffirm \nto him our full readiness to work with him in any way that would contribute to \nthe performance of his tasks. \n\nAt a time when the universal character of our Organization becomes more \nand more pronounced through the accession of new States to its membership, I \ncannot but seize this opportunity to extend to those new Members our \ncongratulations on their accession and, in welcoming them, express our \nconfidence that they will be a new tributary of strength to this Organization. \nThe year 1992 will always be a landmark on the road to a new type of \ndialogue-and-cooperation-oriented international relations. This is attested \nto by the high-level international meetings that have been held, and which \nhave contributed to the emergence of new patterns of international relations. \nExamples of such meetings were the first summit of the members of the Security \nCouncil, the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the Summit of the Organization of \nAfrican Unity (OAU) in Dakar, and the tenth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement \nin Djakarta. \nAt the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, it became clear to all that it is \nno longer acceptable that islands of wealth should persist in an ocean of \npoverty and that international problems cannot be solved in the absence of \nsincere and effective cooperation between all peoples. \nIn these international conditions of rapid change, the causes of \ndemocracy and human rights have undergone a marked development and the idea of \nlinking social progress to economic development has gained more acceptance. \nThis proves that no country or group of countries, no matter how powerful, can \nface up to the challenges of the age on its own, without extensive cooperation \nand consultation. \nHowever, the concept of cooperation and consultation, between countries, \neven if it has gained acceptance in theory, has yet to be translated into \nactual reality. \n\nIn this context, the Rio de Janeiro Conference was a promising start. \nThe decision of the Earth Summit to hold negotiations with the aim of \ndeveloping an international convention on the phenomenon of drought and \ndesertification is cause for optimism. It is regrettable, however, that this \nnatural disaster has been allocated the smallest share of the resources \nearmarked for the implementation of the environmental programme. \nMauritania, in which the bane of drought and desertification has become a \nchronic affliction, has formulated a programme of its own for combating \ndesertification and correcting the imbalance in its environment. \nProceeding from our experience in this area, we appreciate the \ndifficulties of the countries which suffer from this phenomenon. I should \nlike, on this occasion, to declare our solidarity with the peoples of southern \nregions of Africa and the Horn of Africa who are now suffering the effects of \ndrought. \nWith the ending of the cold war and its ideological conflicts, today's \nworld faces no greater challenge than that of development. In past decades, \nthe traditional current pattern of development proved to be deficient and \nincapable of achieving its goals. It is generally accepted now that \nalleviating poverty and even attaining a measure of economic well-being are no \nlonger sufficient to satisfy the ambitions of mankind for progress. The \nsocial dimension of the question of development is vital for the happiness of \nmankind. This has proved to be true to such an extent that the advocates of \nabsolute liberalism have come to concede that no economic progress can be \nachieved in the absence of a social chapter that would complement it. \nHence the hope we attach to the planned world summit on social \ndevelopment, as such a meeting would highlight the need to link the economic \nand the social in development. \n \nThe world economic situation still causes concern. The most telling \nproof of this is that the developing countries, particularly in Africa, still \nface frustrating international conditions that are downright harmful, such as \nprotectionism and the burden of foreign debt. \nThe economies of developing countries are continuously deteriorating and \npoverty is increasing and spreading. Unless something is done to combat this \nsituation, it will become impossible to build a world where stability reigns. \nHow can we talk about a new world order while nothing concrete is done to \neliminate hunger, disease and ignorance? Was it not declared in the \nresolutions of the first summit of the member States of the Security Council \nthat peace and prosperity are complementary and that no lasting stability can \nbe achieved without real international cooperation to eliminate poverty and to \nachieve a better life for all? \nAnd yet, there is a better chance for international cooperation because \nof the increasing practice of democracy in the world and increasing economic \nliberalism world wide. In such a context, the United Nations can play a \nprincipal role, as it is the ideal forum wherein international questions can \nbe addressed, as best exemplified by the special session of the General \nAssembly in 1990 and the Rio de Janeiro summit. Those two gatherings have \ndemonstrated that it is possible for us to conduct a dialogue between North \nand South and thereby to create a climate that is conducive to the promotion \nof development. \nThe reorganization of the United Nations Secretariat will be an \nopportunity to take into account the interests of the majority of the \ninhabitants of the planet who face the challenge of development, and who bear \nthe burden of its attendant fierce struggle against backwardness, ignorance \n \nand disease. In such a context, special attention should be paid to Africa. \nAfrica is the continent that exerts strenuous efforts in facing up to the \nravages of natural disasters and, at the same time, in coping with the adverse \nand frustrating international conditions that stifle its growth, such as a \nforeign debt that now exceeds US$ 225 billion. \n \nIt has to cope with all this under the crushing impact of the increasing \ndepletion of its sources of foreign investment. Therefore, we should provide \neffective support to implement the United Nations Convention on the \ndevelopment of Africa in the 1990s. The political support for the Convention \nthat was announced by the latest summit in Dakar was a first step in that \ndirection. \nFortunately, the world now witnesses marked progress in the observance of \nhuman rights. However, and regrettably, there are still dark corners where \nthe darkness has not been pierced yet by the ray of light of freedom and \ntolerance. How else could we explain what is taking place today in Bosnia? \nHow else could we explain the massacres, the destruction of property, the \nhumiliation, and the desecration of sacred shrines? Can there be any hope of \nputting an end to this tragedy without more pressure on Serbia by every \navailable legitimate means to force it to comply with the will of the \ninternational community? Is it not high time for the international community \nto put an end to the threats to peace and the violations of basic human rights \nin all the world's hotbeds of tension? \nThe World Conference on Human Rights scheduled for next year should \nprovide convincing answers to such questions. For our part, we shall hold on \nto our conviction that the best possible way to ensure respect for human \nrights is to consider them as universal standards that must be applied in all \ncases, to all, without distinction. In other words, we should not confine \nourselves to condemning repressive practices whenever this serves our \ninterests and purposes. We sincerely hope that the future Vienna summit will \nsucceed in affirming the purely humane nature of human rights as far away as \npossible from political or ideological considerations. \n\nWhile we are concerned about the world economic situation and its effects \non international relations at the present time, we are hopeful that the \nincreasing development of democratic practices will lead to more harmonious \nrelations between countries. Mauritanians feel proud of their country's \ncontribution in this respect. \nThe democratic process which was launched by the Correction Movement on \n12 December 1984, has culminated, this year, in the holding of presidential \nand legislative assembly elections within a context of political pluralism. \nThe gradualist approach adopted in achieving this has proved to be the best \nway of avoiding the shocks of sudden change. Municipal elections, in various \nstages, gave the citizen the necessary lessons and sufficient experience to \nacquire a spirit of tolerance, and also tested the electoral machinery. \nThe Mauritanian people have voted on a constitution embodying a full \nmultiparty system for the first time in the history of the country. This \nconstitution, which was voted upon and ratified on 12 July 1991, makes \nprovision for all the freedoms that are set out in the Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights. Consequently, it provides an effective basis for the rule of \nlaw under which every citizen will enjoy freedom and justice. In support of \nthis qualitative transition, there has been a general amnesty that covered all \npolitical crimes and misdemeanours committed since the country became \nindependent. We are therefore very happy to state that in our country today \nwe do not have a single political prisoner. \nWe have passed laws on the freedom of the press and freedom of political \nparties and political assembly which have led to the publication of \n40 independent newspapers and to the establishment of 16 political parties in \naddition to various cultural and scientific organizations. This process has \n \nculminated in three major events: the presidential elections of \n24 January 1992; the elections to the House of Representatives on 6 and \n13 March; and the Senate elections on 3 and 10 April 1992. \nAll these elections took place in an atmosphere of freedom, tolerance and \ntransparency which enabled everyone to see everything that was going on and to \nmonitor it. That this was the case was confirmed by foreign observers who \nmonitored the election process. Indeed, as one of those observers said, the \nreal winner of the election race was the Mauritanian people. Mauritanians \nhave turned their backs on the experience of single-party and non-democratic \nsystems, and have chosen pluralism and real democracy, and, thus, have become \nthe source of the authority and legality, as President Mo'awia Ould Sidi Ahmed \nal Tayeh remarked in his inaugural address. \nOur struggle is not confined to our efforts to develop democracy. We \nhave simultaneously been waging a battle of economic reform, since 1985, by \nmeans of specific plans and programmes. What is at stake here is raising the \nstandard of living of every citizen. Included in this campaign are the \nefforts to eliminate illiteracy by the year 2000 and to enhance the status and \nrights of women. In mentioning these efforts, I should like to extend our \nthanks and gratitude to all the countries and international organizations and \nagencies that have supported our efforts to achieve a better life for our \ncitizens. \nThere are clear causes for concern in the international arena. However, \nthere are also reasons for hope. As the saying goes, life would be hard \nindeed were it not for hope. The Security Council has become more harmonious, \nwhich has enabled it to play a decisive role in solving international \ndisputes. It is no coincidence that we have seen the United Nations achieving \n \nmore in the past two years in terms of the number of peace-keeping operations \nthan it had been able to achieve over several decades. \nProceeding from this, can we dream that all the peoples of the world will \nsoon get a taste of peace in view of the steps taken to reverse the arms race \nand limit armaments? We now see the parties to conflicts increasingly opting \nfor dialogue and reconciliation. This should create a favourable atmosphere \nto end all conflicts. \nNevertheless, all these shining signs of hope along the path of progress \nwill not be enough for the realization of peoples' aspirations for more \nfreedom, independence and prosperity unless they go hand in hand with a \nserious commitment to justice. \n \nIt would be no exaggeration to cite as an example the case of the \nPalestinian people, who continue to be deprived of their right to \nself-determination and independence while their sole legitimate \nrepresentative, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), continues to be \nexcluded and its national uprising is still being repressed. \nOur welcome for the Madrid Conference and the negotiating process that \nemanated from it last autumn stemmed from our hopes for peace in the region. \nHowever, we make no secret of the fact that we are concerned at the course \nthose negotiations are now taking. While the previous Government of Israel \nresorted to stalling and prevarication and had an \\\"anti\\\" position so far as \nany land concessions were concerned, Israel now has an administration that \nclaims willingness for dialogue. Therefore, we hope that cooperation between \nthis new administration and the peace-loving forces will lead to a \ncomprehensive and definitive solution to a problem that has been with us for \nfar too long and which has overtaxed a people which wants nothing but to \nachieve its rights to independence and peace. We believe the only solution is \nwithdrawal by Israel from all the Arab-occupied territories, foremost among \nwhich is the Holy City of Al-Quds, adherence by Israel to the agreed \ninternational obligations and principles and implementation by Israel of the \nresolutions of this Organization. \nWhile on the subject of the Middle East and the hope that international \nlegality may have the upper hand and put an end to the long suffering of the \npeoples of that area, we reaffirm our rejection of any attempt that aims at \nundermining the territorial integrity of Iraq and its independence as well as \nany action that may jeopardize the safety, security or independence of Kuwait. \n \nWhile we support fully the sisterly country of the United Arab Emirates, \nin its demands regarding its legitimate rights over the island of Abu Mousa, \nwe wish to express surprise at the actions of Iran in this respect and call \nupon Iran to deal with this problem in accordance with the agreements between \nthe two countries within a context of good-neighbourliness, mutual respect and \nbrotherliness. \nThe achievement of the unity between the countries of the Arab Maghreb, \nwhich we have the honour of chairing this year, is a hope that all the peoples \nof the area look forward to in order for them to achieve their aspirations \nafter integration, prosperity and development. An important area such as \nthis, with more than 60 million inhabitants, coasts from the Mediterranean to \nthe Atlantic, rich economic resources and a position that makes it a \ngeographic and cultural bridge between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa, should \nget enough support from the United Nations to remove all the obstacles that \nimpede its development and progress. \nIt is no exaggeration to state that all the Arab Maghreb has been hurt by \nthe blockage imposed against Libya. In view of the fact that Libya has \ndeclared its full readiness to cooperate with the United Nations and in view \nof the constructive proposals contained in the Arab League's decision 5092 of \n12 September 1992, we hope the international community will show understanding \nfor this fair position and reach a solution that will satisfy all and spare \nthe Maghreb problems it can do without. \nIn the Western Sahara, the United Nations, in coordination with the \nOrganization of African Unity, continues to deploy efforts which aim at \novercoming obstacles in the field so that suspicion may not replace the early \noptimism that prevailed in the area in the wake of the signing of the \ncease-fire agreement on 6 September 1991. \n \nWe are determined to continue efforts that would lead our Moroccan and \nSahraoui brethren to a permanent peace that, no doubt, will be a vital factor \nin building the Arab Maghreb. \nThe resumption of diplomatic relations between Mauritania and Senegal \nlast April, the resumption of daily flights between the two countries and the \nopening of borders indicate the turning of a new leaf in the relations of the \ntwo countries. The resumption of cooperation between our two peoples is proof \nthat the leaders of both countries are determined to put behind them this \npainful era in order for the two countries to focus on winning the battle for \ndevelopment. \nThe last Nouakchott summit which brought together the leaders of Mali, \nSenegal and Mauritania with the aim of achieving the goals of the organization \nof the investment of the Senegal river, was a model to be followed in the area \nof common African action. \nIn South Africa, the road to the establishment of a real non-racial \ndemocratic system is still full of obstacles despite the progress achieved \nover the past two years. The most dangerous obstacle is the violence that, in \nfive years, has claimed the lives of thousands of people. Consequently, the \ninternational community should remain vigilant until the objectives of the \nUnited Nations declaration of 14 December 1989 have been achieved in full. \nDespite the tragedies and evils and atrocities that sadden the heart in \nSomalia, there are still hearts that are full of goodness. In this context, \nwe must express gratitude to those who have helped Somalia and have made every \neffort to ensure arrival of their humanitarian assistance to it in the face of \nconsiderable difficulties. To all those I extend the thanks of my country and \nI appeal to our brethren in Somalia to let reason reign, put the national \ninterest first and try to resolve their problems democratically, by dialogue. \n \nIn Latin America, as in Asia, we have seen how democratic development and \ndialogue have helped to solve many thorny problems and disputes. Two years \nafter resolving the question of Nicaragua, peace reigns in El Salvador. \nThe most important event in Afghanistan was the accession to power by the \nMujahideen after a long devastating war. Our recognition of the new \nauthorities in Afghanistan was an expression of our satisfaction with this \ndevelopment. We hope that Afghanistan, after the return of its sons, will be \nable to overcome factional strife and, thereby, embark on a much needed \nprocess of national reconstruction. \n\nWe reiterate our support for the Paris Agreements on Cambodia, which \ncommit all political factions to work for peace in that country. We regret \nthe delay in implementing some of the items of those Agreements, and feel that \na careful study should be made of the reasons behind such delay with a view to \ndetermining the type of measures that would enable the United Nations \nTransitional Authority in Cambodia to discharge their task as fully as \npossible. \nThere is no doubt that accession by the two Koreas to the membership of \nthe United Nations is an event that justifies the hope that Korea will be \nunified eventually by peaceful means, through dialogue and consultation. \nThe United Nations stands today at an important crossroads. The \nOrganization must regain its prestige in order for it to be able to rise to \nthe many challenges posed by the international changes on the horizon. In \nthis context, the reorganization of the Secretariat would enable us to find \nthe right instrument to face up to those coming challenges in which the \nquestion of development should be paramount. We have great hopes that this \nnew era will create an appropriate atmosphere for new, more equitable and \ndemocratic international relations. Nothing can help achieve these \naspirations of all peoples and nations more than justice and democracy. \n"

The condemnation of the coup d'etat of \n30 September 1991 is an expression of the desire of the United Nations to \ndefend the democratic principles and rights of the Haitian people, and we \nwould like to thank you warmly for that. \nThe advent of this civilization of peace, on a global level, necessarily \ninvolves restoring constitutional order to Haiti, where blood is flowing, \ncorpses are piling up and repression is intensifying. \nA coup d'etat in itself is a crime against humankind. These 12 months \nare symbolic of a double crime against humankind. May the door allowing for a \nreturn finally be opened so that peace can once more shine among us. \nFive days before the coup d'etat of 30 September 1991, here, at the \nUnited Nations forum, the people of Haiti cried out: \\\"Democracy or death!\\\" \nToday, on behalf of the 3,000 people assassinated by the enemies of \ndemocracy, the Haitian people cries out, with the same conviction and from the \nsame rostrum, the same cry: \\\"Democracy or death!\\\" Anyone desirous of peace \nmust defend democracy. \nMay peace return to Haiti! \nAnd may peace, likewise, be restored to Yugoslavia and Somalia. The \nRepublic of Haiti condemns the acts of terrorism and genocide that have \nbrought about such a paroxysm of horrific deeds. We appeal to the \ninternational community to make itself responsible for progressively creating \na civilization of peace. \nSecond democratic beatitude: Blessed are those who promote economic \ngrowth, because peace and economic poverty are incompatible. \nSince the Second World War, global production fell for the first time, by \n0.5 per cent last year. In developing countries, economic and social \nconditions have deteriorated dramatically. Hence subhuman poverty, drug abuse \nand an increase in crime. \nTwenty per cent of the wealthiest people in the world have 83 per cent of \nthe world's income, while 20 per cent of the poorest people in the world have \nonly 1.4 per cent of world income. Today, 1.2 billion poor people live in the \ndeveloping countries; in the year 2000, they will number 1.3 billion, and in \nthe year 2025, 1.5 billion. \nBut the fundamental principle of international public law is the \nprinciple of equality. In this context, Aristotle reminds us that politics \nrequires a reciprocal and symmetrical relationship in which citizens are \nplaced on an equal footing with each other and not above or below each other, \n(spoke in Creole*) \n(continued in French) \nLikewise, in his work entitled Political Justice. Hoffe, while occupying \nthe Chair of ethics and political philosophy, has reminded us that \\\"on the \nwhole, Plato and Aristotle offered us a florilegium of reasons to demonstrate \nthat life in common is profitable to all those participating in it\\\". \nRelationships, therefore, are ruled by laws: laws that must be \nrespected, laws that must not be transgressed, laws in a society of law. \nJustice must be, as it were, the oxygen of the economy. \nHow can we bring about a civilization of peace unless there is human and \neconomic growth at the world level? \nIt is in this world where, unfortunately, every year almost 3 million \nchildren die from vaccine-preventable illnesses. One out of three children \nsuffers from serious malnutrition. Why so much suffering? Must suffering and \nopulence be necessarily at daggers drawn? \nThe South accounts for 77 per cent of the world's population, but has \nonly 15 per cent of the world's earnings. In Latin America, 17 per cent of \nlandowners control 90 per cent of the land. \nHow can one speak of peace when equal civil rights become socio-economic \ninequality? That is a bitter contrast; that is a startling contradiction, \nowing to violations of human rights. \nIn our country Haiti it is even worse. The exploitive structures \nthat we inherited must be democratically transformed into structures made up \nof participation and justice participation by everyone; justice for all; and \ntransparency in all matters. \nHence, we will no longer be burdened by this colonial heritage that is so \nclearly reflected by the following statistics: \nOver 45 per cent of the national revenue is in the hands of 1 per cent of \nthe population; there are 1.8 doctors for each 10,000 inhabitants; there are \n1.9 nurses for each 10,000 inhabitants; in our 56 so-called hospitals, there \nare but 1.5 beds for each 1,000 sick persons; 59 per cent of urban dwellers \nand 3 per cent of rural dwellers have access to drinking water; 85 per cent of \nthe population is illiterate, yet extremely intelligent. \\\"Illiterate\\\" does \nnot mean \\\"stupid\\\". \nIncumbent on us is the great responsibility to promote productive gainful \nemployment. We will manage to do so by applying judicious macroeconomic \npolicies and effective mesoeconomic measures. \nTherefore, as always, we will have to locate the human individual in the \nvery heart of development, enable the market to function properly, remedy any \ndefects, introduce material infrastructures, support activities of public \ninterest, develop harmonious relations with the private sector and struggle \nagainst corrupt structures. \nThe constitutional process will safeguard participation for all and \njustice for all. Unity in diversity is indeed the very outline of a political \ntopology in which differences of view can be democratically harmonized. \nThe more equality there is in civil rights, the less inequality there \nwill be in the socio-economic field. I repeat: the more equality there is in \ncivil rights, the less inequality there will be in the socio-economic sphere. \nThe Republic of Haiti shares the suffering of those peoples who are \nimpoverished, starving and abandoned. There are many of those dispossessed \npeople who are in vain seeking the return of what is due to them. \nIn addressing our thanks in advance to all those friends of Haiti who \nwish to send humanitarian aid to Haiti, we would like to ask you to coordinate \nthe channelling of humanitarian aid with the constitutional Government of the \nRepublic of Haiti and those non-governmental organizations that are \naccompanying the march of the people of Haiti towards democracy. \nDespite the controversy that has surrounded the idea of an embargo, the \npeople of Haiti would like to repeat 'Yes' to an embargo. Let us have a real, \ntotal and complete embargo at last. Secondly, let us put a stop to the flood \nof new weapons being pumped continually into Haiti. Thirdly, if a total \nblockade is required to achieve this, the Haitian people will welcome it. For \nall those efforts that you have already made and for the support that you \nintend to give us, may I thank you from the bottom of my heart. \nOne year is too long; twelve months is too long, \nThe third democratic beatitude is: Blessed are those who heroically say \nNo to getting off scot-free; No to vengeance; Yes, to justice. \nNo justice, no peace! \nThe refusal to give one's blessing to impunity is part of the lexicon of \njustice and morality. Article 42.3 of the Constitution of the Republic of \nHaiti lays down that \n\\\"Abuses, acts of violence and crimes perpetrated against civilians \nby a military official in the exercise of his duties shall come under the \nauthority of the Courts of common law\\\". \nIn less than one year, 3,000 persons have been assassinated; there have \nbeen over 40,000 political refugees; hundreds of thousands of citizens have \nfled throughout the country, more than a hundred journalists have fallen \nvictim to the terror of the military; the press has been muzzled, priests have \nbeen arrested, beaten up and imprisoned, the life of Monsignor Willy Romelus \nhas been threatened; priests, nuns and members of grass-roots ecclesiastical \ncommunities or Ti Legliz have been continually persecuted. Rural, popular, \nsocio-professional and trade union organizations have been systematically \ndismantled or targeted. Many parliamentarians have been persecuted. One \nDeputy was assassinated in cold blood. Blood is flowing; the corpses are \nbeing heaped up. Never has Haiti experienced such a ferocious and bloody \ndictatorship. \nRejected by all States of the world, these criminals have nevertheless \nbeen recognized, by the Vatican the only State that has elected to give its \nblessing to crimes that it should have condemned in the name of the God of \njustice and peace. What a scandal! \nBecause of this impunity, on 2 June 1992 these criminals burned down the \nLafanmi Selavi orphanage. On 5 February 1991 these same criminals burned four \nstreet-children and destroyed their orphanage. On 11 September 1988, these \nsame criminals burned down St. Jean Bosco's Church, killing some 50 human \nbeings in broad daylight while they were celebrating the Eucharist. \nThey have destroyed human lives. But they will never, never be able to \ndestroy our love. Let the force of love banish the shades of hatred so that \nthe beacon of peace may shine through. \nIn the light of this peace, in which, as Anaxagoras said, \\\"the visible is \na window on the invisible\\\", one may well wonder: what would the attitude of \nthe Vatican have been if Haiti had been inhabited by white people? Secondly, \nwhat would the attitude of Pope John Paul II have been if Haiti had been \nPolish? Thirdly, next October Pope John Paul II will be a few kilometres away \nfrom Haiti. Will he be the Good Samaritan or the High Priest? \nSt. Luke 10:30-37. \nIn the meantime, love and peace to the Pope, because we gain no merit in \nloving only those who love us - Luke 6:32. \nThe fourth democratic beatitude: Blessed are those who reduce arms \nexpenditures and increase expenditures for human development. \nWorld military expenditures add up to $2 million per minute. Since 1945 \nthere have been approximately 150 wars, which have caused a total of \n20 million deaths. The developing countries' military expenditures have \nincreased over the last three decades from $24 billion to $173 billion. \nPeace is promoted by reducing the arms purchases and increasing \nexpenditures on human development. Unfortunately, in our country military \nexpenditures have led not to peace but to the massacre of a non-violent \npopulation. An army of 7,000 men accounts for 40 per cent of the national \nbudget. Striking contradictions! That is not to mention drugs; some officers \nare implicated up to their necks in drug trafficking, a source of corruption \npar excellence. \nIn the face of so much corruption, millions of victims seem to be echoing \nCicero when he asked, \\\"Ouousque tandem abutere. Catilina. patientia nostra?\\\": \n\\\"How long will you continue to abuse our patience, Catilina?\\\" The people have \ncategorically rejected that army. We have no need of it, they constantly \nrepeat. \\\"Police, yes, but this army of criminals, no\\\" they say to anyone who \nwill listen. \nIn keeping with the Constitution, we, the President of the Republic of \nHaiti, respond to the people in these terms: Yes to the army, but the army as \nit is, no. The army should be freed from Cedras and his clique, who have been \nresponsible for the death of several thousand people. Once liberated, it will \nbe integrated and brought up to professional standards, and, in accordance \nwith the Constitution, we shall set up a police force separate from the army. \nSo much, then, for preserving peace. \nA constitutional and democratic State excludes despotism, tyranny, \nanarchy and absolute power, because absolute power corrupts absolutely. \nThe Republic of Haiti would be very happy to see the United Nations set \nup commissions made up of defenders of individual rights to inquire into \nviolations of fundamental rights committed since 30 September 1991. Their \npresence in Haiti is essential to extend our good experience during the \nelections of 16 December 1990. \nLet the United Nations and the Organization of American States meet \ntogether in Haiti, urgently, so that finally fine-sounding resolutions can \nyield visible and fruitful action. \nThe fifth democratic beatitude: Blessed are those who resist political \npollution, for they will make the sun of peace shine. \nDeliberate injustice creates two parallel paths: submission and \nresistance. We, the sons and daughters of Dessalines, Toussaint Louverture \nand Charlemagne Peralte, say no to submission and yes to resistance. \nTolerant towards the intolerant, non-violent towards the violent, \nflexible towards the intransigent, the Haitian people must make their \nresistance and mobilization for liberation more dynamic in order to pave the \nway for a democratic society. \nYes, sons and daughters of freedom. \nSons and daughters of dignity, \nWe reject submission. \nWe choose resistance. \nThe broad highway of resistance will once again lead us to political \nstability, a prerequisite for economic development. From February 1991 to \nSeptember 1991 we had seven months of peace; seven months of political \nstability; seven months of \\\"lavalasian\\\" security! \nThose seven months of security, of course, made it possible for us to obtain \n$511 million in gifts or loans from 15 international donors. \nI pay homage to the women of Haiti, who, through their spirit, were able \nto make more dynamic the teaching of resistance, \nThrough active, non-violent resistance, let us mobilize energetically to \ndefend human rights. Contempt for human life imperils everything our Haiti \nand all humanity hold dear, \nPerseverance, said Plutarch, is invincible. Resistance, we say, is \norganic. \nThe Republic of Haiti offers encouragement to all those men and women on \nthe five continents who are resisting the forces of conflict. \nWe have been following closely the Middle East peace negotiations and \nhope that they will result in a peace agreement, which all men and women \nurgently need. \nSixth democratic beatitude: Blessed are those who defend the truth, for \nthey are a source of justice and peace. \nIndeed, truth remains the foundation of justice. Man can use science to \nkill truth or feed truth, and the same is true of political power. When \nleaders seek truth through objectivity they contribute to the maintenance of \npeace. \nEconomic and anti-democratic forces can follow a strategy that is able to \nmanipulate the information sector, thus spreading an oppressive \\\"truth\\\". \nTherefore, ethics must rise up to oppose any manipulation of the truth or any \nacceptance of a polluted truth. \nFor us Haitians, men and women alike, our existence is linked to the very \nroots of our being. Those roots bring us the sap of the naked truth, of \nethnic identity and of nourishing dignity. The same is true of our \n\\\"lavalasian\\\" policy. We take from it the sap of liberating truth and \ndemocratic ethics. \nFrom Socrates to Heidegger, from Hegel to Jean-Paul Sartre, over and \nabove philosophical differences, our political ethic makes it essential for us \nto seek truth from the very source of objectivity, for a peaceful \ncivilization, within the truth. \nThat is why we chose a constitutional democracy and not a schizophrenic \ndemocracy with its implications of psychopathic breakdown, structural \ndislocation, verbal stereotypes, and hypertrophy of the collective super-ego. \nAs always, we need a political psychology that furthers social peace and the \nrealization of national interests. National interests yes! The interests \nof the country - yes! The interests of the nation - yes! The interests of \nthe nation compel us to transcend personal relationships in order to save the \nnation. This can be seen today in the determination of over 90 per cent of \nthe Haitians to continue to say \\\"No!\\\" to the usurpers after 12 months of \nresistance. This can be seen in the determination of the Haitian diaspora -\nor the \\\"tenth department\\\" which today, heroically and proudly, has taken to \nthe streets. They are over 100,000 strong at this very moment, for that is \nhow they say \\\"Yes!\\\" to democracy. \nTheir will our will is to defend not individual interests but the \ninterests of the nation. It is noble to die for flag and fatherland! Yes, it \nis noble to die for flag and fatherland! \nThe sun of this peace will shine in many countries. The Republic of \nHaiti joyfully welcomes the presence of the United Nations in Cambodia, where \nthere is such a thirst for justice and peace after two decades of war and \nisolation. It will shine one day in the Caribbean and Latin America. During \nthe first 100 years following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in America, \nwe lost more than 90 million human beings. This was the start of the practice \nof genocide. May the blood of our ancestors fertilize the Caribbean and \nAmerica. May their spirit fortify us and guide us towards the triumph of the \ncivilization of peace. \nThe seventh beatitude of democracy: Blessed are they who, regardless of \nclass and race, love one another the Lavalas way. When the black man does not \nlive in peace, the white man cannot enjoy his peace. When the white man does \nnot live in peace, the black man cannot enjoy his peace. Let us love one \nanother the Lavalas way. May the peace of the blacks be with the whites! May \nthe peace of the whites be with the blacks! When the poor man does not live \nin peace, the rich man cannot enjoy his peace. When the rich man does not \nlive in peace, the poor man cannot enjoy his peace. Let us love one another \nthe Lavalas way. May the peace of the rich be with the poor! May the peace \nof the poor be with the rich! \nAccording to Aristotle, politics demands a reciprocal and symmetrical \nrelationship in which citizens are side by side and not one atop the other. \nTo forge unity in diversity, let us love one another the Lavalas way. The \naspiration to peace is inherent in human nature. May it fertilize political \npraxis, guaranteeing the growth of cultures and respect for human rights: the \nright to live in freedom; the right to work; the right to eat one's fill; the \nright of one and all to a seat at the table of democracy. Living in profound \ncommunion with our sisters and brothers in South Africa, the Republic of Haiti \nvigorously condemns the system of apartheid. It is indeed a modern vestige of \nslavery, day after day eroding human dignity. \nFinally, the eighth beatitude of democracy: Blessed are they who, on the \nthreshold of the third millennium, discover the true face of the Haitian \npeople. Freedom, dignity, and pride: These are the values written in letters \nof gold on the brow of this heroic people marching with head held high in \nquest of peace. Five hundred years ago, our ancestors, in search of peace, \nthrew themselves into the sea, abandoning the boats that were carrying them \nfrom Africa to the Caribbean. After 500 years, thousands of political \nrefugees in quest of peace have taken to the sea because the Haitian prefers \nto die on his feet than to live on his knees. \nMay the true face of the Haitian people never again never again be \nhidden behind the faces of Papa Doc, Cedras, and the tontons macoutes. all \nrejected viscerally, democratically, and once and for all by a bare-handed \npeople. Freedom! Dignity! Pride! Yes! He or she who knows the Haitian \ndiaspora or the \\\"tenth department\\\" can say, like Archimedes: \\\"Eureka!\\\" \n\\\"I have found it!\\\" He or she who knows the Haitian people in Haiti can say, \nagain like Archimedes: \\\"Eureka!\\\" \\\"I have found it! I have found Haiti, \nwhere the roots of freedom planted by Toussaint Louverture are sometimes \nfought, sometimes beaten, but never vanquished\\\". In the name of the people \nand its sons and its holy spirit Amen. We will continue to march with every \nHaitian in Haiti so that some day we be able to meet and live in real \ndemocracy."

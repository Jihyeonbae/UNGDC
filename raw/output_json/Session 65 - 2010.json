        "file_text": "Although the global \neconomic situation has improved considerably, it is \nstill fragile. Much of the relief has come from the \nmassive liquidity that has been pumped into the global \nfinancial system by national Governments. That bought \nus time to restructure our economies and correct the \nunderlying imbalances that led to the crisis in the first \nplace. \n Whether the restructuring is happening fast \nenough is, however, still an open question. The \neconomist Joseph Schumpeter viewed economic \ndownturns as the system renewing itself, a process he \ndescribed as creative destruction. In theory, that sounds \ngood. In practice, it is difficult for political leaders to \nstand idly by when companies go bust and jobs are \nlost. Everyone likes the creative part. Destruction, \nhowever, can mean losing an election, which \npoliticians invariably try to avoid. \n The repricing of production factors such as real \nestate and labour is politically sensitive in any country, \nand Governments get blamed for it. Adjusting relative \nfactor costs through the exchange rate is usually easier \nto achieve, although currency devaluation can create \n \n \n17 10-55264 \n \nother problems such as inflation. The argument over \nfair exchange rates in the world today reflects \ncompeting domestic pressures to ease the pain of \nrestructuring in different countries. Thus the United \nStates wants China to revalue the yuan renminbi, while \nChina protests that it is being blamed for the economic \nweaknesses of other countries. \n Of course, if the whole world were to use the \nsame currency, the only way countries would be able to \nadjust would be through improved productivity and \nrepricing. Exchange rate adjustments can facilitate \nstructural adjustment, provided that the deeper \neconomic problems are also tackled. With the world \nbecoming multipolar, global macroeconomic \ncoordination has become more complicated. \nRecognizing the inability of the Group of Seven or the \nGroup of Eight to achieve such coordination, the \nGroup of 20 (G-20) was formed two years ago when \nthe global economy stared into an abyss after the \ncollapse of Lehman Brothers. Without the G-20 acting \nin concert, the economic crisis could well have led to a \nglobal depression. The G-20 \u2014 the members of which \ncollectively account for some 85 per cent of total \nglobal gross domestic product \u2014 is therefore a vital \ngrouping in the community of nations. \n Going forward, the G-20 has to go beyond the \nreform of international financial institutions and better \ncoordination of fiscal, monetary and exchange rate \npolicies. Without fundamental restructuring of the real \neconomy, we may experience a double dip. Without \nfundamental restructuring, increased liquidity in the \nglobal system will end up creating new asset bubbles, \nsome of which we already see forming in Asia. For this \nrestructuring to take place, the international trading \nsystem must be kept open. Only then can markets make \nadjustments and prices find their right levels. In \nfighting protectionism in all its forms, the leadership of \nthe G-20 is critical. If, for lack of political will, the \nG-20 is unable to avert the crisis of a second dip, crisis \nwill in the end force it to act, and by then it will be at \nmuch greater human cost to all of us. \n For precisely that reason, we must not allow \ninterest in the Doha Development Agenda to flag. \nWhen the Doha Round was launched in November \n2001, a key consideration was development. For many \nof us who were in Doha during the negotiations, the \nMillennium Development Goals were uppermost in our \nminds. I remember Tanzanian trade minister Iddi \nSimba insisting, on behalf of the African, Caribbean \nand Pacific countries, that the word \u201cdevelopment\u201d be \nexplicitly incorporated into the name of the new round. \n It has been 10 years since the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals were launched. While some \ncountries have done well, many others have not. The \nG-20 countries must take into account, in their \ndeliberations, the interest of all countries, not only of \ntheir own. The G-20, which together accounts for \n80 per cent of international trade, has to play a \nleadership role in breaking the current impasse in the \nDoha negotiations. In particular, we must ensure that \nthe needs of developing countries, especially the needs \nof the least developed countries (LDCs), are met. \nFreeing up agricultural trade, for example, will make a \nhuge difference to their welfare. \n With those concerns in mind, a loose grouping of \ncountries calling itself the Global Governance Group, \nor 3G, was established more than a year ago. Its \nobjectives were spelled out in a document circulated to \nthe Members of the United Nations on 1 March. The \nbasic stance of the Group is to support the work of the \nG-20 and hold it accountable to the general \nmembership of the United Nations. Permanent \nRepresentatives within the 3G Group meet regularly in \nNew York, including before and after G-20 meetings, \nto present views and make suggestions, which are \ncirculated to everyone at the United Nations. \nDepending on the subjects discussed, we invite \nindividual members of the G-20 to join us at our \nmeetings. For example, in preparation for the coming \nG-20 Summit in Seoul, the 3G Group had several \nmeetings with senior Korean officials, including their \nG-20 \u201cSherpa\u201d, to convey some of our views and \nconcerns. \n A major concern of the countries of the Group is \ndevelopment. In this regard, we have prepared inputs \nto be submitted to the G-20 working group on \ndevelopment. It is good that both Korea as the current \nChair of the G-20 and France as the incoming Chair are \npushing development on the agenda. \n Let us be clear at the outset that development is \nnot principally about aid. Whether a people is able to \nlift itself from the depths of poverty depends more on \ninternal than external factors. Good governance is, of \ncourse, paramount. Investing in the inherent potential \nof citizens and creating a favourable environment for \nthat potential to be realized are central to good \ngovernance. We would like to commend President \n  \n \n10-55264 18 \n \nDeiss on his decision to make \u201cReaffirming the central \nrole of the United Nations in global governance\u201d the \ntheme of this General Assembly. It is most timely. \n A critical element in good governance is \neducation. With education, individuals are able to \nacquire the information and knowledge they need to \nadd value to the world. Aid that helps a people to build \nup its internal strength is valuable. Aid that creates \ndependency is harmful. With education, a citizenry is \nmore able to insist on democratic safeguards against \nthe abuse of power and corruption. Taking full \nadvantage of globalization and information technology, \nwe can now spread education into remote corners of \nthe world. \n One of the most important developments in the \nworld today is the widespread availability of cheap \nmobile phones, often with built-in cameras. Mobile \nphones have altered traditional power relationships \neverywhere where they are available. No longer can \nindividuals be kept ignorant and exploited for long, \nbecause they have alternatives. As smart phones fall in \nprice \u2014 which they are bound to do \u2014 social \nnetworking infrastructures like Facebook, which \nalready has half a billion users in the world, will \nradically change the world we live in. Without being \nplanned for or financed by any national Government, \nFacebook is arguably the most important social \ninfrastructure in the world today. It is an astonishing \nphenomenon. Yet, it is only one wave of many more \nwaves to come. \n Whether we like it or not, the revolution in \ntechnology \u2014 not only information technology but also \nin genetics, material science and other fields \u2014 will \ncause the creative destruction that many politicians \ndread. Communities and Governments that work with \ntechnological change will surge ahead, while those \nfighting change will be left behind. In this new age, \nthose who are wedded to dogma and ideology become \nstuck in the past. Therefore, when we talk about \ndevelopment, the key is education. \n We must make sure that basic conditions are met, \nthat children are fed and healthy and that no group is \ndiscriminated against on the basis of ethnicity, religion \nor gender. The knowledge needed for development is \nalready available in the world, and delivery systems \ncan be readily put into place. \n Unfortunately, there are many obstacles impeding \nthe flow of knowledge. Protectionism is a major \nobstacle. It slows the spread of education and \nknowledge. Throughout history, every time a new trade \nroute is established, knowledge flows along it, enabling \nthe relatively backward to catch up. Our inability to \nmove the Doha Development Agenda forward is \nparticularly injurious to LDCs. \n An important way to help communities acquire \nmore knowledge and use information better is to foster \nthe growth of liveable cities. To develop, countries \nhave to urbanize, and in the coming decades large parts \nof the world will be urbanized on every continent. \nChina during Mao Zedong\u2019s time was 20 per cent \nurban. Today, it is almost half urban. In 20 years\u2019 time \nit will reach the same level of urbanization as Taiwan \nor countries like Korea and Japan, which are over 90 \nper cent urban. \n Urbanization as an organic process of \ndevelopment can be healthy or unhealthy. Cities can be \nenergy-efficient, knowledge-intensive centres of \nproduction, education and sustainable living, or they \ncan be hellholes festering with poor education, \nunemployment, inequality, crime and pollution. \nBecause of the specific challenges that we had to \novercome in our own development, Singapore has been \npromoting the sharing of urban developmental \nexperiences as a practical way to help countries \ndevelop in areas such as public administration, \nlow-cost housing, water management, transportation \nplanning and better logistics. Developing countries that \nare urbanizing rapidly \u2014 and they have to do so in \norder to develop \u2014 should not have to repeat the \nmistakes of those who have gone before them. \n All of us have a vested interest in the growth of \nliveable cities in the third world. For example, carbon \nemissions cannot be reduced without healthy \nurbanization. We hope that fostering liveable cities will \nbecome a major objective of the G-20 countries. The \nbest form of aid we can provide is knowledge and \ntraining. Two years ago, Singapore signed an \nagreement with the World Bank to establish an urban \nhub for the dissemination of knowledge about liveable \ncities. \n A basic requirement for healthy urban \ndevelopment is good water management, which has \nbecome a major challenge in various parts of the \nworld. We should do much more to learn from one \nanother\u2019s experiences, especially in the face of growing \nweather volatility. Last Friday, Slovenia convened a \n \n \n19 10-55264 \n \nGreen Group meeting involving a small group of \ncountries to discuss the subject of water management, \nwhich we hope will be given more attention in the \nfuture. \n Despite the concerns about the global economy, \nnever before have the prospects of bringing \ndevelopment into every continent been so promising. \nThis is not to say that outcomes will be equalized. \nHuman beings as individuals and in groups are \ncompetitive by nature, and we must expect that some \nwill do better than others at any point in time. Indeed, \nby learning from the successes and mistakes of front-\nrunners, human communities often leapfrog over one \nanother, and this is a historical process. Competition, \nhowever, should be conducted in a civilized way and \nwithin an overall global framework and value system \nthat recognizes our global humanity and destiny."

        "file_text": "I would \nlike to begin by extending my warmest congratulations \nto you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency at the \nsixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I have \nevery confidence that under your distinguished \nleadership this session will indeed yield fruitful results. \nMay I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to \nSecretary-General Ban Ki moon. We deeply appreciate \nhis wholehearted commitment and selfless dedication \nto the noble and lofty goals of this august \nOrganization. \n Since their launch in 2000, we have made \nheadway towards achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Yet progress varies \ngreatly across regions and countries and is uneven in \nterms of targets. Among other things, maternal and \nchild health warrants our special attention as the most \noff-track goal in most regions. Indeed, improving \nmaternal and child health is the best investment we can \nmake to carry momentum over to all other closely \nrelated goals. In view of the importance it attaches to \nthis goal, the Republic of Korea has joined the Group \nof 8 Muskoka Initiative for Maternal, Newborn and \nChild Health. Furthermore, Korea fully supports the \nSecretary-General\u2019s pursuit of the Global Strategy for \nWomen\u2019s and Children\u2019s Health, and it welcomes the \nenthusiasm of all stakeholders for this important \ninitiative, as was demonstrated at this week\u2019s meeting. \n With only five years remaining until 2015, the \nprospects for meeting the MDGs are not altogether \nencouraging. It is high time for the international \ncommunity to renew its resolve and galvanize global \nefforts to achieve these vast and meaningful goals. I \nearnestly hope that, when we gather again in 2013 to \nreview progress, we will find that implementation of \nthe commitments at the High-level Meeting held earlier \nthis week exceeds our most optimistic expectations. \n We must bear in mind that the success of the \nMDGs hinges on honouring development commitments \nand redoubling efforts to strengthen global partnership. \nIn full recognition of this, the Republic of Korea has \nembarked on a midterm plan to triple its official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA) budget over the next \nfive years to 0.25 per cent of gross national income, \ndespite tight financial constraints. \n As a new Member of the Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development Assistance \nCommittee, Korea is seeking to improve the quality of \nits development assistance by undertaking far-reaching \nreforms in its ODA system. Last year, basic laws on \nODA were enacted as the first step forward. Korea will \nalso align its development policy to reflect the actual \nneeds of the recipient countries and encourage their \ntaking ownership. With its unique experience of fast \neconomic and social development, Korea will do its \nutmost to play a bridging role between the donor and \nrecipient countries. \n Next year, Korea will host the Fourth High-Level \nForum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan. The Korean \n \n \n31 10-55109 \n \nGovernment will make every possible effort to ensure \nthat this forum serves to map out a new direction for \ninternational development cooperation that can address \nevolving global needs. \n It is indeed our common belief that development \ncooperation is an investment for all. A sustainable and \nbalanced world economy requires us to narrow down \nthe persistent development gap. This is the shared goal \nof the Group of 20 (G-20) and the United Nations. The \nG-20 leaders have agreed to place development as a \ncrucial new item on the agenda for the upcoming G-20 \nsummit in Seoul this November. The G-20 \ndevelopment agenda will concentrate on building \ncapacity to promote economic growth in the \ndeveloping world. In this way, the Group of 20 is \nexpected to complement the ongoing development \nagenda, including the MDGs. \n Global financial safety nets will be another new \nagenda item at the Seoul summit. Robust and reliable \nglobal financial safety nets are vital, especially for \ndeveloping countries, which are most vulnerable to \nvolatile global capital flows. The Seoul summit will \nfocus on faithful implementation of the previous \nagreements, which will help to bring back the stability \nof the global market at an early date. Leaders will \ncontinue to coordinate their policies for a strong, \nsustainable and balanced growth of the world economy. \nReforms of international financial institutions and \nfinancial regulations will also be central to the \ndiscussion at the G-20 summit. \n As the G-20 President this year, Korea is \ncommitted to ensuring a successful outcome for the \nsummit, one that will contribute to overcoming the \ncurrent crisis and to working out the post-crisis \nmanagement of the world economy. \n In discussing economic growth, particular \nemphasis must be placed on green growth. Indeed, this \nlies at the heart of sustainable development. In an \neffort to curb greenhouse gas emissions, Korea has set \na voluntary reduction target of 30 per cent against the \nbusiness-as-usual levels by 2020. Together, we will \ngradually shift the growth paradigm from an energy-\nintensive to a green growth economy. \n As part of the efforts to promote the green growth \nstrategy in the international community, we launched \nthe Global Green Growth Institute last June. We hope \nthat this institute will become an integral part of the \nglobal endeavour to move towards sustainable \ndevelopment as Korea strives to share green growth \nvision and assistance with developing countries. \n On the peace and security front, peacekeeping \noperations have become the most visible and defining \nfeature of the United Nations. The increasing demand \nand growing complexity of peacekeeping operations \ncall for continuous improvement in the operation of the \nmissions. \n Strategic goals should be set more clearly. The \ntroops should be deployed more swiftly. Operations \nshould be conducted in a more professional and \ndisciplined way. To this end, all stakeholders, including \ntroop-contributing countries and financial contributors, \nshould focus on close coordination and cooperation. \n The Republic of Korea has been a committed \ncontributor to United Nations peacekeeping efforts. \nKorea dispatched 240 contingent troops this year alone \nto the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti to \nhelp rebuild the country shaken by a tragic earthquake. \nCurrently, some 650 Korean soldiers are serving in \n11 peacekeeping missions, including the United \nNations Interim Force in Lebanon. We believe that our \nnewly enacted law on participation in peacekeeping \noperations will further enhance our response capacity \nin United Nations peacekeeping and peacebuilding \noperations. \n One of the most urgent security challenges today \nis the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \ntheir means of delivery. It is imperative to further \nstrengthen international disarmament and \nnon-proliferation regimes built around the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). \n In this regard, Korea welcomes the adoption of \nthe Final Document at the 2010 NPT Review \nConference in May. We trust that this hard-won \nachievement will lay the groundwork for future \nprogress in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. \n The nexus between weapons of mass destruction \nand terrorism also poses a grave risk to global security. \nWith this shared understanding, the leaders at the \nNuclear Security Summit held in Washington, D.C., \nlast April recognized the potentially catastrophic \nconsequences of nuclear terrorism and committed to \nstrengthening nuclear security. It was agreed that \nconcrete steps for securing nuclear materials should be \ntaken to prevent them from falling into the hands of \nterrorists. We look forward to follow-up discussions on \n  \n \n10-55109 32 \n \nnuclear security at the second Nuclear Security \nSummit, which is to be held in Korea in 2012. \n In August, President Lee Myung-bak of the \nRepublic of Korea proposed a new vision of the \npeaceful reunification of Korea, which will serve to \nstabilize inter-Korean relations and ultimately bring \nabout a reunified Korea. To make this vision reality, we \nwill work earnestly to build three communities: a peace \ncommunity to ensure security and peace on the Korean \npeninsula; an economic community to develop North \nKorea\u2019s economy and eventually achieve inter-Korean \neconomic integration; and a community of the Korean \nnation which will ensure the dignity, freedom and \nhuman rights of all individuals. \n However, this vision for peaceful reunification is \nnot without obstacles. Sixty years after the outbreak of \nthe Korean War in 1950, there still remain threats to \npeace on the Korean peninsula. A case in point is the \nsinking of the Republic of Korea\u2019s naval vessel, the \nCheonan, by a North Korean torpedo attack on \n26 March this year. The international community sent a \nfirm and unified message to North Korea by adopting \nthe Security Council presidential statement of 9 July. \nNorth Korea must take responsibility for its \nunprovoked attack and refrain from any further \nprovocations. \n The biggest obstacle in our path towards a peace \ncommunity is the resolution of the North Korean \nnuclear issue. Unless North Korea forgoes its nuclear \nweapons programme, no sustainable peace can be \nachieved on the Korean peninsula and beyond. \n Through the adoption of Security Council \nresolutions 1718 (2006) and 1874 (2009), the \ninternational community urged North Korea to abandon \nall nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes \nin a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner. In \norder to secure the lifting of sanctions and the ending \nof isolation, North Korea should make the strategic \ndecision to live up to its commitments to \ndenuclearization. A nuclear-free North Korea would \nalso open the way to saving its people from the current \nmiserable human rights and humanitarian situation. \n Last year, on this very occasion, President Lee \nproposed the \u201cgrand bargain\u201d initiative: a single \ncomprehensive agreement that encompasses all steps \nfor North Korea\u2019s denuclearization and the five parties\u2019 \ncorresponding measures. Together with the \ninternational community, we will work tirelessly to \npersuade North Korea to make the right choice \u2014 a \nchoice that will ensure a better future for both its \ncountry and its people. Once North Korea demonstrates \ngenuine change in its behaviour and attitude, my \nGovernment is prepared to engage in meaningful \ndialogue and cooperation with North Korea. \n We are witnessing many global challenges that \nare testing the international community. These \nchallenges cannot be addressed by one country alone or \neven by a group of countries. They summon us as \nglobal citizens to fulfil a common purpose. They call \non the United Nations to assume the mantle of global \nleadership. In order to effectively address the \nincreasingly diverse and interconnected challenges, the \nUnited Nations should heighten its reform efforts \naimed at broadening its operational response capacity. \n The launch of UN Women is a clear testimony to \nthe world community\u2019s efforts towards this end. Korea \ncommends that historic move to step up progress in \nmeeting the needs of women and girls worldwide. UN \nWomen will greatly contribute to enhancing system-\nwide coherence, bringing together resources and \nmandates for greater impact. We also welcome the \nrecent appointment of Michelle Bachelet at its helm. \n Furthermore, the upcoming review of the Human \nRights Council represents an excellent opportunity to \nmuster our collective efforts to make the Council more \neffective and efficient at fulfilling the promises we \nmade at its establishment. The Republic of Korea looks \nforward to working closely with the international \ncommunity in this joint effort. \n No reform of the United Nations can be complete \nwithout Security Council reform. It is crucial that the \nCouncil be more representative, effective and \naccountable. To this end, the Republic of Korea will \ncontinue to play a constructive role in finding the \nwidest possible agreement on the major issues relating \nto Council reform. \n The challenges facing the United Nations are \nformidable. We may succeed in some endeavours and \nnot in others, but we should not forget that the United \nNations is the best source of hope for many who are \nsuffering from armed conflicts, extreme poverty and \nhuman rights abuses across the globe. The Republic of \nKorea remains fully committed to playing its due part \nin the efforts of the United Nations to translate those \nhopes into reality. "

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your \nbrilliant election to the presidency of the sixty-fifth \nsession of the General Assembly. That election is a sign \nof the unanimous recognition of your personal \ncommitment to promote the role of this Organization \nand to defend its ideals. It is also the crowning moment \nin a talented diplomatic career that you have led with \nskill and tact. It is therefore to you as a skilled \ndiplomat that I would like to pay warm homage.  \n It is also my pleasure to express to your \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, \nmy delegation\u2019s appreciation for the quality of the \nwork he undertook and the results achieved under his \npresidency. Finally, allow me to pay tribute to the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his personal \ncommitment and tireless efforts to support peace and \ndevelopment throughout the world. Furthermore, I \nwish to convey my deep gratitude to him as well as the \ngratitude of His Excellency Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, \nPresident of the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, as well as \nthat of the people and Government of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire for \nhis commitment to reach a settlement of the crisis in \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.  \n By proposing the theme of reaffirming the United \nNations central role in global governance for this \nsession, Mr. President, you celebrate the primacy of \nmultilateralism over unilateralism as a method for \nmanaging global affairs in the best possible manner. \nMoreover, you are transforming our Organization into \nthe forum of choice for dealing with issues of global \nconcern. That vision is, without any doubt, in line with \nthat of developing countries in general and my country, \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, in particular and can only take shape if \nthe United Nations retains its credibility by adapting to \nan international context that has considerably changed \nsince its founding in 1945. This requires urgent and \nthorough reform, because we believe that our \nOrganization has resisted the widespread changes in \nthe world that it was established to serve.  \n Because the United Nations is at the crossroads \nof all of the world\u2019s problems, it is here that we can \nfully assess what has happened since it was founded. \nThis is the appropriate place to assess the progress \nachieved as well as the failings. It is also here that we \ncan envisage solutions to problems that now confront \nthe world. Those issues include poverty, which is the \nsource of all evils, and which remains an open wound \non humanity, which continues to make progress to the \npoint where it is already considering human \nsettlements on the moon. But unfortunately, at the same \ntime, humanity is forgetting that more than a billion \nmen and women across the planet Earth suffer from \nhunger. Women\u2019s lives are lost as they give life. \nMillions of children die before reaching the age of 5, \nand access to drinking water is limited in Africa. The \nAIDS epidemic and the malaria epidemic kill more \npeople than all the wars combined. If the world is \npowerless, the United Nations must be adapted to \nprovide proper responses to those imbalances, because \nthere are not two worlds, there is just one world, which \nis our common heritage. Managing that world must be \ndone in a joint manner, and it must be shared equitably. \nThe United Nations must demonstrate the example and \nshow the path forward. \n In that regard, my country\u2019s position has \nremained unchanged. For C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, that long-\nsought reform must aim for balance in the main bodies \nof the United Nations, including in particular a larger \nSecurity Council and improvement in its working \nmethods. That is why my delegation places much hope \nin the successful outcome of the intergovernmental \nnegotiations that were launched by the General \nAssembly on reform of the Organization in general and \nthe Security Council in particular. \n This session of the Assembly is taking place at a \nmoment when the global economy is beginning a \nfragile recovery, following the most serious economic \ncrisis the world has faced since the Great Depression of \nthe 1930s. That crisis has shown, and indeed has \nexacerbated, the vulnerability of integrated world \neconomies, ruined development efforts and threatened \ncollective security. Many countries, mainly developing \ncountries, are continuing to suffer the effects of the \n \n \n9 10-55396 \n \ncrisis through a drop in the purchasing power of their \npeople, the growing shortage of official development \nassistance, falling foreign direct investment and growth \nin unemployment.  \n If, as the experts tell us, the global economy has \nbegun to recover this year, it nevertheless continues to \nbe fragile, with a growth rate of a mere 2.2 per cent. In \nsuch a situation, we must seek, in solidarity and by \ncombining our efforts, the most appropriate solutions \nto consolidate that tendency to growth. Meeting that \nfundamental requirement will allow us to establish \nthroughout the world societies that are safer, more \nequitable, more inclusive and more stable.  \n My delegation therefore calls on the \nindustrialized countries to make a reality of their \ncommitments with regard to developing countries, \nespecially in terms of official development assistance, \nif the developing countries are to reach the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015. \n C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire also hopes to see the diligent \nimplementation of the conclusions of the United \nNations Conference on the World Financial and \nEconomic Crisis and Its Impact on Development, \nwhich was held here from 24 to 26 June 2009, \nparticularly those calling for reform and strengthening \nof the financial and economic system and of the \ninternational financial architecture in order to adapt \nthem to current difficulties.  It also desires that \nthat reform should not only allow developing countries \nin general and those of Africa in particular to have \nmore adequate representation in international financial \ninstitutions, but should also promote economic and \nfinancial policies that are better adapted to their needs.  \n Along those lines, I would like to pay tribute to \nthe summit of the Group of Eight (G-8) held in June \n2010 in Muskoka, Canada, which reaffirmed, inter alia, \nthe commitments of the G-8 with regard to official \ndevelopment assistance and the guarantee of aid \neffectiveness. It called for the effective mobilization of \nall public and private resources for the achievement of \nthe Millennium Development Goals. It also \nemphasized the urgent need for collective action to \nachieve the MDGs, particularly improvement in \nmaternal health and reduction of infant mortality.  \n On that specific point, my delegation would like \nto welcome the creation within the United Nations \nsystem of UN Women, a special body responsible for \ngender issues and the advancement of women. That \nnew body and the establishment of a trust fund to \nsupport initiatives for women is a real cause for hope \nfor developing countries, particularly those in Africa, \nin their struggle against poverty, discrimination and \nsocial inequalities.  In that connection, I wish to \nwarmly congratulate Ms. Michelle Bachelet on her \nappointment to head UN Women and assure her of the \nfull cooperation of the authorities of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in \nfulfilling her mandate. \n Food insecurity, which now affects more than  \n1 billion people, mainly in developing countries, is a \nmajor and immediate obstacle to development and a \nthreat to world peace and security.  \n In the face of that situation, for which the entire \ninternational community is responsible, we need to \nfind innovative, effective and lasting solutions in terms \nof financing for agriculture. My delegation welcomes \nthe efforts being made by the World Bank, regional \ndevelopment banks and the specialized funds and \nagencies of the United Nations for financing the \nagricultural sector. Similarly, it welcomes the launching \nin 2009 of the L\u2019Aquila Food Security Initiative, which \nallowed the G-8 to mobilize $22 billion to finance \nagriculture in developing countries over a period of \nthree years. \n The delegation of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire welcomes, \nfinally, the reform under way of the Committee on \nWorld Food Security and the launching of the Global \nAgriculture and Food Security Programme.  \n Similarly, I would like to recall the proposals \nmade by President Laurent Gbagbo, at the meeting of \nthe Group of 77 and China that was held in June 2008 \nat Yamoussoukro, to set up a mutual support \nmechanism for providing food products to importing \ncountries by producing countries while aiming to \ncreate in the United Nations a stabilization fund for \nfood products. \n Climate change is rightly seen as a global \nproblem and today represents a serious threat to \nhumankind\u2019s equilibrium. It therefore requires clear \nand committed responses at the international level. \nThus it is important that we rapidly find solutions that \ncan ensure that future generations will have a world \nthat is better balanced and guarantees a better future \nfor humankind. \n In that regard, the delegation of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire \nwelcomes the significant progress of the United \n  \n \n10-55396 10 \n \nNations Conference on Climate Change, held from 7 to \n18 December 2009 in Copenhagen. Although the \nprinciple of a legally binding accord to succeed the \nKyoto Protocol after 2012 was not reached, the hopes \npromoted by that meeting largely justified its being \nheld. Moreover, the significant progress achieved \nconfirms us in that opinion. \n Among the advances made we would mention, \ninter alia, the consensus on the goals for stabilizing the \ntemperature rise at 2\u00b0C, the creation of a mechanism to \nmobilize financial resources for the absorption of \ngreenhouse gas emissions by forests, and the \ncommitment of developed countries to provide  \n$30 billion for the period 2010 to 2012, and $100 \nbillion as of 2020 for measures to adapt to climate \nchange in developing countries.  \n The diligent implementation of those measures \nshould allow vulnerable States such as my own to \nestablish plans to combat climate change, which is \nbecoming increasingly evident throughout the world in \nan upsurge in natural disasters related to drought, \nflooding and coastal erosion. The effects of all of those \nevents on the health of populations and on the \navailability of land and potable water compromise the \neconomic and social development of many States that \nhave already been weakened by poverty and \npandemics. The United Nations, in line with its \nCharter, has the duty to carry out the negotiations that \nwere begun in Copenhagen and must work resolutely to \nthat end. \n Respect for human rights is a concern for my \ncountry, which has endorsed the set of international \ninstruments in that regard. Though it was affected by \nthe socio-political crisis, the human rights situation in \nmy country is today on a path to normalization, thanks \nespecially to the valuable help of national and \ninternational non-governmental organizations involved \nin that area. The international community could see \nthat on 3 December 2009 in Geneva, when the Working \nGroup on the universal periodic review took up C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire. That review led to the adoption on 18 March \n2010 of a final report that earned my country the \nsupport and encouragement of the States members of \nthe Human Rights Council for our stated will to pursue \nefforts to improve human rights. \n The persistence of numerous armed conflicts \naround the world continues to threaten international \npeace and security. Once again, the role of the United \nNations is vital to resolving those conflicts, which are \nhindering the harmonious development of the world. \nThat is particularly true in Africa, a region that, shaken \nby hotbeds of tension, cannot ensure its peaceful \neconomic and social development, despite its enormous \npotential.  \n In that regard, allow me to stress how happy we \nare that the peace so much hoped for is now a reality in \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, following the implementation of the \nOuagadougou Political Agreement, which will permit \nthe organization of free, transparent and open elections. \nThe first round of presidential elections has been set \nfor 31 October 2010. Besides setting that date, the \nsigning on 9 September 2010 of a presidential decree \nfinalizing the ballot list allows for the distribution of \nnational identity and voting cards to the 5,725,720 \nIvorians who are on the list that has been validated by \nthe Independent Electoral Commission and the Special \nRepresentative of the Secretary-General of the United \nNations.  \n Those signs of progress in the peace process and \nthe proven determination of political players and the \nIvorian people to move towards free, open and \ntransparent elections allow us to envisage, with \noptimism, the holding of the presidential election on \nthe appointed date and thus of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire emerging \nfrom its crisis. \n On that hopeful note, I would like to conclude by \nrecalling that the various crises of security, food, \nenergy and finances, compounded by the threat of \nclimate change, demonstrate the extent to which in the \nexistence, balance and future development of humanity \nare now threatened more than ever. In that context the \nUnited Nations has a crucial role to play in \nstrengthening indispensable international solidarity and \nin seeking effective, collective and appropriate \nsolutions to those crises and challenges.  \n However, to be fully engaged with its time and to \nremain true to the objectives of its founding 65 years \nago, the United Nations must adapt to the realities of \nthe contemporary world if it wants to remain the \nguarantor of international peace and security and of the \nworld\u2019s socio-economic development. To that end, we \nmust strengthen the foundations of this Organization \nand \u2014 as the theme of this session invites us to do \u2014 \nreaffirm its central role in global governance. C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire therefore calls for international solidarity so \nthat our common Organization may find the necessary \n \n \n11 10-55396 \n \nsolutions to offer to coming generations the hope of a \nfruitful and peaceful future.

        "file_text": "\nOn behalf of the people and Government of Honduras, \nI wish to recognize Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his \nleadership during the previous session. I also \ncongratulate President Joseph Deiss on his election to \nthe Assembly presidency and the Secretary-General, \nBan Ki-moon, on his wise leadership of our \nOrganization. \n In this same house of the peoples of the United \nNations, at the world summit on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), our President, Porfirio \nLobo Sosa, highlighted the faith that our country has in \nthis Organization and in its Charter for achieving a \nworld that is more peaceful, prosperous and fair (see \nA/65/PV.3). As a founding Member of the United \nNations and a peace-loving country, we reaffirm our \nobligations. As we have been working, ceaselessly and \ntogether with many other Member States, since the \nbirth of the Organization, we will continue to work to \nfully realize the ideals enshrined in the San Francisco \nCharter.  \n Honduras \u2014 which is geographically small but \ngreat of spirit and generous in its democratic and \npeaceful vocation \u2014 has involved itself in the world, \nbasing itself on the principles of equal rights, self-\ndetermination for peoples and non-interference in \ninternal affairs.  \n The imperative of promoting economic and social \nprogress for all nations moves us to acknowledge that \nthe MDGs have been a first step in the right direction. \nWe agree with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that the \nMillennium Goals are not easy, but they are achievable. \nHowever, the struggle against poverty requires \nadditional efforts that recognize the fact that we have a \ncollective responsibility to protect and share what the \nPresident of Honduras has called global common \ngoods, including solidarity.  \n Another global good should be the prudent \nmanagement of our economies. The financial crises \nhave proven that that responsibility does not fall just to \nthe developing countries. It is so important that, \naccording to the World Bank, the recent crises in food, \nfuel and finances have sunk an additional 64 million \nhuman beings into poverty. Such crises can make our \nefforts to fight poverty more difficult or even \nimpossible.  \n The opening of trade and of financial systems is \nanother global good. Access to international markets is \nas important as official development assistance itself, \nalthough it does not replace it. We must add efforts to \nenable foreign direct investment in our developing \nnations; access to technology, in particular technology \nhaving to do with medications; the reduction of \ngreenhouse gases; and the non-proliferation of nuclear \nweapons. \n The challenge of achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals before 2015 in a manner as \nresponsible as possible lies with our Government. \nGiven the results already achieved and what remains to \nbe done, President Lobo Sosa has launched an appeal \nto start talks as soon as possible on a new global \nagreement that will guide our actions and goals after \n2015.  \n We firmly believe that poverty is not only the \nshortage of material goods, but also the lack of \nopportunities. That is why we are committed to respect \nfor human dignity, the common good, support and \nhuman solidarity. Those four principles are not just a \nmoral imperative; in the case of Honduras, they are a \nnational imperative. \n In that regard, with broad consultation with civil \nsociety, the political parties and other independent \nsectors, we adopted a country vision and national plan \nthat sets out four focal points for achieving our \nnational goals, inspired by the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals: a Honduras without poverty, \neducated and healthy, with robust social welfare \nsystems; a Honduras that is developing in democracy, \nwith security and without violence, with absolute \nrespect for human rights; a productive Honduras that \ngenerates opportunities and decent jobs, that \nsustainably exploits its resources and that reduces \nenvironmental vulnerability; and a modern, \ntransparent, responsible, efficient and competitive \nState, with fully independent branches of government.  \n The cohesion of our society, unity, reconciliation, \ngovernance, coexistence and peace all depend on \nachieving that. That is why we are engaged in building \n  \n \n10-54965 58 \n \nan inclusive society, since no country is so poor that it \ncannot show solidarity with those that are even poorer.  \n Our first commitment is to helping people in \nextreme poverty through the \u201cBono 10,000\u201d \nprogramme. Bono 10,000 is a credit programme that \nwill greatly strengthen family economics and, \nfurthermore, is conditional on steps to improve the \naccess of the most vulnerable Hondurans to education, \nhealth care and nutrition through the broad \ndissemination of the School Snack scheme and other \nfood security programmes. \n We are strengthening the decentralization \nprocesses and improving citizen participation in the \nmaking, implementation, monitoring and assessment of \npublic policies. We are also addressing social \ninequality by creating economic opportunities at the \nlocal level. \n Productive programmes, such as the United States \nMillennium Challenge Corporation in Honduras, have \nhad a huge impact on the recipients, resulting in a very \nsignificant increase in the income of the farmers \nparticipating in the programme. With the same aim of \ngenerating greater income for families, we have \nlaunched a programme to finance microbusinesses and \nsmall enterprises, thanks to the cooperation \nprogrammes of the European Union, Japan and Taiwan, \nas well as all those countries that are extending the \nhand of solidarity to our people.  \n In all those programmes, women are a particular \ntarget of our Government\u2019s efforts because we know \nthat, along with the fight against poverty, we must \ncombat gender inequality. \n While we work at the local and community \nlevels, we are also promoting private investment. The \npurpose is to create decent jobs for more than 200,000 \nyoung people who join the labour market annually. The \nGovernment of Honduras bases the successful \nimplementation of its social agenda on a social market \neconomy. \n With those premises in mind, our Government \nhas drawn up a national programme to promote \ninvestment for the period 2010 to 2014 in six main \nsectors: industries generating more and better jobs, \nagro-food and forestry production, clean generation of \nenergy, tourism development, infrastructure to support \nmanufacturing, and water and sanitation. We will \ndevelop those programmes within the new framework \nof the law on public-private partnerships, the law on \nrural and marginal urban employment, a new law on \nclean energy and the law on promoting and protecting \ninvestments.  \n With such efforts, a new era is opening in \nHonduras with the creation of conditions so that \nprivate business can boost sustained economic growth \nwith social responsibility and the country is guided \ntowards prosperity and stability. \n Honduras is ready to better address the challenges \nof reducing its vulnerability to natural disasters and \nclimate change. The law on land management makes it \npossible to utilize and protect the land properly, with \nresponsible management of the natural resources. At \nthe same time, we have launched a national risk \nmanagement system. \n Efforts to improve the social situation and to \nboost economic growth must be based on a legal and \ninstitutional foundation. There is a strong link between \nindividual freedom and political stability with \neconomic growth and social justice. Higher rates of \neconomic growth that are sustainable over time also \nhelp to create the social conditions for governance, \nconfidence and smaller political threats. \n For 30 years, we Hondurans have strived to \ndevelop our democratic institutions. The international \ncommunity has supported us throughout that process. \nAt the end of the third decade of our democracy, we \nhad an institutional system that had ceased to be the \nmonopoly of the executive branch and that shared \npower more evenly among the judicial, legislative and \nexecutive organs. \n Despite that progress, we underwent a political \ncrisis, from which we emerged when the Honduran \npeople turned out in huge numbers on 29 November \n2009 to vote in the election with the greatest turnout \nand transparency in our electoral history. We \nHondurans exercised our popular sovereignty and our \nright to self-determination. We sent an unequivocal \nmessage: we love democracy and our institutions, and \nwe prefer dialogue to conflict. That is our message, \nwhich has been understood and respected by the great \nmajority of the nations represented here. We wish it to \nbe acknowledged by all Governments in the world. \n In that spirit, President Porfirio Lobo Sosa \nendorsed a broad amnesty for political crimes and \nformed a Government of national unity, with the \n \n \n59 10-54965 \n \nparticipation of all the country\u2019s political parties. \nFurthermore, the President decreed the creation of the \nTruth and Reconciliation Commission \u2014 a totally \nindependent body that will ensure that the critical \nevents of 2009 will never happen again. The work of \nthe Commission is already under way, and its report is \nexpected during the first quarter of next year. Its \nconclusions will be broadly disseminated and its \nrecommendations will be implemented.  \n We are convinced that national reconciliation and \nunity are based on respect for all sectors of society \nirrespective of political or ideological position. \nTolerance is and must be the foundation of democracy.  \n  We are also convinced that the human rights \nand fundamental freedoms of citizens must be \nrespected without restriction. The President of the \nHonduras has proposed to the National Congress the \ncreation a Secretary of State for Justice to promote and \ntake charge of designing, implementing, supervising \nand evaluating all public policies and ensuring that \nthey are based squarely on human rights principles.  \n Inspired by our respect for human dignity, our \nGovernment condemns all forms of racial \ndiscrimination and enthusiastically welcomes the \nforthcoming launch of the International Year for People \nof African Descent. To implement our commitment \nagainst racial discrimination, Honduras is creating an \nentity for the development of indigenous peoples and \nAfro-Honduran people and a policy of racial equality. \n In the context of those commitments any person \ndeprived of liberty must be treated with the respect \ninherent in his human dignity. To that end, the \nPresident approved an executive decree aimed at \nreducing overcrowding in the penal institutions \nthrough renovation of their infrastructure and \nequipment. \n Along that same line, the Government of \nHonduras has energetically condemned and continues \nto condemn human rights violations, especially \nviolation of the right to life. We are firmly committed \nto the fight against impunity and will continue to make \nevery possible effort to bring to justice those who \nviolate that essential right of the human person. \n We are thankful for the cooperation we have \nreceived so far in overcoming difficulties in \nguaranteeing security for our citizens. President Lobo \nSosa has also asked Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to \nhave the United Nations consider support for setting up \na commission to fight impunity, in order to support \nnational institutions and strengthen their capacities as \nthey carry out their tasks in investigating and \nprosecuting crime. At the same time, we reiterate our \nGovernment\u2019s invitation to the agencies that make up \nthe United Nations human rights system to follow up \non the situation in Honduras.  \n I wish to convey the ongoing appreciation of \nHondurans to the United Nations system and its \nSecretary-General for all the cooperation and \nassistance given our country. We thank all of those who \nhave firmly supported Honduras, because that has \nbenefited our people directly. \n I want to highlight the solidarity and friendship \nthat exist among the brothers of the Central American \nregion. Within the Central American Integration \nSystem we will continue to go forward until our \ncommon homeland becomes one great nation, beyond \nthe limits of the historic Central America. \n Our Government is aware of the difficulties and \nchallenges of the moment in history in which we are \nliving, and we are taking decisions based on that \nawareness. Today I can state with conviction that we \nare moving along the path to prosperity, because I \nbelieve in the determination of the people of Honduras, \ntheir ability to deal with adversity, their hard work, \ntheir strength of heart and their sprit and hope. We \nhave an unbreakable will; we have the human capital.  \n The time has come to reaffirm our commitment \nand to act in favour of the poorest members of society. \nThe time has come to act in solidarity and with \ndetermination so that all human beings may be \nprotected from discrimination and need. It is time to \ncreate a world with tolerance, with harmony and with \nfreedom and security for all. The time to globalize \nsocial justice with freedom and democracy is now. \n "

        "file_text": "It is a privilege and a \ngreat honour for me today to address this unique forum \nwhere great and small, powerful and less powerful \nnations speak with one voice; a forum we undoubtedly \nexpect to result in dialogue and leadership in order to \n \n \n39 10-54965 \n \ndeal with the challenges to peace and security, hunger \nand development, human rights and climate change. \nSuccess will be possible only by overcoming \nindividual interests. I am convinced that today more \nthan ever, each of us individually and all of us together \nhave reasons to turn our words into actions. \n Let me first congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \nelection as the President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fifth session and assure him of my delegation\u2019s \nreadiness to cooperate during his term. I also \ncongratulate the former President, Mr. Treki, on \nsuccessfully presiding over the Assembly at its sixty-\nfourth session. At the same time I would like to take \nthis opportunity to acknowledge the engagement and \nthe efforts made by the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, to strengthen the role of our Organization. \n At the outset, I would like to say a few words on \nthe consequences of the global financial and economic \ncrisis, and I will refer in particular to the role of the \nUnited Nations in this context. \n The global economic and financial crisis \nthreatened to reverse the progress made in achieving \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and \nefforts to attain peace in all regions. I think that all we \nMember States and the United Nations system in \ngeneral successfully dealt with it. Timely, joint and \nadequate solutions were found to many of the \nproblems. Processes were initiated to mitigate the \neffects of the crisis and to face possible future crises. \nActions were taken to help the most affected, \naccording to the agreed action plans and with \nappropriate support and cooperation, often resulting in \nsuccessful outcomes. Let us not forget that economic, \nfinancial and social security is a foundation on which \nsustainable development, national and global security \nand prosperity rest. \n Five years remain before the deadline for the \nimplementation and realization of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. That objective is still before us \u2014 \nan objective we must not give up on achieving now, \ndespite the decelerated pace of implementation. We are \nall aware of the high stakes and potential benefits. I \nwelcome the outcome of the High-level Plenary \nMeeting on the Millennium Development Goals held \nlast week, when we all pledged to strengthen our \nefforts to attain the ultimate goal. \n The Republic of Macedonia, as before, remains \nstrongly committed to achieving the Goals, as reflected \nat the national level in the Government\u2019s strategy for \neconomic and sustainable development and in national \nlegislation, which is adapted to the current obligations \nderiving from international treaties and agreements. \n On the other hand, global climate change is both \na serious threat to our planet and survival. Frequent \nnatural disasters and humanitarian catastrophes have \nmade it clear that nature reacts to the irresponsible \nattitude that humankind has adopted towards it. \nHowever, the struggle to preserve nature must not only \nbe a matter of declarations; it must enjoy global \nleadership and be visible in every small town, every \nState, and the strict observance and development of \nnational strategies. Successful formulas must be \ntransformed into in a common global struggle to \npreserve our way of life, side by side with the needs of \nthe planet. \n The Republic of Macedonia stands ready to \ncontribute adequately to the global efforts. Many \ninitiatives have been undertaken. We are truly focused \non the best possible weapons in this struggle: \nawareness-raising and education on and a culture of \nreducing the use of electricity by using alternative \nenergy sources and reductions in harmful emissions. As \na party to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change for over a decade, my country has \nworked actively to achieve the Convention\u2019s \nobjectives. \n Unfortunately, the world still does not live in the \ndesired peace and prosperity. Unfortunately, every day \nwe continue to witness disturbances to peace and \nsecurity in certain regions in the world, both in old and \nfrozen conflicts and in the emergence of new tensions \nin several regions in the world. If the fundamental \ninstitutional goal and essential objective of this \nOrganization is to spare humanity from suffering, wars \nand conflicts, then we should ask ourselves whether \nour efforts have been sufficient to secure peace and \nprosperity. The answer is no, neither globally nor \nregionally. \n The consequences of the global financial and \neconomic crisis and the slow pace of implementation \nof the MDGs have had a serious impact on the essence \nof conflicts, often because of a lack of democratic \nprocesses and rule of law in certain areas. Only by \npromoting peace, human rights and the rule of law \nthrough dialogue and tolerance can we make the world \na just and fair place to live in. \n  \n \n10-54965 40 \n \n In the context of what I have just said, I welcome \nthe relevance of this session\u2019s theme, which should \nhelp create effective responses to global crises and \nrestore the role of the United Nations in global \ngovernance. The genuine vision of the founders of the \nUnited Nations should be restored. They have left us a \nlegacy. \n The Republic of Macedonia strongly supports the \njoint efforts to improve the overall coherence of the \nUnited Nations system. I believe that we all agree that \nit was and remains necessary to redefine the \nfunctioning of the United Nations system in order to \nrespond to the demands and priorities of the Member \nStates in the best and most effective manner possible. \nWe should create a highly functional global governance \norganization that has no overlapping of mandates, but \nachieves maximal effect through an appropriate and \ntransparent use of existing resources. \n Since gaining independence, the Republic of \nMacedonia has been fully committed to substantial \nreforms in all areas aimed at promoting democracy and \nimproving the standards of living of its citizens, based \non historical traditions of respect for multiethnic \ncoexistence, dialogue and mutual understanding. \n Our achievements in this context have been \nvalidated and internationally recognized. Therefore, the \nRepublic of Macedonia rightfully expects a date to be \nset to begin negotiations on its accession to the \nEuropean Union (EU) and an invitation to join NATO. \nWe have enforced the necessary reforms to join NATO, \nwe have been an EU membership candidate country for \nfive years, and last year we received a positive \nrecommendation to start negotiations with the EU. \nUnfortunately, our citizens have not yet felt the full \nbenefits of that. And yet, the reforms that brought us to \nthe front doors of these organizations were not at all \neasy. In addition, my country is actively committed to \nregional cooperation and to building good-neighbourly \nrelations. Macedonia accepts and promotes dialogue as \nthe only mechanism for overcoming all outstanding \nissues in the region. \n The Republic of Macedonia has directed all its \navailable capacities and resources towards \nimplementing our top strategic foreign policy goals: \nintegration into the EU and NATO membership. I \nwould like to remind the Assembly that, 15 years ago \nhere in New York, the Interim Accord was signed with \nour southern neighbour, whereby Greece agreed not to \nobstruct my country\u2019s membership of and integration \ninto international and regional organizations. \nNevertheless, I must note that my country is still \nwaiting at the doors of these two organizations due to \nthe actions of our southern neighbour, which are \ncontrary to the obligations under the 1995 Interim \nAccord. \n The Republic of Macedonia is fully committed to \nthe process of resolving its differences with Greece \nwithin the framework of the mechanism established by \nUnited Nations resolutions. Our name is at stake, as is \nour right to self-identification and human dignity. We \nhave done our utmost to nurture close and friendly \nrelations with our neighbour Greece and its people. A \nsolution will be reached only if the United Nations \nCharter, the relevant resolutions and international law \nand its principles, on which the international order \nrests, are respected. \n The Republic of Macedonia and its citizens \ndeserve to enjoy the benefits of NATO membership and \nto start EU accession negotiations. \n Yesterday, here at the United Nations, I had a \nmeeting with the Greek Prime Minister, which sought \nto build a climate of mutual trust and understanding. I \nhope that, as two neighbouring countries that have \nlived and will live with one another, we will be able to \nfind a mutually acceptable solution. It will be a big \nstep not only for us but also towards fulfilling our \ncommon vision for the whole region.  \n I must say that I am encouraged by the situation \nin our region. The more intensive communication and \ncooperation efforts are, the better understanding and \nrespect will be. By accepting dialogue as the only way \nto overcome inherited problems and open issues, we \ncreate a new climate. Proof of this was the second \nBalkan Leaders Forum, which was held here in New \nYork City a couple of days ago. Slowly but surely, the \nBalkans is restoring its impaired dignity. The Balkans \nagain aspires to become part of the European space, \nwhere European values, European criteria and \nEuropean principles will be respected. The Balkans has \nbeen, is and will be Europe. \n Let me conclude with the statement that the \nRepublic of Macedonia believes in the United Nations \nand the postulates upon which it rests. I believe that the \nUnited Nations can maintain the stability of \ninternational order and relations and successfully meet \ncurrent and future global challenges. The Republic of \n \n \n41 10-54965 \n \nMacedonia stands ready to further provide its \nconstructive contribution to the implementation and \nrealization of these goals. "

        "file_text": "It is a \ngreat honour for me to address, on behalf of \nSwitzerland, the General Assembly, which this year is \npresided over by my compatriot, Mr. Joseph Deiss. I \nwould like to take this opportunity to congratulate the \nPresident on his election. His election is a great honour \nfor Switzerland and is not only a personal recognition \nof President Deiss and his work but also of our \ncountry\u2019s commitment to the United Nations as a \nmember of the Organization and a defender of \nmultilateralism. \n We find ourselves today in a building that is \nundergoing renovations. The architectural makeover of \nthe United Nations prompts me to ask: what kind of \nUnited Nations are we building for the next 10, 20 or \n30 years? We need a United Nations that can face the \nchallenges of the future for the good of all. We need a \nUnited Nations that will contribute effectively to \nsolving the world\u2019s problems. We need Member States \nthat are ready to take full responsibility for building a \nbetter world. \n The future of the United Nations must reflect the \nworld of tomorrow. Today, nearly one billion people \nare still malnourished. There will be many more people \nsharing this planet in the future, and no doubt we will \nhave to make do with fewer resources. Thanks to new \ndevelopments in technology and information, our \ncitizens participate more directly in the challenges \nfacing our societies. They are increasingly better \ninformed and feel that at least some of the legitimacy \nof this universal Organization depends on its ability to \nrespond effectively to those challenges. They demand \naccountability. \n In a more globalized world, we must treasure and \ndefend the principles of the United Nations Charter. We \nmust take care to ensure the proper functioning of this \ncommon structure in a spirit of solidarity, respect and \nresponsibility. \n A strong international community requires \nsolidarity. That means more than providing assistance \nto countries when they are unable to help their own \ncitizens. It also means reminding States of the \nresponsibilities they have towards their own people in \nareas such as security, the rule of law, human rights \nand democracy, and all that in respect for the United \nNations Charter. Every woman, every man, every \ncitizen must make his and her contribution to the \nstructure we are building together. At the same time \nevery Member State must be able to place its national \ninterests second to the common good. That is the only \nway we will be able to find solutions that are in \neveryone\u2019s interest.  \n Every day we are reminded of the growing and \nincreasingly complex global challenges confronting us: \nthe economic and financial crisis, climate change, \nenergy and food security, development and poverty, \nand peace and security. The search for sustainable \nsolutions to those challenges calls for real governance, \ngovernance, moreover, that must reflect the new \nrealities in the world. The new-found prosperity of \nsome must go hand in hand with new responsibilities. \nStates whose economic success enables them to play a \nmore active role in the governance of the world must \naccept the new responsibilities that go with that active \nrole. \n The United Nations enjoys a unique legitimacy \nbecause of its universal membership. Its legitimacy \nalso derives from the issues it addresses, which \nconcern us all. This week\u2019s agenda is the best possible \n \n \n9 10-54827 \n \nproof. But the legitimacy of an organization also \ndepends on its performance and its ability to respond to \nthe expectations placed on it.  \n By that standard the United Nations sometimes \ndelivers mixed results. At times it seems ill-equipped \nand hesitant to act. The power derived from universal \nmembership becomes a burden when we Member \nStates are divided. Our debates should not be limited to \nthe lowest common denominator. They must lead to \naction and to results in the interest of the common \ngood of humanity. \n If the United Nations fails to act, other groups \nrepresenting only a fraction of the countries of the \nworld will step in, zealous for effective action, and \nplay a central role in global governance. As far as \nSwitzerland is concerned, such groups lack legitimacy \nby virtue of their limited composition. It is therefore \ncrucial for the United Nations and its principal organs \nto remain at the centre of world governance. That is \nwhy we must take care to ensure that the legitimacy of \nthis universal body does not suffer from a lack of \nefficiency. To make progress in building a better world, \nit is our collective responsibility to meet a global \nchallenge with a global response. Switzerland wants to \ncontribute to this joint effort. \n Concerted global action is required in the \nfollowing areas.  \n The Millennium Development Goals must be \nimplemented rapidly and fully. We know that dropping \na sack of rice from a helicopter is not enough. We must \ninstead teach people how to grow rice. Still today, \n1.4 billion people around the world are living in \nextreme poverty. Every day too many mothers and \nchildren die of malnutrition and lack of care. We know \nthat huge financial means are needed after a disaster. \nMoney flows in emergency situations, but who is still \nconcerned three years later? Who is involved in the \nreconstruction? \n Binding objectives must be defined as quickly as \npossible for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. \nNowadays, we have knowledge and we have clean and \ngreen technology. We must take action, each nation \nwith measures aimed at its own targets. Waiting for the \nindustrialized countries to invest in the South will not \nlead anywhere. Here too, all must fulfil their own \nresponsibilities. This year in Mexico we still have an \nopportunity to make progress. The recent natural \ndisasters are unmistakable signs. Switzerland will \nreduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by \nthe year 2020.  \n Thirty years after the Cold War, the proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction remains a grave threat \nto peace and security. But for civilian populations, the \nreal devastation is caused by small arms and light \nweapons. Terrorists benefit from that situation by \neasily supplying themselves in the arms market. \nSwitzerland, together with other countries, is \nsupporting the full implementation of the United \nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. That \ninitiative provides for the involvement of specialists in \nhumanitarian aid and education. \n Gender equality must at last become a reality. \nAccess to education and health for women and girls \nhas been restricted for decades. More than others, they \nhave been victims of poverty. They have also been the \ntargets of systematic violence in armed conflicts. It is \nhigh time to make full use of their potential in \nmediation and reconstruction in countries affected by \nconflict. In that context, Switzerland welcomes the \ncreation of the United Nations Entity for Gender \nEquality and the Empowerment of Women \u2014 UN \nWomen \u2014 which brings us closer to the fulfilment of \nthis vision. \n We must avoid making the United Nations an \nimmutable historic monument, but rather turn it into a \ndynamic organization. The United Nations is the only \norganization in the world with the legitimacy to \nrepresent all nations and all peoples. It is the only \nlegitimate organization in the world capable of \nnarrowing differences and restoring a balance between \nregions.  \n For that to happen, however, every Member State \nmust accept its responsibilities and start with the task \nof putting its own house in order. Discussion and \npreparing reports are not enough, however; we need to \nact. Each Member State must commit itself clearly \nwithin the Organization to respond to the urgent \nquestions facing the world of today and of tomorrow. \nSuch commitments will strengthen confidence in the \nUnited Nations and its credibility.  \n Switzerland remains firmly convinced of the \naptness of a multilateral approach, with the United \nNations at its centre. With the contributions of \neveryone in this Hall today we will be able to create a \nmore just, peaceful and prosperous world. I thank all \nwho are gathered here for their collective commitment."

        "file_text": "Yesterday was exactly the fiftieth anniversary \nof the first speech of Commander in Chief Fidel Castro \nRuz in this Hall, with that memorable sentence that if \nthe philosophy of plunder disappears, then the \nphilosophy of war will have disappeared (see \nA/PV.872). \n  \n \n10-55122 46 \n \n Sixty million people had to die in the Second \nWorld War so that the leaders of the time could create \nthe United Nations with the aim of saving succeeding \ngenerations from the scourge of war. \n Today, the children and grandchildren of that \ngeneration realize that the human race is faced with the \nthreat of extinction. Within a few decades, the \ndegradation of living conditions on the planet will be \nirreversible. The same could happen in a few hours if \nonly a small part of the nuclear arsenal were to be \nused. Those who met in San Francisco to draft the \nCharter of the United Nations could not have imagined \nthe threat now posed by global warming or the nuclear \nwinter. \n While we deliberate here, as Comrade Fidel has \nwarned, powerful and influential forces in the United \nStates and Israel are paving the way to launch a \nmilitary attack against the Islamic Republic of Iran. \nFor its part, the Security Council, possibly under the \nillusion of preventing that, is going ahead with \napplying sanctions against that country, which, \ntogether with the unilateral sanctions illegally imposed \nby a group of States, seek to strangle the Iranian \neconomy. \n The recent and politically biased report issued by \nthe Director General of the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency has contributed to increasing the \ntensions and has provided a pretext for military \nescalation. Should that aggression in fact materialize, it \nwould be a crime against the Iranian people and an \nassault against peace and international law that could \nignite a conflict that will certainly turn nuclear. The \ntoll would be millions of lives and the impact on the \nenvironment, the economy and world stability \nincalculable. \n Who could assert otherwise, and on the basis of \nwhat guarantees? How could it be argued that the \npresent course of events is distancing the planet from \nwar in the Middle East? The threat is too serious to \ntrust in the capacity of the Security Council, where the \nmain actor responsible for the crisis has relied on its \nability to impose its designs. \n The wars against Iraq and Afghanistan \ndemonstrate that we cannot entrust one or a few \nGovernments with the authority to decide when all \ndiplomatic steps to prevent a war have been exhausted, \nwhen the use of force becomes unavoidable, and when \nthe death of hundreds of thousands or millions of \npeople and the destabilization of a large area of the \nplanet \u2014 or all these things together \u2014 are inevitable. \nSanctions, sieges and conflict are not the way to \npreserve international peace and security. On the \ncontrary, dialogue, negotiation and adherence to the \nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States are the \nonly way to avoid war. \n Cuba commends and encourages the efforts of all \nthose countries, such as China, Russia, Brazil and \nTurkey, that strive to find peaceful solutions, and calls \non the international community to support such \ninitiatives. It is the duty of this General Assembly to \nofficially support those efforts. \n The United Nations must be radically reformed \nand the powers of this General Assembly restored. The \nSecurity Council must be recreated. It must be \nreiterated that the Secretary-General and all senior \nofficials of the international agencies, including the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, answer to all \nMember States, as set out in clear mandates adopted in \naccordance with the Charter and the rules of procedure. \n The serious threat posed by nuclear weapons will be \nsolved only with their total elimination and prohibition. \nThe manipulation surrounding non-proliferation \u2014 based \non double standards and political interest, the existence of \na club of the privileged and the denial to the countries of \nthe South of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy \u2014 must \nstop. We urge the United States, the main nuclear Power, \nto stop opposing the negotiation of binding agreements \nthat could rid us once and for all of this threat within a set \ntime frame. Given the great lethal power and the ongoing \ndevelopment of conventional weapons, we will also have \nto fight for complete and general disarmament. \n In order to move ahead on those tasks, the \nNon-Aligned Movement submitted a proposal that has \ngone unheeded. The proposal envisages a plan of \naction that includes the establishment of nuclear-\nweapon-free zones. It is urgent to establish such a zone \nin the Middle East, where Israel is the only country \nthat opposes it. Success in this effort would contribute \nsignificantly to dispelling the threats of conflict and \nnuclear proliferation and to achieving lasting peace in \nthat region. \n The floods that have affected Pakistan, Central \nAmerica and many other countries in the most diverse \nlatitudes, as well as the droughts and extreme \ntemperatures that have devastated Russia, are a tragic \nreminder of the threats of a climate out of balance. In \n \n \n47 10-55122 \n \nthe face of such a serious threat, no selfish interests or \nnarrow political agendas that prevent the adoption of \nconcrete and binding agreements at the next \nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change should \nprevail. The developed countries, which bear the \ngreatest responsibility for global warming, should \naccept more ambitious goals for reducing greenhouse \ngas emissions and refrain from destroying the \nframework established by the Convention and its \nKyoto Protocol. \n It would be very irresponsible of the \nGovernments of the industrialized countries to ignore \nthe legitimate claims of the non-governmental \norganizations and social movements that were brutally \nsuppressed in Copenhagen and later met in \nCochabamba barely five months ago to defend Mother \nEarth, or to again seek to deceive public opinion by \nblaming the emerging economies. \n We call for the full support of the international \ncommunity for Venezuela in its struggle. The victory in \nyesterday\u2019s parliamentary elections demonstrates the \nbroad majority support of the people for President \nCh\u00e1vez and the Bolivarian revolution, which have \nsuffered North American interference and the scorn and \ndisinformation campaigns of the oligarchic groups and \nmedia empires. \n Now that the television cameras have left Haiti, \nwe call for the pledges of international assistance to be \nhonoured. The noble Haitian people need resources for \nreconstruction and, above all, for development. \n The United States Government is aware of Cuba\u2019s \nreadiness to coexist in a climate of peace, respect and \nsovereign equality, which we have expressly conveyed \nthrough official channels and which I reiterate here on \nbehalf of President Ra\u00fal Castro. I am convinced that \nthe development of relations based on international law \nand the purposes and principles of the United Nations \nwould enable Cuba and the United States to address \nmany of their differences and to resolve others. It \nwould help to create an atmosphere conducive to trying \nto solve the problems of our region and, at the same \ntime, provide significant support to the interests of our \nrespective peoples. \n The agenda for dialogue and bilateral cooperation \ninitiatives submitted to President Obama\u2019s Administration \non 14 July 2009, which I publicly announced in this Hall \nexactly a year ago (see A/64/PV.11), have yet to receive a \nresponse. The North American Government has shown no \nwillingness to address essential matters on the bilateral \nagenda, so the official talks that have been held without \ngreat progress have been limited to specific issues. \n Contrary to expectations, even within the United \nStates itself, its Government does not seem willing to \namend even the most irrational and universally rejected \naspects of its policy against Cuba. The main element in \nour bilateral relations is the economic, commercial and \nfinancial blockade that the United States Government \nimposes against my country directly and through the \nextraterritorial application of its laws. The blockade \nhas been the subject of 18 resolutions that, with the \nalmost unanimous support of Member States, have \nconsistently called for its end. \n However, in the past two years, there has been no \nchange in the policy of blockade and subversion \nagainst Cuba, even though all know that the President \nof that country is vested with sufficient authority to \nmake real change and enjoys the broad majority \nsupport of the North American people in that respect. \n For United States citizens or foreigners residing \nin that country, travelling to Cuba remains illegal. It is \nimpossible to sell Cuban products or products \ncontaining Cuban components or technology to the \nUnited States. With very limited exceptions, Cuba is \nforbidden to acquire, here or in any other country, any \nproduct containing a fraction of American input or \ntechnology. Financial transactions in United States \ndollars, whether linked to Cuba or not, can be either \nconfiscated or frozen and the banks involved may be \nfined. Fines worth several millions are imposed on \nUnited States and foreign companies for violating the \nvenal blockade laws. \n In addition, and in open contradiction of \ninternational norms, Cuba\u2019s broadcasting space \ncontinues to be violated and radio and television \nbroadcasts continue to be used for subversive purposes, \nwhile millions in federal funds are used to foment \npolitical instability in my country. Part of Cuba\u2019s \nterritory has been seized by the United States, which \nhas imposed a military base in Guant\u00e1namo that has \nbecome a centre of torture beyond the jurisdiction of \ninternational humanitarian law. \n United States immigration policy towards Cuba, \nbased on the Cuban Adjustment Act, is a politically \nmotivated exception that encourages illegal migration \nand costs human lives. Cuba\u2019s inclusion on the United \n  \n \n10-55122 48 \n \nStates\u2019 spurious list of countries that sponsor \ninternational terrorism is deeply immoral. \n Our demand, and the universal appeal concerning \nit, is well known. The five Cuban anti-terrorists who \nhave been incarcerated in the United States for 12 years \nas political prisoners must be immediately released. \nSetting them free would be an act of justice that would \nenable President Obama to show his true commitment to \ncombating terrorism in our own hemisphere. \n The President of the United States still has the \nopportunity to make a historical rectification of an \nutterly futile 50-year genocidal policy left over from \nthe cold war. It would be an act of resolve that could \nonly encourage the support of those who elected him \nfor change and of the community of nations that votes \nfor it every year. Whatever the circumstances, the \nCuban revolution will unyieldingly and tenaciously \npursue the sovereign path chosen by our people and \nshall not cease in its endeavours, based on the precepts \nof Mart\u00ed and Fidel, to overcome all injustice."

        "file_text": "Let me start by extending my \nsincere congratulations to you, Mr. President, and your \ncountry, Switzerland, for your election to preside over \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I am \nconfident that with your extensive experience and \ndiplomatic skill, you will lead this session to a \nsuccessful conclusion. I pledge the support of the \nEritrean delegation in your noble efforts for the \ncommon good. I wish also to commend your \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, \nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session, \nfor his excellent leadership. He indeed served us well. I \nwould also like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki \nmoon for his leadership and his report on the work of \nour United Nations at the outset of this general debate \n(see ). \n We meet again, at this sixty-fifth session of the \nAssembly, to expound on the state of our individual \ncountries and to reflect on regional, continental and \nglobal affairs. We come to this gathering year after \nyear to share our thoughts and explain our positions on \nsome issues of interest. Yet we realize that the outcome \nof our deliberations and resolutions falls far short of \nour own expectations, let alone the aspirations of \nhumanity. We agree that the institutions and procedures \nof this Organization have long outlived their time, and \nyet we remain paralysed in our efforts to transform the \nUnited Nations. \n While the prospects for a rapid reform of the \nUnited Nations system appear to be dim, we cannot \nand will not give up. We have to continue to speak out \nand work tirelessly for a United Nations that is fit for \nthe twenty-first century and for a more just and \nequitable world. At the same time, we have to focus on \nour own nations and regions to ensure a peaceful and \nstable environment and a dignified life for our peoples. \nIt is that perspective that informs Eritrea\u2019s policies at \nthe national, regional and international levels. \n Internationally, Eritrea seeks, through robust and \nconstructive engagement, to make its modest \ncontribution to global peace, security, justice and \nequity and to the protection and enhancement of the \nenvironment in the face of changes that threaten the \nvery survival of humanity. \n Regionally, Eritrea\u2019s efforts are directed at \nsecuring peace, stability, development and cooperation \nin the wider Horn of Africa and the Red Sea regions. \nWe endeavour to contribute to transforming our \ndangerous neighbourhood, a neighbourhood mired in \nnumerous conflicts, into a cooperative and peaceful \nregion. In that connection, I wish to touch upon some \nof Eritrea\u2019s immediate concerns. \n In regard to the Sudan, Eritrea is working closely \nwith the Sudanese parties and with regional and \ninternational actors as the country enters a critical \nperiod in its history. Eritrea believes that the \ninternational community as a whole needs to \nwholeheartedly support the parties to the \nComprehensive Peace Agreement as they approach the \nmomentous referendum date in January 2011, and \nbeyond. Irrespective of the outcome of the referendum, \nrelations of trust and cooperation between the parties \nare crucial for peace and stability, not only in the north \nand south, but throughout the region. For all those \nreasons, we ought to encourage the parties to reach \nagreement on the post referendum issues and relations \nas soon as is feasible. There is also a need to \nsimultaneously help the protagonists in the Darfur \nconflict to finally reach an agreement within the \ncontext of the Doha talks that are set to resume in the \nnext few days. \n On Somalia, it is Eritrea\u2019s considered view, borne \nout by the bitter experience and spiralling violence of \nthe past two decades, that there can be no military \nsolution to the problem in Somalia. While that \nconviction by now is widely shared in the international \ncommunity, serious doubts continue to be raised as to \nwhether the alternative \u2014 that is, a Somali-owned and \nSomali-driven, inclusive political process \u2014 is \npossible and practicable. \n Eritrea does not by any means believe or suggest \nthat that is easy or that it can lead to immediate results. \nIt will undoubtedly be a complex and protracted \nprocess, but ultimately achievable. For, even in the past \ntwo turbulent decades, Somalis have more than once \ndemonstrated that, given the right environment, they \nare capable of finding home-grown solutions to their \nproblems. Eritrea therefore urges the United Nations \nand all those concerned with peace and stability in \nSomalia to earnestly engage all Somalis and to give the \n \n \n37 10-55264 \n \npolitical process the serious and sustained attention it \ndeserves. \n I turn next to the matter of Eritrea and Ethiopia. \nWhile the United Nations grapples with the Sudan and \nSomalia, it continues to ignore the grave consequences \nof Ethiopia\u2019s continued occupation of sovereign \nEritrean territory, eight years after the ruling of the \nEritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission and three years \nafter the Commission ended its work by depositing \nwith the United Nations the demarcation of the \nboundary between the two countries. \n Ethiopia\u2019s illegal occupation and the United \nNations silence, which mean the continuation of the \nconflict, are exacting a heavy price on the peoples of \nEritrea and Ethiopia and are complicating the regional \nsituation. I wish to remind the United Nations that \nEritrea awaits responsible and urgent action to end \nEthiopia\u2019s violation of international law and its threat \nto regional peace and security. \n Eritrea\u2019s constructive engagement on regional \nand international matters stems from its firm \nconviction that a conducive external environment is \nessential for nation-building. As Eritrea enters its \ntwentieth year of independence, it remains focused on \nbroad-based and people-centred political, economic, \nsocial and cultural development that will afford a life \nof dignity and prosperity to our people. After several \nyears of consistent investments in health, education, \nagriculture and other essential infrastructure, we have \ncreated a solid basis for sustained economic growth. It \nis expected that trade and domestic and foreign \ninvestment will provide additional impetus for the \ngrowth of our economy. I wish to seize this opportunity \nto extend an invitation to all interested countries and \ntheir enterprises to become our partners in \ndevelopment."

        "file_text": "When I arrived yesterday \nin New York, I received a phone call from the chairman \nof one of the Jewish organizations, who asked me how \nI was coping with all the pressure that is being placed \non Israel. \u201cSurely\u201d, he said, \u201cit must be very difficult\u201d. \nI recalled an old joke, which tells of five Jews who \nchanged the way we see the world: Moses, law is \neverything; Jesus, love is everything; Marx, money is \neverything; Freud, sex is everything; and Einstein, \neverything is relative. So, I told him that everything is \nrelative. On one hand, it is very difficult. On the other \nhand, it is easier than before, because now we have a \nstable coalition and a stable Government and we have \nthe support of a majority of Israel\u2019s citizens. We are \nready for a fair solution and we are ready to cooperate \nwith the international community. However, we are not \nready to compromise our national security or the vital \ninterests of the State of Israel. \n At the outset, I want to emphasize that, contrary \nto what is often presented in the international media, \nthe political arena in Israel is not divided between \nthose who seek peace and those who seek war. \nEveryone wants peace, and the controversy in Israel \ncentres on the specific question of how to achieve this \npeace, how to reach security and stability in the region. \nAnd the question is: why, in the 17 years since we \nsigned the Oslo Accords, have we not arrived at a \ncomprehensive agreement signifying the end of the \nconflict and the removal of future mutual claims? \n Despite all of the efforts of all the good people \nwith the best of intentions, including Yitzhak Rabin, \nShimon Peres, Benjamin Netanyahu, Ehud Barak, Ariel \nSharon and Ehud Olmert; despite the summit meetings \nat Camp David between Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat \nwith the presence of former President Bill Clinton; and \ndespite the Annapolis Summit between Ehud Olmert \nand Mahmoud Abbas, we are today still in deadlock. \n In fact, contrary to the prevalent view that the \nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict is the heart of the instability \nin the Middle East or is the main reason for the \nregion\u2019s numerous conflicts, the reality is entirely \ndifferent. More than 90 per cent of the wars and war \nvictims of the Middle East since the Second World War \ndid not result from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and \nare in no way connected to Israel. Rather, they stem \nfrom conflicts involving Muslims or conflicts between \nArab States. The Iran-Iraq war, the Gulf war, the wars \nbetween North and South Yemen, the Hama atrocities \nin Syria, and the wars in Algeria and Lebanon \u2014 these \nare just a few examples from a list that goes on and on. \n The second flawed explanation for the \nlong-standing conflict between Israel and the \nPalestinians that has gained popularity is that the root \nof the problem is the so-called occupation, the \nsettlements in Judea and Samaria and the settlers \nthemselves. Only the establishment of an independent \nPalestinian State in Judea, Samaria and Gaza, so the \nargument goes, will ensure peace in the region. \n It is sufficient to state a number of well-known \nfacts in order to refute that claim. First, all of Judea, \nSamaria and Gaza were under Arab control for \n19 years, between 1948 and 1967. During those \n19 years, no one tried to create a Palestinian State. \nPeace agreements were achieved with Egypt and \nJordan, despite the presence of settlements. And the \nopposite is also true: we evacuated 21 flourishing \nsettlements in Gush Katif and transferred more than \n10,000 Jews. And, in return, we have Hamas in power \nand thousands of missiles landing on Sderot and \nsouthern Israel. \n Another misguided argument is the claim that the \nPalestinian issue prevents a determined international \nfront against Iran. This argument is not only flawed, it \nis completely irresponsible. The same argument could \nbe made that the Palestinian issue prevents action on \nNorth Korea, piracy in Somalia, the humanitarian crisis \nin Sudan or the challenge of Afghanistan. \n Just as the Khomeini Revolution had nothing to \ndo with the Palestinian issue, neither is the Iranian \ndecision to develop nuclear weapons related. In truth, \nthe connection between Iran and the Israeli-Palestinian \nconflict is precisely the contrary. Iran can exist without \nHamas, Islamic Jihad and Hizbullah, but the terrorist \norganizations cannot exist without Iran. Relying on \nthose proxies, Iran can, at any given time, foil any \nagreement between Israel and the Palestinians or with \nLebanon. \n Thus, in searching for a durable agreement with \nthe Palestinians, one that will deal with the true roots \nof the conflict and will endure for many years, one \nmust understand that, first, the Iranian issue must be \nresolved. One must deal first with the root cause of the \nproblem, and not its symptoms. There are, of course, \nyet other problems that must be solved; solving that \none would not be sufficient, but it is nevertheless a \nnecessary condition. \n \n \n9 10-55264 \n \n In trying to resolve the conflict between Israel \nand the Palestinians, we are dealing with two types of \nproblems: emotional problems and practical problems. \nThat is why the solution must also be a two-stage one. \n The emotional problems are, first and foremost, \nthe utter lack of confidence between the sides and \nissues such as Jerusalem, recognition of Israel as the \nnation-State of the Jewish people, and refugees. Under \nthose conditions, we should focus on coming up with a \nlong-term intermediate agreement, something that \ncould take a few decades. We need to raise an entire \nnew generation that will have mutual trust and will not \nbe influenced by incitement and extremist messages. \nTo achieve a final status agreement, we must \nunderstand that the primary practical obstacle is the \nfriction between the two nations. \n As is true everywhere, where there are two \nnations, two religions or two languages with competing \nclaims to the same land, there is friction and conflict. \nCountless examples of ethnic conflict around the world \nconfirm this, whether in the Balkans, the Caucasus, \nAfrica, the Far East or the Middle East. Where \neffective separation has been achieved, conflict has \neither been avoided or has been dramatically reduced \nor resolved. Consider the cases of the former Yugoslav \nrepublics, the split-up of Czechoslovakia and the \nindependence of East Timor as cases in point. Thus, the \nguiding principle for a final status agreement must not \nbe land-for-peace but rather, exchange of populated \nterritory. Let me be very clear: I am not speaking about \nmoving populations, but rather about moving borders \nto better reflect demographic realities. \n This is not an extraordinary insight and is far less \ncontroversial than some may seek to claim. In fact, \nprecisely this notion \u2014 that a mismatch between \nborders and nationalities is a recipe for conflict \u2014 has \nlong been accepted as a virtual truism in the academic \ncommunity. Leading scholars and highly respected \nresearch institutions have even coined the term \u201cright-\nsizing the State\u201d to capture the idea that States and \nnations must be in balance in order to ensure peace. \nThis is not a controversial political policy. It is an \nempirical truth. \n But beyond empirical truth there is historical \ntruth, namely, the almost 4,000 years during which the \nJewish people were born in the land of Israel and \ndeveloped the corpus of ethical and intellectual \ntreasures that have been instrumental in the rise of \nWestern civilization. The 2,000 years of forced exile \nand interim conquest by Byzantines, Arabs, \nMamelukes, Ottomans and others cannot and never will \nimpair the unbreakable bonds of the Jewish people to \nits homeland. Israel is not only where we are, it is who \nwe are. \n In closing, let me remind everyone in this Hall of \nthe quote on the plaza across from the United Nations, \nwords spoken in Jerusalem almost 3,000 years ago by \nthe Jewish prophet Isaiah: \n \u201cThey shall beat their swords into plowshares and \ntheir spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not \nlift up sword against nation, neither shall they \nlearn war any more.\u201d (Isaiah 2:4) \n Inspired by the deep wisdom embodied in these \nwords, let us hope that the path to true peace \nprophesied by Isaiah will guide our two peoples, in two \nnation-States, living in peace and security."

The range and urgency of the challenges \nthat now confront the international community in our \nglobalized and interdependent world demand, at the \nvery least, our steadfast support for and commitment to \npeace and security for our communities and peoples, \nand for future generations. \n If we are to effectively guarantee human rights \nand achieve peace and security and social and \neconomic justice for all, we need to be united in this \nendeavour, and our cooperation and multilateral joint \nefforts need to be durable and effective. My \nGovernment and people of Vanuatu are steadfast in our \nbelief that the United Nations remains uniquely suited \nto the pursuit and coordination of global initiatives to \nattain these objectives. \n Vanuatu hosted the forty-first annual Pacific \nIslands Forum in our capital, Port Vila, last month. As \ncurrent Chair, I wish to inform the Assembly that the \nPacific Islands leaders again noted that transnational \ncrime remains a threat to national and regional \nstability, in particular the proliferation of small arms \nand light weapons and illicit drugs. Consequently, the \nPacific Islands Forum has strengthened cooperation in \ncounter-terrorism measures and emphasized national \nefforts and regional cooperation in combating \ntransnational organized crime and in strengthening \nborder control capacities. The Pacific Islands Forum \nremains committed to collective arrangements and \nmechanisms to assist regional Governments recovering \nfrom national conflicts and crises. The value of those \nefforts is evident in the positive results of the Regional \nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, created \nunder the Biketawa Declaration with the assistance of \ncontributing member States, which would not have \nbeen successful without the strong leadership and \ncommitment of the Solomon Islands Government. \n While many of our member countries have not \nratified the United Nations Convention against \nCorruption (UNCAC), Forum leaders recognize the \nimportant role that the Convention offers in providing \nan internationally agreed framework for effective anti-\ncorruption activities around the world. I am pleased to \nsay that our regional organizations are working with \nthe various United Nations agencies to advance work \nto promote the Convention. \n While known as a region characterized by \noceanic isolation, smallness and general vulnerability, \nthe Pacific region is one of only a few in the world to \nhave experienced nuclear weapons testing. Therefore, \nadvancing the cause of nuclear non-proliferation and \nthe South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty \u2014 also \nknown as the Treaty of Rarotonga \u2014 remains critical \nand relevant to our signatory member States. The South \nPacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty reflects our region\u2019s \ndeep commitment not only to international peace and \nsecurity but also to collective international action to \nensure peace and security. In endorsing the successful \noutcome of the 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty Review \nConference, Forum leaders also welcomed the \nannouncement by the United States of America of its \nintention to ratify all protocols of the Treaty of \nRarotonga. \n Notwithstanding their size, national obligations \nand circumstances, our respective Forum members \nvalue and are proud of their contributions to United \nNations peacekeeping efforts. My own country is proud \nto contribute to United Nations peacekeeping missions \nin East Timor, Haiti, the Sudan, Bosnia, the Peace \nMonitoring Group and the Bougainville Transition \nTeam in Bougainville, and to the Regional Assistance \nMission to the Solomon Islands. \n Terrorism is an offence to humanity and contrary \nto the core values of the United Nations. We must be \nresolute in our national and collective efforts to combat \nterrorism in all its forms. For my own country, I \nreaffirm our strong support for the relevant Security \nCouncil resolutions against terrorism. Those \nresolutions provide a clear signal of our determination \n  \n \n10-55128 16 \n \nto suppress terrorist activities, including training, \ninternational movement and financing. \n All of us present here today have described the \nvarious stages of our progress to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). For our \nisland countries, our increasing vulnerability to threats \nand challenges, underscored by the impacts of the \nglobal economic, financial, fuel and food crises, is \nexacerbated by the current and impending impacts of \nclimate change, as well as our inherent limited capacity \nto respond. This is not to say, however, that we have \nnot made progress in achieving any of those goals. \nWith respect to Goal 2, the primary education systems \nof the Pacific region are characterized by high \nenrolment, with six of our countries currently \ndisplaying net enrolment ratios of over 90 per cent. \nMost, if not all, of our Pacific island countries are \nexpected to meet the goal of gender equality in \neducation by 2015. We have been able to achieve those \ngoals because we have localized the global indicators \nby adjusting them to suit our local circumstances and \npriorities. \n While we remain concerned about the pace of our \nprogress towards the Millennium Development Goals, \nwe are committed to accelerating progress towards \nachieving them by 2015. The Port Vila Declaration on \nAccelerating Progress on the Achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals, which was adopted by \nPacific Forum leaders at their meeting in Vanuatu last \nmonth, recognizes that the MDGs are extremely \nimportant, as is also the incremental path towards \nachieving those Goals \u2014 a path that should recognize \nand accommodate the special circumstances and \nchallenges we face in the Pacific. The Port Vila \nDeclaration also highlights the importance of \nmainstreaming the programme of support for the \nsustainable development of small island developing \nStates \u2014 which is captured in the Barbados \nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development \nof Small Island Developing States and the Mauritius \nStrategy for the Further Implementation of the \nBarbados Programme of Action \u2014 as an accelerator for \nachieving the MDGs in the Pacific and addressing the \nspecific vulnerabilities that we face. To ensure the \nsuccess of the Port Vila Declaration, we call for the \nsupport, collaborative action and commitment of the \ninternational community and our development partners \u2014 \nparticularly an improved understanding of and ability \nto address our vulnerabilities and for improved \ncoordination of efforts towards achieving the MDGs. \n Advancing the Pacific islands\u2019 work with respect \nto the Millennium Development Goals is closely and \ninextricably linked to the Mauritius Strategy. The \ndevelopment and endorsement of the Pacific Plan by \nthe Forum leaders in 2005 underscored the critical \nneed for creating stronger and deeper linkages between \nour countries and for identifying sectors where the \nregion could gain the most by sharing resources in the \narea of governance and by aligning policies. While we \nbelieve that we have made some excellent progress in \neffectively implementing the Mauritius Strategy at the \nnational and regional levels, we also acknowledge our \nshortcomings, some of which are beyond our control. \nThe growing vulnerabilities of our Pacific island \ncountries are exacerbated by the impacts of the global \neconomic crisis, climate change and natural disasters, \nand those factors affect our abilities to respond. \n Climate change remains the greatest threat to the \nlivelihoods, security and well-being of the peoples of \nthe Pacific. Continuing and concerted efforts by Forum \nmembers are being made at the national, regional and \ninternational levels to address the impacts of climate \nchange on Pacific communities and peoples. The \ndegree of urgency for real commitments to emissions \nreduction must be commensurate with the science and \nwith the associated impacts of climate change on the \nmost vulnerable communities. This issue must not be \nviewed with an eye to short-term impacts on traditional \nindustrial growth or political tenure, but rather with a \nlonger-term consideration of the sustainability of \neconomies, societies and peoples the world over. A \nmeaningful, legally binding agreement on emissions \nreduction must be reached urgently and without delay. \nRecognizing the importance of effective coordination \nand implementation of climate change adaptation and \nmitigation efforts at all levels \u2014 and particularly at the \nnational level \u2014 Forum leaders have endorsed a set of \nprinciples that will guide Forum island countries and \ndevelopment partners in this regard, bearing in mind \nexisting and ongoing efforts in the region. Those \nprinciples are consistent with the Cairns Compact and \nthe Pacific Islands Framework for Action on Climate \nChange, and they reflect recognition by Forum leaders \nof the important role that regional and international \narrangements play in supporting national adaptation \nand mitigation through the enhancement of capacity \nand access to resources. \n \n \n17 10-55128 \n \n I am also pleased to say that, ahead of the Canc\u00fan \nclimate change meetings this November and December, \nthe Government of Kiribati will be hosting the Tarawa \nClimate Change Conference in November. We \nanticipate bringing together representatives of \ncountries vulnerable to the impact of climate change, \nas well as representatives of major economies. \n Allow me at this juncture to make a few remarks \npertinent to Vanuatu\u2019s position on a number of issues. \nWe are meeting here at this Assembly session to once \nagain renew our commitment to the United Nations and \nto the principles enshrined in its Charter. However, the \nneed to reform the United Nations to ensure that it \neffectively responds to the needs of its Members \nremains imperative. \n In that regard, I wish to commend the Secretary-\nGeneral for advancing the work on the reform of the \nSecurity Council. We note the work done by the Chair \nof the intergovernmental negotiations on the question \nof equitable representation and increase in the \nmembership of the Security Council and other matters \nrelated to the Council. So we join all like-minded \nStates in encouraging the United Nations to pursue \nequitable reforms in its institutions in order to \nminimize the democratic deficit in the multilateral \narena. \n My Government also joins all other heads of \nGovernments that are Members of the United Nations \nfamily in congratulating the Secretary-General on \nbringing to a reality the efforts over four years to \ncreate the office of UN Women, a new entity formally \nestablished by the General Assembly within the United \nNations created in July of this year. That decision gives \nmore prominence to women and their place in our \nsociety.  \n Vanuatu celebrated 30 years of political freedom \nlast July. This year marks the end of the Second \nInternational Decade of Decolonization. My \nGovernment wishes to question the progress on some \nimportant processes of self-determination. It is \ndisturbing to think that we may legitimize practices \nthat contravene the very principles on which this \nOrganization has been founded. Are we to assume that \ndecolonization issues may be ignored in the years to \ncome so as not to unsettle the status quo? \n Issues relating to decolonization and severe \nhuman rights violations must be effectively and \nimpartially addressed. We call upon the United Nations \nto strengthen its efforts in working towards full \ndecolonization of Territories that are still under the \ncontrol of administrating Powers. Where there are \nserious reports of human rights violations, there must \nbe a stronger United Nations role in investigating all \nallegations of human atrocity. We are reminded that the \nnoble task of our multilateral Organization is to \nreaffirm our commitment to and respect for \nfundamental human rights and the dignity of the human \nperson. \n We are encouraged to see emerging nations, such \nas Kosovo, rising from the turmoil of restraint to take \nup their position in the midst of the independent \nnations of the world. It is in the spirit of democratic \nfreedom that justice must prevail for those peoples \nwhose right to political freedom continues to be \nsuppressed by colonial and illegitimate administrating \nPowers. That includes for those countries whose \npolitical freedom to claim their rights to territorial \nsovereignty under the United Nations Convention on \nthe Law of the Sea and those whose political freedom \nto rightfully claim an extended continental shelf under \nthe Convention are suppressed by colonial \nadministrative rule. \n As we applaud calls for a peaceful resolution of \nthe conflict between Israel and Palestine, my country \nalso calls for the lifting of the embargo on Cuba, which \nwill enable the good people of Cuba to improve their \nlives. \n My country, together with other least developed \ncountries in the Pacific, has consistently argued in this \nforum that the mechanisms and criteria for assessing \ngraduation eligibility must not be isolated from the \npermanent and inherent vulnerabilities of our countries. \nIt is unrealistic for United Nations agencies to look at \nthe progress and make projections without taking into \nconsideration the issues of permanent vulnerabilities \nand capacity to sustain growth in our countries. \nIndicators for most Millennium Development Goals \nclearly demonstrate little progress in human \ndevelopment. Climate change, volcanic eruptions and \nother disasters will continue to be significant factors \ninhibiting human development in our islands. Such \nfactors are critical, and we therefore reiterate our \nposition that they must be carefully weighed in the \nvulnerability graduation criteria. \n In the case of our very close neighbour, Fiji, my \nGovernment believes that all players are interested in \n  \n \n10-55128 18 \n \nseeing positive political progress there, which must \ncontinue to genuinely engage the good people of Fiji. \nWe have learned that multilateralism offers some \nconstructive innovations in diplomatic practice, but it \nmay also complicate conflict resolution by increasing \ntension between actors. \n Finally, in the spirit of reconciliation through the \nPacific way, I call upon all international and regional \ndiplomatic actors to assist in ways that will not \npolarize the region. Instead, our diplomatic approaches \nshould help to give genuine dialogue and engagement a \nmore credible opportunity. There should be genuine \nand renewed commitment to fostering relations in the \nPacific region, commitment that promotes greater \nfreedom, regional cooperation, friendship and \nintegration, as envisaged in the Pacific Plan document. \n In conclusion, I take this opportunity to express \nmy gratitude to all our development partners for the \nsupport that they are providing in building our \neconomies. I believe more can be done to assist the \nPacific island countries in addressing the growing \nchallenges confronting the region."

        "file_text": "The \nGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis has looked \nforward to this sixty-fifth session of the General \nAssembly with much anticipation. We welcome the \nopportunity to share in the usual rich general debate, to \nstrengthen existing relationships and to build new ones. \n This environment, we believe, facilitates the \nexchange of views on issues of common interest. We \nlook forward, particularly, to the views on the work \nstill ahead in tackling the insidious global challenges. \n The tasks I have in mind are: mitigating the \nnegative impact of the ongoing economic crisis on our \ncountries and peoples, and dealing with its many \nimplications for vulnerable small economies like ours; \ntackling the prolonged tightening of credit markets; \nprotecting the environment from degradation; \npromoting human security; and redressing the global \nepidemic of interpersonal violence. \n These are but a few of the problems with which \nGovernments across the globe must grapple. And we \nmust do this against a backdrop of uncertainty, while \nestablished centres of power are shifting. Governments \nmust now reconcile the pursuit of statecraft and \nnational interests with rapidly changing and less \npredictable relations among States. \n Additionally, the 2008 economic and financial \ncrises, whose effects are still very real today, have \nundermined confidence in our financial market systems \nand in what we had hitherto hailed as sound economic \nmodels. \n Similarly, since the global recession, poverty \nranks across the world have been swelling. The \n  \n \n10-55122 34 \n \npercentage of working poor has reached unprecedented \nlevels, and millions more, now unemployed, see little \nprospect for hope or relief. As a consequence, many \nhave lost faith in governance methods and in our long-\nestablished financial systems. \n We have all become painfully aware that \nenvironmental degradation is not country-specific and \nthat the actions of individuals and enterprises in one \ncountry ultimately harm ecosystems and threaten \nlivelihoods in others. Hence, as countries pursue \nnational agendas, we need to be mindful of the \ncommon interests and ties that connect our societies \nand peoples, and we must use every opportunity to \nwork towards a realistic convergence of our respective \ninterests. \n There can be little doubt that we have established \na solid foundation that allows us to envision new and \nexciting horizons. Reaching these horizons, however, \nrequires that, as we contemplate bold initiatives \nappropriate for the challenges confronting us, the \nUnited Nations must itself be prepared to further \ndeepen its engagement with Member States, regional \nand national systems, and international financial \ninstitutions.  \n My delegation believes that this is one way to \nhelp provide new opportunities, to facilitate greater \naccess to the resources needed to implement national \npolicies and meet international obligations. \n The United Nations, created out of the ruins of \nwar, has over the past six and a half decades, been \nprovidentially guided by an unfaltering spirit of \npartnership and prevailing common sense. Despite \ncountless challenges, that spirit is alive and well today. \nWe must therefore work even harder to fulfil the dream \nof its architects and to live out their vision. The United \nNations, then, must remain that vital nexus, fostering \nthe necessary partnerships for the greater good. \nPerhaps that would provide us with a more visible \npresence on the global stage, furthering the effort to \nbuild a better future for us all. We have seen this \npartnership in action on the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). We saw it as we worked to address the \nglobal financial crisis, which threatened large \neconomies and almost crippled the economies of small \nisland States. We saw it when Governments and \npeoples across the globe came to the assistance of our \nbrothers and sisters in disaster-stricken Haiti, the \nmagnitude of whose tragedy we had not experienced \nbefore in this hemisphere. \n In the context of repositioning the United \nNations, we began, earlier this month, a process of \nreview. It is through improved partnerships that the \nUnited Nations has an opportunity to bring \ninternational business communities and civil society \ntogether with Member States in a more structured way, \nallowing for the practical exchange of ideas, the \nsharing of expertise and best practices, and the \npromotion of development and prosperity. Saint Kitts \nand Nevis welcomes such a dialogue and partnership \nand recognizes the extent and reach of the United \nNations in helping to build capacity, in the face of \nchallenges such as the brain drain, which robs \ndeveloping countries of their invaluable human \nresources. Through such advocacy, the United Nations \ncan help also to safeguard gains in social and economic \ndevelopment. Saint Kitts and Nevis encourages \nMember States to embrace this idea of a multipronged \npartnership as a way to bolster development processes \nand strengthen global governance and accountability. \n Cognizant of the spirit of cooperation, the \nGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis thanks the \nGovernment and people of Taiwan for their continued \noutstanding support, international cooperation and \ndevelopment assistance over several decades. I \nwelcome the recent passage in that country\u2019s \nParliament of their international cooperation and \ndevelopment law, which incorporates the essence and \nprinciples of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness \nand the United Nations MDGs. We owe them a debt of \ngratitude for their efforts and for sharing their \ndevelopment experience through public projects and \nsocial, agricultural and private sector development. \n We note that, despite being successful before the \nWorld Trade Organization dispute settlement body, \nAntigua and Barbuda, a fellow CARICOM member \nState, has yet to benefit therefrom. In the spirit of \ncooperation, we urge the parties involved to seek \nquickly to resolve the situation and to arrive at a \nnegotiation settlement that is fair and just to Antigua \nand Barbuda and its nationals. \n 2010 has so far been a year of epic global natural \ndisasters. The regularity and ferocity of floods, \nhurricanes, typhoons, sea-level rises and other \ncatastrophic events are stark reminders of the \nconsequences of climate change. This is of particular \n \n \n35 10-55122 \n \nconcern to us, as small island developing States are \nhardest hit by the consequences of climate change. In \nthe light of the facts, it should be a matter of some \nimportance to develop a proactive coordinated \napproach, in collaboration with financial institutions, \ninsurance companies and other catastrophic-event-\nmitigation stakeholders. It is clear that the disaster \npreparedness, mitigation and response paradigms \nincorporated into our national development strategies \nare in need of urgent strengthening. Indeed, my country \nis committed to a comprehensive approach in disaster-\nrisk abatement and mitigation, through capacity-\nbuilding and through the creation of internal \nmechanisms that would ensure more effective \nresponses. I urge Member States to continue exploiting \nand exploring technology and best practices, as we \nwork in partnership to find sustainable solutions to this \nproblem. \n We believe that stronger political commitment, \ngreater cooperation and less apportioning of blame are \nrequired if we are to succeed in this endeavour. \nTherefore we hope that the global partnership and \nsolidarity evidenced in the aftermath of this year\u2019s \nmany disasters will continue to prevail. \n Four months ago, in May 2010, the General \nAssembly adopted resolution 64/265 on the prevention \nand control of non-communicable diseases. That \nresolution seeks to halt the growing trend of premature \ndeaths from these diseases \u2014 mainly, diabetes, \ncardiovascular diseases, cancers and chronic respiratory \ndiseases. Saint Kitts and Nevis applauds that resolution. \nAt the same time, however, we seize the opportunity to \nremind this Assembly of another public health and \npublic security issue that begs attention and resolution. \nMany will recall our efforts last year to focus attention \non the issue of the global epidemic of interpersonal \nviolence and its implications for development, health, \nsecurity and governance. The data reveal that \ninterpersonal violence accounts for about 4,300 deaths \nper day, one every 20 seconds, one half of them being \ndue to homicide. In some countries homicide rates are as \nhigh as 60 to 70 per 100,000. The human, social and \nfinancial costs of violence are unacceptably high and are \nescalating. \n The World Health Organization has been playing \na key role in this field through its Milestones of a \nGlobal Campaign for Violence Prevention programme, \nand the General Assembly has adopted individual \nresolutions on violence against children, violence \nagainst women and armed violence. There is still, \nhowever, no General Assembly resolution that calls for \nan integrated approach to all forms of interpersonal \nviolence; there is no resolution that speaks to youth \nviolence, one of the major contributors to high murder \nrates and social breakdown; and there is no resolution \nthat emphasizes the necessity of a multisectoral \nresponse to this problem. Saint Kitts and Nevis is \ntherefore once again soliciting your support for such a \nresolution. We are calling for an integrated and \nmultisectoral response to all forms of interpersonal \nviolence and recognition of the causes, with a view to \nits placement on the General Assembly agenda for \ndebate next year, 2011. As we celebrate the \nInternational Year of Youth, I can think of no better \ntime to introduce such a resolution. \n Saint Kitts and Nevis guards zealously the \neffective management and care of our resources. Our \nprimary resource is our people, particularly our youth \u2014 \nour future. In preparing them for the promises and the \npotential perils of tomorrow, we have been investing \nstrategically in education \u2014 education with relevance. \n I applaud the establishment of the United Nations \nEntity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of \nWomen (UN Women). The occupying of high office \nand decision-making roles by women has been the \nnorm in Saint Kitts and Nevis, and we remain \ncommitted to gender-equal opportunities at home and \nabroad. We look forward to participating actively in \nUN Women in the coming years and would be most \npleased to share our experiences. \n As we move forward through this sixty-fifth \nsession of the General Assembly, I encourage us to \nremain committed to the ideals that have brought us to \nthis point. Let us marshal the courage to do the things \nthat ought to be done if this indispensable global \ninstitution is to be able to deliver at its very best. \n In conclusion, permit me to congratulate you, \nMr. President, and the Government of Switzerland, on \nyour election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session. I thank you, Sir, for \nyour readiness to preside over this General Assembly \nat a time of great challenge. We feel confident that you \nwill rise to the occasion with great fortitude and \ndetermination. \n Permit me also to thank Mr. Ali Abdussalam \nTreki, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\n  \n \n10-55122 36 \n \nfourth session, for his leadership and commitment \nduring the past year. \n I trust that under your leadership, Mr. President, \nwe will seize the moment for change \u2014 this \ncompelling moment for reform and one that is reflected \nin the deliberations of the recent Meeting on the \nMillennium Development Goals \u2014 as we draw closer \nto the 2015 target. I assure you, Sir, of my \nGovernment\u2019s full support for your stewardship."

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to \njoin the previous speakers in expressing my sincere \ncongratulations to His Excellency Joseph Deiss of \nSwitzerland on his election as President of the sixty-\nfifth session of our General Assembly. I am confident \nthat under his able leadership our Assembly will be \ncrowned with significant progress on many global \nissues of international concern. Likewise, I would like \nto take this opportunity to pay tribute to His \nExcellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for the \nprofessionalism and dedication with which he \nconducted the previous session of our General \nAssembly. \n This sixty-fifth session is particularly significant, \ncombining in a timely manner two important high-level \nmeetings, namely, the high-level meeting on the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the High-\nlevel Review of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further \nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the \nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \nStates. Those important meetings remind us that there \nis no better entity than the United Nations to address \nglobal challenges and that multilateralism is relevant in \naddressing the world\u2019s interconnected and proliferating \n  \n \n10-55264 10 \n \nchallenges, including the global economic and \nfinancial crisis, climate change, food security, \ninternational peace and security, regional conflicts and \nothers. \n The global economic and financial storm seems \nto be over, but the task of restoring confidence and \npromoting economic recovery is far from complete and \nremains a daunting task, especially for the developing \ncountries. However, achievement of the MDGs is \nuncertain owing to the fragile economic recovery of \nthose countries. Failure to meet the MDGs by 2015 \nwill leave millions of people locked in the cycle of \npoverty. Therefore, as the economic recovery \ncontinues, a joint effort towards concrete action is \nneeded to further boost confidence and maintain the \nmomentum of global economic growth. \n In Cambodia we adopted our own MDGs in 2003, \nknown as Cambodian MDGs and have thus achieved \nthe MDG targets on reducing child mortality and \nHIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. According to a \nrecent study issued by the Overseas Development \nInstitute and the United Nations Millennium \nCampaign, Cambodia ranks among 20 countries that \nhave made the most absolute progress on the MDGs. \n Our world today is facing most serious global \nchallenges. Climate change presents a major threat for \nevery country, although it is more severe for poor \ncountries. Daily, we see an increase in headline news \nand reports on chaotic weather occurring worldwide, \nwith record heat and cold waves, unusual torrential \nrains leading to apocalyptic floods and landslides and \nmudslides that kill hundreds and displace millions of \npeople. Intense forest fires resulting from to extreme \nheat indicate that Mother Nature is raging. \n The confluence of those natural calamities also \nmeans that the agricultural sector, which depends \nlargely on weather, has been hit most often, resulting in \nadverse impacts on food security. All those events have \naggravated poverty and led to increased illegal \nimmigration, which has already become a serious \nhuman security problem. \n Although the much awaited summit of the \nfifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties in \nCopenhagen last year failed to achieve a binding \nagreement, it established a good foundation at the least \nto enhance international cooperation on a number of \nkey issues, such as deforestation, renewable energy and \nfinancial support for the world\u2019s poorest countries to \nmitigate and adapt to climate change. We regret, \nhowever, that the pledges have not been actualized. \n It is still uncertain whether a binding agreement \nwill be secured in Canc\u00fan this year. In particular, the \nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities \nfor developed and developing nations should serve as \nthe foundation for negotiations. Such a principle is key \nto rebuilding mutual trust among nations, which is the \nmost urgent task needed to achieve a meaningful result \nat the Canc\u00fan Conference. The spirit of compromise is \nabsolutely necessary for the sake of humanity. Climate \nchange has already reached a point of no return. \n Cambodia urges developed countries to honour \ntheir commitments to provide financial and \ntechnological aid to developing nations for the fight \nagainst climate change and to take the lead and cut \ntheir respective carbon dioxide emissions, so that the \nConference in Canc\u00fan can produce tangible results. \nFruitful outcomes in Canc\u00fan will depend on efforts by \nall to save humankind from much more serious \ncatastrophes. Climate change is not a vital problem of \nonly one country or one region, but of the world as a \nwhole. \n Cambodia is pleased to join the group of \ncountries for implementation of the Copenhagen \nAccord. We have launched our own initiative called the \nCambodian Climate Change Alliance, which focuses \non capacity-building and strengthening national \ninstitutions. Cambodia has also steadily implemented \nprojects aimed at reducing emissions from \ndeforestation and forest degradation and will continue \nto assume its share of responsibility in curbing carbon \ndioxide emissions and bringing about adaptation and \nmitigation measures. \n Cambodia believes that the problem of food \nsecurity also deserves great attention. At the World \nSummit on Food Security in November 2009 it was \ndisclosed that the number of hungry people had already \nreached 1 billion. That number will certainly increase \nday by day with the augmentation of the world \npopulation, thus further aggravating food security in \nthe world, particularly in the poorest countries. \n The lack of financial resources devoted to \nagriculture, the lack of access to agrotechnologies and \nthe irrational use of water resources are among the \ncatalysts of the food crisis. At the same time, as a result \nof recent high fuel oil prices, agricultural land has been \ndiverted to grow bioenergy crops to meet increasing \n \n \n11 10-55264 \n \ndemand for fuel, while the world population needs \nmore and more food. Furthermore, official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA) has not been \nsufficiently focused on agricultural production. \nTherefore, Cambodia hopes that the international \ncommunity will turn its attention to redirecting and \nincreasing ODA to emphasize food security. At the \nsame time, adequate and timely measures must be \ntaken to address the various obstacles to food security, \nin order to avoid recurrence of food crises in the future. \n In this context, the pledge of $20 billion over \nthree years made at the 2009 Group of Eight Summit in \nL\u2019Aquila to support agricultural production in poor \ncountries was extremely opportune and offered much \nhope, not only with regard to narrowing the food \nshortage but also for progress towards the MDGs and \npoverty reduction in general. Still, respecting that \ncommitment through timely disbursement and efficient \nutilization of that funding are absolutely essential. \nWithin Cambodia, food production is the top priority of \nour Government policy, and agriculture and irrigation \nare being aggressively promoted as a springboard for \nbroader economic development, with the ambition of \nturning Cambodia into a more important rice-exporting \ncountry. \n Peace and security remain issues of grave \nconcern in many parts of the world. Terrorism remains \na very serious threat to the world, killing innocent \npeople every day in many parts of the world. The \nregional security landscape in Asia and the Middle East \nconstitutes a concern for the international community, \ncompelling us to be ever vigilant. \n The situation in the Korean peninsula still \npresents a threat to peace and security in that region. \nCambodia earnestly calls on the parties to refrain from \nany act that could escalate tensions, with a view to \npromoting conditions that could enable the Six-Party \nTalks to resume as soon as possible. Peace will prevail \nonly as a result of negotiations aimed at re-establishing \nthe confidence necessary to a peaceful Korean \npeninsula. \n The Israeli-Palestinian issue remains one of the \nlongest and most explosive running conflicts in the \nMiddle East. Year after year the Palestinian people are \ndenied their right to establish a Palestine State living \nside by side in peace with the people of Israel. Year \nafter year this Assembly urges the parties concerned to \ncomply with the relevant Security Council resolutions, \nwhile the whole world waits impatiently for a peace \nagreement between Israel and the Palestinians. \nCambodia urges both parties to act with utmost \nrestraint and to avoid any act of provocation, in order \nto pave the way for a peaceful solution. \n Cambodia warmly welcomes the recent direct \npeace talks between the Israeli Prime Minister and the \nPalestinian President in Washington and in Egypt, as a \nstep in the right direction for bolstering an atmosphere \nof trust between the two sides. Cambodia shares the \nview of the international community that new \nsettlements in the West Bank present the main obstacle \nto efforts towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict. \nCambodia hopes that both sides can finally look for a \ncompromise on this crucial issue in order to achieve a \nbreakthrough for the sake of a lasting peace in the \nMiddle East. \n With regard to the embargo imposed by the \nUnited States of America against Cuba, Cambodia \nfirmly supports the resolutions of our Assembly on the \nnecessity of ending that embargo and calls upon all \nMembers of the United Nations to implement those \nresolutions in order to end the prolonged suffering of \nthe innocent people of Cuba.\n Given the very serious emerging global \nchallenges, the United Nations must be ready to fulfil \nits growing responsibilities to tackle those complex \nworldwide issues. The functioning of every organ of \nthe United Nations should be readjusted and \nreinvigorated so as to effectively manage the \ncomplexity of the world today to overcome all the \nchallenges in order to build a suitable world for all. \nRegarding the reform of the United Nations Security \nCouncil, Cambodia is of the view that priority should \nbe given to increasing the representation of developing \ncountries, which comprise a vast majority of the United \nNations membership. For many years, many have \nraised the matter of reform, but unfortunately particular \ninterests have prevailed over the world\u2019s concerns and \nprevented the reform from taking place."

        "file_text": "I would first like to \ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to \n  \n \n10-55122 6 \n \npreside over the sixty-fifth session of the General \nAssembly. Please be assured of my delegation\u2019s full \nsupport and cooperation. I would also like to take this \nopportunity to offer our appreciation to both your \npredecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, for the \nexemplary manner in which he guided the work of the \nsixty-fourth session, and to Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon for his leadership of the United Nations over \nthe past four years. \n Last week, I had the opportunity to report on the \nMaldives\u2019 progress towards attainment of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). My report \ndemonstrated that while we have achieved five of the \neight MDGs \u2014 namely, Goals 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 \u2014 \nseveral others remain challenges, and some \nachievements are increasingly becoming threatened. \nFor example, the Maldives has made great strides in \neliminating poverty, in education and in improving \nmortality rates among mothers and infants. However, \nwe have yet to make significant gains in the area of the \nempowerment of women. We are also still struggling to \nprovide for our environmental and development needs. \nMoreover, religious extremism runs counter to notions \nof equality and social justice and endangers our \nachievements in gender parity. All the while, \nenvironmental and economic vulnerabilities threaten to \ndiminish our gains. \n Those gains, among others, have improved the \nlives of the Maldivian people and contributed to a \nsituation that has led to our imminent graduation from \nthe United Nations list of least developed countries \n(LDCs) this year. While we look forward to our \ngraduation, we are also concerned about the sudden \nwithdrawal of some of the benefits afforded to LDCs \nthat have helped sustain our development efforts for \nthe past four decades. Those include preferential \nmarket access and concessionary financing. While we \nwere very encouraged by the pledges made by our \npartners at the donors conference held in the Maldives \nin March this year to invest in urgent development \nprojects, we anxiously await the speedy disbursement \nof the promised aid. \n Furthermore, we look forward to working with \nour development partners to achieve consensus on a \ntransitional model that provides for a gradual reduction \nof benefits to avoid the disruption of our development \nefforts, as stipulated in resolution 59/209. As a country \non the verge of LDC graduation, we look forward to \nadopting a development strategy that places emphasis \non greater independence and economic stability \nthrough private investment and public-private \npartnerships. Our Government\u2019s policies on \nprivatization and our employment of commercial \ndiplomacy are designed to achieve this transition. \nHowever, like many other small island States, our \ngeopolitical and socio-economic circumstances will \ncontinue to render the Maldives vulnerable. \n The impact of the recent global recession clearly \ndemonstrates those vulnerabilities. As a country \nprimarily dependent on tourism and fishing, the \nMaldives was severely affected by decreases in \nconsumption in our traditional markets. As a result, the \nGovernment was compelled to implement severe \nausterity measures that cut public spending and \nundertook massive economic reforms. Nevertheless, \nour people continue to face formidable development \nchallenges, and thus the Maldives will continue to push \nfor greater recognition within the United Nations for \nthe plight of small island developing States. \n The economic transition in the Maldives \ncomplements an ambitious political transition from \nautocracy to democracy. Although this is a daunting \ntask, we have been successful in achieving important \nmilestones over the course of these past two years. In \nfact, the two-year period of transition stipulated in our \nnew Constitution concluded in August. This process \nresulted in the establishment of our Supreme Court and \nthe creation of other relevant institutions. While our \ntransition process was accompanied by some political \ndiscord, it was largely peaceful. \n Our friends in the international community \nhelped us find peaceful solutions during this somewhat \ntumultuous period in our politics. I would like to thank \nall members of the international community for their \ncontinued engagement and assistance, and especially \nPresident Mahinda Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka for his \nconstructive contributions. \n The Maldives\u2019 transition to democracy has been \naccompanied by our evolution from an abuser of \nhuman rights to a staunch advocate for them. We are \nproud of what we have achieved, but are the first to \nrecognize that there is no shortage of challenges that \nrequire our immediate attention. These include the \nneed to abrogate the use of torture, the need to \nsafeguard the rights of women, children and the \ndisabled, and the need to improve our capacity to deal \nwith human trafficking in our region.  \n \n \n7 10-55122 \n \n The Maldives is proud to have been elected to the \nHuman Rights Council in May, and we are cognizant of \nthe trust and responsibility conferred upon us by the \noverwhelming support demonstrated by United Nations \nMembers across all regions. We will continue to \nuphold our pledge to use our membership to promote \nhuman rights through positive engagement and to \naddress sensitivities in our collective quest to protect \nthe most vulnerable. Moreover, the Maldives is \nundergoing its own universal periodic review this year, \nand we consider this exercise to be an opportunity to \nfurther strengthen human rights protections at home. \n While our interest in human rights is rooted in \nour ambition to improve the lives of our own citizens, \nit also emerges from our rising concerns about life in \nour now interconnected global village, where the need \nto compel tolerance, understanding and respect for \nhuman dignity is greater than ever before. We support \nthe initiatives for a culture of peace, dialogue among \ncivilizations and tolerance among different faiths. \n As a Muslim country, we lament the rising tide of \nIslamophobia in non-Muslim States. The people of the \nMaldives certainly appreciate the difference between \nGovernment-sanctioned incidents and those anti-Muslim \nactivities that can be attributed to marginal segments of \nnon-Muslim societies. However, we believe that \nreligious intolerance, negative stereotyping, racial \nprofiling and discrimination thwart this institution\u2019s \nmission for peace and prosperity among all societies. \nTherefore, we must intensify our efforts to promote a \nculture of tolerance and understanding while pursuing an \neffective dialogue to expand the scope of rational \ndiscourse between the Islamic world and other \ncivilizations. \n Some of the gravest threats facing humankind \ntoday do not occupy their rightful places in the \nheadlines, nor do they gain the significant attention \nthey require. We believe that climate change is such a \nthreat. For the Maldives, the effects of global warming \npose an overwhelming threat to our infrastructure, our \neconomy and our very existence. \n In an attempt to implement adaptation measures, \nthe Maldives has invested in water and sanitation \nprojects and coastal defences and is attempting to \ndevelop voluntary resettlement programmes to more \nviable islands within the country. We are also investing \nin a low-carbon future that emphasizes renewable \nenergy and other green projects to achieve our goal of \nbecoming carbon neutral by 2020. \n It is obvious that our actions alone cannot save \nus. The global community must act. Regional \ninitiatives that complement United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) processes \nmust be pursued. Weeks before Copenhagen, the \nMaldives convened a group of countries and formed \nthe Climate Vulnerable Forum to declare our concerns \nwith a united voice. I am pleased to report today that \nKiribati will take over the leadership of this group \nahead of the sixteenth session of the Conference of the \nParties to the UNFCCC in Canc\u00fan this year, and that \nBangladesh will steer it to the seventeenth session in \nSouth Africa next year. \n The Asian region is one of the most vulnerable to \nclimate change. We recognize that failure to extend \nemissions targets beyond 2012 will leave 60 per cent of \nthe world\u2019s population without durable solutions for \nthe global warming effects already being felt. Threats \nto food and water security for the world\u2019s most \nsusceptible populations will undoubtedly perpetuate \ndisease, exacerbate conflicts and threaten to erode \ndecades of hard-won successes achieved by countries \nthroughout the region. \n While we have high hopes for the ensuing \nsixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth sessions of the \nConference, we believe that alternative solutions that \nharmonize the development needs of industrial States \nwith the human and economic rights of vulnerable \npeoples should exist. Therefore, the people of the \nMaldives and Timor-Leste call for an Asian initiative \nthat would forge a consortium of Asian countries and \nregional partnerships. This will aim to enable our \nregion to aid the world\u2019s most vulnerable States. \n The Maldives believes that it is time to let go of \nthe mistrust and blame that has plagued the UNFCCC \nprocess. We welcome the recent voluntary initiative of \nIndia to curb its emissions and its commitment to \npromoting green energy without waiting for others to \nfollow suit. We call upon all nations large and small to \ncome together in a cooperative spirit in Canc\u00fan so that \nwe may effectively establish and promote mitigation \nactivities that will restore our native carbon sinks, \nincrease energy efficiency, reduce emissions and \npreserve our ecosystems. \n The Maldives would also like to state its support \nof the Group of Four position for reform of the \n  \n \n10-55122 8 \n \nSecurity Council. We believe that an expansion of \npermanent membership to reflect the realities of our \ncontemporary international system will improve \nrepresentation in the Council and better serve to \naddress a panoply of concerns facing nations in all five \nregions today. \n The Maldives also continues to grapple with \ntraditional security threats. The scourge of terrorism \nand the growing menace of piracy threaten national, \neconomic and maritime security throughout our region \nand around the world. Yet deficits in the capacity to \nattribute criminal accountability to the perpetrators of \nterrorism persist. Our failure is marked by the advances \nin the modus operandi of terrorists, the proliferation of \nillegal technology transfer, and the surge in the trade of \nillicit weapons. The Maldives cannot stress enough the \nimportance of this Assembly\u2019s finalizing the draft \nconvention on terrorism. \n Our geographical location in the Indian Ocean \nmakes the Maldives particularly vulnerable to threats \nto its maritime security, as our vast open waters \ncontinue to prove difficult to police. We are deeply \nconcerned over the surge in piracy that has moved \nbeyond the Gulf of Aden into the Indian Ocean. If the \ninternational community does not increase its efforts, \nwe fear that piracy may end up turning into an \nuncontrolled threat to security in the region. Thus, we \nwere particularly encouraged by the adoption of \nSecurity Council resolution 1897 (2009) and are \npleased with the work of the Contact Group on Piracy \noff the Coast of Somalia. We feel, however, that it is \nimportant for the Group to urgently establish an easily \naccessible legal toolkit for States that enables them to \nfill the vacuums in their national legal systems and \naddress piracy in a comprehensive manner. \n The continued suffering of the Palestinian people \ndeeply saddens the Maldives. They have been denied \ntheir right to self-determination and their right to live \nin peace and freedom in their own independent State \nfor far too long. While recognizing the rights of the \nPalestinians, we also appreciate and support the right \nof the people of Israel to live in peace and security \nalongside an independent and sovereign State of \nPalestine. We continue our call for all sides to use the \nongoing peace talks as an opportunity to resolve their \ndifferences, and are therefore heartened by the new \ninitiatives being pursued by the United States in its \npursuit of a Middle East peace treaty. Furthermore, we \ncall for continued support for the Governments of \nJordan and Egypt in their work on the Arab Peace \nInitiative, which we believe may provide an enduring \nsolution to the conflict for the people of the region. \n Additionally, our pursuit of a more secure and \njust world and our respect for international law were \nthe basis of the Maldives\u2019 recognition of the \nindependence of Kosovo, declared on 17 February \n2008. The Maldives believes that the declaration of \nindependence by the people of Kosovo reflects a last-\nresort remedy that embodies the best prospects for \npeace and stability in the region. The Maldives also \nwelcomes the advisory opinion of the International \nCourt of Justice on the unilateral declaration of \nindependence in respect of Kosovo, issued on 22 July \n2010, which concluded that that declaration of the \nindependence of Kosovo did not violate international \nlaw. While we have been disappointed by recent efforts \nto reverse this judgment, the Maldives welcomes the \nalternative solution, contained in the unanimously \nadopted European Union-sponsored resolution 64/298, \nas a positive step towards Kosovo\u2019s assumption of full \nUnited Nations membership. \n Closer to home, the Maldives has borne witness \nto advances in democracy, sustainable development, \nand peacebuilding throughout the region of the South \nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation. Notably, \nwe praise the progress made by the Islamic Republic of \nAfghanistan, including the development of democratic \ninstitutions, as well as improvements in the areas of \nhealth, education and the status of women. We wish the \nAfghans continued success in their efforts to rebuild \ntheir long-suffering nation, and implore the \ninternational community to maintain their support of \nthe Afghan people. \n Furthermore, the Maldives welcomes Sri Lanka\u2019s \nsuccess in its ongoing consolidation of peace and \ndemocracy, and we call upon the international \ncommunity to support that country in its reconciliation \nefforts, as well as in its efforts to rebuild a nation torn \napart by 25 years of sustained conflict. \n We are a small nation with big dreams. Our \ndreams are rooted in the vision of the Charter that \nbinds the membership of this Assembly together here \ntoday. Our hopes are inextricably linked to the fears of \nthe past that inspired this body and to the hopes of \nthose who dream of a future grounded in justice, \nequity, opportunity and peace for peoples of the North \nand South, in nations large and small. Our humanity \n \n \n9 10-55122 \n \ndefines our obstacles, but we believe that our dreams \nfor a better future defy our limitations. \n "

        "file_text": "The theme of the sixty-fifth \nsession of the General Assembly, \u201cReaffirming the \ncentral role of the United Nations in global \ngovernance\u201d, is appropriate and timely. Today\u2019s \ntransnational challenges, including issues of peace and \nsecurity, development, human rights, the environment \nand health require genuine global governance that \nencompasses all United Nations Member States. \n In this regard, Kenya fully reaffirms the central \nrole of the United Nations in global governance, \nconsistent with its Charter and international law. It is, \ntherefore, imperative that the ongoing United Nations \nreforms be accelerated in order to ensure that this \ninstitution of multilateral engagement is representative \nand transparent, is accountable to its 192 members and \noptimally achieves the aspirations of today\u2019s world. \n When I last addressed the General Assembly two \nyears ago, I briefed this august body on the major steps \ntaken by my country to resolve the political difficulties \nfollowing our general elections in December 2007. \nSince then, we have made tremendous progress in \nimplementing far-reaching reforms that will entrench \ndemocracy and secure our peace and stability. Top on \nthe reform agenda has been the enactment of a new \nconstitution, which was promulgated on 27 August \n2010 following a successful national referendum. \n The new Constitution greatly improves the \nstructures of governance and lays a firm foundation for \npolitical stability and economic prosperity. It has \ncreated new vitality and a sense of renewal. We believe \nthat this step will go a long way in contributing \ntowards the pursuit of the Millennium Development \nGoals. It is also our hope that this historic development \n  \n \n10-54827 30 \n \nwill contribute to the continued consolidation of \ndemocratic governance in our region. \n Ten years ago, world leaders meeting here in New \nYork committed themselves to pursue the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals in response to the world\u2019s main \ndevelopment challenges of poverty, ignorance and ill-\nhealth. Two thirds of the time allotted for the \nattainment of these Goals has lapsed. With only five \nyears left to the targeted year 2015, the urgency of \nbridging the remaining gap is a reality we must now \nconfront. \n As I indicated in my statement to this Assembly \nthree years ago, Kenya has invested significant \nresources in the pursuit of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. We have recorded substantial \nprogress in poverty reduction and education, in \nreducing maternal and child mortality, in the fight \nagainst HIV/AIDS and malaria, and in promoting \ngender equality and the empowerment of women. \n Climate change continues to hamper our \ndevelopment aspirations. In recognition of this \nchallenge, my country has taken major steps to \nenhance environmental sustainability, such as \nreclaiming and protecting our five major water towers; \nundertaking investments in wind, solar and geothermal \nenergy; and making comprehensive commitments to \ngreen our economy. \n Despite these efforts, Kenya is facing many \nnegative consequences of climate change. Our crop- \nand livestock-based agriculture, on which the vast \nmajority of Kenyans depend, is now at the mercy of \nunpredictable weather patterns. It is with a deep \nconcern, therefore, that we note the international \ncommunity\u2019s inability to make headway in the critical \nnegotiations on climate change. It is Kenya\u2019s hope that \nthe world will recognize the urgency of concluding \nthese negotiations in the interest of the survival of \nhumanity. I look forward to positive outcomes from the \nupcoming meetings on climate change in Mexico and \nSouth Africa. \n I now wish to turn to one of the major obstacles \nto the pursuit of peace and development, including the \nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals, in \nour subregion, namely, the continuing political \ninstability in Somalia that is festering beyond that \ncountry.  \n Since the early 1990s, Kenya has borne the full \nweight of insecurity in Somalia. Today, as this \nAssembly meets, the security situation in Somalia \ncontinues to deteriorate and threaten peace and \nstability across the entire region and beyond. Needless \nto say, the threat posed by today\u2019s Somalia to \ninternational peace and security is greater than that of \nany other conflict in the region. Yet Somalia continues \nto suffer benign neglect from the international \ncommunity, leading to many lost opportunities to \nresolve the crisis. The perceived reluctance of the \nSecurity Council to engage with Somalia has been a \nmatter of great concern for those of us who suffer the \nworst consequences of the conflict. Today, I wish to \ndraw the attention of this Assembly to yet another \nopportunity that should not be lost. \n In July of this year, the Intergovernmental \nAuthority on Development (IGAD) Summit identified \ncritical elements of engagement and took a number of \ndecisions on the way forward. These decisions were \nendorsed by the African Union summit in Kampala in \nJuly 2010. Unfortunately, the support needed to \nimplement these decisions by the international \ncommunity has not been forthcoming. \n It is against this background that Kenya urges the \nUnited Nations and the entire international community \nto seize the opportunity created by the African regional \ninitiative and lend support to the proposed measures, \nwhich include the appointment of an eminent high-\nlevel personality for Somalia, the effective deployment \nof the proposed 2,000 troops, a review of the current \nmandate of the African Union Mission in Somalia to \nenhance its peace enforcement capacity, and the \nextension of support to the Transitional Federal \nGovernment to bolster its effectiveness countrywide. \n As the Chair of the IGAD Committee on the \nSudan, I have remained actively engaged with the \nimplementation of the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement (CPA). I have done so because we in the \nIGAD region believe that the CPA holds the key to \npeace and stability in the Sudan and the region.  \n I wish to inform this Assembly that I have \nreceived assurances from both President Omer \nAl-Bashir and First Vice-President Salva Kiir to remain \non course with respect to the preparations for the \nreferendum. I am pleased to further inform the \nAssembly that both reaffirmed their commitment to \nresolve all the outstanding issues, to hold the \n \n \n31 10-54827 \n \nreferendum on 9 January 2011, and to accept the \noutcome of the vote. We in the region are looking \nforward to the holding of a successful and peaceful \nreferendum that promotes regional peace and stability. \n These efforts by the neighbours of the Sudan and \nthe African Union have created a momentum that is \ncritical to the full implementation of the CPA. It is \ncrucial that the world stand in support of these \ninitiatives as Sudan takes vital steps in relation to its \nfuture governance. I believe that continued engagement \nwith the leadership of both the National Congress Party \nand the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement is the \nonly way towards the peaceful resolution of the \nchallenges facing the Sudan.  \n In view of this perspective, I wish to inform this \nAssembly that I will convene the second IGAD Special \nSummit on the Sudan in November 2010, in order to \ntake stock of progress, ensure the process remains on \ncourse and support efforts relating to the post-\nreferendum arrangements. \n In conclusion, I wish to express my hope that \nthrough our unity, solidarity, cooperation and \ncommitment, the challenges facing the international \ncommunity will be overcome. Let us rise to the \noccasion and demonstrate our political will and ability \nto work together for the good of all humankind."

        "file_text": "I am indeed honoured to \naddress this Assembly for the first time as Prime \nMinister of the Republic of Slovenia. I reaffirm my \ncountry\u2019s commitment to the United Nations and its \nCharter. \n Let me also congratulate you, Sir, on your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fifth session. We all rely on your political \nwisdom and experience, and I assure you of my \ncountry\u2019s utmost support in the coming weeks and \nmonths. \n In the past few years, numerous national leaders \nhave spoken in this very Assembly about new global \nchallenges that threaten our security, prosperity and \nfreedom. There is a general consensus that more \neffective and coordinated global action is required to \naddress such challenges. For Slovenia, strengthening \nglobal governance means renewing our common \ncommitment to multilateralism and its principles of \ninclusion, legitimacy and transparency. \n The United Nations must keep its place at the \ncore of global governance structures. However, this \nOrganization also needs to adapt to the contemporary \nreality of an interconnected world and the resulting \nnew challenges and threats. As many of my colleagues \nhave already said, reform of the United Nations has \nbeen long undervalued. The composition of the \nSecurity Council is visibly out of date and the work of \nthe General Assembly needs revitalization. Progress in \npeacekeeping reform would strengthen all other United \nNations activities relating to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security, including preventive \ndiplomacy and post-conflict peacebuilding. \n The reforms of international economic and \nfinancial systems must continue at an accelerated pace, \nreflecting global development needs. Our endeavours \nshould aim at increasing accountability, responsibility \nand solidarity, while taking into account the need for a \n \n \n23 10-55103 \n \nstronger voice for and better participation of \ndeveloping countries, which should be fully included \nin the international response to the crisis. Together, we \nmust build a world in which economic indicators are \nnot the only measure of a prosperous society. Human, \nsocial and environmental values should also become \nprincipal elements of our criteria. In this connection, I \nencourage closer cooperation and coordination between \nthe United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions \nand between the United Nations and the Group of 20 in \nfinding the best possible responses to the crisis and in \naddressing the needs of the most vulnerable. \n It is unfortunate that, as a result of far-reaching \ndevelopments, we continue to face an even greater \nchallenge in climate change. Indeed, the past year has \nbeen a year of lost opportunities. However, this should \nnot be a reason to lower our ambitions. Climate change \nis real, the loss of biodiversity is unprecedented and \nthe consequences are already being felt by far too \nmany people around the world. In some cases, the very \nexistence of individual countries, States Members of \nthe United Nations, is at stake. This year, we must do \nbetter and do more in Canc\u00fan to reach a comprehensive \npost-2012 climate agreement that will limit global \nwarming to below 2\u00b0C, as stated in the Copenhagen \nAccord, and improve adaptation to the adverse effects \nof climate change. Our responsibilities differ, but we \nmust all shoulder our share of the common burden. \n After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the countries of \nWestern Europe decided to open their ranks to the \nStates of Central and Eastern Europe. This decision \nwas instrumental in building a modern Europe of key \ndemocratic values. The choice of enlargement of Euro-\nAtlantic institutions was thus a choice for stability on \nthe continent. \n Unfortunately, the financial and economic crisis \nand international debates in many European States \npushed aside some of the topics that are important and \nof strategic interest to the continent as a whole. The \nneed for a continued process of enlargement of the \nEuropean Union and NATO is one of them. I would \ntherefore like to underline that the commitment to \nenlargement to the Western Balkans needs to be \nhonoured, and all the more so since the situation in the \nregion today has changed for the better. Obvious and \ntangible progress has been made. \n In this connection, I would like to recall that only \na couple of weeks ago this Assembly adopted \nresolution 64/298 by consensus, acknowledging the \ncontent of the advisory opinion of the International \nCourt of Justice, which was rendered in response to a \nsubmitted request on the issue of the declaration of \nindependence of Kosovo. I am particularly glad that \nthe resolution paved the way for dialogue, which the \nEuropean Union is ready to facilitate. It is the historic \nresponsibility of the democratically elected leaders of \nthe countries of the Western Balkans to pursue \nreconciliation and the rebuilding of mutual trust. \n In order to promote the necessary confidence, I \ntherefore decided, together with the Prime Minister of \nCroatia, to launch the so-called Brdo process several \nmonths ago in Slovenia. I think the results and \nconsequences of this decision have so far been very \ngood. Our aim is to encourage dialogue and \ncooperation among the political leaders with a view to \ndiscussing mutual support and further steps on the road \nto the Euro-Atlantic integration of the entire region. I \nbelieve that we are on the right track, and we will \ncontinue to work in this direction. \n Slovenia plays an active role in the international \ncommunity and takes its responsibilities seriously. I \nwould therefore like to confirm once again our \ndedication to our candidacy for a non-permanent seat \non the Security Council, for the period of 2012-2013, \nat the elections to be held next year in this Assembly. \nSlovenia views its candidature as an opportunity to \ncontribute further to the maintenance of international \npeace and security, as well as the peaceful settlement \nof disputes. We intend to build on our international \ncommitments and experience gained in recent years. \nWe are committed to upholding the rule of law, respect \nfor human rights, international law and international \nhumanitarian law, and we continue to foster open and \ntransparent international dialogue in the spirit of \ncooperation and consensus-building. \n Our candidature therefore underscores the great \nsignificance Slovenia attaches to the role of the United \nNations in an increasingly interdependent and complex \nworld. Furthermore, it indicates Slovenia\u2019s desire to \nutilize its rich multilateral experience to enhance the \ngoals and principles of this universal, international \nOrganization. \n Finally, let me say once more how honoured I am, \nas the Prime Minister of Slovenia, to be present in this \nAssembly. Extraordinary historical circumstances have \nshaped the development of my country, which \n  \n \n10-55103 24 \n \ntherefore attaches great importance to the constant \npromotion of the noble purposes and principles of \ninternational relations, as defined in the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. I am therefore all the more pleased to \nhave been able to participate in the general debate \ndevoted to the reaffirmation of the central role of this \nOrganization in global governance."

        "file_text": "I am delighted and \nprivileged to address this Assembly. I believe that this \nis the right place to discuss the issues of greatest \nconcern to the international community. Recent years \nhave been marked by many challenges. All countries, \nlarge and small, had to tackle the financial and \neconomic downturn. They also had to deal with the \npainful consequences of natural and man-created \ndisasters. In a global world, all our countries must \nshare responsibility for the future. The scale of our \ndeeds and the openness of our hearts will make the \ndifference, not the size of our countries and territories. \nHere, I would like to share some views of my country, \nLithuania. \n Let me start with our proposals in the fields of \nsecurity and the environment. Lithuania has launched \nan initiative to introduce in the General Assembly a \ndraft resolution on sea-dumped chemical weapons. \nLithuania wants to strengthen international efforts in \nraising public awareness about dangerous munitions \nburied in the sea. It is in every country\u2019s interest to \nsupport a voluntary information exchange in order to \nstrengthen common security. Everyone must be aware \nhow lethally dangerous these dumped chemicals still \nare. We need to have guidelines on how to behave in \ncase of disaster. That is why United Nations \ninvolvement and an eventual resolution on this issue \nare so indispensable. That is why I call on the United \nNations to take a much more active role in very \nconcrete projects, even if they may not seem big \nenough for global attention. \n Gender equality is another topic of vital \nimportance for the nations of the world. We decided to \npromote it in the framework of the Community of \nDemocracies. That is another example of precisely \nfocused action. Gender equality issues are rarely \nassociated with issues like overcoming the economic \ncrisis or stopping climate change. However, it has been \nestimated that the elimination of gender discrimination \nin the labour market in Europe, for example, could \nincrease gross domestic product by as much as 30 per \ncent. \n It seems that the Lithuanian people have decided \nto test this estimate in practice, and I can give an \nexample. It is no surprise to us that women in \nLithuania hold a number of top positions in politics and \nbusiness. It is only natural that Lithuanian women have \nmade their own the famous saying: When the going \ngets tough, the tough get going. But we still need much \nmore coordinated effort. Gender equality on a global \nscale will become possible only when a certain level of \nsecurity and economic development is achieved. Let us \nall put all our efforts together to eradicate intolerance \nand discrimination, which so often are the main \nreasons for the many conflicts in the world. By doing \nthis we also pave the road to achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals that we all aspire to. European \nUnion activities such as the European Institute for \nGender Equality, based in Lithuania, can serve to lead \nother regions. I strongly hope that the high-level \nmeeting on gender equality issues which will be held \nwithin the framework of the Community of \nDemocracies in Vilnius, Lithuania, on 30 June next \nyear will explore many more new ideas and good \npractices. \n Security, the environment and gender equality: all \nare interdependent, and all need to be adequately \naddressed on the international agenda. That is a \n  \n \n10-54833 34 \n \nprerequisite for ensuring sustainable development. The \nEuropean Union has been for years the largest and \nmost responsible donor worldwide, the best example \nfor any country willing to contribute. These European \nvalues are very dear to my country, which has been a \nmember of the European Union since 2004. Lithuania \nhas limited resources, but we have provided \nhumanitarian aid to Haiti, Pakistan, Moldova, Ukraine, \nRussia and other countries. \n We have engaged in such difficult initiatives as \nthe training of the national security forces of \nAfghanistan. Working together with the people of Ghor \nprovince in Afghanistan, Lithuania has funded a \nnumber of community-based education programmes, \nbuilt 19 schools which have opened up their doors also \nfor girls, founded the first public library in the \nprovince\u2019s capital of Chaghcharan. That is our modest \ncontribution, but it works. I am sure that each time we \nimplement a concrete project we move closer to \nachieving our global objectives all together. \n I invite all the leaders gathered here to contribute. \nWe should welcome, support and multiply any and \nevery constructive effort, however small it may seem \nto us. Only joint efforts and concrete deeds will bring \npositive change to international politics. Let us develop \ninitiatives, let us implement them, let us implement the \nbest practices and let us work together."

        "file_text": "May I take this \nopportunity to join those who have come before me in \ncongratulating His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \nelection as President of our Assembly and on his \ndiligent stewardship of the proceedings thus far. I also \nthank and congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki for his leadership and drive at the \nhead of the sixty-fourth session of the Assembly. \n We spent the first three days last week debating \nthe progress made \u2014 or not made, as the case may \nbe \u2014 in attaining the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) by 2015. For many of us, there are still \nformidable struggles ahead. For Seychelles, while we \nhave made huge strides forward towards meeting these \nGoals, we are also pedalling furiously so as not to slip \nback on what we have already worked hard to achieve. \nThis brings to mind the question: Are the MDGs an end \nin themselves? The task does not end in 2015. It cannot \nend in 2015. What happens, and where are we headed \nafter that? \n Those of us that are middle-income countries, and \nthat includes many small island developing States \n(SIDS), already know the different set of challenges \nthat these questions bring \u2014 questions that other \ncountries will also have to face as they achieve and \nmove beyond the MDGs. The debate needs to start \nnow, as we fast approach 2015, on how countries will \naccess the affordable financing they will need not just \nto move beyond the MDGs, but to ensure that they \nkeep and do not lose what they have achieved. \n That is why Seychelles announced at the MDG \nsummit that we will be engaging with the United \nNations system to enter into new commitments towards \nsetting MDG-plus targets, the overall objective being \nto make sustainable development a reality beyond the \nMillennium Development Goals and the next \ngeneration. \n We are all aware of the differences among us in \nour sizes and populations. The needs of every Member \nof the United Nations are different. We have learned a \nlot about development over the years, and today we all \nknow that one-size-fits-all does not work. At the \nUnited Nations and other development organizations, \nwe have created development categories to facilitate \naccess for those most in need of the appropriate \nresources. Resources are always stretched, and, as we \nmove beyond 2015, we must make sure that \ndevelopment categories truly facilitate development. \nSuch categories must not become a way to punish those \nthat succeed in development. \n And we must not allow small island developing \nStates to fall through the cracks between the categories. \nMiddle-income SIDS face special problems that the \ninternational development architecture does not \ncurrently make provision for. The funding that is \navailable to SIDS is fragmented. There is no reliable \nfunding to them. Even on issues where SIDS are most \naffected, such as climate change, there are many \nbarriers to our ability to access funding, not least the \nuse of gross domestic product per capita criteria to \ndefine eligibility for funding. \n The question that will come up increasingly as we \ntry to answer the question of how to fund development \nbeyond 2015 is where SIDS can go to finance their \ndevelopment. The answer is that we need to define a \nspecific development category for SIDS to be used by \nall development partners. \n That is why small island developing States say \n\u201clet us start at home\u201d by requesting the Secretary-\nGeneral to initiate a system-wide review of how \neffectively the United Nations and its various agencies \n \n \n49 10-55122 \n \nare actually supporting SIDS, and how that can be \nimproved. This could be done by an inter-agency \nworking group that would provide concrete \nrecommendations to this sixty-fifth session of the \nGeneral Assembly as to how the United Nations system \ncould better support the specific needs of SIDS. The \nworld economic and financial crisis has reinforced the \nvulnerability of island States to external shocks. More \nthan ever, it has illustrated that islands need as much \nsupport as possible if they are to be able to pursue \ndevelopment successfully. \n As I have already highlighted, there are gaps in \nthe existing development system. Those gaps mean that \nwe must be prepared to be innovative in meeting the \ndevelopment challenges that are looming. We welcome \nthe efforts of several countries and of the Secretary-\nGeneral to adopt new and innovative means to finance \ndevelopment. In Seychelles, the pressures of the food, \nfuel and financial crises meant that in 2008 we had to \nengage in wide-ranging macroeconomic reform with \nthe support of the Bretton Woods institutions, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank and our Paris Club creditors. We \nare most grateful to all our partners for their support. \n I think it is interesting to note that while we were \nrestructuring our old debt, our economy began to grow \nthanks to new foreign direct investment, most of it \nfrom the developing world \u2014 the Gulf, Africa and \nAsia. There are many new channels for development \nthat remain relatively unexplored and unstructured. \n I would like also to brief the Assembly on a \ngroundbreaking renewable energy project being \nundertaken in Seychelles with the support of the \nUnited Arab Emirates Government. This project is an \nexample of how a small island can have access to \naffordable financing to reduce its dependence on fossil \nfuels \u2014 one of the things that make islands most \nvulnerable.  These South-South dynamics are often \noverlooked in the traditional dynamics of the United \nNations. Often, we also waste a lot of time on \nideological debates that further obscure the true \nobjectives of development. We need to be pragmatic \nand we need to act. \n Climate change, and in particular sea-level rise, \nremain by far the greatest threats to small islands. \nMuch more ambitious global action needs to be taken \nto significantly reduce emissions and implement \nadaptation in a manner that will ensure the \ndevelopment aspirations and survival of all countries, \nsmall islands in particular. We need to ensure that fast-\nstart funding is also available for disbursement as \nquickly as possible. \n I must stress the concern of small islands that \nmuch of the funding available to adapt to climate \nchange is being channelled through traditional funding \nchannels. This means that most SIDS will miss out on \nfunds because of our middle-income status. Climate \nchange requires funding mechanisms that do not rely \nonly on business as usual. We need a real fast start. For \nthe moment, we are still stuck at the starting block. \n While we reflect on the governance of the United \nNations, we must also spare no effort to ensure that we \ncan be effective in resolving conflict in those areas \nwhere human suffering is at its worst. In the Horn of \nAfrica, we remain deeply concerned about the ongoing \nsituation in Somalia. We convey our solidarity to the \nSomali people and the Transitional Federal \nGovernment that is trying to restore peace and security. \nWe fully support the efforts of the African Union, \nthrough the African Union Mission in Somalia, and of \nthe United Nations. \n It is clear, however, that we must now be \nprepared to move beyond what we have already tried \nand tested. The ongoing problems associated with the \nsituation in Somalia also continue, unfortunately, to \nhamper the conditions for development in the region. \nThe threat of terrorism is rising, while the scourge of \npiracy continues to spread further afield, as far east as \nMaldives and as far south as Madagascar. \n Seychelles has worked hard to ensure that our \nmaritime zones remain safe, and we thank all our \npartners for their support. Nonetheless, piracy has led \nto direct losses in our economy of over 4 per cent of \ngross domestic product. We welcome the new regional \nproject on piracy being developed by the Indian Ocean \nCommission and the Common Market for Eastern and \nSouthern Africa, with the support of the European \nUnion. This project approaches the problem from \nseveral angles simultaneously as we attempt to \nstrengthen the regional capacity for patrols and \nsurveillance, strengthen the legal and judicial capacity \nof our countries, and mitigate the negative effects on \nour economies. \n I would like to thank our friends and neighbours \nfor their support on this issue. It is an issue that \ndepends on all countries working together, both from \nwithin the region and beyond. We must also continue to \n  \n \n10-55122 50 \n \nengage with the Somalia to strengthen its ability to \nbuild its own institutions. \n Seychelles also strongly believes that the \ninternational community must strengthen its efforts to \ntackle transnational crimes that are often linked to \ninstability and insecurity, from money-laundering to \npeople trafficking. In the Indian Ocean region, we are \ndetermined to work with all partners to ensure that we \ncan address these issues effectively. \n We are all part of the United Nations because we \nbelieve that we must work together to achieve \ndevelopment. Development is a collaborative process. \nWe need to strengthen this collaboration. We need to \nmake more efforts to ensure that there is more \ninnovative financing to fund development. We need to \nbe more pragmatic in our approach. We know it will \nnot be easy, but that only strengthens our resolve. We \nare ready to move forward together."

        "file_name": "PER_65_2010.txt",
        "file_text": "This \nis the second time in 25 years that I have come to this \npodium as head of State of Peru to address the \nrepresentatives of all the countries of the world.  \n First of all, I would like to begin by \ncongratulating the President of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-fifth session. Peru will constructively \nsupport his actions because we are sure that his \nexperience will help us to achieve the results we hope \nfor. \n The first decade of this century has already been \nmarked by the bloody attack of 11 September 2001 and \nagain by the greatest economic crisis of the last \n80 years. That shows that we face enormous challenges \nthat know no borders and require a joint, united \nresponse from the entire international community. \nHence, in this most important forum on our globe, Peru \nreaffirms its resolve to cooperate with the United \nNations and other States to tackle the challenges of \nclimate change, terrorism, extreme poverty, the \neconomic crisis, drug trafficking, weaponization and \nxenophobia, which is rearing its head again.  \n For Latin America, the first decade of the twenty-\nfirst century has also meant confronting a choice \nbetween two different models of social and economic \ndevelopment.  \n The first is social democracy exercised through \ninstitutions. This is a democracy that recognizes \nmarket policy and that attracts global investment with \nclear rules, but which also has public policies for \n \n \n35 10-54827 \n \nproductive infrastructure. This is a democracy that \ndoes not just wait for a trickle-down effect to reach the \npoorest, but neither does it resort to the facile approach \nof subsidizing everything or raising wages in the public \nsector. This is a democracy that is open to the world \nand that acknowledges the immense power of \ncybernetics and communications and that, therefore, \nembraces a global market policy and aims to reach \noutward in the world through fairly negotiated free-\ntrade treaties that preserve the rights of workers and \nthe environment. But this is also a democracy of \neducation, teaching people that the path to \ndevelopment is one of effort and of individual and \ncollective merit. \n In the face of that model of social democracy, \nanother path was proposed in America at dawn of the \ntwenty-first century. That was a model of State \nownership, advocated by countries with great natural \nresources, who trust their development to administer \ntheir resources and reject global investment. That \nmodel aims to control the political direction of the \neconomy and rejects global reality. It suggests growing \nthe domestic market, administering international trade \nby State authority, using subsidies and wages in the \npublic sector instead of promoting productive \ninfrastructure and assuring the peoples\u2019 future. \nMoreover, instead of affirming democratic institutions, \nthis alternative path affirms the politic will and \npersonal agenda of leaders, which always culminate in \nan aggressive downward spiral, destroying freedom of \nthe press and expression and taking people down the \npath of weaponization.  \n That second path does not seem to us a \nresponsible one, because it avoids reality and offers no \nsustainable solution to social problems, nor does it \ncreate jobs that people need, because poverty cannot be \ndiminished and true employment created without \nmodern technology and integration into the global \neconomy. Therefore Peru opts for a realistic and global \napproach.  \n After four years, I am proud to share the progress \nand successes that we have achieved in our social \nagenda and in the Millennium Development Goals that \nthe United Nations has put forward. I can say that Peru \nis today a more stable, independent and egalitarian \ncountry than it was years ago; and all this means that \nwe are better able to contribute to the defence of world \nfreedom and democracy and to play a stronger role in \nfostering regional and international peace and stability. \n Peru has been one of the proving grounds for \nrealistic, global development, for modern, democratic \ndevelopment that follows a global markets policy for \nsustained development while pursuing social policies \nthat ensure increasing stability and equity for our \ncitizens. In the past five years we have achieved annual \ngrowth of 6.5 per cent, and even in the year of the great \ncrisis we maintained employment growth and poverty \nreduction. All the forecasts for this year indicate \neconomic growth of 8 per cent, which will enable us to \nreduce further the poverty that still exists in our \ncountry. \n We have given priority to public spending on \ninfrastructure projects in the areas of health, education, \nwater and sanitation, electrification of thousands of \ntowns and roads, in accordance with the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) established by the \nAssembly. \n As a middle-income country, over the past four \nyears Peru has achieved an annual rate of public \ninvestment of 6 per cent of output, double previous \nrates, and has invested $24 billion in more than \n130,000 specific projects aimed at raising the living \nstandards of our poorest populations and improve their \nparticipation in the economy. However, besides public \nefforts, and thanks to the stability of our economy and \nto the rules we follow, the private sector has invested \nand reinvested $72 billion over four years, creating \n2.1 million new jobs. All international projections \nindicate that we will continue to grow at an annual rate \nof 6 per cent for the next six years, since we are \nalready assured of $38 billion in investments to be \nmade, in addition to investments in the agricultural and \nmanufacturing sectors. \n Peru has succeeded in reducing its poverty rate \nfrom 48 to 34 per cent of the population, and we shall \nreach our goal of lowering it to 30 per cent next year. \nWe feel sure that when Peru celebrates the bicentenary \nof its independence, in 2021, the rate will have fallen \nto 10 per cent. \n As I remarked yesterday at the High-level \nPlenary Meeting on the Millennium Development \nGoals (see ), Peru has achieved many of the \nMDGs ahead of schedule and will continue to work to \nmeet all the goals of poverty reduction, improved \nnutrition, literacy, health and education, among others, \nwhich are the true objectives that every good \nGovernment must aim for. Suffice it to say that our \n  \n \n10-54827 36 \n \ninfant mortality rate has already been cut to half of \nwhat it was at the beginning of the MDG period, and \nby a third compared with five years ago. \n All this has been achieved thanks to a stable \neconomic policy and an increase in basic services and \nemployment. Moreover, our currency reserves have \ntripled in the last five years and now stand at \n$42 billion. Peru\u2019s financial system is one of the most \nsound in the world, without debt or credit exposure that \nmight put it at risk. But the most important thing is that \nthe political discourse of politicians that constitutes an \nessential element in driving and guiding our countries \nhas consistently advocated democracy and investment, \nand has been fully in line with a broad path of \nexpanded trade and global investment. I believe that it \nis this alignment that has granted us the results that we \ncan illustrate today. \n As opposed to this, some countries in the \nAmericas which chose the second route \u2014 that of State \nownership, political management of the economy, \ninward-looking growth and State administration of \ntrade or confrontation rather than productive \ncooperation with other countries of the world \u2014 cannot \nshow similar results. Thus, we can now say that Peru \nhas laboured on the progressive path of history in \nmoving towards the purposes of the United Nations. \nMoreover, the crisis has shown us that the free market \ndoes not mean an absent State, and that we who govern \nmust not wait for wealth to expand without knowing \nwhen and how to steer it in order to benefit those who \nneed it most. \n Besides doubling our exports over four years and \ntripling our reserves, we have also signed trade \nagreements with most of the world\u2019s countries \u2014 the \nUnited States, China, the European Union, Canada, \nKorea and many others \u2014 providing us with the \nnecessary base to maintain and drive growth and \nimprove our competitiveness, thus providing jobs for \nthe people. In this way Peru will be greater and will be \nable to better contribute to international cooperation \u2014 \nand cooperation, along with maintaining peace, is the \ngreat purpose of our Organization. \n We are aware, however, that we live in a \nmultipolar and interdependent system, and that none of \nPeru\u2019s achievements will be sustainable in the long \nterm unless we unite our efforts to combat common \nthreats. Peace, security and cooperation are inseparable \nparts of globalization, and we must promote them \nthrough coordinated strategies. \n Twenty-five years ago I spoke from this rostrum \nfor the first time, and I see that, 20 years after the end \nof the cold war, we have still not built the stability that \nis a new multilateralism, based on the power of \ninternational law. We are still in a situation of \nuncertainty, where instability encroaches on peace and \nnew threats arise, testing the agility, creativity and \npolitical determination of this Organization and the \ncountries it comprises. \n Peru believes that in this globalized world, \nsecurity is the result of the interaction of internal and \nexternal factors. We are thus deeply concerned about \nthe proliferation of nuclear arms, which must be halted \nat all costs. There is also, however, the issue of \nconventional weapons, since in practice it is they that \nproduce the death and destruction suffered in many \nparts of the world. Moreover, arms and the arms trade \nlimit social development, foster poverty and inequality \nand feed the threat of instability. Peru has therefore \nproposed to all countries of South America, the \nadoption of a protocol on peace, security and \ncooperation to bring about permanent peace and \nreduced arms expenditures. \n In our view \u2014 and this has been said a thousand \ntimes here \u2014 it is not possible that, since the \nestablishment of the integrated, reliable Union of South \nAmerican Nations, its 10 member countries have \ninvested $25 billion in new weapons and spent another \n$150 billion on maintaining military operating \nexpenditures. This is shameful, because with that sum, \nmore than 50 million people in South America could \nhave ceased to live in poverty. Over the next five years, \nif we do not halt this absurd arms race, we will have \nspent another $35 billion on new weapons and $200 \nbillion on regular military expenditure, thus fueling an \nirrational race which will always find justification to \ncontinue. \n But the absurdity we see in South America is \neven more serious on the global scale. It is not possible \nfor our countries to continue to allocate so much \nmoney to the buying of weapons when there are so \nmany poor people in the world. It is as though the cold \nwar had not ended and was continuing to the benefit of \narms traders. \n We say once again, as we did in the Union of \nSouth American Nations and the Organization of \n \n \n37 10-54827 \n \nAmerican States, and as we say in all international \nforums in which we participate, let us allocate less to \nthe buying of weapons and more to combating poverty. \nLet us raise the flag of the martyr of pacifism Jean \nJaur\u00e8s or our great friend, the Olof Palme of Sweden.  \n Let us demand that multilateral financial \ninstitutions include anti-armament clauses in their \ncontracts and conditions, just as they do environmental \nprovisions. Why should they lend belonging to all the \ncitizens of the world to countries that use them in a \nrace to death? It is a serious matter to produce and \nconsume harmful drugs, but it is also a serious matter \nfor the richest countries of the world to produce \nweapons for poor countries to buy, curbing their \ndevelopment and road towards justice. We appeal to \nthe leaders of the world: stop buying and producing \narms; feed the disadvantaged; develop land; and create \nemployment. \n Real strength, real leadership of nations and \npeoples is found in intelligence and the ability to help \nthe least developed, not in the capacity for arms \nproduction or its nuclear power. We know it is difficult \nto make this appeal over and over again, but we shall \nkeep doing it because one day clarity and acceptance of \nthese ideas will prevail among world opinion and \namong the world\u2019s peoples. \n For all those reasons, we call for this world forum \nto act. It is important for us also to think of regional \nintegration, because we are not a cluster of asteroids. \nBut we believe in a modern, different integration. In \nthis world of computers, satellite communication, trade \nwithout borders and human rights without national \nrestrictions, this new integration does not mean just \njoining those who are already geographically joined, \nbut also using the tools of technology to ensure that the \nfurthest off are also integrated. This is the new space of \nfreedom that science and technology are creating for \nhuman beings and nations. \n We must get beyond the primitive idea that there \nis not enough to go around and realize that when the \nwealth of information is distributed, those who \ndistribute it are no poorer for having done so. Rather, \nthey have lost nothing by sharing with others. \nSimilarly, integration is a form of wealth which sooner \nor later will reach all united peoples. \n Here, I can provide a fine example of the path \nfollowed by Ecuador and Peru after two centuries of \nconfrontation, hatred and war. Thanks to the \ndetermination and political will of the Government of \nEcuador headed by President Rafeal Correa, and its \nagreement with the Peruvian Government, we have \ntaken a quantum leap forward in fraternity, integration \nand development. \n Barely 15 years ago, we were divided by war, but \nnow we have a permanent joint binational Cabinet \nthanks to which we have built bridges and thousands of \nkilometres of roads, improved our agricultural systems \nand integrated our social security systems for workers \nin our two countries. We have binational consulates \nand embassies, representing both our countries in many \nparts of the world. Ours is an example we would like to \nshow to the United Nations as proof of our genuine and \nactive devotion to integration; we believe in integration \nand in fraternity among peoples. \n The need for greater integration was tested when \nthe worst international crisis of the past 80 years broke \nout. This financial crisis, which began in developing \ncountries, has had consequences that we still cannot \npredict. Our understanding of this crisis is the \nfollowing: the beginning of globalization and the \nincrease in world trade were possible only with the \nnew information and communications technologies \nwhich, at the infrastructure level, have developed new \nforms of production and policy. \n Information is now the fundamental fuel driving \nthe economy and political change. It is gradually \ndisplacing fossil fuels as the essential form of energy. \nSo we see the structure of world trade becoming \nincreasingly dematerialized, but information and \ncommunication, by means of e-money and computers, \nare able to work at such speeds that they have \noutstripped the human capacity of our banks, our \nfinancial wizards and existing institutions to manage \nthe new economy. \n This is the dawn of a new, much swifter, \ndigitalized economy in crisis. But if this speed brings \ncrisis and chaos, the same speed of technology will \nalso bring solutions to problems engendered by the \ncrisis. We must trust in human beings and their creative \nabilities. Never in human history have we had so many \nmeans of payment and so much capacity to consume; \nnever have we had so much technological creation and \ntransformation; never have we had such an interactive \ndigital market that allows people, even the poorest, \nfrom their homes to instantly stimulate production in \nother parts of the world. \n  \n \n10-54827 38 \n \n This enables us to look with human optimism to \nthe future of the world and to believe that after a slight \nrise in inflation in 2012, which will come about \nbecause of the expansion of the means of payment to \novercome the crisis, world trade will accelerate and \nhelp us emerge from the present circumstances. \n However, we must be prepared for this greater \nspeed brought about by digitalization and by creativity. \nWe must strengthen our peoples\u2019 and communities\u2019 \nability to integrate, strengthen exchanges among our \ncountries through transportation, communications and \nelectronic interconnection, strengthen education and \neradicate weaponization. \n Our message is one of optimism about the world \nsituation. Despite ourselves, we are building a better \nworld, without borders, without tyranny, with more \nfreedom. We must act, employing policies which are \nsuccessful against the crisis. We must employ \ndemocracy, sound institutions and realism, using \ncapital and international technology and mobilizing \ninvestment in small and micro businesses. \n Of course, our response to the crisis must always \nbe a collective one. The Group of 20 (G-20) is now the \nprime forum of international financial cooperation and \ncoordination, and we must support its role to support \nits role in reforming the system. We need a greater \nregulation given the growing speed with which \nfinancial and economic instruments can be \nmanipulated. Peru commends the efforts that have been \nmade, but proposes that the work of the G-20 gain in \nlegitimacy by establishing fluid lines of \ncommunication with the International Monetary Fund \nand the World Bank, and by involving other countries \nin this work. \n But just as in the financial crisis, all nations must \ncoordinate our efforts to properly confront terrorism, \ndrugs, the illicit arms trade, money laundering, \ntrafficking of persons, xenophobia and climate change.  \n With respect to this last theme, I must note that \nPeru is vulnerable to the environment and is at very \nserious risk due to climate change. But at the same \ntime, my country is strategically placed to mitigate and \nadapt to the effects of global climate change because it \nranks fourth in terms of the quantities of tropical \nforests.  \n We want to change our discourse. We have not \ncome with hand extended to demand cooperation from \nthe rich of the world but to demand that they fulfil their \ncommitments in their own countries. We have come to \nsay that we will do the same in our own countries.  \n In Peru, our forest sequesters 21 billion tons of \ncarbon per year. We have 84 biospheres and are one of \n17 megadiverse countries on the planet.  \n I offer \u2014 if necessary, with hand extended to the \ninsensitive world of the rich countries \u2014 our budgetary \nand humane commitment to protect, unscathed, Peru\u2019s \n54 million hectares of forest, thus controlling climate \nchange at the global level. As a tropical glacier country \nin danger, we appeal to the world to implement specific \ngoals for cooperation and technology transfer and to \nprovide resources to develop programmes to combat \nthe effects of climate change.  \n We want an agreement that is comprehensive, \nbinding, fast and effective, and I reiterate to the \nAssembly my country\u2019s desire to strengthen joint \naction through development of a clean and sustainable \ngrowth economy with low carbon emissions. With that \nintention we will voluntarily reduce to zero the \ndeforestation of the primordial natural forests and will \nalter our present energy matrix so that by 2021 \nrenewable non-conventional energy, hydropower and \nbiofuels will account for at least 40 per cent of the \nenergy consumed in the country. And we will make \nannual reports to the Assembly. \n However, we must not forget that much of the \npollution is still produced by poverty. Hundreds of \nmillions of households in the world continue to use \nwood-burning stoves, thus driving deforestation and at \nthe same time polluting the environment and causing \nserious bronchiopulmonary and nutritional problems \namong children. We propose to reduce the number of \nwood-burning stoves in Peru by 20 per cent by 2021 \nand to replace them with better stoves, and we want \nthat issue to become part of the Millennium Goals. \n A final point is something of particular interest to \nPeru \u2014 the situation of migrants. The globalization of \ncapital, services and products cannot be accepted \nwithout also accepting the free movement of people or \nfacilitating their mobility. Peru actively promotes the \ndefense of the human rights of migrants and their \nfamilies, because it is a country built by European \nmigrants, as is the United States and many other rich \ncountries today \u2014 which they forget when they expel \ntoday\u2019s migrants and deport them by plane.  \n \n \n39 10-54827 \n \n Peru believes that migration is a development \ntool that has enriched and continues to enrich universal \nculture and the social life of countries. That is why we \ncondemn any type of regulation, whether in Arizona or \nelsewhere, or any kind of xenophobic or discriminatory \nexpressions. It is a paradox that the countries governed \nby the children of migrants are today those that most \nvigorously deport migrants, unwittingly creating a new \nform of domestic violence that could have very serious \nconsequences in the short term. \n We reiterate that the best way to avoid \nunregulated migration is by means of unhampered free \ntrade and investment from the most developed \ncountries that helps to generate employment and \nimprove the quality of life of people in the developing \ncountries.  \n Peru has an ongoing commitment with the United \nNations, a commitment with humankind without races, \ncolours or distinctions. We would like, as we proposed \na few years ago, to strengthen the entire system in \norder to consolidate ourselves as a modern, strong and \nfree organization, free of the contradictions or delays \nof the past, one that can ensure peace with less \nbureaucracy and with greater resolve and stronger \npolitical fortitude.  \n Let there be peace and well-being for all peoples \nof the Earth; let there be bread with freedom for all \nhuman beings.

        "file_text": "It gives \nme pleasure to congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \nelection to the presidency at this session and to wish \nhim every success in fulfilling his important tasks. We \nwould also like to convey through you, Sir, our thanks \nto His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his \nvaluable efforts during his presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. \n We would like also to express our thanks and \nappreciation to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon for his tireless efforts in strengthening the \nrole and work of the United Nations and its bodies in \nvarious fields. In particular, we greatly appreciate his \nefforts, and those of the United Nations entities, \nespecially the United Nations Relief and Works \nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, which \ncontinues to work to provide essential services to \nPalestinian refugees, who have been waiting for more \nthan 60 years for redress of their plight and the \nrealization of their right to return to their homes and \nproperties. \n I am well aware that the agenda of the General \nAssembly is filled with matters and issues of pressing \nconcern to the entire human race and to our planet, \nparticularly those relating to armed conflict, wars and \nthe struggle of people under foreign occupation to \nrealize their right to self-determination, as well as \nclimate change, global warming, natural disasters and \nthe global economic and financial crises. \n All of this is happening at a time when we are \nwitnessing rightful demands for the revitalization of \nthe United Nations, particularly reform of the Security \nCouncil aimed at making it more representative and \ntruly reflective of the current international situation. \nThis is especially important in the light of the \n  \n \n10-55103 30 \n \nemergence of new Powers, which should be \nrepresented in the Security Council in order to enhance \nits role and effectiveness in maintaining international \npeace and security. \n There is also significant discontent over some \nStates\u2019 non-compliance with Security Council and \nGeneral Assembly resolutions. This demands that the \ninternational community take vigorous, effective \nmeasures to compel those countries to respect and \nimplement these resolutions; to end colonization, \noccupation and exploitation in our world so as to \npromote the values of freedom, justice, tolerance and \ncoexistence; and to combat extremism and terrorism. \nIndeed, the United Nations has a fundamental role to \nplay in promoting cooperative relations among peoples \nand guiding them towards investment in the \ndevelopment of societies and infrastructure, as well as \nin fighting poverty, unemployment, desertification, \ndisease and epidemics and the lethal human and \nenvironmental risks they pose for humanity and the \nfuture of our planet. \n Our people, our homeland, Palestine, and our \nregion, the Middle East, are facing extremely serious \nproblems that continue to push them towards violence \nand conflict, wasting chance after chance to seriously \naddress the issues faced by the peoples of the region \nand to arrive at comprehensive and bold solutions. This \nis the result of the expansionist and hegemonic \nmentality that still prevails in the ideology and policies \nof Israel, the occupying Power, whose standard policy \nis non-compliance with internationally legitimate \nresolutions, including those of the General Assembly \nand the Security Council. Such disrespect has rendered \nthose resolutions ineffective, undermined the \ncredibility of the United Nations and bolstered the \nprevailing view that double standards are in effect, \nparticularly regarding the Palestinian question, and that \nIsrael is a State above the law, flouting all these \nresolutions and engaging in oppression, arrests, \ndetentions, killings, destruction, demolition of homes, \nblockades, settlement expansion and the establishment \nof the annexation apartheid wall, violating and \nundermining the existence and the rights of our people \nin their own homeland. \n The ancient city of East Jerusalem, capital of the \nindependent State of Palestine and designated by \nUNESCO as a world heritage site requiring protection, \nis being subjected by Israel, the occupying Power, to \nactions that alter and distort realities on the ground. \nSuch actions destroy landmarks, cemeteries and the \nreligious, spiritual and historical identity of the holy \ncity in every aspect and as quickly as possible, aiming \nto erase its historical character and pre-empt final \nstatus negotiations. This is in addition to the \ncontinuous excavations under the Al-Aqsa mosque, the \ndemolition of homes, the deportations and revocation \nof the residency rights of its population and the \nimposition of a siege on the city in an attempt to isolate \nit from its natural Palestinian Arab surroundings and to \ncontrol it geographically and demographically. \n This situation is a provocation to our people. It \nantagonizes them and gives rise to anger, especially in \nthe Arab and Islamic world. It creates instability in our \nregion and constitutes a serious obstacle to the \nachievement of peace and security. All of these illegal \nIsraeli measures and practices must cease. \n This is also the case with regard to the situation \nin the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to an \nunjust, illegal and unprecedented land, air and sea \nblockade in violation of international law and United \nNations resolutions. It is also the target of harsh Israeli \nmilitary aggression that has severely damaged its \ninfrastructure. This illegal blockade and aggression \nhave resulted in the destruction of the infrastructure \nand productive capacity of Gaza and destroyed 25 per \ncent of its homes and nearly 75 per cent of its jobs, \nleading to widespread unemployment and dependence \non international aid. The Israeli blockade is preventing \nour people in Gaza from rebuilding their homes, even \nthough the international donor community has pledged \nsome $5 billion to finance reconstruction. The \nblockade against the Gaza Strip must be lifted \nimmediately and completely, and the tragic suffering \nbeing inflicted on our people there must be ended as \nsoon as possible. \n We welcome the efforts of the international \nindependent fact-finding mission established by the \nHuman Rights Council concerning the Israeli attack on \nthe Freedom Flotilla, which was carrying humanitarian \nassistance for our people in the Gaza Strip. We \nwelcome the conclusions reached by the mission, and \nwe also look forward to the submission by the Panel of \nInquiry established by the Secretary-General of its \nfindings to the Security Council. \n To all of this I must add the fact that thousands of \nPalestinian prisoners and detainees remain in Israeli \njails and detention centres. They are all fighting for \n \n \n31 10-55103 \n \nfreedom. They must be released and an end must be put \nto their suffering. This is essential for creating a \npositive environment for the attainment of peace. We \ncannot reach a peace agreement that does not liberate \nall of them from their chains and their imprisonment. \n In spite of all of this and despite the historic \ninjustice that has been inflicted upon our people, their \ndesire to achieve a just peace that guarantees the \nrealization of their national rights in freedom and \nindependence has not and will not diminish. Our \nwounded hands are still able to carry the olive branch \npicked from the splinters of the trees that the \noccupation forces uproot every day. Our people aspire \nto live in security, peace and stability on their \nPalestinian national soil, to build the lives and future of \nour generations. \n We are willing and ready to reach a \ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace, based on rights \nand justice and on the resolutions of international \nlegitimacy. Such a settlement must lead to the \nwithdrawal of Israel, the occupying Power, from all the \nArab and Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, \nincluding East Jerusalem, so that the State of Palestine, \nwith East Jerusalem as their capital, can enjoy \nindependence and sovereignty and so that peace can \nprevail throughout the Middle East. \n Because of our genuine desire to attain a \ncomprehensive peace in the region, we have decided to \nenter into final status negotiations. We will exert every \neffort to reach an agreement for Palestinian-Israeli \npeace within one year, in accordance with the \nresolutions of international legitimacy, the Arab Peace \nInitiative, the road map and the vision of the two-State \nsolution. On behalf of the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization, we have reaffirmed our commitment to \nthe option of just peace and our determination, \nseriousness and sincere intention to make these \nnegotiations succeed, in spite of all the difficulties and \nobstacles before us. \n The international community should draw lessons \nfrom the reasons for the faltering of the political \nprocess and the inability to achieve its goals in the \npast. Restoring the credibility of the peace process \nmainly requires compelling the Government of Israel \nto comply with its obligations and commitments. In \nparticular, the Government of Israel must cease all \nsettlement activities in the occupied Palestinian \nterritory, especially in and around East Jerusalem; \ndismantle the apartheid annexation wall; and put an \nend to the policy of blockade and closures that restrict \nthe lives and movement of our people and deprive them \nof their basic human rights. \n Our demands for the freezing of settlement \nactivities, the lifting of the blockade and an end to all \nother illegal Israeli practices do not constitute \npreconditions that are alien to the political process. \nRather, they are consistent with the implementation of \nprevious obligations and commitments which have \nbeen repeatedly reaffirmed in all the resolutions \nadopted since the start of the political process. \n Israel\u2019s implementation of these obligations and \ncommitments will lead to the creation of the necessary \nenvironment for the success of the negotiations and \nwill give credibility to its pledge to implement the final \nagreement. Israel must choose between peace and the \ncontinuation of settlements. \n From this rostrum, I reaffirm that we will \ncontinue, as we have always done, to make every \npossible effort so that these negotiations will achieve \nthe desired objective of realizing peace by addressing \nall final status issues, namely Jerusalem, refugees, \nsettlements, borders, water, security and the release of \nall prisoners and detainees. This must be done in a \nmanner that will achieve freedom, independence and \njustice for the Palestinian people in their homeland, \nrectify the historical injustice inflicted upon them, \nachieve security and safety for all their neighbours, \nlead to a just peace throughout the Middle East, \nincluding on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, and thus \nusher in a new era of stability, progress, prosperity, \ncoexistence and good-neighbourliness. \n The political process will be put back on the right \ntrack only if the international community assumes the \nmain responsibility for ending the Israeli occupation, \nthe longest occupation in modern history; ensures our \npeople\u2019s right to self-determination in their \nindependent sovereign State based on the borders of \n4 June 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital; and \nfinds a just and agreed solution to the plight of the \nPalestinian refugees. This must all be carried out \nthrough the implementation of the principles of the \nCharter, the relevant Security Council and General \nAssembly resolutions, the advisory opinion of the \nInternational Court of Justice, and the provisions of \ninternational law, including international humanitarian \nand human rights law, on the ground in the occupied \n  \n \n10-55103 32 \n \nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem. All of \nthese measures constitute the legitimate political terms \nof reference for any successful negotiation leading to a \nfinal peace settlement. \n Our people, despite the profound and continued \nsuffering they have endured, hold steadfast to their \nrights, their land and their national soil. At the same \ntime, they are determined to restore national unity and \nthe bonds between the two parts of our homeland. We \nare making every effort to restore unity through \ndialogue and the good, honourable efforts of our \nbrothers and friends, especially the Arab Republic of \nEgypt. On our part, we will spare no effort to end the \ndivision resulting from the coup against Palestinian \nlegitimacy and to establish democracy as an essential \nfoundation of our body politic. \n We will also assume our responsibility for \nbuilding national institutions for our independent State \nand national economy, and for ensuring the security \nand safety of our citizens under a national authority \nbased on the rule of law, accountability, transparency \nand justice. We will also continue to fulfil our \nobligations under the road map and the agreements \nreached between the two sides. \n In conclusion, it is imperative in this context to \nexpress our appreciation to all those who have \ncontributed to sponsoring and supporting the peace \nprocess. Here, I would like to express my special \nthanks to His Excellency Mr. Barack Obama, President \nof the United States of America, who affirmed in his \nstatement before the Assembly (see ) two \ndays ago the two-State solution and the need to freeze \nsettlement activities and establish the independent \nState of Palestine with full membership in the United \nNations next year. On this occasion, we reaffirm our \nreadiness to cooperate fully with his country\u2019s efforts \nfor a successful political process to achieve a \ncomprehensive and just peace in the region. \n We must also pay tribute to the United Nations \nfor preserving our cause and extending a helping hand \nto our people through its resolutions and decisions, \nwhich constitute an unshakeable foundation for peace. \nFrom this rostrum, we call on the United Nations to \ncontinue its pivotal role until justice is upheld, our \npeople have regained their usurped rights and peace \nprevails in our entire region. We reiterate our \nappreciation for the Organization\u2019s tireless efforts to \nstand in solidarity with the just cause of Palestine, and \nwe reaffirm our faith in the peace to which we and all \nthe peoples in the region aspire. We ask God to bless us \nwith a future in which we will all enjoy peace, security \nand stability."

        "file_text": "I have been given such \na bad spot on the speaking list that I feel as if I am in a \nFellini movie, speaking to an empty Hall. Still, because \nI believe in ghosts, I believe that the friendly ghosts of \nthose who are not present are here to listen, and I \nprofusely thank those who bothered to come on this \nSaturday afternoon. \n Mr. President, in compensation for my having the \nworst possible time slot in the general debate, when I \nsee you this afternoon I hope you will have a nice box \nof Swiss chocolates to give to me. \n We will not distribute the written version of my \nspeech because no one reads them anyway and it is a \nwaste of paper and money. However, anyone who is \ncurious enough about my speech will be able to find it \non the General Assembly\u2019s website. It is a lengthy \nspeech \u2014 although I will not compete with Presidents \nObama, Ahmadinejad or Ch\u00e1vez \u2014 so I will skip \nthrough much of it, out of respect for the \nrepresentatives who have been here for a week \nlistening to many speeches. \n Still, I would fail my upbringing if I were not to \nthank the Mayor of New York and New Yorkers for \nwelcoming us to their city. We sympathize with the \nresidents of this city for the inconveniences we cause \nthem by our presence, even if most people would agree \nthat the United Nations and the numerous meetings \nheld here throughout the year bring enormous tangible \nand non-quantifiable benefits to the city. I also would \nlike thank the United States federal authorities for their \nexceptional efforts and professionalism in providing us \nwith a secure and friendly environment. \n I have never met Mayor Bloomberg, but he has \ngone up in our esteem and respect because of his \nintellectual clarity and moral courage in standing up \nfor the rights of American Muslims in building a \ncultural centre and a sacred place of worship in lower \nManhattan as a venue for reflection, learning and \nfraternity among cultures and religions. What better \nplace is there than lower Manhattan, near the World \nTrade Center, to signal the revulsion of American \nMuslims and moderate Muslims all over the world at \nthe actions of some extremists? I congratulate Mayor \nBloomberg for his moral courage and integrity. \n I was not present in this Hall when President \nAhmadinejad of the Islamic Republic of Iran addressed \n  \n \n10-55109 2 \n \nthis Assembly a few days ago. I was at Columbia \nUniversity, addressing an equally important gathering \nof young students and academics from many countries, \ncultures and religions. So I did not hear President \nAhmadinejad\u2019s latest intellectual concoctions in this \nAssembly. I will not question the right of anyone to \nspeak his mind. President Ahmadinejad is entitled to \nbelieve in and regurgitate whatever intellectual, \nphilosophical or theological concoctions his unique \nmind may fabricate. However, I do not agree that any \nof us should disregard the basic rules and practices of \nconduct among leaders by uttering obscenities in this \nAssembly. What President Ahmadinejad said in this \nforum in regard to the terrorist attacks on the World \nTrade Center was an obscenity. He went too far, as he \nhas done many times before in this Assembly and in \nother forums, as when he has questioned the facts of \nthe Holocaust. \n Otherwise, we fully subscribe to Iran\u2019s legitimate \nright to develop nuclear technology for peaceful \npurposes, and we caution the Powers that be not to \nhasten in reaching conclusions that may lead to \nirreversible, catastrophic decisions. We do have serious \ndoubts, however, about the reliability and safety of \nnuclear energy. Let us not forget the lessons of the \nThree Mile Island accident, which occurred at 4 a.m. \non 28 March 1979 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or the \neven worse Chernobyl nuclear meltdown of April 1986. \nThe recent catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico \nwould pale by comparison with the blow-up of a \nnuclear energy facility. We do not know whether \nIranian rulers do or do not have the desire to be an \narmed nuclear Power. What we do know, however, is \nthat the possession of nuclear weapons is not a shortcut \nto super-Power status, as some in Asia seem to think, \nand does not insure anyone against twenty-first century \nconventional and non\u2013conventional security threats. \n Nuclear weapons were developed as a result of \nthe tragic experiences of the Second World War and of \nmutual suspicion and fears pervasive among the \nPowers at that time. They have become obsolete. That \nis proven by the fact that the mighty Soviet nuclear and \nconventional arsenals were not able to prevent the \nimplosion of its Empire, the liberation of hundreds of \nmillions of people or the reunification of Germany. \nNuclear weapons are not going to be of much help in \nthe ongoing ethnic, religious and border disputes in \nAsia. We pray to God the Almighty and the Merciful \nthat these weapons and others, chemical and biological, \ndo not ever fall into the hands of extremist non-State \nentities. \n We gathered here from 20 to 22 September to \nreview the progress \u2014 or lack of it \u2014 on the pledges \nwe solemnly made before our peoples in 2000 to \neliminate or at least halve poverty by 2015. In Timor-\nLeste, we regained independence in 2002, and in the \nfirst years of our independence we set out to rebuild \nour country from the ashes of the violence of the past, \nlay the foundations of a functioning democratic State, \nheal our wounds, reconcile our divided communities \nand normalize relations with past external adversaries. \nIn only eight years and in spite of the overwhelming \nchallenges facing us, we have navigated out of the \nstorms to a new period of peace, stability and \neconomic growth. \n Timor-Leste is a least developed country, affected \nby pervasive poverty. We are still a fragile country, \npartly because we are only eight years old, and being \nan infant country, all the institutions of the State are \nyoung and fragile. However, the Almighty and the \nMerciful has blessed us with generous natural \nresources, such as oil and gas, enabling us to accelerate \nour overall development. \n Timor-Leste was not yet independent in 2000, \nand it was not until our first Millennium Development \nGoal report was issued in 2004 that the first targets \nwere set. For the past three years, Timor-Leste has \nenjoyed real peace and a robust economic growth of \nover 12 per cent. In the past two years, poverty levels \nhave decreased by as much as 9 per cent. Infant \nmortality and under-five mortality rates have been \nreduced and have already reached the 2015 target. \nSchool enrolment has increased from 65 per cent in \n2007 to 83 per cent in 2009-2010. Adult illiteracy is \nbeing gradually eliminated thanks to a joint programme \nbetween Timor-Leste and Cuba. We anticipate that, \nwithin two to three years, Timor-Leste will be \ncompletely free of illiteracy. About 30 per cent of our \ngeneral State budget is allocated to public health and \neducation. This turn-around is due largely thanks to \naggressive public financing of social such programmes \nas direct cash transfers to the elderly, widows, the \nhandicapped and veterans, and to determined efforts to \nexpand cultivated areas and increase food production. \n The first of the 800 Timorese medical students \nstudying in Cuba have returned home. In addition to \nthose studying medicine in Cuba, there are 200 more \n \n \n3 10-55109 \n \nenrolled in the medical school of our national \nuniversity. In addition, more than 200 Cuban doctors \nhave been assigned to Timor-Leste since 2004, \nworking side by side with Timorese doctors and nurses \ndelivering services to the remotest corners of the \ncountry and training our medical and health personnel. \nThe members of the famous Cuban Medical Brigade \nare true missionaries, as deserving of the Nobel Peace \nPrize as Mother Teresa. \n In Timor-Leste, this year we will finalize our own \nroad map, the 2011-2030 Strategic Development Plan, \nwhich will lift our people from centuries of poverty to \nthe level of an upper-middle-income country by 2030. \n With regard to the management of our petroleum \nresources, we are pleased to note that the Extractive \nIndustries Transparency Initiative in its most recent \nreport of 1 July, rated Timor-Leste number one in Asia \nand number three in the world for sound, transparent \nand effective management of our oil and gas revenues. \n Women make up almost 30 per cent of the \ndeputies in our national Parliament. Key cabinet \npositions in the executive branch \u2014 finance, justice, \nsocial solidarity, prosecutor-general and so on \u2014 are \nheld by women. A youth parliament, comprising \n130 youth parliamentarians ranging in ages from 12 to \n17 years, has been elected and will have its first formal \nsitting in November. I am pleased that our expectations \non balanced gender representation were in fact \nexceeded. The youth parliament counts 68 girl and \n62 boy deputies. \n Timor-Leste is proud to have one of the most \nhumanist Constitutions in the world. It prohibits the \ndeath penalty and its maximum prison sentence is \n25 years. We have also ratified all core international \nhuman rights treaties. Our Constitution gives primacy \nto international law over domestic law, such that all our \nlaws must conform to international law. \n As the Head of State guided by humanist beliefs \nand the relevant provisions of our Constitution, I have \nissued pardons to individuals who have been tried and \nfound guilty by the courts and have served a number of \nyears with good behaviour. We believe that the pursuit \nof justice cannot be dissociated from other \noverwhelming values, such as compassion and \nunderstanding of mitigating circumstances. \n I wish now to turn to some international issues. \nWe appeal to President Barack Obama to sign an \nexecutive order releasing five Cuban citizens who have \nlanguished in United States jails for over 10 years and \ndenied family visits. Even visits by the International \nCommittee of the Red Cross have not been authorized. \nThe United States should likewise lift the draconian \nfinancial and economic sanctions and trade embargo \nagainst Cuba. The Cuban people are among the few in \nthe world who are still suffering the inequities of the \ncold-war era. It would seem that, for some in the \nUnited States and in particular in the State of Florida, \nthe cold war is not over. \n The situation in Myanmar is an immensely \ncomplex one. It is a vast country fragmented along \nethnic lines and plagued by numerous armed groups \nfighting with different agendas. Based on our own \nexperience, we believe that in order to manage such \ncomplex challenges, be it in our own country, \nMyanmar or anywhere else, we must all show wisdom \nand engage in patient dialogue with those who do not \nagree with us so that together we can end conflict and \npull our countries out of poverty. \n With respect to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we \ncommend the Israeli and Palestinian leaders for their \nrenewed dialogue under the auspices of the United \nStates Administration. To those in Palestine who, in \nspite of decades of suffering and humiliation, have \nresisted the temptation of extremism and violence, I \nbow. To those in Israel who have championed the cause \nof peace and the rights of the Palestinian people, I will \nsay that they represent the very best of the Jewish \npeople \u2014 a people who more than anyone else on \nEarth should understand the suffering and desire of \nothers for freedom. \n We urge Hamas to show statesmanship by \nrecognizing the State of Israel. Extremism, fanaticism \nand indiscriminate violence do harm to the noble \nPalestinian quest for dignity and freedom. At the same \ntime, we submit that Hamas and Hezbollah are genuine \npopular movements deeply rooted in the plight of \nmillions of poor, dispossessed, alienated and angry in \nthe Middle East. Labelling them terrorists and refusing \nto engage and build bridges with such groups is, in our \nview, not a sound policy. \n We urge Israel, a country founded on 5,000 years \nof history and born of centuries of persecution and war, \nto show the wisdom and generosity of the Jews by \nending the Gaza blockade, allowing unhindered access \n  \n \n10-55109 4 \n \nfor humanitarian assistance, and ending the land-\ngrabbing and colonization of the West Bank. \n On the question of Western Sahara, the aborted \ndecolonization of that territory and the endless plight \nof hundreds of thousands of Saharans in camps in \nAlgeria constitute an indictment of the international \ncommunity. This is not an issue as complex as \nAfghanistan or Palestine. How can we believe that \nthere will be an early resolution of these other \nseemingly intractable problems when there seems to be \nlittle political will to solve the Western Sahara \nproblem? \n I believe that I have already exceeded the time \nallocated to me by one minute and 35 seconds. I have a \nfew more words to say about foreign aid and climate \nchange, but I will skip that in order to respect \neverybody else, particularly those following me. Allow \nme only to say two words about United Nations \nreform. \n More than 60 years after its founding, the United \nNations has yet to undertake meaningful reform to \nmake it more representative of the world of the twenty-\nfirst century and to become more effective. And we are \nnot talking only about an expanded and more \nrepresentative Security Council. We are talking about \nmaking the United Nations and its many agencies and \nprogrammes less bureaucratic and more efficient in \ntheir internal management and service delivery. \n In regard to the Security Council, we restate our \nview that it has to be expanded to accommodate the \nnew demographic and economic realities of the twenty-\nfirst century. Major regional Powers like India and \nBrazil must be granted permanent member status in the \nSecurity Council. \n In concluding, on behalf of our people I thank the \ninternational community for the steady and generous \nassistance provided to us in our years of need. We \nwould not have been able to achieve the progress of the \npast years without the understanding of our friends and \npartners. \n We can all do better in Timor-Leste and \nelsewhere, and we must. With humility we \nacknowledge our failings and limitations. We are \ndetermined to live up to the expectations of our people \nand to lead them towards a peaceful and prosperous \nfuture."

        "file_text": "It is an \nhonour for me to speak to the General Assembly today. \n The world has changed dramatically since the \nUnited Nations was founded 65 years ago. \nInternational trade and exchange are, of course, \nnothing new. What is new, however, is how quickly the \nchanges affect everybody\u2019s lives. Only if we in the \nUnited Nations are and remain able to act can we shape \nthese global changes. We will manage to solve \nproblems relating to security and economic, social and \necological development only if the international \ncommunity stands united. Germany is ready to assume \nglobal responsibility within the framework of the \nUnited Nations. \n Germany\u2019s foreign policy is firmly embedded in \nthe international community. In Europe, a system of \ncooperation has replaced the confrontation that cruelly \ndivided our continent for centuries. The European \nUnion is successful because, in Europe, all peoples and \nStates meet on an equal footing. The United Nations, \ntoo, brings together nations large and small, rich and \npoor, those that are more powerful and those with less \ninfluence. Cooperation between equals on an equal \nfooting is our guiding principle also for work here at \nthe United Nations. Each and every country must \nrespect all others. \n German foreign policy is a policy of peace. This \nautumn, Germany will stand for election as a \nnon-permanent member of the Security Council \nbecause the Council is the ideal forum in which to \ncooperate in the cause of peace and development. \nPeace is more than the absence of war. In today\u2019s \nglobalized world, people are just as vulnerable to the \nconsequences of climate change, poverty and \nunderdevelopment as they are to violence and \noppression. \n Climate change has a direct impact on each and \nevery one of us. Countless people are already \npersonally feeling its economic and social \nconsequences. In their letter to the Security Council, \nthe Pacific island States rightly warned us in no \nuncertain terms just how much climate change \nthreatens everyone\u2019s security. Everyone must play their \n \n \n35 10-55103 \n \npart to protect the climate. In Germany, we have just \nadopted a forward-looking energy strategy. By the year \n2050, 80 per cent of our electricity production will \ncome from renewable sources. Germany has also \npledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 per \ncent by the year 2020, compared to the 1990 baseline. \nEven now, we have reduced our carbon dioxide \nemissions by almost 30 per cent. We are pioneers in the \nfield of climate protection. We are helping those who \nare now most adversely affected by climate change. We \nare particularly concerned about the fate of small \nisland States. \n Anyone who is serious about combating climate \nchange has to build on innovation, new technologies \nand exchange. Developed and developing nations alike \ncan profit from cooperation on future energies. \nGermany will contribute its technological expertise, for \nexample, in the fields of renewable energy and energy \nefficiency. In this way, we are turning the challenge of \nclimate change into an opportunity for fair \ndevelopment and enhanced cooperation. Climate policy \nis a cornerstone of any sustainable development policy. \nThe recent summit on the Millennium Development \nGoals laid down the next steps forward in our global \npartnership for development. \n Education is the key to development. \nDevelopment needs education. Education protects \npeople from discrimination and oppression. Education \nfights prejudice and thereby fosters peace. Education \nalso creates products and markets; education is the path \nto prosperity. The true wealth of many nations is no \nlonger found in their raw materials but in the minds of \ntheir people. Education is a human right. It is because \neducation will determine whether societies succeed or \nfail in tomorrow\u2019s world that Germany is one of the \nmajor international partners for learning. By building \non education, we are building bridges to the future for \nthe young people of today. \n The United Nations itself must also keep up with \nthe pace of change. Today\u2019s world order is not properly \nreflected if Africa and Latin America are not \npermanently represented on the Security Council. Asia, \ntoo, rightly considers itself to be underrepresented. The \nentire continent, not just individual States, is \ndeveloping at breathtaking speed. We take our \npartnerships seriously, both the old and the new. \nGermany, too, remains ready to assume greater \nresponsibility. \n Disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are \nnot issues of the past but challenges of our time. \nDisarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are two \nsides of the same coin. We have to do all we possibly \ncan to ensure that weapons of mass destruction do not \nbecome the bane of globalization. Unlike the Review \nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons five years ago, \nthis May\u2019s Review Conference was a success. If we \nwork together to maintain this momentum, it will be in \nour power to ensure that this decade does not see a \nbuild-up of arms but becomes a decade of \ndisarmament. A world without nuclear weapons is a \nlong-term vision, but even a marathon begins with the \nfirst step. \n There is now movement in the disarmament \ndebate. The group of States founded here in New York \non Wednesday to advance disarmament and arms \ncontrol does not stand alone. For over 10 years, the \nConference on Disarmament in Geneva was not even \nable to agree on an agenda. That is not the way to live \nup to our shared responsibility. We met yesterday at the \ninvitation of the Secretary-General to break the \ndeadlock binding the Geneva Conference. Our world \nwill be a more secure place when the Comprehensive \nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty enters into force and the \nproduction of fissile material is ended once and for all. \n German peace policy stands for the peaceful \nsettlement of regional conflicts. Germany is doing its \nutmost to ensure that the direct talks between Israel \nand the Palestinians are a success. We will continue to \nstrengthen the forces of reason and reconciliation. \nDuring this vital period for the peace process in \nparticular, I urge both sides to refrain from taking any \naction that might block the path to peace. We condemn \nany form of violence that has the sole aim of \ntorpedoing the peace talks. At the same time, we call \nfor the moratorium on settlement construction to be \nextended. Lasting peace will be achieved only through \na two-State solution, with Israel and a Palestinian State \nliving peacefully side by side within secure borders. \n Iran, like every other country, naturally has the \nright to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. \nHowever, the Tehran leadership itself has sown doubt \nabout the civilian nature of its nuclear programme. \nIran, by demonstrating openness and transparency, can \nallay that doubt. Our offer of dialogue still stands. It is \nnow up to Iran to grasp our outstretched hand. \n  \n \n10-55103 36 \n \n The conference aimed at establishing a zone free \nof weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, \nplanned for 2012, will be a major opportunity to \nstrengthen peace and security in the region. Germany is \nencouraging all countries in the region to take part to \nensure that the conference is a success. We are \ncommitted to a nuclear-weapon-free Middle East. \n Germany is one of the major supporters of a \npeaceful and secure Afghanistan. As we agreed in \nLondon and Kabul, we want to transfer security \nresponsibility for the whole of Afghanistan to the \nAfghan Government by 2014. To make progress in that \ncountry, so long ravaged by war and civil strife, \neffective measures must be taken to prevent the \nviolence. However, military means alone will not bring \nsuccess. We favour a comprehensive approach and \nabove all a political solution. All sides now need the \ncourage and the stamina to engage in reconciliation. \n The German Government assists when people \nanywhere in the world are struck by natural disasters \nand emergencies. However, a country\u2019s conscience is \nto be found in the hearts of its citizens. I am proud that \nmy fellow Germans donate so generously at times of \ngreatest need. Humanity and solidarity are global \nvalues; humanity and solidarity make no distinction \nbased on skin colour or religious beliefs. When the \ntsunami devastated coastlines around the Indian Ocean, \nwhen the Haiti earthquake destroyed the work of \ndecades, or just recently, when the horrific floods in \nPakistan left havoc in their wake, we Germans shared \nthe victims\u2019 pain and helped in the most heartfelt way \npossible. We will stand by Pakistan over the coming \nmonths and years to ensure that the country has a \npromising economic future. \n We are working towards a peaceful order in the \nSudan, now and after the referendum early next year. \nWe are looking for ways of achieving stable conditions \nin Yemen and are particularly active in the Friends of \nYemen group. We are working hard to combat piracy \noff the Horn of Africa and to bring peace and stability \nto Somalia. \n Reconstruction efforts in devastated regions \ncannot bring success overnight. Similarly, for societies \ntorn by war and civil strife, the route to life in dignity \nleads through peace and reconciliation. There can be \ntrue peace only when human rights are respected. For \nus, such principles as the rule of law, freedom of \nopinion, freedom of the press and respect for \ninalienable human rights are essential. The protection \nof human rights remains a task for all societies. \n It is a fundamental tenet of the United Nations \nthat women determine their own lives and help decide \nthe fate of their countries. Ethnic or religious \nminorities enrich their societies. Tolerance is one of \nGermany\u2019s guiding principles. Everyone wins in the \ncompetition for the best ideas; in a clash of cultures, \nthere can only be losers. \n United Europe can make a valuable contribution \non our continent and beyond. Germany is working to \nensure that, in the future, the European Union shall \ncooperate even more closely with other regions in \nLatin America, Africa and Asia, and live up to its \nglobal responsibility. Germany is the third-largest \ndevelopment cooperation donor. We have practically \nrecovered from the financial and economic crisis and \nare on the right track due to our robust economic \ngrowth. This strong economy makes Germany a strong \nglobal partner. \n If all countries, small and large, work together, \nwe will be able to master the pressing challenges of our \nworld. \nThey can count on Germany. They can rely on \nGermany. "

        "file_text": "\nWith reverence and an immense sense of responsibility, \nI come to this historic forum for the first time to \nreiterate the commitment of my country and more than \n45 million Colombians to the fulfilment and success of \nthe founding principles of the United Nations. As this \nOrganization proceeds in its reform process, we \nsupport its adoption of the criteria of good governance, \nefficiency and transparency in order to realize those \nprinciples and to achieve a more effective international \nsystem of cooperation. \n We believe that the United Nations should focus \non achieving concrete results that transform realities \nrather than deepen conditions of dependency or \nperpetuate assistance programmes that often do more \nharm than good in developing countries. It is in this \nbelief and with faith in the future of the Organization \nthat I express today before this Assembly my country\u2019s \naspiration to become a member of the Security Council \nfor the period 2011-2012. We seek that position on the \nbasis of respect for the principles of the United Nations \nCharter and with the commitment to providing our \nfullest cooperation to the maintenance of international \npeace and security. \n Colombia \u2014 which, along with other Latin \nAmerican nations, commemorates its two-hundredth \nyear of independence this year \u2014 has a long and \nsuccessful democratic and institutional tradition. Our \nRepublic has suffered the attacks of terrorism and the \nravages of international crime, but we have always \nfaced them within the framework of our Constitution \nand laws, following the most rigorous democratic \nprocedures. We are confident that our long and painful \nexperience can be very useful to all States Members of \nthe Organization in matters in which we have \ndeveloped a strong technical and operational capacity, \nsuch as security, the struggle against terrorism and \ndrug trafficking, the fight against the illicit trade in \nsmall arms and light weapons, the progressive \neradication of anti-personnel mines, humanitarian \nassistance, the disarmament, demobilization and \nreintegration of illegal armed groups, and \u2014 of \nparticular importance \u2014 how to do so while always \nprotecting human rights. \n As advocates of peaceful coexistence, we \nColombians are proud to participate in peacekeeping \nand peacebuilding operations, such as the United \nNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, the \nMultinational Force and Observers in Sinai, and the \nUnited Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in \nSierra Leone. This participation reflects our \ncommitment to peace anywhere in the world, which we \nreaffirm today. \n That is why we want to be the voice of Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean in the Security Council at \nthis very special moment for our region. Latin America \nand the Caribbean, a region of some 600 million \ninhabitants, is our area of natural interaction. The \nregion includes countries with multiple political \nvisions and diverse positions on many specific topics. \nBut we are united in the interest of overcoming \npoverty, improving the living standards of our people, \nintegrating ourselves successfully into the global \nmarket, and protecting our environment. \n Latin American nations are beginning to assume a \nglobal leadership role on economic, environmental, \nsecurity and development issues. In my inaugural \nspeech on 7 August, I said that, given the significant \nprogress achieved by my country, the time for \nColombia had come. Today, in this global forum, I \nwish to go further and state with absolute conviction \nthat the time has come for Latin America. \n We Latin Americans have assumed the \nmanagement of our economies with responsibility. As a \nresult, we were one of the regions least affected by the \nglobal economic crisis. Today, our countries are \ngrowing on the basis of economic, social and \ntechnological pillars that are stronger than ever and \nattracting investors from throughout the world. We are \na subcontinent where the majority of the population is \nyoung, with immense talents and ability to work, with \ncities and natural wonders that attract tourists and \n \n \n5 10-54965 \n \ninvestors from all over the world, and with \nunparalleled environmental wealth. \n In these times, when the world demands food, \nwater, biofuels and natural lungs for the Earth such as \nthe tropical forests, Latin America has millions of \nhectares ready for cultivation without affecting the \necological balance, and all the willingness necessary to \nbecome a supplier of all the goods that humanity needs \nfor its own survival. \n More than 925 million people living with hunger \nand malnutrition are a challenge that cannot be \npostponed. Latin America can and wants to be part of \nthe solution. Ours is the region richest in biodiversity \non the planet, with the most megadiverse country in the \nworld, namely Brazil, and the country with the greatest \nbiodiversity per square kilometre, namely our country, \nColombia. The Amazon region alone holds 20 per cent \nof the global supply of fresh water and 50 per cent of \nthe planet\u2019s biodiversity. \n Colombia is not a country with high levels of \npolluting emissions, but we want to assume our \nresponsibility to the planet and its future. We therefore \nsupport the international initiative known as Reducing \nEmissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, \nwhich seeks to generate and allocate the resources \nnecessary to reduce tropical forest loss and associated \nemissions. We Colombians want to be a model country \nfor the world in monitoring its forests, carbon \nemissions and the state of its biodiversity. \n Latin America as a whole must be a key region in \nsaving the planet. We call for a new agreement to \nreplace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012, to \nensure the commitment of all \u2014 starting with the big \nindustrial Powers  to emissions reduction. With \nappropriate economic compensation, we have an \nenormous capacity to reduce deforestation and plant \nnew forests, changing the history not only of the region \nbut of the world as a whole. \n When the twenty-first century began, Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean were just starting their \nmarch towards integration into the global economy. \nToday, 10 years later, in the light of our political and \neconomic stability and agricultural, energy and \nenvironmental potential, I want to send a message to \nthe other nations of our region. The world\u2019s eyes are \nupon us. Now is the time for us to open our own eyes, \nto overcome any persisting differences among us, and \nto think big. If we do so, and given everything I have \njust said, we can declare with one voice, as I do today \nat the dawn of the second decade of the third \nmillennium: This is Latin America\u2019s decade. It will be \na decade in which we can grow and advance, and first \nand foremost in which we can serve our peoples and \nthe well-being of humankind. \n Two days ago, I had the opportunity to present \nColombia\u2019s results in its progress towards the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. I \nam not now going to repeat our achievements \u2014 which \nhave been many \u2014 or our remaining challenges, which \nare many more. I simply want to underline that, more \nthan any other problem, poverty, with all its related \nconsequences, is the greatest calamity in our world.  \n I want to call attention in particular to the twofold \ntragedy faced by a brother Caribbean country, which, \nalong with its endemic poverty, is coping with the \neffects of a devastating natural disaster. I was in Haiti a \ncouple of months ago and I must say, before this \nAssembly of the nations of the world and with a \nsaddened heart, that its unbearable reality surpasses the \nworst nightmare. The pledged international aid is yet to \narrive in its entirety, or at least it is not visible. \nHaitians are still fighting and surviving with dignity \nand courage, but without the due attention we must \ngive to their situation, which can bear no delay. I call \non the Security Council to consider transforming the \nUnited Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti into a \ntrue development operation that responds to Haiti\u2019s \nneeds and achieves concrete results. \n In these difficult economic times, especially for \nindustrialized nations, with high unemployment and \nstagnation, global solidarity tends to vanish from \namong our priorities. That is a mistake. Turning one\u2019s \nback on international cooperation and trade helps no \none, and we are convinced that selfishness harms \neveryone, and the industrialized world more than any. \nWhere else are consumers going to come from if not \nfrom the millions of poor who have until now been left \nat the margins of progress? Who, other than societies \nfilled with enthusiastic young people, can contribute to \nthe dynamism  that mature nations need? What \neconomic space, other than the developing world, is \navailable to satisfy the needs of humankind in the \ncoming decades? Collective prosperity has advanced \nthe most precisely when millions have been involved in \ndevelopment, and the darkest moments of our planet\u2019s \neconomy have been those of exclusion and barriers. \n  \n \n10-54965 6 \n \n I cannot close without referring to two global \nscourges \u2014 terrorism and drug trafficking \u2014 that feed \noff each other, because it is often the money from illicit \ndrugs that finances terrorists acts and groups. Perhaps \nmore than any other country, Colombia has been a \nvictim of these phenomena, but it has also been a \nmodel in the fight against them and a champion of the \nneed to act together with the international community, \nunder the principle of shared responsibility. \n Our democratic security policy \u2014 a policy of \nsecurity for all with respect for the law \u2014 is also a \nhuman rights policy because we have been able to \ndramatically reduce the crimes and behaviours that \nmost threaten the lives and fundamental rights of our \npeople, such as homicide, kidnapping and \ndisplacement. We were the first country to \ncomprehensively apply the principles of truth, justice \nand reparation in the demobilization of illegal armed \ngroups. The Colombian State and society are \ncommitted to defending and promoting human rights. \nWe do so out of conviction \u2014 deep conviction \u2014 and \nnot by imposition. \n We have achieved great results in the fight \nagainst drug trafficking. There has been a substantial \nreduction in hectares where coca is grown, and we are \ncommitted to pursuing this task until those crops are \ncompletely eradicated. We have hit hard the mafias that \ncontrol this business, including guerrilla groups that \nhave become veritable drug cartels. We will continue to \nfight them relentlessly and without quarter. We will \nspare no effort. Just yesterday, from this very city, I \nannounced to the world the news of the death of the \nhighest-ranking military leader of the Revolutionary \nArmed Forces of Colombia in an operation impeccably \nconducted by our armed forces. This is the most \nimportant and decisive blow against that terrorist group \nin its history, and we hope it will bring us closer to \npeace. \n We want to achieve peace either by reason or by \nforce, and we will achieve it so that we can dedicate \nand focus all our energies on achieving development \nand prosperity for our people. In the fight against drug \ntrafficking, we have lost many of our best soldiers, \npolicemen, leaders, judges and journalists. Still, their \nblood has not been shed in vain. From a failed State in \nwhich violent actors, financed by drug trafficking, had \ndistorted our democracy, today we look at the world \nfrom a thriving democracy rising towards democratic \nprosperity for all. We defeated the big drug cartels, but \nthis business has not come to an end yet. That is why \nwe will keep on fighting it, because for us it is a matter \nof national security. \n We are concerned and distressed that our relative \nsuccess has led to other countries of the region \nsuffering the growing presence and activities of drug \ntrafficking in their territories. The world needs to open \nits eyes, because to be in denial with respect to this \nproblem could be fatal. It happened to us at a very high \ncost. \n We Colombians are more than willing to \ncooperate with States that need it, and we are already \ndoing so with several countries in Central America and \nthe Caribbean, with Mexico and even in Afghanistan. \nBut, it is very important that we be consistent on this \nissue. I say this as representative of the country with \nthe highest moral authority to speak of this scourge, \nbecause no other nation has suffered like ours the \ndisastrous consequences of drug trafficking. \n We note with concern the contradictory stance of \nsome countries that, on the one hand, demand a head-\non fight against drug trafficking and, on the other, \nlegalize consumption or study the possibility of \nlegalizing the production and trade of certain illicit \ndrugs. How can I or anyone tell a peasant in my \ncountry that he or she will be prosecuted and punished \nfor growing crops for drug production, while in other \ncountries such activity is being legalized? These \ncontradictions make it urgent \u2014 and on this matter we \njoin the call by President Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez Reyna of \nthe Dominican Republic \u2014 that we agree to review the \nglobal strategy against illicit drugs in order to draft a \nsingle global policy that is more effective and within \nwhich all countries will contribute equally to this \neffort. \n Thanks to the significant security, economic and \nsocial achievements accomplished in recent years \nthrough the efforts of many Colombians and the \nleadership of my predecessor, President \u00c1lvaro Uribe, \ntoday Colombia finds itself at the dawn of a new \nmorning. I came to office with the commitment to fight \npoverty and unemployment and to lead my country \ntowards not only economic but also social prosperity \nthat reaches everyone, above all the poorest. I have \nproposed a Government of national unity in which all \nColombians are united to create jobs and greater \nwelfare. I foresee with great optimism our future as a \nnation. \n \n \n7 10-54965 \n \n Today, I present myself before this global forum \nwith respect, humility, a sense of history and an \nawareness of our own limitations to say that we can do \nnothing alone, neither in my country nor in the world. \nOnly united and only with respect, solidarity and \ntolerance will humankind be able to know a better \ntomorrow."

        "file_text": "I too offer \nyou, Sir, my warmest congratulations upon your \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nthis our sixty-fifth session. Let me assure you, as \nalways, of the cooperation and support of the Tongan \ndelegation. I also express my gratitude to your \npredecessor His Excellency Mr. Ali Treki for his \n  \n \n10-55408 6 \n \nrecently concluded term as President at our sixty-fourth \nsession. \n I wish to also thank the tireless Secretary-\nGeneral, Ban Ki-moon, for his resolute leadership of \nthe Organization during these times of unprecedented \nand challenging global events. We also acknowledge \nthe enduring work of the Organization\u2019s Secretariat and \nits agencies, and in particular those who have made the \nultimate sacrifice in the furtherance of that work. \n A decade on, the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) continue to reflect our firm global resolve to \nensure a durably improved quality of life for all of our \npeoples \u2014 a global pursuit of happiness, if you will. It \nis no surprise, then, that the MDGs are now a core \ncomponent of our national development planning.  \n Tonga has recently produced its second national \nMDG report, which highlights positive results across \nthe eight Goals. With regard to MDG 1, on the \neradication of extreme poverty and hunger, the report \nsuggests that, while the international community \nacknowledges that Tonga does not suffer from extreme \npoverty or hunger, there are some households that do \nsuffer hardship, and their needs are being addressed. \nWith regard to Goal 2, the net enrolment ratio in \nprimary education for 2008 was 93 per cent, indicating \nthat Tonga has almost achieved universal basic \neducation. Goal 6, as it relates to halting and reversing \nthe incidence of non-communicable diseases by 2015, \nand Goal 5, as it relates to universal access to \nreproductive health, both remain challenges. \n Yet despite the continuing uncertain global \neconomic and financial climate, Tonga remains \ncommitted, in the five years remaining until 2015, and \nbeyond, to making further strides towards achieving \nthe MDGs. We look forward to completing one such \nstride on MDG 6 next year, in 2011, with the timely \nconvening of a high-level meeting of the General \nAssembly on the prevention and control of  \nnon-communicable diseases. \n The MDGs, in our view, as much as marking the \nadvent of the twenty-first century, reflect our \naspirational goals for this millennium beyond 2015. \nMuch of any future progress for Tonga will be \ncontingent on our determination and ability to rely on \nour own domestic efforts, complemented by the actions \nof our development partners and the international \ncommunity. \n At the annual meeting of the Pacific Islands \nForum leaders held in Port Vila last month, leaders \nadopted the Port Vila Declaration on Accelerating \nProgress on the Achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, wherein they drew linkages \nbetween the attainment of the MDGs and the state of \nprogress in the 19 focal areas of the Mauritius Strategy \nfor Implementation. \n If the landmark Barbados Programme of Action \nplaced small island developing States (SIDS) firmly on \nthe global agenda, then the linkages between the \nMDGs and the Mauritius Strategy +5 Review (MSI+5) \nserve as an accurate compass for charting the direction \nthat small island developing States, their development \npartners and the international community need to take \nto ensure progress. We join others in thanking the good \nAmbassadors of Luxembourg and Singapore for \nbrokering the consensus outcome of the MSI+5.  \n Like others, Tonga calls for the creation of a \nformal SIDS category within the United Nations \nsystem that not only improves the internal linkages and \ninfrastructure within the system but ultimately \nimproves its ability to better relate to and respond to \nthe needs of SIDS. Without some measure of \nadjustments to the manner in which the United Nations \nsystem addresses SIDS and SIDS issues, progress will \nremain stilted. \n Climate change properly continues to dominate \nthe majority of statements we have heard this week and \nlast. In the end our collective ability as States could not \nadequately meet the burden of global expectations in \nCopenhagen, and many States like Tonga were left to \nlook for what little positive outcome the Copenhagen \nAccord represents. Therein lies the potential for all of \nus to reach beyond our narrow national and regional \ninterests in Canc\u00fan and embrace our collective \nresponsibility and duty to each other as nation-States, \nparticularly to those States that are most vulnerable, \nleast responsible for this situation and least able to \naddress the capricious whims of climate change. \n In taking forward the work of the Pacific SIDS on \nthe consensus resolution entitled \u201cClimate change and \nits possible security implications\u201d (resolution 63/281), \nwe would join others in strongly encouraging current \nand prospective members of the Security Council to \nseize the moral imperative and follow the momentum \nby taking positive and proactive action on the \nresolution. As the final arbiter of international peace \n \n \n7 10-55408 \n \nand security, the Council must ensure it positions itself \nin an active leadership role on this issue. \n Tonga continues to follow the course of the \nongoing exchanges among our membership on the \nreform of the Security Council and the limited progress \nthat has been made to date. An organization such as \nours that wishes to retain its broad relevance and \nglobal primacy in this day and age has to be open and \nwilling to seriously reconsider those elements that give \nit a unique and distinctive quality. In our view, the \nSecurity Council and its composition constitute one of \nthose elements. \n We maintain our support for Council reform. It is \nalready somewhat self-evident that there should be an \nexpansion in both categories of membership, \npermanent and non-permanent, with certain States \u2014 \nJapan, Germany, Brazil and India \u2014 being worthy of \npermanent membership on an enhanced Council. The \npermanent membership category must also take \nfavourable account of seats for Africa.  \n Tonga remains supportive of the substantive \nefforts for direct talks by President Obama and his \nAdministration, the Quartet and regional neighbours to \nfind a comprehensive, just and enduring peace in the \nMiddle East. Despite the pursuit of the seemingly \nelusive goal of two States living side by side within \nsecure borders and in lasting peace and genuine \nsecurity, including a viable Palestinian State that can \nrealize the true potential of its people, we encourage all \nparties to continue this fresh round of dialogue with a \nrenewed sense of purpose and conviction. \n Tonga was one of the 13 Pacific SIDS that \nparticipated in an historic summit between Pacific \nleaders and the League of Arab States earlier this year \nin Abu Dhabi in order to share perspectives on the \ncurrent and future challenges faced by our respective \nregions. That historic summit and its outcome represent \nthe ever-expanding development of Tonga\u2019s foreign \npolicy interests to include countries and regions that \nhad hitherto not been considered. That development \ncomes firmly on the heels of our active engagement \nwith the International Renewable Energy Agency and \nour continuing interest in the potential of renewable \nenergy and the first-time visit to Tonga and a number \nof other Pacific SIDS by His Highness Sheikh \nAbdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan to develop relations \nwith our region. In that regard, we acknowledge with \nappreciation the Partnership in the Pacific Programme \nand its potential to meet the development aspirations of \nthe peoples of the Pacific. \n Earlier this year, Tonga, in compliance with its \nobligations under the United Nations Convention on \nthe Law of the Sea, formally presented its partial \nsubmission to the Commission on the Outer Limits of \nthe Continental Shelf. One issue of concern that arose \nas a result of our formal presentation to the \nCommission is the likely lengthy time frame for \nconsideration of submissions such as Tonga\u2019s. We \nencourage our fellow States parties to the Convention \nto thoughtfully consider the adjustments necessary for \nthe Commission to fulfil its mandate with respect to all \nStates parties in a reasonably timely manner. \n Tonga welcomes the successful conclusion of the \n2010 review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons, particularly, the continuing \nacknowledgement of the concerns of SIDS over the \nsafe transport of radioactive materials by sea and the \nannouncement by the United States of its intention to \npursue ratification of the Protocols to the Treaty of \nRarotonga. \n When my Prime Minister addressed this body last \nyear, it marked the tenth anniversary of Tonga\u2019s \nadmission as a State Member of the United Nations. \nOur admission was culmination of a journey towards \nstatehood that began with tentative steps 135 years ago, \nin 1875, with the granting of Tonga\u2019s Constitution by \nKing George I. \n And after 135 years, we realize that our domestic \nsystem of governance needs to be strengthened in ways \nthat align itself more readily with the strong and \nvibrant systems of democratic governance prevalent \ntoday. And so, simultaneous with my delivery of these \nremarks here today is the historic closure of the current \nsession of Tonga\u2019s Legislative Assembly, the last under \nthe existing system of governance. Elections under the \nnew system are scheduled to take place later this year, \non 25 November. So while the modalities for \nimproving democratic representation have been \nenhanced, the fundamental values and freedoms \nguaranteed in the Constitution continue to protect and \nsupport all Tongans. \n As any small island developing State appreciates, \na presence here in New York represents a significant \nsacrifice of already scarce resources, but it is made in \nthe knowledge that despite our size, our remoteness \nand our geographical isolation we are not immune to \n  \n \n10-55408 8 \n \nthe global challenges that beset us all. Therefore we \nhave a responsibility to our Government and our \npeople to be more than mere bystanders in the work of \nour Organization. \n As such, Tonga reaffirms the rights and \nresponsibilities bestowed upon it by the United Nations \nCharter, and we pledge in our own way to continue to \nparticipate actively and constructively to give an \nenduring Tongan voice to the global issues of concern \nto us all. And while many subgroupings and variations \nof States such as the Group of 20 or the Group of Eight \nmay convene from time to time for a particular purpose \nor timely nuance, whether it be reforming the \ninternational financial governance institutions or \nreinvigorating international environmental governance, \nthe pivotal role of the United Nations as a viable \ninstitution remains constant against an ever-changing \nbackdrop. \n Finally, any other 65-year-old might be \ncontemplating retirement, but our Organization\u2019s \nstrength rests as much in the principles of the Charter \nas it does in the people it must continue to inspire and \nremain relevant to, especially our young people. \nDuring this, the International Year of Youth, the United \nNations and all of us must ensure a legacy worth \npassing on to the next generation."

        "file_text": "\nI wish to begin by conveying our heartfelt \ncongratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election \nto guide the work of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nfifth session. Your human and professional qualities are \na guarantee of success in the Assembly\u2019s important \ntasks. \n I come to this rostrum as the representative of \nChile, a country that is far away on the map but that is \ninhabited by a people that is close and that is in \nsolidarity and brotherhood; a country geographically \nnarrow but with a big and generous heart; a country \nphysically surrounded by an arid desert to the north, \nmajestic mountains to the east, a huge sea to the west \nand the magnificent Antarctica to the south. Despite \nthat, it is a people with a permanent and steadfast \ncommitment and calling to integration in the world. It \nis a country that like many others has experienced \ndivision and discord among its children but that is \ntoday fully united and reconciled; a country with a \nfearless and earthy character but possessing \nindomitable determination and valour; a country of \nwarriors and heroes but that has enjoyed uninterrupted \npeace for 130 years. It is a young country but with age-\nold institutions, and it views the present with \nconfidence and the future with optimism. \n Chile is a country that today is living through \ntimes that are historic and dramatic and offer enormous \nopportunities. I say historic times because only five \ndays ago we commemorated our two-hundredth \nanniversary of independence and opened the doors to \nour third century of republican life. We did so as one \nbig family saluting the same flag, honouring the same \nheroes and singing the same national anthem \nirrespective of our political ideas, religious beliefs, \nethnic origin or economic situation. \n But Chile is also living through dramatic times of \nadversity and sadness. A few months ago our country \nsuffered one of the five worst earthquakes in human \nhistory, followed by tidal waves on our coastlines. Five \nhundred and twenty-one of our fellow citizens lost \ntheir lives and many are still missing. More than \n2 million Chileans were affected. Entire cities and \nvillages were demolished. Hundreds of hospitals, \nclinics, bridges and ports are still unusable. One of \nevery three children \u2014 1.25 million \u2014 were unable to \nreturn to school because the schools had been \ndestroyed or badly damaged. Total losses amounted to \nabout $30 billion, equivalent to about 18 per cent of \nour national product. Without doubt, it was the largest \ncatastrophe with the biggest damage ever suffered by \nour country in the history of its 200 years of \nindependence. \n But from those ruins rose a people united in \nsolidarity. After a mere 45 days all children and young \npeople had returned to school. In only 60 days we were \nable to restore proper health-care services in the \naffected areas. In only 90 days we had built more \nemergency housing than we had built throughout our \ncountry\u2019s prior history. In 100 days we had entirely \nrestored connections, providing full or partial services \nto airports, ports, roads, bridges \u2014 everything the \nearthquake had destroyed. In 120 days our economy \nhad recovered the capacity to grow and create \nemployment with greater strength than ever. \n Certainly, reconstruction has only just begun and \nwill require years of effort. But to that end we will \ncontinue to work tirelessly until we have rebuilt the \nlast school, the last hospital or the last home that had \nbeen destroyed. Because for a country such as Chile, \nwhich has been shaped by adversity, determination and \nhard work, however difficult a crisis may be or how \npainful its consequences, it always represents an \nopportunity \u2014 the opportunity to build a better country \ntogether. \n In addition to being historic and dramatic, these \nare times of enormous opportunities. That is because \nthis generation of Chileans \u2014 the bicentennial \ngeneration \u2014 is in position to fulfil the dream our \nparents and grandparents had always cherished but \nnever achieved. That dream is to succeed in making \nChile, before the end of this decade, a country able to \n  \n \n10-54833 26 \n \ndefeat poverty, to defeat underdevelopment and to \ncreate opportunities for material and spiritual \ndevelopment for all of its children, which Chile has \nnever before known. \n How will we do this? First, by strengthening the \nthree basic pillars so that development germinates and \nopportunities flourish. At the political level that \nrequires a stable, participatory, transparent and vital \ndemocracy; at the economic level, a social market \neconomy open to the world and trusting unreservedly \nin the economic entrepreneurship and creativity of its \ncitizens; and at the social level, a State that is strong \nand effective in the fight against poverty and in \npromoting greater equality of opportunities. \n But we will build upon rock, and not upon sand. \nWhat was done before is insufficient. We must \nstrengthen the pillars of society, knowledge and \ninformation. I am thinking about the development of \nour human capital, which is the greatest wealth we \npossess. We must encourage innovation and \nentrepreneurship, which are the only truly renewable \nand inexhaustible natural resources that we have. We \nmust invest in science and technology, which will \ncreate unimaginable opportunities for the future we all \nface, and we must promote more dynamic and flexible \nmarkets and institutions in order to confront the \nchanges and opportunities that have become the \nchallenges of the modern world. \n For those reasons, almost 65 years ago, Chile, \ntogether with 50 other countries, attended the \nformation of this United Nations, whose goal was to \nmaintain peace, security and international cooperation. \nThat was the post-war period, when our planet was \ncrossed and divided by two walls. One was the iron \ncurtain running from north to south, dividing the world \nfor a long time into two irreconcilable blocs, each with \nsufficient war-making capacity to annihilate our planet \nseveral times over. But there was another wall, the one \nrunning from east to west, which separated the rich and \nprosperous countries of the North from the poor and \nunderdeveloped nations of the South. \n Both walls fell before our eyes as the sun set on \nthe twentieth century. The first wall was in Berlin, in \nCentral Europe, and the second one in Silicon Valley, \nBangalore, Singapore, New Zealand and in the main \ntechnological centres throughout the world. But the fall \nof these walls uncovered a third wall, less visible than \nthe previous ones but equally or more harmful and \ndamaging. That wall has existed in our countries and \npeoples forever, separating the older souls who live in \nnostalgia and fear the future from the young souls who \nare creative and entrepreneurial and embrace the future \nfearlessly and always believe that the best is still to \ncome. \n That wall prevented many of our nations from \njoining the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth \ncentury. That explains why there are still \nunderdeveloped countries while others, fewer in \nnumber, managed to demolish that wall in time and to \njoin that revolution. \n But today we are confronted by a new revolution, \nmore powerful and more significant than the Industrial \nRevolution: the revolution of knowledge, technology \nand the information society. It has been knocking at \nour doors for several years. It will be very generous to \nthe countries that want to embrace it, but tremendously \nindifferent and even cruel to those that ignore it or \nsimply let it pass. And in order to deepen our \nintegration and to govern globalization better \u2014 lest \nglobalization should end up governing us \u2014 the crisis \nmust be addressed differently. \n The financial crisis has ceased to be a national \nproblem and has acquired regional and often global \nimplications. The evils of modern society such as \nterrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime know \nno frontiers or territories or jurisdictions. And any \nattempts to effectively tackle global warming, natural \ndisasters, health emergencies, hunger or extreme \npoverty are going to require action that is much more \nattentive, concerted and effective on the part of the \ncommunity of nations. \n So the United Nations and other institutions \nderiving from the Bretton Woods consensus, such as \nthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, \nurgently need to modernize and adapt to the new times \nif they want to play a leading role and not be mere \nspectators of events to which we will be witnesses and \nprincipal actors. Those new times are the changes \nalready taking place in this new century. \n As in 1945, when Chile participated in the \ncreation of this Organization, and with the authority \nconferred on us by the fact of having actively \nparticipated in each one of its forums \u2014 peacekeeping \noperations and humanitarian missions \u2014 today we also \nwant to participate in encouraging and promoting the \ngreat reform and modernization that the United Nations \n \n \n27 10-54833 \n \nand the international order require. That must be done \nby creating a much more demanding and efficient \ninstitution in terms of goals and expectations, one more \nflexible and effective in structure and more determined \nand committed in the defence of the ideals for which it \nwas created. \n In other words, we need a United Nations able to \nmeet the challenges and needs of the twenty-first \ncentury, which we all know are genuine peace, \nsustainable progress and respect for the dignity of all \nthose who inhabit our planet. Such reforms require \nmodernizing the Security Council so that it is more \npluralistic and representative of the new global reality. \nIn this regard, we reiterate our appeal for the \nincorporation of other emerging countries, such as \nBrazil, on our own continent. \n I should also like to take this opportunity to offer \nmy very sincere congratulations to my predecessor as \nPresident of Chile, Michelle Bachelet, on her recent \nappointment as Under-Secretary-General for Gender \nEquality and the Empowerment of Women, and to \nexpress my pride and that of my whole nation at the \nfact that a compatriot will be head of a global effort to \nachieve greater equality between men and women. I am \nsure that, given her human and professional qualities, \nshe will lead the new gender entity brilliantly and \neffectively. \n I also wish to reaffirm our commitment to the \nprinciples that have always governed and guided our \nforeign policy, including full respect for international \nlaw, the inviolability of treaties, the juridical equality \nof States, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the \nself-determination of peoples, which are unquestionably \nessential foundations of international stability and \npeaceful coexistence among nations. \n I also stress the importance of the promotion of \ndemocracy and respect for human rights at all times, in \nall places and in all circumstances, and our lasting \ncommitment to multilateralism and open regionalism \nthat promote constructive and more cooperative \neconomic practices among the countries of the world \nand of our region. Chile will never cease to raise its \nvoice in all international gatherings and forums to \ndefend these principles. \n Here at the United Nations today, I also wish to \nsincerely recognize the aboriginal peoples who \ninhabited our lands thousands of years before the \nEuropean explorers and conquistadors arrived. We are \nvery proud to be a multicultural nation, but we \nrecognize that we failed for centuries to give our \naboriginal peoples the opportunities they deserved and \nneeded. That is why we in Chile are promoting the \nconstitutional recognition of all our aboriginal peoples, \nabandoning the strategy of assimilation and moving \ntowards that of integration. Such a strategy respects, \nvalues and protects their languages, culture and \ntraditions, which are part of our deepest national \nwealth. Along with this constitutional recognition, we \nhave established a dialogue involving the Government, \ncivil society and our aboriginal peoples, in particular \nthe Mapuche, to strengthen the agenda for historic \nrediscovery with the most powerful initiative ever \nlaunched in Chile on this subject \u2014 the Araucan\u00eda \nPlan. \n I would also like to recall that only weeks ago my \ncountry was shaken by an event heard around the \nworld. A rockslide of more than 100 million tons left \n33 miners trapped deep under a mountain in the \nAtacama desert. From that moment, our Government \nand country committed themselves body and soul and \nmade their very best efforts to launch a search-and-\nrescue operation. Seventeen anguishing days later, we \nwere able to reach the trapped miners. They sent up a  \nmessage that filled all my compatriots\u2019 hearts with joy: \n\u201cWe are okay, we are safe, the 33\u201d. This represents the \nwhole paradox of our country. We have struggled so \nhard to save the lives of the 33 miners, and yet at the \nsame time we have 34 Mapuche herders who are on a \nhunger strike that is killing them. \n I wish to conclude by telling those assembled \nhere that the example of courage and perseverance set \nby our 33 miners will light the path to the future. The \nfuture is always an adventure. For pessimists, it means \nfear; for sceptics, it means doubt; but for all men and \nwomen of good will, it always means challenges and \nopportunities that we must meet together in order to \nbuild a better world than the one we inherited from our \nparents, and which we have a duty to bequeath to our \nchildren. That challenge, my friends, is for us, and it is \nnow, because if it is not now, when, and if not for us, \nthen for whom? "

        "file_text": "It is always a great \nhonour for me to address the annual gathering of the \nGeneral Assembly. \n In uncertain times such as ours, cooperation is \nmore necessary than ever. Unless we stand together \nand invent new approaches to the global challenges we \nall face, we shall be torn apart by fear and self-\ndestructive interests. Gatherings such as this, therefore, \nare valuable only if they allow us to shape a common \nvision for concrete action towards peace, development, \nsolidarity and justice. \n This month, thanks to the coordinated efforts of \nthe international community and the leadership of \nPresident Obama and Secretary of State Clinton, direct \npeace talks have resumed between Israelis and \nPalestinians. This is a very important moment, because \nthey resume precisely when many people had given up \nhope for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. \n The road to peace, security, and justice is still a \nlong one. The remaining obstacles are enormous. But \nthe goal is so noble and necessary that no effort should \nbe spared. That is why today I would like to pay tribute \nto all those who are taking risks for peace. Yes, risks. \nBecause peace is never obvious, never easy. That is \ncertainly true in the Middle East, and it is true in my \nregion as well. \n One of our common goals, then, must be to \nenable those risk-takers who have the courage to defy \nconventional wisdom and forge new paths to peace. \nPeace is not an easy way. But peace is the only way. \n As the President of a young democracy that \nrecently suffered from war and invasion and is still \nunder partial occupation of an important part of its \nterritory by a nuclear super-Power, I can say this: peace \nis our most precious common goal and, at the same \ntime, our only path towards the other goals we share. \n To those here and in my own country who see no \nway to reverse the armed occupation or reduce regional \ntensions, I say: peace is not only the goal, it is also the \nmeans to any goal. \n Today my region is at a crossroads. For too long, \nit has suffered from division, injustice, conflict, \ncolonization and violence. Today, however, change is \npossible. In fact, change is already taking place. I came \n  \n \n10-54833 2 \n \nhere to speak about this change and to promote a \nspecific vision \u2014 a vision of a free, stable and united \nCaucasus. \n From the times of Pushkin, Lermontov or Tolstoy \nto the present day, the Caucasian mountains have been \na symbol of wilderness and paradoxes, a region where \nindividuals and souls were fundamentally free, but \nwhere citizens were brutally oppressed; where people \nand cultures were deeply tolerant, but where \nGovernments and authorities created artificial \ndivisions; where shepherds would cross 5,000-metres-\nhigh mountains, but where rulers erected walls nobody \ncould cross. I have come here today to tell the \nAssembly that those times are vanishing, that the \ndream of unity and peace is possible. \n When I addressed the Assembly two years ago \u2014 \nin the aftermath of a full-scale invasion, and when the \nRussian Foreign Minister was openly discussing with \nforeign diplomats and the international community the \npossibility of Georgia\u2019s total annihilation \u2014 few \npeople believed that our country would survive as an \nindependent and democratic State. Few people thought \nthat our Government would endure, that our economy \nwould survive the war and the global crisis, that our \nreforms could continue with renewed vigour, or that we \nwould make steady progress towards the European \nUnion and Euro-Atlantic structures. \n Well, I am proud to tell the Assembly, two years \nlater, that we have succeeded against all the odds, \nthanks to the commitment of the Georgian people and \nto the support of friends and allies. Today, Georgia is \nback. \n Georgia is back, first, as a laboratory for political \nreform and social transformation. \n More than ever, we are committed to the promise \nat the heart of the Rose Revolution to turn a failed \nState into a modern European one. Our local elections \nlast May were proof of that transformation and a \nmilestone for our democracy, the result of seven years \nof patient, constant, tireless reform. \n Our objective is clear: to create a more \ninstitutionalized system of liberal democratic \ngovernance. \n My term as President ends in 2013. These \nchanges will survive my presidency and the current \nGovernment, because we are not speaking only about \nchanges of leadership or reforms of institutions; we are \nspeaking about something deeper and stronger \u2014 \nsomething that The Economist of London recently \nbranded as Georgia\u2019s \u201cmental revolution\u201d. \n The Georgian people have tasted freedom, the \nabsence of corruption, the fruits of economic \ndevelopment, the emergence of a true meritocracy. \nThey have changed their behaviour, their vision of the \nworld, their dreams even, and they will mightily resist \nany attempts to reverse those changes \u2014 no matter \nwhether those attempts come from inside or from \nabroad. \n This is our great victory: we helped to create \nsomething that goes far beyond the leaders and parties \nthat led the Rose Revolution. We helped to create a \nrevolution of the heart and the mind. \n Once one of the most corrupt countries of the \npost-Soviet world, Georgia has made greater gains in \nthe fight against corruption, as witnessed by \nTransparency International, than any other country \nover the past five years. Once a place where foreign \ninvestors were kidnapped by gangs and mafias, \nGeorgia is now ranked by the World Bank as number \n11 for ease of doing business in the world \u2014 a ranking \nwe hope to further improve this year \u2014 and the \nnumber 1 in Eastern and Central Europe. These \nrankings make clear why Georgia\u2019s only interest is a \npeaceful resolution of conflicts: Georgia is winning the \npeace \u2014 Georgia is winning through peace. \n Our northern neighbour expected us to change \nour path when it imposed on us a full embargo in 2006, \ninvaded us in 2008, ethnically cleansed Georgian \nregions and illegally occupied 20 per cent of our \nterritory, an occupation that continues to this day. All \nthese actions had one objective: to destroy the \nGeorgian laboratory of political, economic and social \nreform \u2014 to prevent the region from changing. \n We answered those relentless attacks by \nreinvigorating our reforms, opening our economy even \nmore, and accelerating our social transformation. This \nis our policy, and no provocation will ever make us \nchange it. Thanks to this commitment to reform, \nGeorgia is now a responsible international player. \n I am proud that my nation is fighting \ninternational terrorism in Afghanistan. I pay tribute \nhere to our nearly 1,000 soldiers who are risking their \nlives every day in the south of Afghanistan to help the \nAfghan people secure a stable, terror-free future. I pay \n \n \n3 10-54833 \n \na special tribute today to company commander First \nLieutenant Mukhran Shukvani, who died earlier this \nmonth. Mukhran was killed in the cause of peace, \nwhile serving alongside NATO forces in the dangerous \nHelmand province of Afghanistan. \n We are fighting other common scourges, now \nfocusing especially on the terrible danger of nuclear \ntrafficking. Many times over the past seven years we \nhave intercepted criminals who had in their possession \nthe essential ingredients for nuclear devices. Every step \nof the way, we have cooperated with our allies in the \ninternational community to ensure that Georgia is \ndoing everything possible to confront this global \ndanger. \n Here I must pause to draw attention to a grave \nproblem that resulted from the partial occupation of my \ncountry \u2014 a problem that everybody should worry \nabout, even those who overlook and do not care too \nmuch about violations of international law, who forget \n500,000 internally displaced persons and refugees; \neven those who dismiss repeated assaults on basic \nhuman rights, civil liberties and the environment. \n I am speaking of the lawlessness bred by the \nRussian occupation. Our two occupied regions exist in \na black hole of governance. Today, in those lands, \ncriminals act with impunity. The most elemental human \nrights are abused. Drugs and weapons are smuggled. \nPeople are trafficked. And potential weapons of mass \ndestruction are moved in and out of the territories, \nposing a threat to us all. \n Three days ago, we met in this very place to \ndiscuss the Millennium Development Goals and our \nprogress in meeting them over the past decade. I shall \nnot tire the Assembly with a recitation of our efforts to \nachieve the Goals, the strides we have made in halving \nour poverty rate and decreasing by two thirds our \nextreme poverty, reforming our educational system and \nimproving health care. \n But I will tell the Assembly that all those \nsuccesses remain bittersweet for me, because they \ncannot be savoured by all the people of Georgia \u2014 not \nby those who live in fear for their basic rights in the \noccupied territories, nor fully by the 500,000 internally \ndisplaced persons and refugees who were expelled \nfrom their homes and cannot go back and regain their \nproperty. \n For the last two years the Russian Federation has \nbeen violating the ceasefire agreement brokered in \nAugust 2008 by my good friend French President \nNicolas Sarkozy, who was acting at the time on behalf \nof the European Union. The Russian army has not \nwithdrawn as required by the ceasefire. European \nUnion monitors cannot enter Russian-occupied areas of \nGeorgia, where a constant military build-up is taking \nplace. Hundreds of thousands of internally displaced \npersons, victims of the ethnic cleansing campaign led \nby the Russian forces, are still prevented from entering \ntheir homes. \n How did Georgia respond to those violations of \ninternational law and human rights? We answered with \npatience and calm. We implemented \u2014 fully \u2014 the \nceasefire agreement and went beyond our obligations, \nwithout ever using as a pretext Russia\u2019s refusal to \ncomply. Last month, the head of the European Union \nMonitoring Mission in Georgia, Ambassador Haber, \npublicly praised Georgian policy as \u201cconstructive \nunilateralism\u201d. \n What does constructive unilateralism mean? It \nrefers, for instance, to our calm when militias \nsupported by Russia\u2019s federal security service (FSB) \nkilled our policemen at the occupation line, or to our \nwillingness to free criminals working for the \noccupation regime when the other side was kidnapping \nteenagers who wanted to visit their empty house just \nafter their school time. \n Constructive unilateralism means that we behave \nin a civilized and patient way, even when our enemy \nuses barbaric methods or implements an impulsive and \nirrational policy. It means that \u2014 even if peace \nrequires both sides to come to the negotiating table \u2014 \none can pave the way to peace on one\u2019s own, without \nthe other side\u2019s cooperating. \n This constructive unilateralism is based on the \nidea that peace is in the supreme interest of Georgia, \nthat peace is the only path to the de-occupation of our \ncountry. It forms the substance of the strategy on \noccupied territories that my Government has put in \nmotion to engage the populations held hostage by the \nRussian occupiers, on the other side of the new Iron \nCurtain that illegally divides our country. \n Like the Berlin Wall, walls like the one dividing \nGeorgia will be brought down not by bombs, but by the \ncommitment of citizens to build a free, united \ncountry \u2014 and by the commitment of the world \n  \n \n10-54833 4 \n \ncommunity to enforce international law and the \nprinciples of the Charter. \n This commitment is expressed in the refusal of \nnearly the entire world to legitimize the Russian \noccupation and the result of ethnic cleansing by \nrecognizing the so-called independence of Abkhazia \nand the Tskhinvali region, a de facto annexation of \nGeorgian territories by the Russian Federation. \n It is noticeable that, despite enormous pressure \nand multiple threats from Moscow, not a single former \nSoviet republic has recognized this dismemberment of \nGeorgia. It shows \u2014 to the great surprise of those who \ndescribe the fall of the Soviet empire as the worst \ncatastrophe of the twentieth century \u2014 that the old \ntimes are definitely over. It shows that the change I \nevoked earlier has already taken root. It shows that all \nthe former captive nations of Soviet times are now \nindependent States that can determine their own \npolicies. It is noticeable \u2014 and it is noticed in \nMoscow. \n I solemnly call today on those three, isolated \nMember States that recognized Russia\u2019s de facto \nannexation of our territories and legitimized the \nRussian-led ethnic cleansing of around 500,000 \ncitizens, to acknowledge that it is never too late to \nreverse a bad policy. The dismemberment of Georgia \nhas failed categorically \u2014 and even the Russian \nFederation will one day need to reverse its disastrous \npolicy. Imagine how uncomfortable those leaders from \nfaraway countries will be when Moscow itself chooses \nto comply with international law and withdraw its \ntroops. Because that day will come. \n Those who claimed a military victory in 2008 \nnow face a diplomatic and political defeat. And in \nMoscow the occupation and annexation will soon be \ndebated. They are in fact already debated in the \ncorridors of the Kremlin, because this situation is not \nsustainable, even for the Russian leadership. \n We have now in our country Russian soldiers \ndeserting their units and fleeing to the Georgian side \nthrough the wall erected by their superiors, just as \nSoviet soldiers did in Berlin during the cold war. In \nwhich direction is history moving? Certainly not in the \ndirection of those who can deploy thousands of tanks \nin a very short time, but who cannot even take care of \ntheir soldiers or prevent them from fleeing. \n Those who refuse to modernize their society and \nto open their political system may have an interest in \nwar and instability. But in Georgia we know, and we \nhave always known, that peace is our interest \u2014 the \nvery precondition of our survival and our success. \n I have three calls to make today. \n My first call is addressed to my fellow citizens, \nethnic Abkhaz and Ossetian, who live behind the new \nIron Curtain that divides our common nation. I want to \ntell them once again: We will protect your rights, your \nculture, your history \u2014 we will work with you, we will \nwork for you. You are part of a common history, a \ncommon culture and a common future. Your \ndifferences enrich our proud national tapestry. Rather \nthan see you succumb to annexation by the emerging \nRussian empire, we invite you to build together with us \na multicultural and multi-ethnic society that will be a \nregional model for tolerance and respect. \n I dream about the day when \u2014 as has happened \nseveral times in our common history \u2014 an Abkhaz or \nOssetian citizen of Georgia becomes President and \nleader of a democratic and European Georgia. And this \ndream will become possible in a reunited and free \nGeorgia, a Georgia that will build positive relations \nand even intense cooperation with the Russian \nFederation, a Russian Federation acting as a rational \ninternational player and not as a revisionist or \nrevanchist Power; a Russian Federation that will have \nchosen cooperation instead of confrontation and has \ndropped the politics of embargoes and intolerance, and \ninstead of imposing crackdowns will be a good partner \nto cooperate with. \n My second call is, therefore, to the Russian \nleadership, to whom I say: You face a choice. Either \nyou take a major part in the ongoing transformation of \nour common region, accepting that other countries are \nyour partners and not vassals, or this transformation \nwill happen without you. We all want \u2014 I personally \nwant \u2014 Russia as a great partner and not as an enemy. \nThat is why the Georgian Government supports the \nreset policy of the United States and the European \nUnion\u2019s engagement with Russia. Nobody has a greater \nstake than we have in seeing Russia turn into a country \nthat truly operates within the concert of nations, \nrespects international law and \u2014 this is often \nconnected \u2014 upholds basic human rights. \n I want to tell the Russian people that they will \nalways be welcome in Georgia, as tourists, as students, \n \n \n5 10-54833 \n \nas businessmen, as journalists or simply as friends, but \nnever as occupation forces. And I want to tell the \nRussian leaders that they should care more about their \ncitizens and less about our diplomatic orientation, more \nabout developing the Northern Caucasus \u2014 a region \nthat is exploding as I speak \u2014 than about undermining \nour development. They are welcome to come too if \nthey want, in order to understand how a post-Soviet \nsociety can turn into a European one.  We invite them \nto come, with notebooks rather than with missiles, with \niPads rather than Kalashnikovs. \n I was pleased to note that some of our reforms \ninspired a few recent presidential speeches in Moscow. \nInstead of fighting each other, we should excel together \nin modernizing our common region. And instead of \nsecretly copying or envying our reforms, they should \ncooperate with us in building a stable and free region, \nbuilding stable and free countries. Because by looking \nover the best pupil\u2019s shoulder one might not get the full \npicture of what modernization means. The complete \npicture is rather simple: lasting stability and prosperity \ncannot be achieved without respecting some basic \nprinciples. \n Modernization without freedom is not sustainable. \nOne cannot hope to diversify and develop one\u2019s \neconomy when one sends one\u2019s most talented and \nsuccessful businessmen to the Gulag, as happened to \nMikhail Khodorkovsky. Computers are not enough \nwithout free minds to use them. So let us free our \nminds from our common Soviet past in order to build a \ncommon future. \n My third and final call is to every member of the \ninternational community: help us to secure peace \u2014 in \nGeorgia, but also in our broader region. We Georgians \nhave learned tragically how a so-called frozen conflict \ncan very quickly become a hot one. \n If there is clear support from the international \ncommunity, I am convinced that a lasting peace can be \nsecured in the Caucasus. I am convinced that if the \nworld shows the same commitment to a peaceful \nresolution of conflicts in my region as in other parts of \nthe world we can accomplish wonders. It is in \neverybody\u2019s interest to see this strategic region, this \ncrossroads of civilizations, become more stable, \nprosperous and open. \n History has taught us that wars can erupt \nquickly \u2014 but also that brave leaders can secure peace \nwhere nobody would ever believe that conflicts could \nbe resolved. History has taught us that regions that \nwere torn apart by armed conflicts and contaminated \nby hate \u2014 starting with Europe \u2014 can achieve lasting \npeace through cooperation, interdependence and unity. \nHistory has taught us that dreams are often more \nrealistic than resignation. \n I strongly believe that a common market, shared \ninterests and political and economic interdependence \nwill one day give birth to a united Caucasus. That is \nwhat I call for today. \n We share a similar history of oppression, but we \nhave also in common a deep, essential and undefeated \naspiration for freedom. Let us capitalize on this \naspiration. Our region will never be truly free if it is \nnot united. \n It will of course require a long and difficult series \nof efforts and gestures, from all of us, but the objective \nis worth every sacrifice. As happened a long time ago \nwith the European Union \u2014 that amazing geopolitical \nrevolution we aspire to join one day \u2014 the historic \nmove towards Caucasian unity will start with concrete \nprojects, in the energy sector, in the education and the \ncultural fields and in the civil society sphere. \n We should begin with more people-to-people \nexchanges. It is time we got to know each other and \nforged links that will bring us together without \nchanging existing inter-State borders. \n My birth town and our capital, Tbilisi, is \ninhabited by Caucasians of every religion and every \nethnicity. Together they form a living example of \ntolerance and cooperation. So it is possible. We leaders \nhave to learn from this cohabitation of peoples and \ntranslate it into geopolitics. \n Our unity would not be directed against anyone. \nOnce again, we will not aspire to change any borders. \nThat needs to be emphasized. \n We may belong to different States and ethnic \ngroups, and live on different sides of the mountains, \nbut in terms of human and cultural space there is no \nNorth and South Caucasus; there is only one Caucasus, \nwhich belongs to world civilization and Europe and \nwill one day join the big European family of free \nnations, following the Georgian path. \n We, the Caucasians, driven by legitimate or \nimaginary threats of assimilation or attacks from other \nPowers, or from each other, hoped too often to be \n  \n \n10-54833 6 \n \nprotected by neighbouring empires. This anxious \nsearch for foreign shelter led us to subjugation, \nassimilation, annexation and historical tragedy. It \nauthorized foreign leaders to artificially emphasize and \nmanipulate our divisions. \n We \u2014 Caucasian people \u2014 all made the same \nmistake through history. It is time to change. It is time \nto stick together, to help each other to survive and \nprogress. It is time to understand that our region has \nsufficient resources and potential for all of us. It is time \nto rely on ourselves, on the human potential of our \ncitizens, on development of our own education system, \nand time to organize our own development. \n The Caucasus is one of the birthplaces of world \ncivilization. It is time to show that the energy of our \nancestors does not belong only to an iconic past, and \nthat we have something to give to our children and to \nthe world. It is time to stop fighting and weakening \neach other and to realize that our strength consists in \nunity. It is time for unity and peace. It is time to stop \nbeing prisoners of the past and to move towards our \ncommon future. \n In the past, Georgian citizens perceived our \nborder with the Ottoman Empire as an absolute threat. \nToday, we have passport-free customs; we can enter \neach other\u2019s country without passports and visas. We \nhave a joint airport and free trade with Turkey, and \nvery friendly relations. Tomorrow, the citizens of \nArmenia and Azerbaijan will be able to cross our \nborders without passports. Even today there is a very \nsimplified procedure; they do not even have to leave \ntheir cars. \n Recently, a foreign diplomat told me that after \ncrossing our only legal crossing point with Russia he \nencountered dozens of roadblocks where dangerous-\nlooking, unshaven local militiamen and FSB agents \nkept blocking the passage from one valley to another, \nfrom one village to another, aggressively preventing \nindividuals from circulating in their own country. \nThere is also talk about the eventuality of, and \npreparation for, a new war with Georgia. \n It is time to replace those people, barbed wire and \nroadblocks by open borders and passport-free customs, \nto replace camps for internally displaced persons by \njoint schools and universities, to replace the \nKalashnikov by computers, and to replace missiles by \nbooks or television sets. \n In 2008, thousands and thousands of tanks, \narmoured vehicles, artillery platforms, troops and \nmilitias crossed the Caucasian mountains, bringing \ndestruction, death and hatred. Now it is time for \nideas \u2014 the ideas of freedom and unity that we all \ncherish \u2014 to cross the same mountains, bringing hope, \nlife and even love. \n As I speak, thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles \nand missile platforms are entrenched or moving all \nacross the Caucasus. If we remain on our own, isolated \nfrom each other, they surely will prevail. But if \neverybody holds his neighbour\u2019s hand, if tens of \nmillions of unarmed people peacefully stand together, \nshoulder to shoulder, being the continuation of each \nother, just like the Caucasian mountains, then no brutal \nforce will ever break through this chain of awakened \nhuman spirits and this irresistible thirst for freedom."

        "file_text": "\nIt is an honour and a great responsibility to address the \n \n \n21 10-54965 \n \nAssembly today. It is a responsibility because we need \nto make the right analysis of the serious problems we \nface and, in my particular case, of the difficult reality \nin my country. El Salvador is one of many nations on \nthis planet beset by the problems of poverty, \nbackwardness and, above all, injustice. The more a \nleader is weighed down by the tragedy of his people, \nthe greater the responsibility, as we know well. \n When the Assembly reviews the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and the struggle against \npoverty in the world, and we look at the reality in \nCentral America, we can say that the efforts made have \nnot yet yielded the expected results. It is not easy for \nme to be so blunt in my assessment, but that is the \nreality and the international community must be \nsensitive to the plight of the vast majority of the \nworld\u2019s population. For many years now, the agenda of \nthe United Nations and other multilateral forums has \nincluded the struggle against poverty. The hoped-for \nimprovements, however, cannot be discerned. As far as \nsocial justice is concerned, far from achieving the \ndesired progress, the gap between rich and poor \ncountries, and between the rich and poor within \nindividual countries, has widened. Injustice has \nprevailed over our good intentions. That is the truth. \n The recent massacre in the Mexican state of \nTamaulipas of 72 migrants, of whom 14 have been \nidentified as Salvadorans \u2014 and we continue to try to \nidentify others \u2014 reveals the magnitude of the tragedy \nthat, while centred on Mexico and Central America, \naffects the whole world. Those 72 murdered desperate \nyoung men and women, who lost their lives trying to \nfind a future in the United States or Canada, are an \nexpression of the tragedy in the region, as well as a \nmetaphor for global injustice. This tragedy was not the \nresult of a plane crash or climate change. It was the \nresult, essentially, of three factors that point to the lack \nof positive results in the fight against poverty and \ninjustice. \n I am referring first to the lack of opportunities, \nexclusion, backwardness and widespread injustice that \naffect Central American societies and account for the \nmass emigration of their young people. The second is \nthat of migration, a consequence of the first. The third \nis violence, crime and the shadow business of \norganized crime, which exploits the breeding ground of \npoverty and the transit of dispossessed migrants for its \nillicit purposes.  \n El Salvador has 6 million inhabitants in its \nterritory and 3 million more living elsewhere, mainly \nin the United States. Migration has grown year by year \nin the wake of Governments\u2019 lack of response to the \naforementioned problems. Our migrants \u2014 indeed, the \nmigrants of the entire world \u2014 leave their civil rights \nbehind when they leave their country and arrive in new \nlands that do not recognize those rights. As experts on \nmigration have said, the migrant is a pariah, a human \nbeing without rights. For the more than 200 million \nmigrants around the world, mostly young people, \nhuman and social rights, such as those embodied in the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, are not \nguaranteed. Another reality in our region is the very \nhigh incidence of violence against women, which also \ncalls for our special attention. \n We note the close relationship between poverty, \ninjustice and migration. Furthermore, another, closely \nrelated factor in our region is the strong presence of \norganized crime and the extremely high incidence of \nviolence and criminality. We can say without \nexaggeration that the map of poverty and injustice is \nthe same as the map of migration; of the traffic in \ndrugs, humans and weapons; civic insecurity; money-\nlaundering and crime on a major scale. \n I mentioned the lack of positive results in fighting \npoverty and injustice on a global scale, especially in \nCentral America. I will now offer an example of the \nfailure of policies implemented in my country over the \npast decade. According to a report of the United \nNations Development Programme, the wealthiest \nsegment of the population in El Salvador received \n23 per cent of the State\u2019s social spending. The lowest \nsegment \u2014 the poor and marginal population \u2014 \nreceived only 18 per cent of that social spending. The \nState actually promoted and expanded injustice and \ncontributed to greater poverty. It is obvious that the \nneoliberal policies implemented in recent decades have \nrun counter to the desire of the international \ncommunity to reduce poverty, as expressed in the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n Let us therefore keep in mind the wise words of \nAlbert Einstein, who said that an insane person is he \nwho does the same thing over and over again and \nexpects different results. I am not speaking of my \ncountry alone. I believe that everyone has to undertake \nprofound changes in the way social policies are \ndesigned in order not to perpetuate failure. It would be \nna\u00efve, for example, to think that a coercive, repressive \n  \n \n10-54965 22 \n \nState that invests more and more in its security forces \nor that mobilizes its army to support the police to \ncombat crime \u2014 as I have ordered done in El Salvador, \ngiven the rise in crime that I inherited upon assuming \noffice \u2014 can in and of itself resolve the problem of \ninsecurity. We would be making a historic mistake if \nwe did not address the root causes of violence and \ncrime. The indolent State that has prevailed in recent \ntimes must be transformed into a social State that \nwages as its chief battle the reduction of poverty and \ninjustice. \n In this regard, I would like to lay out some \nthoughts based on that reality. First, the righteous \nbattle against organized crime and on behalf of the \nhuman rights of migrants does not fall exclusively to \nMexico and Central America. Here, I would like to say \nthat we must not leave it to Mexico or to Central \nAmerica alone. Our region is not the main consumer of \ndrugs. Our countries are not the major recipients of the \nuninterrupted flow of laundered drug money, the \nproduct of the failure of stricter controls. It is not only \nour people who will be hurt if the drug cartels continue \nto grow stronger and to endanger our countries\u2019 \nsurvival. This battle is not irrelevant to anyone. It \nwould be a mistake to believe that Mexico and Central \nAmerica can defeat crime alone. The territory of \ncriminal violence today is the border between the \nUnited States and our small countries, but tomorrow it \nwill be in the major cities of the developed world, the \ncapitals of America, Europe, Africa and Asia. So let us \nnot leave it to Mexico alone, and let us not leave it to \nCentral America alone. \n This is my appeal to the international community. \nThe help our countries need is economic; it is \nintelligence; it is support for training and equipping \nour law-and-order forces to combat crime and control \nmoney-laundering. But we also need help with the new \nsocial and regional policies that the Central American \nIntegration System has prepared, because those \ninvestments will address the causes of our tragedies.  \n For these reasons, I wish to bring two proposals \nto the General Assembly. First, we should establish, \nunder the auspices of the United Nations, a Central \nAmerican commission to investigate organized crime. \nThe establishment of such a body would be based on \nthe good experience of the International Commission \nagainst Impunity in Guatemala known as CICIG, which \nwas established with the support of the United Nations, \nthe United States, Canada and Spain. Such a \ncommission would no doubt contribute to \nstrengthening institutions. We must recognize that State \norganizations have been infiltrated by organized crime \nand that all means must be made available to recover \nthem and to wage the war against crime. \n My proposal is based on an implicit \nacknowledgement of the obvious truth that organized \ncrime does not recognize borders or respect States. Our \nresponse must therefore also transcend these \nboundaries; our response must be integration. Until the \nestablishment of such a commission, my country shall \nwork along these lines and has launched dialogue and \naction with neighbouring countries with a view to \ncoordinating policies to prevent and punish crime.  \n My second proposal concerns the establishment \nof an international alliance to support the priorities of \nregional integration, which are the fight against \npoverty and inequality and the creation of opportunities \nthat will allow our populations to stay in their \ncommunities of origin. \n Central Americans understand this, and are \nwilling to give battle to poverty, exclusion, and \norganized crime. To that end, we have started joint \nwork by relaunching our integration organization, the \nCentral American Integration System. Central \nAmericans are striving to create strong, democratic and \njust societies. In the specific case of El Salvador, my \nGovernment is moving forward with the building of a \nsocial State that reformulates social policy, taking into \naccount the failure of past mechanisms that I \nmentioned earlier. \n Gangs have become veritable criminal \norganizations coordinated with organized crime. We \nshall not overcome this reality with mere assistance \npolicies or improvements in the standards of living. \nThis phenomenon is found among young people who, \nfrom earliest childhood and adolescence, join gangs, \nand is so widespread that gangs have become a \ncomplex subculture. Our response must be equally so. \n Within the framework of a social State, we must \ndeepen democracy and strengthen republican \ninstitutions. We know that corruption is one of the \nworst enemies of the democratic system; therefore, \nworking for transparency has become a fundamental \naspect of our national and regional strategies.  \n Throughout Central America, this struggle is a \nmatter not only of ethics, but also of democratic \n \n \n23 10-54965 \n \nsurvival. In other words, we must oppose the potential \nemergence of a drug State by building strongly \ndemocratic and transparent States. It has been proven \nthat the more corruption there is, the less economic \ndevelopment there is. Corruption poisons public \npolicies, especially those that assist the poor; it reduces \ncitizens\u2019 trust in their system and makes markets \ninefficient. \n My Government has created a specialized body to \nfight corruption. The Under Secretariat of \nTransparency and Anti-Corruption is the first body in \nAmerica to submit itself to the in situ control by the \nInter-American Program of Cooperation to Fight \nCorruption of the Organization of American States, and \nhas been commended as such. According to the \nGovernment of the United States, El Salvador is also \nthe Central American country with the best \nperformance in fighting organized crime and drug \ntrafficking. Thus, it is not on the high-risk map which \nthat Government has just published. Without \ntransparent institutions, strong and independent \ninstitutions and without a true vocation to fighting \norganized crime, it will not be possible to meet the \ngreat challenges before us.  \n We are waging a war. It is a new war unlike those \nof the past. We are not waging it against another nation \nor standing army. We are facing a powerful, \nsophisticated, diffuse enemy that has blended in with \nour society, and we must fight it with new weapons, \ncreativity, intelligence, and the cooperation of our \nsocieties and the global community. Only thus will our \nefforts be commensurate with the circumstances. Only \nthus will we be able to meet today\u2019s challenges. Only \nthus will we provide sound responses to the needs of \nthe majority of our peoples, who await opportunities to \nbelieve once again in democracy, institutions and \npolitics.  \n Once again, I appeal to the conscience and \nsensibility of the international community. In \nconclusion, I wish to do so by quoting President John \nF. Kennedy\u2019s 1961 inaugural speech, which reflects \nwhat I have tried to convey today. He said that \u201cif a \nfree society cannot help the many who are poor, it \ncannot save the few who are rich\u201d."

        "file_text": "It is indeed a great \nhonour and privilege for me to stand here and speak on \nbehalf of the Gambia and the President of the Republic \nof the Gambia, His Excellency Al Hadji Yahya A. J. J. \nJammeh. \n First of all, I thank Allah, may He be glorified \nand exalted, for the opportunity of this moment, as we \ngather here to deliberate on ways to foster peaceful \ncooperation and development across the world. On \nbehalf of my delegation and the Government and the \npeople of the Gambia, I wish to thank the General \nAssembly for the warm welcome my delegation and I \nhave received since our arrival. I also wish to offer \ndeep congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, for \nhis courage and for the outstanding and efficient \nleadership he demonstrated during the sixty-fourth \nsession of the General Assembly. We welcome His \nExcellency Mr. Joseph Deiss of Switzerland as  \nMr. Treki\u2019s successor as the President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session. We would assure \nMr. Deiss of the Gambia\u2019s support for his presidency. \nMy delegation would also like to thank the Secretary-\n  \n \n10-55128 40 \n \nGeneral for his tireless efforts in leading and managing \nthe affairs of this highly complex Organization. \nFinally, I convey to all participants the good wishes of \nthe Government and the people of the Republic of the \nGambia. \n It is clear that the recent upheavals and crises in \nthe global arena have put into sharp focus what the \nUnited Nations can and must do as the springboard for \ncoordinating global responses and solutions to global \nissues. For this reason, the theme that the President has \nchosen for the sixty-fifth session of the General \nAssembly, namely, \u201cReaffirming the central role of the \nUnited Nations in global governance\u201d, is very apt and \ntimely. Any reaffirmation of the pivotal role of the \nUnited Nations must start with respect for the purposes \nand principles of its Charter. In the same vein, the \nOrganization must continue to implement the set of \nreforms that were introduced at the 2005 World \nSummit and other related United Nations summits and \nconferences. Without reform, the United Nations \ncannot be of relevance in the twenty-first century. \n One of the major reforms that we all agreed on is \nthat the size, composition and working methods of the \nSecurity Council should be improved. In the absence of \naction to implement the reform, the legitimacy of the \nactions of that body will be open to question. Africa\u2019s \ndemand for greater representation in all categories of \nCouncil membership is rooted in the need for justice \nand for an end to its marginalization. It is therefore \nhigh time to stop consigning Africa to the fate of \nsecond-class membership within the United Nations \nthrough its perpetual exclusion from the important \ndecision-making that takes place in the Security \nCouncil. \n For many years, I have called for a greater voice \nfor developing countries in international and financial \neconomic matters, and today I renew that call with a \ndeep sense of urgency. As developing countries, we \nbelieve that the Economic and Social Council should \nbe the leading platform for the discussion and \nformulation of global policies in the economic and \nsocial fields. \n The achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) remains a major priority of my \nGovernment. Through various interventions, policies \nand programmes, we are poised to achieve and even \nsurpass some of the Goals. However, as we run the last \nstretch before 2015, the critical need for greater \ninternational solidarity and partnership cannot be \noveremphasized. I am confident that the Gambia will \nattain all the Goals by 2015, as we are already on \ncourse to do so. \n We should remind ourselves that the United \nNations was created to unify the world, and not to \ndivide it. The Organization should be seen to provide \nthe most potent avenue for allaying fears and restoring \nhopes and aspirations, fighting for the rights of \noppressed and desperate people the world over, and, \nabove all, restraining bullies who seek to skew \ninternational politics, growth and development, most \noften using might and tyranny as weapons. \n International criminal law and its institutions \nhave a crucial role to play in global governance and \nhence the need to avoid selective prosecution and the \npoliticization of court processes. In the world today, \nthere is ample evidence to suggest the existence of the \nwidespread abuse of power, oppression and violation of \nhuman rights through illegitimate wars and other forms \nof excessive intervention. There are times when strong \nnations attack and trample upon the sovereignty of the \nweak, while the United Nations and the world watch \nhelplessly, doing nothing, except for a few who raise \ntheir voices in isolation. \n This will not deter us or discourage us from \nhighlighting the injustices that the International \nCriminal Court is supposed to set right. If that \ninstitution gives way to undue pressure or demonstrates \nweakness, its cracks may undermine the credibility of \nthe international judicial system. \n We know that there are leaders, past and present, \nwho deserve to be dragged into the International \nCriminal Court for prosecution but they go about their \nbusiness as if they were above the law. I ask whether \nthis is acceptable. \n As a consequence of all this, global governance, \nfrom the perspective of the United Nations, has to go \nbeyond political systems aimed at exposing and \nneutralizing the strategies employed to subdue fragile \nStates. Good governance, as the West prefers to refer to \nit, needs to permeate the finance structures \u2014 of the \nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund, for \nexample \u2014 in order to render them more effective in \noffsetting the imbalances created through exploitation, \ncontrol and protectionism. Indeed, these international \nfinancial powerhouses should be transformed into \n \n \n41 10-55128 \n \nconduits for mitigating the effects of \nunderdevelopment and poverty the world over. \n It is lamentable that the assessment criteria for \nproviding assistance to needy people or nations in \ndistress are tied to political affiliations cloaked in \ninexplicable, good governance issues. \n The Security Council has contributed to the \nunfair imposition of sanctions that have direct \nconsequences for the lives of civilians. Such measures, \noften taken to bring down Governments, continue to \nexpose this Organization and the ploys it subtly \nexecutes at the behest of powerful nations. We \ncondemn such sanctions and recommend that thorough \nconsultations and sounder procedures precede any \nsanctions that may have direct, negative impact on \ninnocent lives. \n Similarly, we condemn indiscriminate use of \nbanned weapons with impunity while the Security \nCouncil does nothing to punish the culprits. \nCombatants should legitimately engage enemy \ncombatants, and reckless attacks on defenceless people \nmust not be condoned. \n There are regional structures in almost every \ncorner of the globe. The United Nations must recognize \nthose structures and work closely with them to quell \nunrest wherever it erupts. To illustrate this point, let me \nobserve that the Economic Community of West African \nStates and the African Union (AU) have demonstrated \nability, if adequately supported, to handle unrest on the \nAfrican continent. I wish to call on the United Nations \nto intensify its collaboration with those groupings in \ncrucial State and inter-State interventions. \n The African Union and the subregional \norganizations in Africa have opened up many avenues \nfor cooperation with the United Nations, especially in \nthe area of preventive diplomacy. We would like to see \ngreater support for the activities of the United Nations \nOffice for West Africa. \n It is an open secret that West Africa is suffering \nan onslaught of drug traffickers. We are committed to \nthe fight against illegal narcotics, not only in the \nGambia, but also in the whole of Africa, as illegal \nnarcotics traffickers are holding some West African \nStates hostage. \n The dangers of narcotics transcend boundaries, as \nthey provide a lot of money to dangerous criminals, \nincluding terrorists, who have no regard for human life. \nGiven the enormous challenges that lie ahead of us in \nthis battle, our security forces are alert and ready to \ncooperate with our neighbours and all those who share \nour concerns. We are determined more than ever to turn \nWest Africa into a living hell for terrorists, drug \ntraffickers as well as organized criminal gangs and \nhuman traffickers. This is a battle we must win, and \nwin right. \n Let me turn to the phenomenon of Islamophobia. \nIt is important to note that the message of Islam is \nuniversal peace and progress, love for humanity and \ntotal submission to the will of Allah. History teaches us \nthat Islamic civilization, which has flourished for 1,400 \nyears, has always exhibited its unique capacity for \npeaceful coexistence, tolerance and compassion among \nglobal religions, manifested in the vast expanse of its \ndominions, cutting across parts of Europe, Africa, Asia \nand Eastern Europe, among other regions. \n Islamic teachings condemn terrorism in all its \nmanifestations and view such acts as not only savage \nbut also criminal. Islam regards human life as sacred \nand condemns the killing of innocents. The world, and \nin particular the West, should therefore be wary of the \nactions of a small few, including those who abuse the \nHoly Koran and even threaten to burn it, thereby \nfuelling tensions and insecurity. Their actions \nconstitute manipulations to judge Islam and its \nfollowers in the wrong way. We must not allow bigots, \nracists and evil entities in the West that are \nmasquerading as nationalists and far right elements to \nspread a global war of religion. If this were to happen, \nthe entire human race would suffer. Therefore, Western \nGovernments should do more to stop these real \nterrorists who are on the rampage. \n We maintain that the United Nations should play \na lead role in combating terrorism through means \napproved by the General Assembly. Noting that \nterrorism is a global challenge, no unilateral action \nbased on any form of doctrine should be taken by any \nnation against another, nor must the United Nations \nsuccumb to external pressure from any single nation in \npursuit of national gains or interests. Conversely, we \nsupport the use of multilateral diplomacy and \ncooperation to complement internal measures where a \nparticular nation is the target of terrorism. \n My delegation\u2019s position on the issues raised in \nthis statement is to see to it that the United Nations \nreviews its governance structures in order to become \n  \n \n10-55128 42 \n \nmore democratic. This would require that the \nrepresentation quotas for various regions, particularly \nAfrica and Asia, be redefined on the basis of the \nprinciples of fair play and justice, and not on the basis \nof sheer economic or military might. \n We recommend that the laws and procedures \ngoverning the issue of arrest warrants, prosecution \nprocedures and legal representation at the International \nCriminal Court also be reviewed objectively, in order \nto avoid politicization and the selective targeting of \nindividuals. \n We also urge that all sovereign States that have a \nlegitimate Government based on the will and consent \nof their people be admitted to the United Nations, and \nthis applies in particular to the Republic of China on \nTaiwan. We commend the countries on both sides of \nthe Strait for their continuous progress in pursuing \npeace and shelving disputes over the past two years. \nWhile both States deserve special recognition and more \nencouragement, the United Nations also needs to be \ncognizant of the efforts by Taiwan in this peaceful \nprocess. It is important to note that Taiwan\u2019s invitation \nto participate in the World Health Assembly as an \nobserver in 2009 and 2010 not only enhanced \ninternational health and medical care networks, but \nalso set a positive example for Taiwan\u2019s participation. \nWe therefore urge all Member States to ensure that \nother specialized agencies are opened up to Taiwan\u2019s \nmeaningful participation in the work of the United \nNations. \n Taiwan is contributing immensely to the \ninternational community through trade, investment, air \ntransport, finance, telecommunications technology and \nenvironmental protection in the spirit of international \ncooperation. Therefore, we call upon the United \nNations to find a proper way to accept Taiwan\u2019s \nparticipation in all its specialized agencies, notably the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization and the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange. \n The international community needs to recognize \nthat Taiwan has adopted and pursued a pragmatic, \nmoderate and steady foreign policy, and we therefore \nencourage United Nations specialized agencies to be \nopen-minded with regard to Taiwan\u2019s participation in \ntheir activities. It is our collective responsibility to \nenable the 23 million people of Taiwan to participate \nmore visibly and make them able to function within the \ninternational system. \n The United States embargo against Cuba is one of \nthe longest running political disputes that this \nAssembly has needed to address for almost two \ndecades. It is embarrassing that such a cruel and \noutmoded form of settling scores in international \nrelations is still in place. The embargo has no \nlegitimacy or appeal, and it is time for those that \nimposed it to show genuine leadership by ending it. \n It is worth noting that the development of the \nAfrican Union has shown that African leadership on \nAfrican issues is the key to finding solutions to the \nproblems that continue to plague the continent. From \nclimate change to the undemocratic change of \nGovernments, from peacekeeping to peacemaking, \nfrom development to regional integration, Africa has \nshown that it is ready to chart its destiny with dignity. \nThat is what we are committed to, and all we ask of the \ninternational community is fulfilment of the pledges \nmade to Africa. We are willing to cooperate with those \nthat are willing to do so respecting the dignity of our \ncountries, without humiliating conditionalities. \n The Gambia\u2019s commitment to peace and stability \nacross Africa has been manifested not only in troop \ncontributions, but also in our readiness at all times to \nfind peaceful solutions to conflicts plaguing the \nAfrican continent. We call on the international \ncommunity to lend its full support to the efforts of the \nAfrican Union and the United Nations to consolidate \npeace and stability across the Sudan. \n As for Somalia, we recognize the need to \nempower the Government of Somalia, so that it can \nassert its authority over its territory, achieve lasting \npeace and, thus, address the problem of piracy. \nSupporting one faction against another is not a worthy \nsolution to the Somali problem. \n A major development in the evolution of the \nUnited Nations this year has been the creation of \nUN Women. As a firm believer in gender equality and \nwomen\u2019s empowerment, my Government will do all in \nits power to support that entity. We wish the new board \nwell and urge them to assign centre stage to gender \nissues and policies without politics. \n Finally, we believe that there is no substitute for \nthe United Nations, a body whose role in global \ngovernance we consider critical. The missing link has \n \n \n43 10-55128 \n \nbeen the absence of a global governance framework to \nembrace universality and representation."

        "file_text": "First of all, I would like to offer \ncongratulations on the upcoming sixty-fifth \nanniversary of the United Nations. For an individual \nperson, 65 is an age when life experience turns into \nwisdom. As the great Goethe once said, it is our \nexperience that teaches us to truly appreciate life. \nToday, the United Nations, with its 65 years of \nexperience gained in the noble work for peace and \nprogress, is the most reputable and relevant \ninternational organization there is. Each State Member \nof the United Nations, regardless of its size or power, \nseeks to contribute to building a safer and better world. \n On 29 August 1949, the first atomic explosion on \nthe ancient Kazakh land was carried out near the city \nof Semipalatinsk, unleashing an insane nuclear arms \nrace and inflicting enormous suffering on the people of \nKazakhstan. On 29 August 1991, the President of \nKazakhstan, Mr. Nursultan Nazarbayev, issued a decree \nthat unilaterally shut down, once and for all, one of the \nworld\u2019s largest nuclear test sites. \n It is highly symbolic that 18 years later, the \nGeneral Assembly at its preceding session acted upon \nhis initiative to adopt a resolution establishing \n29 August as the International Day against Nuclear \nTests (resolution 64/35). The unanimous adoption of \nthe resolution has effectively reaffirmed the \ncommitment of the international community to the \nprocess of reducing the nuclear threat. \n The April visit of Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon to Kazakhstan started with a tour of the \nformer Semipalatinsk nuclear test site. Standing right \non the former Ground Zero, he urged the international \ncommunity to redouble its efforts to create a world free \nof nuclear weapons. \n For the people of Kazakhstan, who know only too \nwell all the horrors of nuclear tests, the issue of a total \nban on such tests is particularly relevant. Over the \ncourse of 40 years, some 490 nuclear explosions were \ncarried out at the Semipalatinsk test site, affecting \nmore than half a million people and damaging territory \nas large as today\u2019s Germany. \n Today we call upon States that have not signed or \nratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \n(CTBT) to do so as soon as possible. The entry into \nforce of the CTBT will become one of the key areas of \neffective implementation of the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), an \nimportant instrument forming a foundation for the \nsecurity of all humanity. \n We are satisfied that the States parties to the NPT \nwere able to adopt a final document last May at the \nconclusion of the latest NPT Review Conference. But \nnew and more decisive steps are needed today for \nnuclear disarmament. An early drafting of a Fissile \nMaterial Cut-off Treaty, which along with the CTBT \nshould become an important pillar of the NPT, is one \nsuch step. \n \n \n45 10-55103 \n \n We believe that it is extremely important to \nbegin, as soon as possible, to draft an international \nlegally binding instrument providing security \nassurances by nuclear Powers to non-nuclear-weapon \nStates. Only such assurances can effectively keep in \ncheck the aspirations of certain non-nuclear States to \nacquire nuclear weapons, which they regard as a \nguarantee of their own security. \n The establishment of new zones free from nuclear \nweapons, including in the Middle East, would \nrepresent another step towards achieving the goal of a \nnuclear-free world. We are convinced that a focused \nand progressive move in that direction would \ncontribute to the establishment of trust among \nneighbours in the region and lay the foundations for a \nradical change in the situation of that long-suffering \nregion. \n Addressing the Assembly from this rostrum, I \nwould like to reaffirm the urgency and relevance of the \ninitiative of the President of Kazakhstan, Mr. Nursultan \nNazarbayev, to draft a universal declaration on a \nnuclear-free world, which would reflect the \ncommitment of all States to firmly and consistently \nmove towards a nuclear-weapon-free world. \n We support the legitimate and inalienable right of \neach State party to the NPT to develop nuclear energy \nfor peaceful purposes. However, such activities should \nbe carried out in a transparent manner and on the basis \nof strict compliance with all requirements of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and under \nits control. Kazakhstan, the world\u2019s largest uranium \nproducer, intends to contribute to the development of \nnuclear energy and is ready to host an international \nnuclear fuel bank, under the auspices of the IAEA, and \nto commit itself to its safe storage. \n As 2010 Chairman-in-Office of the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), \nKazakhstan, in the interests of all participating States, \nhas emphasized efforts to shape not a security space \nbut a security community, free of dividing lines and \nzones with different levels of security. \n The promotion of an atmosphere of trust in the \ninterests of all and strengthening consensus on key \nissues in all three dimensions of OSCE activities has \nmade it possible to reach a historic consensus on an \nOSCE summit, to be held on 1 and 2 December 2010 in \nthe capital of Kazakhstan. It will be the first such event \nin the past 11 years. I have no doubt that this upcoming \nAstana summit will become a landmark in the \nprogressive movement of the OSCE participating \nStates towards shaping a truly common and indivisible \nsecurity community in the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian \nzones, based on shared values, principles and \ncommitments. \n In that regard, we view the discussion at this \nOSCE summit of the issue of the stabilization and \nsocial and economic rehabilitation of Afghanistan as an \nimportant contribution to regional and global security. \nTime has proven that a purely military solution to the \nAfghan problem does not exist. Accordingly, \nKazakhstan favours enhanced efforts by the \ninternational community to adapt Afghanistan to post-\nwar development. On the initiative of our head of \nState, an educational programme has begun this year to \ntrain some 1,000 Afghan nationals in the educational \ninstitutions of Kazakhstan for careers in medicine, \nagriculture and construction. We have allocated \n$50 million to that purpose. \n The serious political crisis in Kyrgyzstan, which \ncould have extremely negative consequences not only \nfor Central Asia but also far beyond its borders, has \ndemonstrated the lack of an effective and \ncomprehensive mechanism to prevent such conflicts. \nThat is why the forthcoming OSCE summit provides a \nunique opportunity to develop an appropriate \nmechanism, drawing on the great potential and \nexperience of the OSCE, the United Nations and other \nmultilateral institutions. \n In the context of countering new challenges and \nthreats, primarily terrorism and drug trafficking, we \npay close attention to the implementation of counter-\nterrorism conventions and Security Council \nresolutions, and we support early adoption of a \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \nKazakhstan has actively supported the Global Initiative \nto Combat Nuclear Terrorism. At the initiative of \nPresident Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan put \nforward at the global Nuclear Security Summit in \nWashington, in April 2010, a proposal for a conference \non countering the financing of terrorism. \n That phenomenon is closely linked to drug \ntrafficking, and thus combating that scourge is one of \nour top priorities. Accordingly, Kazakhstan attaches \ngreat importance to the Central Asian Regional \nInformation and Coordination Center (CARICC) for \ncombating illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs, \n  \n \n10-55103 46 \n \npsychotropic substances and their precursors, located \nin Almaty, Kazakhstan. We believe that CARICC can \nand should become a platform for interaction between \nregional anti-drug agencies. \n We also intend to take those issues forward \nwithin the framework of our activities in other \ninternational organizations, including the upcoming \n2011-2012 Kazakhstan chairmanship of the Ministerial \nConference of the Organization of the Islamic \nConference (OIC). One of the universally accepted \nthemes is the promotion of the ideas of tolerance, non-\ndiscrimination, and intercultural and interfaith \ndialogue. At the initiative of the President of \nKazakhstan, Astana has become the venue for a unique \nforum, the Congress of Leaders of World and \nTraditional Religions, recognized today as an effective \nplatform for dialogue to promote ideas of interfaith \npeace and harmony. \n As a sponsor of resolution 62/90, we welcome the \nefforts of Member States, UNESCO and other \ninternational organizations to conduct activities in \nobservance of the International Year for the \nRapprochement of Cultures. \n We commend the work of the Alliance of \nCivilizations and stand ready to continue to actively \ncooperate with it to promote the goals and objectives of \nthe Alliance at the international level. \n Based on its experience, Kazakhstan supports the \nactive use of the capacity of authoritative regional \narrangements, such as the OSCE and the OIC, in \nefforts to overcome nationalism, religious intolerance, \nracism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism, and we intend \nto work for the adoption of concrete decisions within \nthose organizations. We are deeply convinced that \ntoday security cannot be for a single country, region or \ncontinent alone. Therefore Kazakhstan believes that all \nexisting structures of regional and international \nsecurity must coordinate their efforts and cooperate \nactively together. \n In this context, I would like to note with great \nsatisfaction that the first meeting of the Conference on \nInteraction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia \nand the OSCE, which was held in June 2010 in \nIstanbul, has laid the foundation for a future \ntranscontinental security belt. It appears that the level \nof institutional development of the Conference and the \ngrowing interest in its activities on the part of Asian \ncountries will allow us to consider that forum as a \nprototype of a collective security system in Asia. \n Today, the world is slowly but surely emerging \nfrom a severe financial and economic crisis. At this \njuncture, it is critically important to ensure that the \ndevelopment of a post-crisis model of development is \nnot limited to cosmetic measures. Instead, it should \nproduce a qualitative restructuring of the entire system \nof international economic relations. We believe that all \nthe world\u2019s economic problems are rooted in the \ninefficiency of the existing world monetary system, \nwhich no one controls and which is not democratic. \n Kazakhstan\u2019s leader has proposed that a new \nfinancial architecture be developed, with a global \nregulatory system to oversee financial markets at its \ncore. Such a mechanism would allow us to avoid \nspeculative interflows of resources that exist only on \npaper and a situation in which developing countries are \nactually financing consumption in the developed \ncountries. The establishment of a more stable \nmacroeconomic model, in our view, calls for the \nintroduction of a single supranational currency, under \nthe auspices of the United Nations. \n Finding an urgent solution to environmental \nproblems is one of our main responsibilities to future \ngenerations. It is also a prerequisite of preserving life \non Earth. In this context, we have initiated plans for \nholding ministerial conferences for the Economic and \nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific and the \nEconomic Commission for Europe in 2010 or 2011 in \nAstana. The goal of these events is to build a \u201cgreen \nbridge\u201d between Europe and Asia and to harmonize \nprogrammes for sustainable development and \nenvironmental protection. \n We appreciate the assistance provided by the \ninternational community, including the United Nations \nand its specialized agencies and programmes, to our \ncountry\u2019s efforts to overcome the effects of \nenvironmental disasters in the Aral Sea and \nSemipalatinsk regions. Given their global nature, they \ncall for an effective new approach on the part of the \ndonor community to solve these problems. \n Kazakhstan is firmly committed to the \ndemocratization of its society and building a State \nbased on the rule of law. In February this year, our \ncountry successfully passed its first universal periodic \nreview of the Human Rights Council and intends to \nfully implement its recommendations. Reaffirming its \n \n \n47 10-55103 \n \ncommitment to open and constructive cooperation in \nthe area of human rights, Kazakhstan has sent a \nstanding invitation to all mandate holders of the \nCouncil\u2019s special procedures. \n Our country has always been and still remains \nopen to cooperation with the international community \nin the protection and realization of individual rights \nand freedoms. With those values and ideals in mind, \nKazakhstan has put forward its candidature to the \nHuman Rights Council for the 2012-2015 term, which \nwe hope will be supported. \n Over the past 65 years the United Nations has \nmade an enormous contribution to international peace \nand security on the Earth and to the solution of many \nsocial, economic, humanitarian and other problems. It \nis in our common interests that the United Nations \ncontinue to demonstrate leadership in promoting peace \nand cooperation and sustainable progress on Earth. \nKazakhstan not only has consistently supported and \nsupports the activities of the United Nations, but \nalways seeks to contribute to the attainment of the lofty \ngoals set by our respected Organization. \n"

        "file_text": "At the dawn of the new \nmillennium 10 years ago, Tuvalu raised its flag among \nthose of the States Members of the United Nations here \nin New York as a new member of this body. Our \nadmission was a testimony of hope and opportunity for \nour nation\u2019s destiny in the resolve of humankind \nthrough the noble pillars of the United Nations, as \n \n \n35 10-55276 \n \nenshrined in its Charter. I am greatly honoured and \nprivileged to speak before this body on behalf of the \npeople and Government of Tuvalu and to convey of the \nGeneral Assembly our warmest greetings at this session. \n At the outset, we join the high commendations \nexpressed by previous speakers to you, Sir, on your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fifth session, and to your predecessor for his \nleadership and dedication during his presidency of the \nlast session. Let me reassure your Excellency of our \nsupport during your presidency. \n As Tuvalu celebrates its thirty-second anniversary \nof independence later this week, I take this opportunity \nto acknowledge and convey our sincerest thanks and \ngratitude to the international community, especially our \ntraditional development partners and close and new \nfriends, for their continued support and cooperation in \nthe pursuit of our development goals. Without their \ngesture of understanding, friendship and cooperation, \nTuvalu could not have achieved the progress it has \nmade to date. \n We welcome and support the key priority issues \u2014 \nsuch as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \nglobal governance, and the promotion of sustainable \ndevelopment \u2014 that you, Mr. President, clearly \nhighlighted in your opening address to the sixty-fifth \nsession. Last week, the General Assembly convened a \nHigh-level Plenary Meeting on the review of the \nMillennium Development Goals. In the context of \nachieving these Goals, Tuvalu has been reasonably \nsuccessful. Our population does not suffer from \nextreme poverty or hunger. We have very high \nparticipation rates in primary education. The \nparticipation of women in Tuvalu society is prominent, \nalthough representation in Parliament remains an issue. \nProgress in reducing child mortality has been \nsomewhat slow, and access to adequate health care also \nremains an issue. \n During the review of the MDGs, there was one \nvery clear lesson that we learned. This relates to the \nfact that while we have made progress in achieving the \nMDGs, these successes can be easily and very quickly \nreversed by our particular economic and environmental \nvulnerability. \n In the context of economic vulnerability, the \nrecent global financial and economic crises continue to \nhave an enormous adverse effect on Tuvalu\u2019s economy. \nFor a small island economy like Tuvalu\u2019s, which is \nhighly reliant and dependent on the import of products \nfrom overseas, the severe impact and consequences of \nsuch crises also continue to be encountered by our \npeople. One element of that effect was the increased \ncost of importing fossil fuel. The cost of fossil-fuel \ndependency is having a crippling effect on our national \nbudget. We are in desperate need of renewable energy \nand energy-efficiency technologies that are appropriate \nto the unique conditions of Tuvalu. \n Last week, we also undertook a review of the \nMauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of \nthe Barbados Programme of Action. During the \ndiscussions, we proposed three key outcomes. First, we \nneed support to help regulate and police illegal, \nunreported and unregulated fishing. Secondly, we need \nto ensure that our economies are able to recover after \nsevere weather events. This means that we need a \nclimate risk insurance mechanism that can draw on \npublic international finance to underwrite the cost of \npremiums and pay-outs. Thirdly, we are seeking proper \nacknowledgement of small island developing States\u2019 \nconcerns in the United Nations process and their \nrecognition as a discrete group within the United \nNations system. \n Much has been said and well documented on the \nimportance and seriousness of climate change, \nespecially its adverse impact on small island States and \nleast developed countries like Tuvalu. At the recent \nPacific Island Forum meeting, leaders highlighted \nclimate change as the greatest threat to the livelihoods, \nsecurity and well-being of the peoples of the Pacific. \nOur leaders further iterated that unsustainable \ndevelopment and climate change threaten not only the \nlivelihoods of Pacific peoples but also the islands \nthemselves and the cultures they nurture. \n However, despite our high expectations of \nconcrete and timely support from the international \ncommunity, we were deeply concerned and disappointed \nat the outcomes of the Climate Change Conference in \nCopenhagen. We sincerely hope that the forthcoming \nConference of the Parties to be held in Canc\u00fan later \nthis year will lead to concrete results and not shallow \npromises. In view of the slow and painful progress in \nthe ongoing negotiations under the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change process, \ncoupled with the lack of concrete commitments shown \nby key greenhouse gas emitting countries, Tuvalu \nwould like to see three key political commitments \ncome out of the meeting in Canc\u00fan.  \n  \n \n10-55276 36 \n \n First, we would like to see all the amendments \nand rules for the Kyoto Protocol agreed so that such \namendments are ready for ratification to avoid a gap in \nthe commitment periods. Secondly, we should decide \non a mandate to start negotiations on a new, legally \nbinding agreement based on all elements of the Bali \nAction Plan. Thirdly, we should agree on a set of \ndecisions that would provide interim steps to \nimplement measures to be incorporated into the new \nlegally binding agreement. That should be the bare \nminimum we anticipate agreeing upon in Canc\u00fan. For \nTuvalu, addressing climate change in a substantive way \nis fundamental to our sustainable development and \nlivelihood. We cannot allow the next conference in \nCanc\u00fan to be another failure like Copenhagen. \n Despite the fact that Tuvalu is one of the small \nisland developing States and least developed countries \nmost vulnerable to a wide range of global events, as \nalluded to earlier, the United Nations General \nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council have \nnot recognized and taken such vulnerability seriously \ninto consideration when addressing the question of \ngraduation from the least developed country category. \nWe strongly believe that Tuvalu\u2019s economic and \nenvironmental vulnerability cannot be overemphasized \nand totally ignored, especially with the ongoing \nconsequences of climate change and the recent global \ncrisis. In that regard, we continue to call upon the \nUnited Nations and our development partners to \nrecognize our vulnerability as a least developed \ncountry in the review of the criteria and the graduation \nrule for the graduation of least developed countries. \n We could not agree more as to the need and \nimportance for the General Assembly and Security \nCouncil to be revitalized and reformed, respectively, so \nas to enable them to fulfil their mandates and roles in a \nmore transparent, coherent, efficient and timely \nmanner. We fully support the ongoing reform \nprocesses, and we believe that small island developing \nStates should be allocated a seat in the Security Council. \n While we applaud and strongly support the \ncontinuing significant role played by the United \nNations as the major peacekeeping body in the \ninternational community, the efforts and progress made \nby Taiwan in pursuing peace on both sides of the \nStraits needs special recognition and encouragement by \nthe United Nations. In addition, we strongly believe \nthat with its active involvement and contributions to \ninternational trade, investment, air transport, finance, \ntelecommunications technology and environmental \nprotection, Taiwan deserves to participate more fully as \na member of the World Health Organization and other \nUnited Nations specialized agencies such as the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization and the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange. Tuvalu therefore urges the United Nations \nspecialized agencies to accommodate Taiwan\u2019s \nmeaningful participation in their respective systems \nand activities. \n In conclusion, let me reiterate and underscore the \nimportance and seriousness of climate change as a \ncross-cutting issue and its adverse impacts, especially \nthe impact of sea-level rise on a small island \ndeveloping State such as Tuvalu. Although we do \nacknowledge with profound appreciation the \ncommitments and generous pledges offered by the \ninternational community and the establishment of \ninternational trust funds specifically earmarked for \nclimate change, the process of accessing such sources \nof funds, let alone their timely disbursement, is \nextremely difficult and time consuming for small \ncountries such as Tuvalu. Therefore, such \ncommitments without timely actions to deliver \nconcrete results on the ground may well leave small \nand poor countries such as Tuvalu to continue to \nshoulder the burden. May God Bless the United \nNations. "

        "file_text": "Let me start by \ncongratulating Ambassador Deiss on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly. I assure him of \nFinland\u2019s full support for his leadership. \n Climate issues and the recent financial, economic \nand food crises call for change. The world needs an \nunderstanding of global development that is \neconomically, socially and environmentally sustainable. \nBoth developing and developed countries wish for \neconomic growth. But the growth needs to be green, \nequitable and inclusive. It must create jobs and \npromote opportunities for decent work and a better life \nfor everyone. \n Basic social protection is everyone\u2019s right and an \nimportant element of sustainable development. But the \nmost vulnerable need our special attention. We need to \ndo much more to combat discrimination and exclusion. \n Current consumption and production patterns \nneed to be revised in many countries. In the words of \nMahatma Gandhi, there is enough in the world for \neveryone\u2019s need, but there cannot be enough for \neverybody\u2019s greed. Our stocktaking of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) showed that there has \nbeen progress but that it remains uneven. We agreed to \nredouble our efforts. The MDGs must become part of \nour everyday work, and we all need to deliver on our \ncommitments. The Millennium Development Goals are \nreachable by the year 2015. What we want, we can \nreach. \n Our common work with the ecological welfare of \nthe world has continued. Promoting biodiversity is \nvital for sustaining the ecosystems that our lives \ndepend on. Preventing the loss of biodiversity is of \ngreat importance for climate change mitigation, \nensuring food and water security and eradicating \npoverty. The high-level meeting as a contribution to the \n \n \n17 10-54959 \n \nInternational Year of Biodiversity, confirming our \ncommitment to that goal, was a good step forward. \n The impacts of climate change are more and more \nvisible and affect us all around the globe. Today I want \nto focus on the special needs and vulnerabilities of \nsmall island developing States and the implementation \nof the Mauritius Strategy. Climate change is a hard \nreality for them. Mitigating and adapting to its effects \nis crucial for their survival. \n Finland is committed to a new, ambitious climate \nagreement. All of us must work hard to ensure a global \ndeal and commit to building a sustainable future, thus \nresponding to what the Secretary-General so \npertinently calls the 50-50-50 challenge. In order to \nreach our goals, we must mobilize all available \nresources. Cooperation to tackle climate change must \ninvolve States, non-governmental organizations, the \nprivate sector and all of our fellow global citizens.  \n Lasting solutions to global challenges cannot be \nfound without the active participation of women in \ndecision-making at all levels. Women are agents of \nchange and development. Investing in women and girls \nhas a vital effect on the eradication of poverty and \nsustained economic growth. Having heard the \ndiscussions this week, I am happy to conclude that \nthere has clearly been a breakthrough in this respect. I \ncould even call it mainstreaming. This is a good basis \nto continue from. Women and men together can \nachieve truly sustainable development. \n The United Nations has to lead global efforts to \npromote a new blueprint for sustainable growth and \nlow-carbon prosperity. I am honoured to co-chair the \nSecretary-General\u2019s High-level Panel on Global \nSustainability together with my colleague, President \nJacob Zuma of South Africa. We will, I promise, work \nhard. \n All human rights are equally important and must \nbe enjoyed by everyone without discrimination. The \nprotection and promotion of human rights must be an \nintegral part of peacebuilding and crisis management.  \n In combating impunity, justice must always go \nhand in hand with peace efforts. Finland firmly \nsupports the International Criminal Court in its work in \nbringing to justice those responsible for the most \nserious crimes. We call on all States parties to the \nRome Statute to uphold their international legal \nobligations under the Statute. \n The Human Rights Council was created in 2006 \nto promote the respect for human rights, and its \nfunctioning will now be reviewed. To achieve tangible \nresults, the Human Rights Council needs effective \ntools. The independent thematic country-specific \nmandates continue to be vital in order to achieve the \nfull implementation of human rights for all. \n The commitment of all the United Nations \nMember States to strengthen the promotion of women\u2019s \nrights, gender equality and gender mainstreaming is \nwelcome. Finland strongly supports the United Nations \nEntity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of \nWomen (UN Women) and would like to congratulate \nPresident Michelle Bachelet on her appointment. We \nmust ensure that UN Women becomes a strong \nadvocate and actor for women\u2019s rights throughout the \nwork of the United Nations. \n This year marks the tenth anniversary of Security \nCouncil resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace \nand security. Concrete improvements have been made, \nbut we must step up our efforts to further turn the \nobjectives into practice. National action plans are \nvaluable tools for implementing the resolution. Finland \ncompleted its own plan in 2008, and we have now \nstarted a twinning initiative with Kenya. \n We need a comprehensive approach which \nintegrates both long-term development programmes \nand conflict resolution. In our common efforts to \nprevent and resolve conflicts, the contribution of \nregional organizations is valuable. Civil society can \nalso play a role. Finland supports the development of \nthe peace mediation activities of the United Nations. \n After several rounds of proximity talks in the \nMiddle East, the parties started direct talks in \nSeptember. The international community has welcomed \nthis wise decision. We now stand ready to give our \nsupport whenever needed. \nFinland is greatly encouraged by the New START \nagreement and by the outcomes of the Nuclear Security \nSummit, held in Washington, and the Review \nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The world \ncommunity must seize the moment. Global and \nbilateral efforts must be continued towards a world \nwithout nuclear weapons. \n  \n \n10-54959 18 \n \n The United Nations remains the only forum \nwhere we can solve our common problems together. \nTherefore, we must continue to reform our \nOrganization and increase its effectiveness without \nforgetting our own responsibilities as Member States. \nThis is absolutely necessary, because we need to tackle \nthe food crisis, the financial crisis, various kinds of \nnatural disasters, contagious diseases, terrorism and \narmed conflicts in different parts of the world, as well \nas meeting our common challenge of climate change. \n Combating everyday crises and working, at the \nsame time, for sustainable development is a huge task. \nBut no other choice has been given to us. That is why \nwe have to combine our efforts for a better world \u2014 \nand do it now."

May I take this \nopportunity to congratulate you on your election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly\u2019s sixty-fifth \nsession and to pay tribute to your predecessor, His \nExcellency Mr. Treki. \n As I highlighted last year in my address (see \nA/64/PV.10), Fiji and her people, through the Strategic \nFramework for Change, have embarked on a path of \nstructural reform to modernize and liberalize our \neconomy in line with today\u2019s global environment. As \npart of this agenda, the Fiji Government has revamped \nits foreign policy. Our new foreign policy direction \nstems from the philosophical basis that, while we \ndetermine our own destinies as sovereign States, we \nmust at the same time work in collaboration with all \nMember States towards sustainable world peace, \nsubstantive justice, dignity and respect for all. \n However, we cannot achieve these objectives or \nactually implement these noble principles if we simply \nrely on predetermined political influences or \npredetermined alignments. We must be prepared to \nexpand the range of our international relationships and \nnot simply subscribe to bloc voting. We must assess \nand decide each issue on its merits. We must decide \neach matter based on equality, substantive justice and \ninternational law. We must keep an open mind. This \n  \n \n10-55122 22 \n \napproach will result in the manifestation of a fairer and \nmore just system for all Fiji\u2019s citizens. \n This significant shift in foreign policy direction \nheralds Fiji\u2019s globalization and maturity and \ndemonstrates Fiji\u2019s intention to become a good and \nengaged global citizen. Accordingly, over the past year \nFiji has formalized diplomatic relations with many \ncountries with which no ties previously existed. In \naddition, Fiji has sought membership of the \nNon-Aligned Movement. The broadening of our \nengagement with the rest of the world was given \nfurther impetus in Abu Dhabi in June, when, at the \nArab League\u2019s invitation, a summit was held between \nthe Pacific small island developing States and the \nmember countries of the League which was hosted by \nthe United Arab Emirates. \n This commitment to be a good global citizen is \nfurther expressed through Fiji\u2019s ongoing engagement \nwith the United Nations and its associated agencies and \nsecretariats. There is no better example of this \nengagement than Fiji\u2019s long-term contribution to the \ncause of United Nations peacekeeping and \npeacebuilding. Fijian servicemen and women currently \nserve in peacekeeping missions in Iraq, southern \nSudan, Liberia, Darfur and Timor-Leste. I offer my \ncountry\u2019s tribute to the selfless service given by United \nNations peacekeepers and peacebuilders, past and \npresent, in the troubled regions of our world. We pay \nspecial tribute to those who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice to the cause of peacekeeping. \n On the subject of peace and security, Fiji is proud \nto have been among the Member States that in 2006 \nvoted in favour of preparations for a robust and legally \nbinding arms trade treaty in 2012. We remain \ncommitted to the work of the United Nations to curb \nthe illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. Fiji \nhas ratified the Convention on Cluster Munitions and \nregards this instrument as a welcome development for \nhumanitarianism and international disarmament. It also \nremains fully committed to international efforts against \nterrorism. \n With respect to resolving the world\u2019s territorial \nand sovereignty disputes, Fiji stands firm with all \ninternational efforts aimed at peaceful resolution \nthrough a process of genuine dialogue. It welcomes the \nrecent resumption of direct negotiations between the \nleaders of Israel and Palestine and hopes for a \nsuccessful outcome. \n Fiji is an active member of the Special Political \nand Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee). \nFollowing our participation in the ministerial mission \nof the Melanesian Spearhead Group to New Caledonia \nthis year, Fiji sponsored the Fourth Committee\u2019s 2010 \nresolution on New Caledonia. We urge all concerned \nparties to accelerate the progress of the provisions of \nthe Noum\u00e9a Accord. \n Over the past year, the Fiji Government has \nimplemented a number of legal changes that have not \nonly modernized our laws and brought about gender \nand social parity, but have also ensured compliance \nwith international conventions. These changes include \nthe Crimes Decree, which eliminated the archaic rules \nin respect of rape trials. We have implemented for the \nfirst time a comprehensive law against domestic \nviolence to comply with our international obligation to \nprotect the welfare of women and children. We now \nhave child welfare laws which require the reporting of \nviolence against children or suspicion of abuse of \nminors. These and other new laws assist in our \ncompliance with the Rome Statute by recognizing \ncrimes against humanity and incorporating them into \nour domestic laws. Fiji was also present in June at the \nReview Conference of the Rome Statute held in \nUganda and is of course supportive of the work of the \nInternational Criminal Court. Reforms in our laws and \noutlook have helped us comply with the Convention on \nthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against \nWomen and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. \nThey also support our efforts to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n I would like to reaffirm the critical points made at \nlast week\u2019s MDG Summit and at the high-level review \nof the Mauritius Strategy for the Further \nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the \nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \nStates. I make these points as one of the United \nNations Members classified as a small island \ndeveloping State. In spite of their considerable \ndomestic efforts in cooperation with the international \ncommunity, the small island developing States (SIDS) \nhave had very mixed results in achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals. Going forward, we \nand our development partners must examine where \ngains have been made and where efforts have been \nunsuccessful and identify country-specific priorities in \norder to achieve the MDGs. \n \n \n23 10-55122 \n \n The threat of climate change, particularly sea-\nlevel rise, continues to hang over us all. While some of \nus are more vulnerable than others, we must work in \nconcert as a responsible international family to \nmitigate the adverse effects of this global phenomenon. \nIn this context, I reiterate the common call of the small \nisland developing States: that the promised fast-track \nfunding from the international community to finance \nclimate change adaptation and mitigation measures be \ndelivered without delay. \n Through the Pacific small island developing \nStates, Fiji pledges to assist in securing increased \nrepresentation of the Pacific island countries in the \nUnited Nations system. The aim is to also increase \nemployment of Pacific Island nationals within the \nUnited Nations Secretariat and its affiliated bodies. \n Here, I should add that Fiji is playing a prominent \nrole in the International Telecommunication Union \n(ITU). I note that only a few days ago the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, accepted a report on \ndigitalization, including accessibility to broadband. In \nthis area Fiji has also embarked on its own initiative \nfor accessibility to and improvement in, \ntelecommunications and information technology. This \nincludes the process of finalizing a national policy on \nbroadband and spectrum management. We therefore \nappreciate the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative in this \nrespect and urge him to carefully consider the report \nand provide impetus at the global level through the \nUnited Nations. Improved technology and e-access will \nprovide that trajectory in meeting the MDGs and \nimproving the lives of all our peoples. \n As one of the founding signatories of the United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Fiji has \nkept its oceanic obligations at the core of its foreign \npolicy. Fiji therefore follows, and also expects fellow \nMember States to adhere to, the legal regime of the \nexclusive economic zone that encompasses sovereign \nrights. \n Since it is the Year of Biodiversity, we call on the \nInternational Seabed Authority to be vigilant in \nsafeguarding the environmental integrity of the world\u2019s \nseabed. Within this context, one of the great challenges \nfor Pacific small island developing States is to be \neffective in conserving the Pacific Ocean\u2019s fish stocks. \nThey are critical to our livelihoods, our economies. \nCountries that overexploit these fish stocks must be \ninformed that the practice is unsustainable. As owners, \ninvestors and harvesters, we should follow and adhere \nto international law and chart a path to sustain stocks \nfor the benefit of all. \n What I say today is that we must recognize that \nmeaningful dialogue is essential \u2014 within our \nrespective countries, within our respective regions and \nin the world as a whole. Seeking to achieve resolutions \nand solutions through dialogue is the way forward. In \nthe true spirit of international cooperation, we must at \nall times, as sovereign States in our community of \nnations, develop and maintain relationships based on \nrespect, dignity and equality. We must also decide on \nissues and matters before this august Assembly based \non merit, justice and international law. \n Once again, I congratulate you, Mr. President, on \nyour election and offer my best wishes for a productive \nsixty-fifth session of the General Assembly."

        "file_text": "Let me \nbegin by congratulating you, Sir, on your well-deserved \nelection to preside over the sixty-fifth session of the \nGeneral Assembly. I assure you of Tanzania\u2019s full \nsupport and cooperation. I also thank and congratulate \nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdussalam Treki, \nfor his leadership and accomplishments. \n Having just concluded a successful summit on the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), I would like \nto congratulate the Secretary-General, His Excellency \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his leadership, dedication and \ncommitment to the work of the Organization and for \nthe new momentum that he is bringing towards the \nachievement of the MDGs. Once again, we welcome \nhis Global Strategy for Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Health \nand urge the international community to render the \nnecessary support for its implementation. \n We emphasize the importance of national \nleadership and global partnership in meeting the \nMDGs. Tanzania will do its part. We call on all \npartners to do their part, as stipulated under MDG 8. \nOne such successful partnership is the collective efforts \nof the African leadership through the African Leaders \nMalaria Alliance (ALMA), chaired by His Excellency \nMr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the United \nRepublic of Tanzania. Our focus within ALMA is on \nensuring that we attain the 2010 targets for universal \ncoverage of appropriate malaria prevention, diagnosis \nand treatment interventions. We are confident that, if \nthe requested support is realized, we can attain that \ntarget. For that reason, we ask for the full and timely \nreplenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \nTuberculosis and Malaria. \n We all know that the Millennium Development \nGoals will not be attained without sustained economic \ngrowth and sustainable development. For Tanzania, \nwhere the vast majority of the people depend on \nagriculture for their incomes and livelihoods, poverty \ncannot be alleviated without addressing the challenges \nof production, productivity and markets in the \nagricultural sector. \n Recognizing that, Tanzania has developed a \nprogramme known as Kilimo Kwanza, which translates \nas \u201cAgriculture First\u201d, aimed at transforming and \nmodernizing the agricultural sector. A key component \nof the programme is the improvement of infrastructure, \nespecially irrigation systems, transport and energy. \nHowever, the major challenge for us remains how to \nfinance the huge investment gap in infrastructure. That \ngap cannot be filled by the public sector alone. For that \nreason, the participation of the private sector is \nimperative. \n Tanzania has undertaken a number of reforms to \ncreate an environment conducive to private sector \ninvestment. We have created the requisite legal, \nregulatory and institutional framework to attract both \nlocal and foreign private investment in infrastructure \ndevelopment. We now have a public-private \npartnership policy in place, and Parliament enacted a \nbill on such partnerships in June. \n Through a presidential circular, Tanzania also \nestablished the Tanzania National Business Council as \nan institution to provide a forum for public-private \nsector dialogue. The Business Council brings together \npublic and private sectors with a view to reaching \nconsensus and mutual understanding on strategic issues \nrelating to the efficient management of resources in the \npromotion of socio-economic development in \nTanzania. The Council\u2019s Chairperson is the President \nof the United Republic of Tanzania. \n  \n \n10-55122 10 \n \n The Government of the United Republic of \nTanzania would like to reaffirm its commitment to \ndemocratic good governance, the rule of law and \nrespect for human rights. The recent peaceful \nreferendum in Zanzibar produced a new political \ndispensation that provides for a Government of \nnational unity whichever party wins the elections. That \nshould now stabilize Zanzibar and strengthen the \ndemocratic ideals that we all aspire to as Tanzania \nprepares for its general elections, scheduled for \n31 October. As in previous elections, we will do \neverything in our power to ensure that these are \npeaceful, free and fair. We thank all partners that, \nbilaterally or through the United Nations system, are \nstrengthening our capacity to realize that goal. \n Tanzania is pleased that Africa has continued to \nplay a leading role in conflict prevention, management \nand resolution, as well as in entrenching principles of \ngood governance. Increasingly, more and more African \ncountries are holding free, fair and peaceful elections, \nfollowed by smooth transitions. The peaceful \nreferendum in Kenya that paved the way for a new \nConstitution demonstrates the will of African countries \nto take charge of their own destinies. That is a matter \nof great satisfaction to us, and we commend the people \nand leadership of Kenya for that important \nachievement. \n We thank and commend all who continue to work \nhard for a political solution to the situation in Darfur \nthat will lead to durable peace and address the \nhumanitarian situation. We are concerned about \nperiodic eruptions of violence, and we call on all sides \nin Darfur to join the peace process. In the meantime, \nwe commend the African Union-United Nations Hybrid \nOperation in Darfur (UNAMID) for the good work that \nit continues to do under very difficult conditions. We \ntherefore urge the international community to give \nUNAMID all the support that it needs. \n We note the preparations and progress towards \nthe holding of a referendum in Southern Sudan early \nnext year. We call on all parties to do everything in \ntheir power to keep to the timetable for that \nreferendum. The referendum must be peaceful, free and \nfair, and the wishes of the people of Southern Sudan \nmust be respected. We commend the Secretary-General \nfor his initiatives to facilitate that process, including \nhis decision to appoint a panel of eminent persons, \nheaded by His Excellency Mr. Benjamin Mkapa, the \nformer President of the United Republic of Tanzania, to \nmonitor the process. We pledge Tanzania\u2019s full support \nto Mr. Mkapa and his team for the successful \naccomplishment of the task ahead of them. We urge all \nparties to cooperate with the team, and we call upon \nthe international community to provide the requisite \nsupport for the successful holding of the referendum \nand the peaceful management of its outcome. \n Tanzania will continue to play its role in ensuring \nlasting peace and stability in Africa and elsewhere. \nThat includes contributing to United Nations \npeacekeeping operations and missions in Africa and \nelsewhere, including those we have deployed in Darfur \nand Lebanon. \n We are concerned about the worsening political, \nhumanitarian, social and security situation in Somalia, \nwhich threatens the whole region and, ultimately, the \nworld. Recently, we witnessed terrorist bombings in \nUganda by the group Al-Shabaab, which caused the \nloss of many innocent lives and the destruction of \nproperty. Having been victim to similar attacks in  \nDar es Salaam in 1998, Tanzania condemns that \nbarbaric attack in the strongest terms and expresses \nsolidarity with and support for Uganda and other \nneighbours in tracking down and prosecuting those \ninvolved. \n We highly commend Uganda and Burundi for \ncontributing peacekeeping troops in Somalia under the \nAfrican Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM). We \nfurther thank all those African countries that have \ncommitted to providing additional troops to AMISOM. \nWe ask the international community to provide the \nsupport needed to make that deployment possible and \ntimely. However, the problem of Somalia cannot be left \nto Africans alone. In that regard, the Security Council \nmust be more engaged and supportive in finding a \nlasting solution to Somalia. \n Tanzania is concerned about the continued \nincrease in piracy activities in the Gulf of Aden and the \nIndian Ocean, which are now spreading beyond the \ncoast of Somalia. The piracy issue cannot be resolved \non the seas alone or without addressing the causal \nfactors on land. A coordinated, coherent, \ncomprehensive and integrated response that includes \npolitical, military, financial and legal support is \nneeded. The United Nations and the international \ncommunity should work closely with the African \nUnion, members of the Intergovernmental Authority on \nDevelopment and other neighbouring States to \n \n \n11 10-55122 \n \nsuppress acts of piracy, as well as to apprehend and \nprosecute those who commit that crime. \n In the United Republic of Tanzania, we recently \namended the criminal code to allow our courts to \nprosecute suspected pirates under universal \njurisdiction. We call on the international community to \nenhance the prosecution and custodial capacities of \ncountries, such as ours, that apprehend and prosecute \npirates. The international community must also agree \nto share post-prosecution custodial responsibilities \nwith the affected States. Tanzania has also offered to \ntrain 1,000 Somali soldiers in Tanzania in the firm \nbelief that, in the final analysis, peace and security in \nSomalia lie in the hands of the Somalis themselves. \n Over the years, Tanzania has been a home for \nmany refugees. The current stability in our \nneighbouring countries has enabled voluntary \nrepatriation of many refugees, in addition to those who \nhave been naturalized. As a result, the population of \nrefugees in Tanzania declined from 1.2 million in 1994 \nto 108,426 by 31 July this year. This has enabled the \nclosure of 12 refugee camps. \n Tanzania has also continued its tradition since \nindependence of granting citizenship to refugees who \nhave been in our country for many years. In April this \nyear, we naturalized 162,254 refugees who entered the \ncountry in 1972. The Government is now in the process \nof integrating these naturalized persons into Tanzanian \nsociety. \n This, however, is a costly exercise. It is estimated \nthat the naturalization and local integration programme \nwill cost over $146 million. This is a huge burden to a \npoor country like Tanzania. We call upon the \ninternational community to support this integration \nprogramme under the principle of equitable \nresponsibility and burden-sharing. \n We join others in welcoming the adoption of \nresolution 64/289 on system-wide coherence, which, \namong other things, established UN Women. It is our \nhope that UN Women will receive the required support \nfrom the international community and the entire United \nNations system to deliver on its mandate. Tanzania \ncongratulates Ms. Michelle Bachelet on her \nappointment to head UN Women and assures her of \nTanzania\u2019s unwavering support as she discharges her \nduties. \n Tanzania\u2019s experience as a pilot country in the \ndelivering as one reform initiative has convinced us \nthat this, indeed, was a good decision and has \nstrengthened national ownership and leadership. I am \npleased that Tanzania will, in January 2011, be the first \ncountry to present a common country programme. \n Tanzania fully supports the priorities that you, \nSir, have set for the sixty-fifth session of the General \nAssembly. Inclusive and democratic governance is as \nimportant at the national level as it is at the global \nlevel. It has, sadly, taken too long to give this issue the \npriority it deserves at all levels. We believe that the \ninclusive global governance agenda will ensure \naccountability and equitable participation in \ninternational trade and financial institutions, and open \ndoors for fair and equitable participation of developing \ncountries in the World Trade Organization, the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank. \n Tanzania emphasizes and reaffirms the \ninclusiveness of the General Assembly as opposed to \nthe Security Council. We thus call upon all Member \nStates to press for the expeditious reform of the \nSecurity Council. Africa has the largest number of \nMember States. It cannot continue to be denied fair \nrepresentation in that important organ of the United \nNations. We urge all Member States to support Africa \nin its rightful pursuit of permanent representation on \nthe Security Council. \n In this regard, Tanzania reiterates the decision of \nthe African Union, as contained in the Ezulwini \nConsensus, which demands not less than two \npermanent seats with all the prerogatives and privileges \nof permanent membership, including the right of veto, \nas well as five non-permanent seats. \n On the issues of the Middle East and Western \nSahara, let me reiterate what His Excellency President \nJakaya Mrisho Kikwete said during the sixth-fourth \nsession of the General Assembly in 2009 (see \nA/64/PV.6). Tanzania supports a two-State solution \nwhereby Israel and Palestine would live together side \nby side and at peace with each other. Tanzania strongly \nmaintains that this is the best way to sustainable peace \nin the Middle East. \n Regarding Western Sahara, the President also \ncalled upon the Security Council to expedite the \nprocess of giving the people of Western Sahara the \nopportunity to decide their future status. This matter \n  \n \n10-55122 12 \n \nhas dragged on since 1975 \u2014 in other words, for too \nlong. The time has come to end the impasse. \n Let me conclude by once again reaffirming \nTanzania\u2019s belief and confidence in the United Nations \nas the Organization and forum for global governance \nand the pursuit of the letter and spirit of its Charter: a \nworld free from wars and dehumanizing poverty; a \nworld of sustainable economic and social progress, as \nwell as freedom, human rights and justice for all. We \nreaffirm our commitment to doing our part in pursuit of \nthat world."

        "file_text": "First \nof all, let me join other delegations in offering \ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss on \nhis election to the post of President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session. With your guidance, \nSir, my delegation is confident that we can discuss, in \nthe spirit of cooperation, the different global challenges \nconfronting us in order to further the common good of \nhumankind. \n We are meeting at a time when the world is going \nthrough some mixed developments. While, on some \nparts of the globe, countries are experiencing relative \npeace, in other parts they are embroiled in armed \nconflict. While some countries are enjoying economic \ngrowth and budget surpluses, others are experiencing \neconomic stagnation or contraction. \n The focus at this session of the General Assembly \non reviewing the progress on the implementation of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) is most \nappropriate. The achievement of the eight cross-cutting \nGoals we set for ourselves would improve the quality \nof life of all of our peoples. Just last week, we \nconcluded a stocktaking of the progress in the \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals. \nWhile the results on the scorecard are mixed, the \ncommitment of Member States to continuing to \nimplement measures to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals by 2015 is unequivocal. \n Papua New Guinea, like many developing \ncountries, has had measured success. As many noted \nlast week, the global economic crisis has had an \nadverse bearing on the implementation of the MDGs. I \nwould add, however, that had the resources promised in \n2000 for implementing the MDGs been made available, \nthe assessment sheet for many developing countries \nwould have looked more positive. Papua New Guinea \napplauds the commitment of $40 billion for poverty \nalleviation, especially to improve the health of children \nand women. It is our hope that this will be a new \nresource envelope and not repackaged old \ncommitments. \n We have noted the calls for countries to take \ngreater ownership of the implementation of the eight \nMillennium Development Goals. Papua New Guinea \nhas accepted these challenges. We will continue to do \n  \n \n10-55128 2 \n \nall we can to meet the obligations we assumed when \nwe joined others in 2000 to adopt the Millennium \nDeclaration (resolution 55/2).  \n The Permanent Representative of Papua New \nGuinea to the United Nations outlined in detail last \nweek our country\u2019s efforts to achieve the MDGs by \n2015. Allow me to reiterate some of the main actions \nwe are taking. Papua New Guinea has adapted and \nlocalized the MDGs by establishing 15 targets and 67 \nindicators within our medium-term development \nstrategy for the period 2005 to 2010. We have \ncalibrated our 2011-2015 medium-term development \nplan and designed our development strategic plan to \nachieve the MDGs. In addition, we have drafted our \n2050 Vision Statement to be consistent with the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n Our official development assistance programmes \nwith our donor partners are being gradually realigned \nto enable Papua New Guinea to eventually meet its \nMDG targets. On a wider scale, we urge donor partners \nto abide by the principles of the Paris Declaration on \nAid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action. In \nthe Pacific, we have adopted the Cairns Compact to \nbetter coordinate development assistance and to ensure \neffective delivery. Developed countries also need to \nraise their official development assistance to 0.7 per \ncent of their gross national income, in line with their \ncommitments. \n In line with our commitment towards MDG 3, my \nGovernment has submitted proposed legislation to the \nPapua New Guinea legislature to reserve 22 seats for \nwomen in the national Parliament. With respect to \nMDG 2, we have introduced a universal primary \neducation policy and aim to achieve free primary-level \neducation for all of our children by 2015. \n Papua New Guinea is under no illusion that the \nachievement of the MDGs is a unilateral undertaking. \nThis is a joint undertaking between developed and \ndeveloping countries, just as it is a cooperative effort \nbetween the Government and civil society \norganizations. It is for this reason that my country is \ndisappointed that MDG 8 on a global partnership for \ndevelopment appears to attract little serious interest \nfrom the developed countries. We note that the real \nvalue of aid has remained constant and that the Doha \nDevelopment Round remains an unfinished affair. \n Also of concern to us is the inability of many \ndeveloping countries to enjoy equitable treatment from \nthe Bretton Woods institutions. Our efforts to reduce \ndeforestation in tropical rain forest countries, which I \nwill touch on later, have met with the same apathetic \nresponse. Despite the best of efforts within the World \nTrade Organization and Asia Pacific Economic \nCooperation forum processes, the international trading \nenvironment continues to be characterized by \ninequalities. Often less visibly but still harmfully, \nglobal trade continues to be encumbered by trade \nprotectionist measures. \n In the area of international peace and security, the \nworld, unfortunately, is no safer today than it was when \nthe United Nations was established. War continues to \nbe waged in Afghanistan. Iraq continues to suffer from \nregular suicide bombings. The Korean peninsula \ncontinues to be a flashpoint in the Asia region, and the \nMiddle East continues to be a hotbed of tension. \n Likewise, regional conflicts and ethnic tensions \ncontinue to erupt in many parts of Africa, Latin \nAmerica and Eastern Europe. The international \ncommunity needs to do more to address these conflicts, \nespecially the Afghanistan and Iraq issues. The fragile \npeace and global security environment is further \nexemplified by the continued presence of Blue Helmets \nin many parts of world. \n Papua New Guinea commends the efforts of \nUnited Nations peacekeeping forces, many of which \nhave to operate in very trying circumstances. We wish \nto thank the troop-contributing countries for bearing \nthis onerous responsibility on all our behalves. For our \npart, I am pleased to announce that my Government \nhas enacted the International Obligations Bill to \nprovide the legal framework for Papua New Guinea\u2019s \nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping \noperations. \n Acts of terrorism continue and the threat of \nanother terror attack on a scale similar to that of 9/11 \nremains real. The international community must \ncontinue to strengthen its cooperation to address this \nscourge. \n Nuclear weapons continue to cause anxiety in our \nsecurity considerations. While some may argue that \nnuclear weapons are the reason why the world has not \nfought another world war, my Government believes \nthat these weapons of mass destruction are unnecessary \nand need to be eliminated. As part of that process, we \nsupport efforts to strengthen the mechanisms aimed at \nthe non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. \n \n \n3 10-55128 \n \n As for other countries of the Pacific region, \nclimate change is of great concern to Papua New \nGuinea. We need no scientist to tell us of the negative \nimpact of climate change. We live it and we suffer \nfrom it. Many of our islands, such as the Carterets, and \ncoastal habitats like my own home area of the Murik \nLakes are being gradually submerged by rising sea \nlevels. The result is that people living in these areas are \nbecoming environmental refugees. Lowland diseases \nsuch as malaria are now occurring in the highlands of \nPapua New Guinea. Unusual weather patterns, such as \nincreased incidences of cyclones, frequent heavy \nflooding and mudslides, are causing havoc in our \neconomies and exacting untold suffering on our people. \n All these attendant climate change challenges are \ntaxing the budgetary resources of our countries and \nundermining our development plans. The international \ncommunity has rightly recognized the insidious effects \nof climate change and agreed to take concerted action \nunder the ambit of the Kyoto Protocol, the Bali Road \nMap and the Copenhagen Accord to address the issue. \n Papua New Guinea urges our developed partners \nto shoulder greater responsibility for reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions and for assisting developing \ncountries, particularly small island States, to adapt to \nclimate change and its effects. \n Resources for adaptation and mitigation \nmeasures, particularly those committed in Copenhagen, \nmust be made more readily available to developing \ncountries. We note the initiative announced by Japan \nlast week during the MDG review and look forward to \nfurther details of what it constitutes. We also applaud \nthe financial commitments and policy initiatives that \nChina announced to assist developing countries to \nimplement the Millennium Development Goals. As for Papua New Guinea, with our colleagues \nfrom the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, we have \ncommitted ourselves to a programme of reducing \nemissions from deforestation and forest degradation, \nmore commonly known as REDD-plus. As this is the \nInternational Year of Biodiversity, let me say that the \nREDD-plus initiative will assure the protection of \nimportant biodiversity. \n In addition, at the national level Papua New \nGuinea has adopted an action plan for climate-\ncompatible development and established the Office of \nClimate Change and Development explicitly to oversee \nour actions on climate change issues. As part of our \nstrategy to reduce our carbon footprint, we are now \naggressively seeking to develop more hydropower and \ngeothermal sources for our energy requirements. We \nhave also embarked on a major commercialization \nexercise of our gas reserves to deliver a cleaner energy \nalternative to the world. \n Many of us here have recognized the need to \nreform the United Nations in order to take account of \nthe changed circumstances under which it operates, as \nwell as the new and emerging challenges that it must \naddress. We note and commend the Secretary-General \nfor the ongoing administrative and institutional reforms \nhe is undertaking to improve the efficiency of the \nUnited Nations in better serving Member States. We \nurge all stakeholders in the Security Council reform \nagenda to demonstrate courage and leadership so that \nthe composition and workings of the Council can be \nreformed in ways that are equitable and reflect the \ncurrent geopolitical and economic realities. \n Papua New Guinea has previously stated at this \nAssembly that we believe that the expansion of the \nmembership of the Security Council is logical to allow \nfor representation from certain developed and \ndeveloping countries. In that regard, I wish to reaffirm \nPapua New Guinea\u2019s support for Germany and Japan to \nbe included as permanent members in an expanded \nSecurity Council. \n Finally, the inequities that exist in the global \ntrading system today are daunting, but they can be \nresolved. With genuine partnership, we can and shall \novercome them. The world may not be any safer today \nthan it was when the United Nations was established \nsome 65 years ago, but having been able to avert \nanother world war is ample testimony that the \ninternational community has the political will to \naddress tensions and discord in a measured way. The \nUnited Nations and the international legal architecture \nthat it has achieved, developed and promoted have \nplayed a significant role in that regard, thus \nunderscoring the continuing relevance of this body.

        "file_text": "In the name of the Nicaraguan people and of \nComrade President Commander Daniel Ortega \nSaavedra, I convey my warmest brotherly greetings to \nyou, Sir, and to each and every one of the peoples and \nGovernments represented in the General Assembly. \n As the shadows of apocalyptic threats darken the \nworld stage, we begin to doubt the capacity for reason \nand the strength of the most noble sentiments of human \nbeings to face up to the serious problems confronting \nhumanity. Various types of information are \nmanipulated by the global communications media in \norder to continually discredit the independence efforts \nof the Governments of the South. They disseminate the \nidea that humanity is impotent in the face of the \npresent state of disaster and that we must prepare for \nthe worst. Furthermore, what is worse is that they tell \nus that no one is responsible and that it is a faceless \ndisaster, seeking thus to exonerate the industrialized \ncountries of the North. \n However, we know full well that the underlying \ncause of the serious crises we are experiencing is the \nnature of the system of economic, political and social \nrelations established by global capitalism and the effort \nto have that system accepted as a universal paradigm. \n In this regard, the poor countries, which are \nreferred to by the euphemism \u201cdeveloping countries\u201d, \ncan strip away the masks of those who \u2014 driven by \ngreed, selfishness and the desire for absolute power in \nthe name of manifest destiny or of divine reason \u2014 \nhave brought humankind to the brink of extinction. \n Nicaragua, which has experienced the pain and \ninjustice of war first-hand, is against war. We do not \naccept the failure of reason. We do not accept war as \nthe obligatory language among peoples. Nicaragua \nrejects war as a solution to conflicts between States. \nWe reject war as a means for appropriating the planet\u2019s \nnatural resources or for imposing the hegemony of a \nfew over the majority of the world\u2019s nations. War will \nnever lead to solutions partial or full, much less \ndefinitive. The invasion of Iraq by foreign troops under \nfalse pretexts has brought neither peace nor stability to \nthat country. On the contrary, it has left that country in \nruins and failed to bring greater stability to the region. \n The war in Afghanistan has become a dead end \nfor the occupiers. At the same time, it has also had \nnegative effects on its neighbours. Security Council \nresolution 1929 (2010), which imposes new sanctions \non the Islamic Republic of Iran, has only served to \nincrease the possibility of a large-scale military \nconflict with unforeseeable consequences. The war \ngames on the Korean peninsula increase tensions in \nthat region, jeopardizing the gains achieved between \nthe two Koreas. Neither Europe nor the Persian Gulf \nhas escaped the expanding zone of militarization. \nSimilarly, the establishment of military bases and the \ndeployment of naval and air power on Latin American \nsoil threaten the political stability of our nations. \n \u201cAmong individuals, as among nations, respect \nfor the rights of others is peace\u201d. This saying of Benito \nJu\u00e1rez, President of Mexico and the first indigenous \npresident in the Americas, clearly reflects the \nconception of and will for peace among the peoples of \nthe world. This apothegm should guide our \nOrganization, and in particular the Security Council, \nensuring that their actions adhere strictly to the \npurposes and principles of the United Nations. \n Moreover, Nicaragua believes that there is a close \nrelation between disarmament and development. Our \ncommitment to security includes a commitment to the \npromotion of human rights, which we interpret as \n  \n \n10-55128 30 \n \ntantamount to sustainable development centred on the \nhuman being and implemented in an environment of \ngood governance with direct citizen participation and \nsocial equality, which are indispensable to real \ndevelopment. \n From our point of view, the resources freed up as \na result of disarmament efforts should be directed to \nensuring the attainment of the national social \ndevelopment goals of each of our countries. One only \nhas to take a brief glance at the trillions of dollars \nspent on war to realize how many human problems \ncould be solved with these funds, alleviating the pain \ncaused by poverty and exclusion. The global economic \nand financial crisis has had little or no effect on global \nmilitary spending. \n Nicaragua remains actively committed to the \ncause of general and complete disarmament. Nicaragua \nbelieves that only a climate of fundamental trust and \nsolidarity can guarantee strict compliance with arms \ncontrol and disarmament accords with a view to \nattaining complete disarmament \u2014 and especially \nnuclear disarmament \u2014 as the only option for \nachieving real and lasting world peace. Nicaragua \nsupports the inalienable right of the parties to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to \nuse nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and without \ndiscrimination. Nicaragua encourages actions to \npromote the exchange of material resources, equipment \nand technology for the peaceful use of nuclear energy \nin order to guarantee the sustainable economic \ndevelopment of every nation and the world. \n Precisely because of this belief, Nicaragua \ndemands that neither Iran nor any other nation be taken \nto task for developing nuclear programmes for peaceful \npurposes. It is possible to build trust based on dialogue \nand negotiation. In this context, Nicaragua joins the \ngeneral support expressed for the tripartite declaration \nof Brazil, Turkey and Iran, which constitutes an \nalternative for promoting regional and world peace. \n That which was a warning yesterday is today a \nreality. The present international context is leading to a \nglobal political crisis. The entire political model \nconstructed and articulated around the paradigm of \nneo-liberalism, globalization and the free market is in \nquestion. At the global level, we need more decisive \naction to affirm multilateralism as the new paradigm. \nSuch multilateralism must listen to the voices of \npeoples living in extreme poverty and \nunderdevelopment. It must take the new political \nrealities into account and effectively democratize the \nworld order, beginning with this Organization, \nincluding the Security Council and the United Nations \nas a whole; re-establish the representational and \ndemocratic rights of its 192 Member States; and \nidentify the rights and obligations that are common to \nall States without undermining their sovereignty, \nindependence and self-determination, regardless of \ntheir size. \n In Latin America and the Caribbean, this trend is \nmanifest in the process of integration and unity taking \nplace among our peoples. We have already made the \nhistoric decision to create the Latin American and \nCaribbean Community of States, whose \ninstitutionalization will begin next year and conclude \nin 2012. This is further and unquestionable proof of the \nprofound changes taking place in the world. \n The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our \nAmerica has become the vanguard of this process of \nchange. The struggle against intervention of all kinds, \nincluding military intervention, and for the \nmaintenance and re-establishment of peace is an \nessential component of the Alliance\u2019s action in its \nrelations with the world, and strengthens its capacity to \nguarantee the national sovereignty of its peoples. \n Nicaragua joins the brotherly people of Puerto \nRico in waving the flag of its independence which has \nbeen unjustly trampled. The criminal economic \nblockade by the Government of the United States of \nAmerica against the brotherly people and Government \nof heroic Cuba must stop immediately, and the five \nCuban heroes, counter-terrorism combatants \nimprisoned in United States jails, must be released \nnow. \n We express our solidarity with the brotherly \npeople of Argentina in their demand for sovereignty \nover the Malvinas Islands and with the brotherly \npeople of the Democratic Arab Saharan Republic in \ntheir quest to be recognized as an independent State. \n The war and State terrorism against the people of \nPalestine must immediately cease. All Security Council \nand General Assembly resolutions concerning Israel \nmust be respected and complied with. We must tie the \nhands of those who fan the flames of hatred and war \nand are capable of attacking a humanitarian flotilla \u2014 \nan act that has been denounced by the Human Rights \nCouncil commission of inquiry. \n \n \n31 10-55128 \n \n We salute the invitation extended by the \ninternational community to Taiwan to participate in the \nwork of some United Nations specialized agencies \ndirectly related to the well-being of the 23 million \nTaiwanese. In this regard, we call on the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \nand the International Civil Aviation Organization to \nadopt a similar position. \n Never before have we had so much information \nor, I hope, been so conscious of the severity of the \nenvironmental crisis affecting our planet. Our \nawareness of the gravity of the situation makes it \nindispensable that we forge a coalition of forces based \non the common values and inspiring principles that \nserve as the ethical foundation and catalyst for \npractices to promote a sustainable way of life. The \nEarth, with its minerals and sources of energy; with its \nland, water, forests and marine life; with its ecosystems \nand micro-organisms, must be recognized as our \nsupreme and universal benefactor and an integral part \nof humankind, and not only as a source of survival. \n Global capitalism, with its logic of competition \nand unlimited growth and its unsustainable modes of \nproduction and consumption, separates human beings \nfrom nature and establishes a relationship of dominion \nover it. This situation must change and be restored to \nthe right track before it is too late for us all. \n The meeting in Copenhagen demonstrated the \npower of the interests that block decisive action on \nclimate change and the rights of Mother Earth. It left \nus with the unpleasant feeling that we had wasted our \ntime and that those who impede the urgent solutions \nneeded to address the critical state of Mother Earth are \nuncommitted to change. With our eyes fixed on hope, \nwe continue to promote our commitments based on the \nfundamental principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibilities. These should be proportional to the \ngreenhouse gas emissions accumulated since the onset \nof the Industrial Revolution and not since last year. \nThose who have historically caused the damage should \nassume most of the responsibility.  \n In that hope, Nicaragua was the first country of \nthe world to have signed the Universal Declaration of \nthe Rights of Mother Earth, and calls on all the \ncountries of the world to sign it. It was also in that \nhope that Nicaragua signed the People\u2019s Agreement \nadopted in Cochabamba in April during the World \nPeople\u2019s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights \nof Mother Earth. It is in that hope that Nicaragua trusts \nthat, when we arrive in Canc\u00fan, we will be united in \nseeking agreements that will at least partially reverse \nthe harm, and in taking a path that re-establishes the \nlost or gravely endangered balance between humankind \nand Mother Earth. \n Although it is proclaimed without much support \nthat the worst of the global economic and financial \ncrisis is behind us, its most serious effects remain and \ncontinue to greatly affect our peoples. We should not \ncontinue to accept the imposition of economic models \nbased on the pillage and exploitation of our riches. \n For all of those reasons, Nicaragua and most of \nthe Latin American nations are dedicated to building an \nalternative model of economic sovereignty, a sphere of \ninterdependence and solidarity that will enable us to \nface global capitalism\u2019s profound crisis and to recover \nour capacity to determine our own paths to \ndevelopment. We reaffirm that the development \nstrategies of each country are their own responsibility, \nthat they should have national ownership and \nleadership, and that foreign cooperation should be in \nline with the strategies, plans and objectives of the \ncountry that receives it. \n In connection with the urgent need to create a \nnew model, we reiterate our support for the outcome of \nthe Conference on the World Financial and Economic \nCrisis and Its Impact on Development of June 2009 \n(resolution 63/303, annex). There can be no economic \nrecovery or balance in the inequality with the present \nmodel, which concentrates the income and wealth \namong and within nations. \n All of this should take place in a framework of \nmutual respect, devoid of punitive political conditions \nagainst our peoples that would block and stifle the \ndevelopment of the countries of the South. \n Besides the hundreds of millions of people in the \nworld who suffer from hunger, we have before us the \nterrifying reality that in developing countries,  \n10.9 million children under the age of five die every \nyear. Malnutrition and hunger-related diseases cause  \n60 per cent of those deaths. The cost of malnutrition to \nnational economic development is estimated at \nbetween $20 and $30 billion per year. That intolerable \nsituation must stop. The developed countries must \nfulfil their commitments to eliminate the suffering of \nmillions of human beings. \n  \n \n10-55128 32 \n \n Nicaragua reaffirms its decision to confront, with \nthe means available to it and in the context of its \nnational sovereignty, the different forms of \ntransnational organized crime, which have become a \npermanent threat to domestic and international security. \nSimilarly, Nicaragua reiterates its position of \ncombating terrorism in all its forms and whatever their \nsource. \n There are several processes that are hampering \nnecessary and urgent changes. The most prominent is \nthe suppression of information \u2014 not saying anything \nin order to perpetuate ignorance. And when \ninformation is made available, it is distorted and \nalways against the peoples\u2019 interests and their \nlegitimate aspirations and experiences, thus converting \nlies into truths and vice versa, converting a smile into a \nsneer, words into noise and an objective fact into \nvirtual reality. \n The universal citizen is witness, through global \ncommunication, to a real war for truth and freedom, \nforced to confront a permanent, slanderous campaign \nagainst change, against hope and against the proper \nevolution of history. That campaign has far-reaching \nimplications and has the goal of destroying the process \nof direct popular democracy and of the profound and \nrevolutionary social transformations that are taking \nplace in our countries as a result of the triumph of \nrevolutionary political forces, as is the case in \nNicaragua with the Sandinista Front. We must \ndenounce the campaign waged by hegemonic and \nselfish interests in a few countries in an attempt to \nundermine the legitimacy of our political system and \nour people\u2019s Government. \n Nicaragua proclaims its right to live in peace and \nto combat the poverty, illiteracy, hunger and \nmalnutrition generated by historic exclusion and the \nimposition of an economic and political model that is \nalien to our reality. Nicaragua declares its dignity, \nsovereignty, self-determination, respect, unity and \nsolidarity with all the peoples of the Earth, as \nguaranteed by the United Nations Charter. Nicaragua is \nworking to develop a social awareness of solidarity \nidentified with the ideals of humankind, justice, \nfreedom and democracy for all, without exception. \n From this forum, Nicaragua makes a vehement \ncall for world peace, for the survival of the human \nspecies, for the dignified future of the noblest \naspirations of men and women. That is the only \npossible future."

        "file_text": "Let me \ncongratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election to \npreside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \nsession. May the United Nations, under his leadership, \nconfirm its central role in global events. Slovakia \nstands prepared to support him. I also appreciate the \nwork done by his predecessor at the previous session. \n The Slovak Republic fully aligns itself with the \nEuropean Union\u2019s statements. We are pleased that 27 \nEuropean member States, plus other associated \ncountries, speak in one voice at this universal \ninternational forum. This is a good prerequisite to clear \nthe way for widely anticipated effective cooperation \nbetween the Union and the United Nations. \n Let me now share with the Assembly several \nremarks on certain global and regional issues from the \nperspective of the Slovak foreign policy priorities. \n The foreign policy of Slovakia, as a United \nNations member, is based on respect for the core \ndemocratic values, international law and effective \nmultilateralism. We therefore welcome and support the \nmain theme of the sixty-fifth session: \u201cReaffirming the \ncentral role of the United Nations in global \ngovernance\u201d. This topic is all the more important since \nwe often witness failure to respect binding decisions \ntaken by United Nations bodies, and from time to time \neven among the various United Nations institutions. \n One of the most important missions of the United \nNations is to act as a guarantor of the formulation, \nprotection and implementation of the principle of \ncollective security of States. Hence, the preservation of \ninternational peace and security at a global level and \nwithin the bounds of international law must remain at \nthe core of United Nations activities. For peace and \nsecurity become particularly vulnerable in times of \nglobal financial and economic crises. They require \nincreased attention on our part in order to remain under \nthe control of States and the international community. \n The process of arms control and disarmament \nrepresents the most important instrument for the \nprevention of war and other conflict. The progress \nachieved in the area of non-proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction gives us reason for cautious \noptimism. Our duty is to continue the effort and to \nstrengthen the global system of non-proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. Yet the risk of such \nweapons falling into the hands of terrorists remains \nhigh. We are also prepared to cooperate with our \npartners on a number of priorities, such as the entry \ninto force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \nTreaty. \n We appreciate the new post-START Treaty \nbetween the Russian Federation and the United States. \nWe believe that the Treaty will invigorate the process \nof disarmament, which is getting off the ground, and \nincrease pressure on certain States to desist from their \nambitions to own nuclear weapons. In particular, I wish \nto underscore the important role played by the \nConference on Disarmament, which is described as the \nsole multilateral disarmament negotiating forum. \n In the area of conventional weapons, it is \nnecessary to continue negotiations leading to the \nadoption of a new, effective arms trade treaty. \nAdequate attention must also be paid to small arms, the \nuncontrolled spread of which may have devastating \nconsequences for the maintenance of peace and \nsecurity, particularly in conflict areas. \n United Nations peacekeeping operations \nrepresent one of the most visible activities of the \nUnited Nations in its efforts to preserve peace and \nsecurity in the world. Slovakia, as an active contributor \nto United Nations missions and other international \ncrisis management operations based on a United \nNations mandate, welcomes the steps towards reviving \nthe reform of peacekeeping operations as described in \nthe document \u201c A New Partnership Agenda: Charting a \nNew Horizon for UN Peacekeeping\u201d. \n I believe that the new Global Field Support \nStrategy will contribute, in real terms, towards a more \nrapid deployment of peacekeeping missions and, at the \nsame time, ensure a more efficient utilization of human \nand financial resources. \n Proper coordination between the United Nations \nand regional organizations plays an important role. \nThere is room for improvement, for example, when it \ncomes to cooperation between the EU and NATO at the \noperational level, but also for a more effective \ncoordination at strategic level. \n \n \n13 10-54833 \n \n The United Nations must also play a key role in \nthe prevention of conflicts. Slovakia supports the \nprevention and mediation role of the United Nations \nand its capacity-building. It is, however, necessary to \nexert synergic efforts taking due account of the \ninterests of all stakeholders at the local, regional and \nglobal levels in order to eliminate sources of conflict \nand proceed directly with establishing peace. \n The establishment of the United Nations Regional \nCentre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia, \nwhich is headed by a Slovak diplomat, was a step in \nthe right direction. The recent events in Kyrgyzstan \nconfirmed the usefulness of this instrument and \nunderscored the need to support it further. \n Slovakia takes an active part in peace processes. \nSince our non-permanent membership in the Security \nCouncil in 2006 and 2007, we have continued our \ninvolvement in security sector reform. We are glad that \nsince then several strategic papers have been produced \nand that progress has been made in building the \nrequisite capacities, particularly in cooperation with \nAfrican countries. \n As the chair of the Group of Friends of security \nsector reform, we continue to actively work towards \nstrengthening the relations in this matter between \nMember States and the Secretariat. In the course of the \nsixty-fourth session of the General Assembly, we \nteamed up with our partners from Argentina and \nIndonesia to hold regional workshops dealing with \nsecurity sector reform in the broader context of \npreserving and building peace and, at the same time, \nestablishing a link between its global and regional \naspects. We are determined to uphold this effort in \ncooperation with the Inter-agency Task Force on \nSecurity Sector Reform, as well as with other Member \nStates and subregional organizations. \n Under the Charter, the primary responsibility for \ninternational peace and security lies with the Security \nCouncil. The process of its reform could almost be \ncalled a never-ending story. We are therefore pleased \nthat the intergovernmental negotiations on Security \nCouncil reform were given a clearer shape. It must \nstand on the following pillars: representativeness, \neffectiveness in fulfilling its mission and transparency \nof its working methods, while allowing for possible \nenforcement of its decisions by sanctions. \n The global financial and economic crisis laid bare \nthe weak spots in the existing structures of the world \neconomic order. The key role of the United Nations \nand its Member States must also be confirmed in this \nfinancial and economic dimension at the global level. \n At the High-level Plenary Meeting on the \nMillennium Development Goals, we shared the view \nthat since our efforts in achieving these Goals started \nsome 10 years ago they had not become less topical or \nless important. Eradicating poverty and hunger, \nimproving the quality of education, adequate \nemployment, improving health-care services and \nhousing, improving maternal health, gender equality \nand environmental sustainability remain among the \ncentral concerns of United Nations programmes, funds \nand specialized agencies. \n Everyday life also shows us that creating \nconditions for equitable and sustainable development \nmust go hand in hand with respect for nature and its \nrules. There is an inherent link between the two, and \nboth have an impact on the life of individuals, who are \npart of the universal system. \n The people of Slovakia had the misfortune to \nwitness nature\u2019s power as floods of an unprecedented \nscale ravaged our country earlier this summer. A proper \nbalance must be struck between development and \nrespect for nature, based on well-reasoned arguments \nsupported by proper analysis, and without giving way \nto the influence sought by certain narrowly focused \ntransnational organizations that call themselves \nenvironmentalists. \n For the first time this year, Slovakia took part in \nthe Economic and Social Council meetings as a \nmember. Our experience shows that we need to \nstrengthen the links between the Economic and Social \nCouncil and other organizations of the United Nations \nsystem and beyond, provided they work towards the \nsame objectives. \n Slovakia welcomes the establishment of \nUN Women \u2014 the United Nations Entity for Gender \nEquality and Empowerment of Women. We believe that \nthis entity will help curb all forms of violence against \nwomen. We also extend our good wishes for a \nsuccessful mandate to the Secretary-General\u2019s Special \nRepresentative on Sexual Violence in Conflict. \n Slovakia rejects any and all forms of intolerance, \nxenophobia, discrimination, racism and extreme \nnationalism. We are devoted to the protection of and \nsupport for human rights at both the national and \n  \n \n10-54833 14 \n \ninternational level. We play a leading role in the \ninterregional initiative aimed at the adoption of a new \noptional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of \nthe Child. \n Slovakia fully supports the fight to end impunity \nfor the perpetrators of the most serious crimes under \ninternational law, such as genocide, war crimes and \ncrimes against humanity. As a facilitator for the \nuniversality and implementation of the Rome Statute of \nthe International Criminal Court, we actively work \ntowards increasing the number of States Parties to the \nRome Statute and towards its proper implementation. \n Slovakia closely watches the situation and \nproblems in individual regions of the world. \n The long-term effort to reach lasting peace in the \nMiddle East has failed to yield the expected results. At \nthis stage, we appreciate the contributions of all \nfacilitators involved in reconciling the demands of both \nsides by way of direct Israeli-Palestinian talks that \nwere launched recently. We are hopeful that the \nPalestinian and Israeli leaders will find a way of \ncoming to an agreement that will lay down the final \narrangement of their mutual relations. This is necessary \nfor world peace. \n Africa, as the most troubled continent, continues \nto call for special attention by the international \ncommunity. We need to address the origin and the \nessence of the problems, not only their consequences. \nOn the other hand, we are pleased to see the progress \nmade in the stabilization and development of countries \nsuch as Ghana, Benin, Togo, Mauritius and others. \n As members of the United Nations, we all have to \nsupport respect for the binding nature of Security \nCouncil resolutions \u2014 particularly when it comes to \npreserving peace around the globe. For this reason, we \nsupport diplomatic negotiations on the Iran issue, as \nwell as on the situation on the Korean peninsula, which \nis a matter of concern. \n Slovakia welcomed the conclusions of the Kabul \nInternational Conference on Afghanistan. The \nConference marked a new phase of partnership \nbetween the Afghan Government and the international \ncommunity, based on the principle of a gradual \nAfghanistanization of the country, that is, the transition \nto full Afghan leadership and responsibility to be \nachieved in the Kabul Process. Slovakia will continue \nto participate in the stabilization and development of \nAfghanistan by contributing to NATO- and EU-led \nstabilization and training operations and by \nimplementing humanitarian and development aid \nprojects. \n Slovakia remains a staunch supporter of a \npeaceful and just settlement of the Cyprus issue under \nthe auspices of the Secretary-General. More than \n20 years of our support for negotiations and the \ncontinued involvement, since 2001, of the largest \ncontingent of the Slovak armed forces in the United \nNations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus within the \nUnited Nations crisis management operations, bear \nwitness to our engagement in this respect. \n As for the Western Balkans, we are looking to \nstrengthen stability and support democratic processes. \nWe wish for the European integration processes of the \nWestern Balkan countries to move forward. We also \nwish for the Balkans to see peace agreements and not \nimposed solutions. \n The United Nations must be able to effectively \nrespond to the current challenges of the twenty-first \ncentury. This calls for synergies across all United \nNations bodies, programmes, funds and specialized \nagencies. But, more importantly, since Member States \ndetermine their activities and their direction, we need \nto build synergies among us. The people of our \ncountries are looking to see positive results. \n I am confident that, under the Assembly \nPresident\u2019s leadership, the United Nations will make \ngreat strides in advancing its cause."

        "file_text": "Every year, we gather in this \nGeneral Assembly Hall to take stock of our \nachievements in the pursuit of a more peaceful, more \nsecure and a better world for all citizens of the global \ncommunity. \n As it emerged from the ashes of devastating \nworld wars, the United Nations heralded a new era and \na new world order of international cooperation in the \npursuit of international peace and security. It is \npremised on the principles of sovereign equality and \npeaceful coexistence. \n Taking stock of what we have achieved since \nthen, we can say today that we have been successful in \npreventing many of the scourges that have challenged \nhumanity, including world wars and widespread \ndisease. But as we rid our global society of those \ninjustices, new and emerging forms of injustices now \nthreaten our global security. \n I believe that climate change remains the greatest \nmoral challenge of our time. While it affects all nations \nof this planet, the irony is that it is the poorest and \nsmallest countries, which have made the least \ncontribution to greenhouse gas emissions, that are \npaying the ultimate price in order that the lifestyles and \ndevelopment agenda of some countries may be \nmaintained. Where is the justice in that? \n The Copenhagen Conference failed to meet the \nexpectations of many, but especially of those countries \non the front line for which the threat of climate change \nis no longer a matter of speculation but one of survival, \nand therefore of great urgency. There is a tendency in \nmuch of the world to view climate change as a distant \nand gradual process whose harmful effects are remote \npossible and not worthy of much attention. I have said \nin various forums that, for low-lying island countries \nlike Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Maldives and the Marshall \nIslands, among other similarly vulnerable countries, \nclimate change is a matter of survival and of increasing \nurgency. \n Already we are witnessing major damage to \ninfrastructure and property as a consequence of higher-\nthan-normal tides and storm surges. Coastal erosion in \nheavily populated areas is occurring at a rate that \nexceeds the Governments\u2019 capacity to respond. Lack of \nresources is exacerbating the situation. Coastlines \ncontinue to be eroded and homes and properties \ncontinue to be damaged. \n Long before our islands are inundated by the \nrising seas, they will become uninhabitable as \nfreshwater aquifers are contaminated by saltwater \nintrusion from rising tides. Increasing demand for \nresources to undertake effective responses to climate \nchange impacts will become a dominant feature of our \ndevelopment agenda. I truly hope, therefore, that I can \nduring this session communicate the deep sense of \nurgency and growing sense of despair besetting our \npeople in the face of this oncoming catastrophe. \n On the basis of current scientific projections, the \nCopenhagen Accord does not provide the means to \nguarantee our future survival, and therefore we did not \nsign it in Copenhagen. We have subsequently \nassociated ourselves with the Accord, essentially for \nthe following reasons. First, we are of the belief that \nthe Accord at least represents a positive step towards \n \n \n7 10-55109 \n \nan international governance system on climate change. \nSecondly, we have the expectation that further, \nforthcoming scientific evidence will unequivocally \ndetermine the targets to be agreed upon. Finally and \nmost importantly, we believe that our support for the \nAccord will ensure the flow of urgently needed \nadaptation funds. I regret to say that, to date, we have \nnot been able to access any of the fast-start funds \npledged. \n I acknowledge that many elements of any \ninternational regime on climate change will take \nseveral years to conclude, but I also believe that there \nis common ground on which there is no real debate. \nThe urgent need for the flow of adaptation funds to \naddress the more urgent adaptation needs of the most \nvulnerable countries is a matter over which there is \ngeneral consensus. It is not a matter to negotiate or \nprocrastinate over; if we do, it will be too late for some \ncountries and any subsequent agreement will be \nmeaningless. It is also important that adaptation funds \nnot be regarded as additional development funds by \neither development partners or recipient countries, but \nbe provided and applied for the sole purpose of \nadaptation to climate change. \n I believe that we need to modify our approach to \nMexico if we are to succeed. I believe that we have a \nmoral obligation to reach agreement on a legally \nbinding framework that regulates our ability to pursue \npolicies that harm others. For very obvious reasons, I \ndo not believe that any country should have the right to \nexercise sovereignty over its greenhouse gas emissions. \nIn my view, any alternative to a legally binding \nframework is simply unacceptable and would have \npotentially destabilizing consequences. \n The experience at Copenhagen taught us that if \nwe are to make any progress, we must acknowledge \nour differences and discuss ways around them rather \nthan allow them to dominate the international agenda \nbehind the process. In this regard, we believe that trust \nand mutual respect are indispensable to the process. \n Climate change offers the international \ncommunity an opportunity to reflect upon the future \ndirection of our relations as sovereign nations. I \nbelieve that the climate change challenge provides us \nwith the opportunity to be more innovative in our \nconcept of international governance. Our current \narrangement is similar to that of State Governments not \naccepting federal authority within a federal system. \nOne can imagine the chaos. \n While other countries are focusing their efforts \nand resources on their sustainable development, we, \nthe most vulnerable countries, continue to spend the \nlimited resources we have on fighting the continuous \nonslaught of the rising seas and storm surges on our \nhomes and livelihoods. It is no surprise therefore that \nwe are off-track to achieve most of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and the implementation of our \nsustainable development agenda under our national \ndevelopment plan, the Pacific Plan and the Mauritius \nStrategy. For every step we take forward, we are \nknocked back two or three due to the challenges we \nface, which are exacerbated by climate change. \n In this regard, it is imperative that the pledges \nmade at Copenhagen for fast-start funds to assist \nvulnerable countries like Kiribati to adapt to the impact \nof climate change and sea-level rise be mobilized at the \nearliest possible opportunity. This is a matter of great \nand increasing urgency. \n We acknowledge the critical role of our \nenvironment as the pillar of sustainable development. \nMaintaining the health of our biodiversity within our \noceans and ecosystems faces the very same challenges \nthat we have so far failed to address in respect of our \natmosphere. It is imperative, therefore, that we \nundertake the commitment to put in place now the \nmeasures needed in order to avoid the mistakes we \nhave made with climate change. In pursuit of this, we \nin Kiribati have designated the largest marine protected \narea and marine World Heritage Site, the Phoenix \nIslands Protected Area. It covers an area of more than \n400,000 square kilometres, representing some 11 per \ncent of our exclusive economic zone. The Protected \nArea is the result of a collaborative partnership with \nConservation International and the New England \nAquarium. It provides a natural breeding ground for \ntropical fisheries and ocean ecosystems. It is a natural \nlaboratory for the study of such ecosystems and the \nimpact of climate change in a pristine area virtually \nuntouched by human activity. \n The preservation of that Area is our gift to \nhumanity and our contribution to international \nbiodiversity conservation efforts to significantly reduce \nbiodiversity loss in this International Year of \nBiodiversity. Even now, as we confront the possibility \nthat our islands will become uninhabitable within the \n  \n \n10-55109 8 \n \ncentury due to the rising sea level, we recognize the \nvalue of protecting something that is the common \nheritage of humanity. \n Kiribati and the Pacific are committed to the \nsustainable conservation and management of their \nocean ecosystem through the Micronesia Challenge, \nthe Coral Triangle Initiative, the Nauru Agreement and \nthe many other national efforts throughout the region \nto conserve biodiversity and ecosystems. At its meeting \nlast month in Vanuatu, the Pacific Islands Forum \nendorsed the Pacific Oceanscape Framework, which \npromotes collaboration and cooperation among marine \nprotected areas in the Pacific region. Initiatives such as \nthe Pacific 2020 Challenge and a novel Pangaea World \nconcept of green development through knowledge \neconomies link those initiatives to the countries of the \nPacific Rim and beyond. \n Our message to the international community is \nthat the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems in \nthe Pacific is not important only to the sustainable \ndevelopment of Pacific peoples. It is also of vital \nsignificance to the rest of the world. Support from the \ninternational community in protecting ecosystems in \nthe Pacific, and indeed elsewhere, should not be \nviewed as a handout, but as an investment for future \ngenerations of this planet. \n Last year, we all called for a new world order. We \nall acknowledged that our great Organization must \nevolve to reflect the realities of our time \u2014 a time in \nwhich new and emerging security threats and injustices \nsuch as climate change are challenging the credibility \nof our international system of governance; a time in \nwhich the future survival of some nations is seriously \nin question; a time when all those countries with the \nability to do so must contribute to the prevention of \nthat calamity or be forever judged in history. \n We note that tensions remain high in certain \nregions, notably in the Middle East and the Korean \npeninsula. For the sake of those of us on the front line \nof the major global challenges, let us pray that great \nunderstanding and stability will prevail. For while we, \nas small nations, may seem not to be affected by such \nevents, they serve to distract the focus of attention \naway from the real challenges facing the international \ncommunity and our planet today. \n It is gratifying to note the easing of tensions and \nimprovement of relations across the Taiwan Straits \u2014 \nno doubt, a most welcome development for all in that \nregion. We also welcome the inclusion of Taiwan in the \nWorld Health Assembly, and we hope that similar \nunderstanding will prevail in respect of other \ninternational institutions in which Taiwan can \nparticipate and contribute meaningfully for the good of \nhumanity. \n As we chart the path towards a new world order, \nwe must address the fundamental threats to the very \nexistence of the units that make up our Organization. \nAs the so called community of nations, we must be \nable to guarantee the survival of members of our \ncommunity by addressing this defining challenge of \nour era. Climate change must be addressed before it is \ntoo late for those nations on the front line and for the \nwhole of humanity. \n At this time, we need compassionate, visionary \nand responsible leadership to direct our path towards a \nmore secure and more just world. We need to share the \nsolution, and we need to act as one in Mexico. We owe \nit to our future generations to act, and to act now. \nMaintaining the status quo is simply not an option. "

        "file_text": "First, I should \nlike to take this opportunity to congratulate the \nPresident on his election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session and to \nassure him that he can count on the support of Angola \nso that at the end of this session we will all be better \nprepared to respond to the multiple and complex \nchallenges facing the international community. I also \ntake this opportunity to convey, though the President, \nour most sincere gratitude to the outgoing President for \nthe selfless manner in which he conducted the sixty-\nfourth session. \n In the last decade several events have profoundly \nmarked the world community, including natural \ncalamities and man-made disasters, which should lead \nus to consider the need to work towards a more \ncooperative and increasingly integrated world, for no \none is immune to those phenomena. The terrorist attack \nof 2001 on the Twin Towers of New York that killed \nmore than 3,000 people, the tsunami of December 2004 \nin which more than 200,000 people perished, the recent \nearthquake in Haiti that caused more than 200,000 \ndeaths, and the series of natural disasters that have \noccurred on every continent, added to the global \nfinancial and economic crisis, should awaken us to the \nfact that we live in a different world that requires \nbroader cooperation among nations, given that those \nphenomena are unforeseeable. \n Therefore, in today\u2019s world, the consequences of \nthe irresponsibility of a few can have repercussions on \nthe lives of us all. It is thus imperative that we pursue \nrelationships that have greater balance and equality \nbetween large and small and rich and poor, because the \nnew reality is that we are increasingly interdependent \nin a global world. \n Angola, has always been convinced of the \nimportant role of the United Nations and of multilateral \ndiplomacy in general, because no country can progress \nand develop unilaterally, isolated from the community \nof nations and alienated from the common problems \naffecting humanity as a whole. \n \n \n25 10-55276 \n \n In the President\u2019s speech to the General Assembly \non the occasion of his election (see A/64/PV.93), \namong other things he set the following topics as \npriorities for the sixty-fifth session: climate change, the \nMillennium Development Goals, food security, \nsustainable development, rebuilding and strengthening \nfragile post-conflict States, and humanitarian aid and \ndisarmament. Angola is of the opinion that the \nenvironment and other issues he mentioned must \nremain priorities on the national and international \nagendas. They are crucial for sustainable development, \nfor the growth of our economies, for the implementation \nof national strategies for combating poverty, and for \nthe attainment of the Millennium Goals.  \n At the Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s \nRegional Conference for Africa, held recently in \nLuanda, the participants expressed their concern about \nthe impact of climate change on the world food crisis \nin some regions and recommended that States make an \nextra effort to reduce its impact on agriculture. \n Angola believes in the importance of \nmultilateralism as the best form of treatment and \nresolution of the multifaceted challenges that humanity \nfaces today. In that context Angola advocates a shared \ncommitment to find solutions to our problems at all \nlevels. \n My country gives priority to political and \ndiplomatic coordination and to strengthening \ninstitutional relations with the organizations of the \nUnited Nations system, as well as with the regional and \nsubregional organizations to which it belongs, namely, \nthe African Union, the Southern African Development \nCommunity (SADC), the Economic Community of \nCentral African States (ECCAS), the International \nConference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and \nthe Commission on the Gulf of Guinea, the latter \nhaving its headquarters in Angola. \n In the Commission on the Gulf of Guinea, \nmember States cooperate with a view to managing \npotential conflicts linked to maritime borders and \nmanaging shared maritime resources, as well as \ncoordinating policies for the prevention of maritime \ntrafficking and piracy, thus providing security to a \nregion that produces more than 15 per cent of the \nworld\u2019s oil. \n With that motivation, Angola and its armed forces \nbravely participated in the liberation of southern \nAfrica, having contributed to the independence of \nNamibia and to the end of apartheid in South Africa. \nWith that same motivation we contributed to the \nstabilization of the Republic of Congo and the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. With other \ninternational partners of the United Nations, we are \nparticipating in the training of the armed forces of the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.  \n Today the Angolan armed forces are a factor for \nstability not only for Angola, but also for the southern \nand central regions of Africa, where we are part of the \nearly warning mechanisms of SADC and ECCAS. At \npresent we are committed to finding solutions to the \ncrisis in Guinea-Bissau, in close cooperation with other \npartners in West Africa, namely, the Economic \nCommunity of West African States, and in partnership \nwith the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries. \n It was therefore with great amazement that we \nlearned of the mention of involvement by the Angolan \narmed forces in alleged acts of human rights violations \nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo in a report \nintended to be circulated as a document of the High \nCommissioner for Human Rights. We stress that that \ndocument was produced at the initiative of an organ of \nthe United Nations Secretariat with no specific mandate \nfrom the Secretary-General or from Member States.  \n It is important to emphasize before the Assembly \nthat Angola intervened in the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo on the basis of a SADC mandate, at the \nrequest of the Government of the Democratic Republic. \nThat intervention made it possible to stop the \nbloodbath and to save the lives of millions of people \nand lay the basis for the negotiations that culminated in \nthe establishment of the transitional Government, the \ninstallation of the United Nations peacekeeping \nmission and the successful holding of the first \ndemocratic elections. It thus contributed to the \npacification of the Great Lakes region. \n Angola vehemently rejects the insinuation and \nconsiders abnormal the manner in which that so-called \nmapping exercise was conducted. We question the \nmotivations behind that venture. We would like to \nreiterate that Angola and the Angolan armed forces will \ncontinue to act responsibly and on the basis of \ninternational standards and scrupulous respect for \nhuman rights. \n The report of the Secretary-General to the sixty-\nfifth session contains references to peace and security, \nconsidering them essential for development and for the \n  \n \n10-55276 26 \n \npromotion of and respect for human rights. Angola \nshares the concerns of the Secretary-General. Our \nexperience shows that only peace, the democratic rule \nof law and respect for human rights can guarantee the \nstability necessary for sustainable development and \nimprovement of the living conditions of our people. \nAngola encourages the efforts by regional organizations \nand the United Nations in conflict resolution and \npeacekeeping to ensure global security and stability. \n A situation that is certainly of concern to all of us \nis the conflict in the Middle East. Angola recognizes \nthat it has lasted a long time, with serious \nconsequences for the population. Therefore we support \nthe resumption of peace talks by President Barack \nObama with a view to creating a Palestinian State that \ncoexists peacefully with the State of Israel. \n Angola is also concerned at the persistence of the \neconomic, commercial and financial blockade against \nCuba, despite successive General Assembly resolutions \ndemanding its immediate removal. That unilateral \nmeasure, particularly its extraterritorial effects, is \ncontrary to the principles and norms of international \nlaw and contributes to the precarious humanitarian and \nsocial situation of the Cuban population. From this \nrostrum we reiterate our vehement appeal for the lifting \nof a measure whose anachronistic nature has been \nrestated here on numerous occasions. \n Regarding the question of Western Sahara, \nAngola notes with concern that despite various United \nNations resolutions and initiatives, there has not been \nthe type of progress that would lead to meeting the \naspirations of the Saharan people. We urge the \nSecretary-General to continue his efforts to attain those \nobjectives. \n Mutually beneficial cooperation, the promotion of \npeace and respect for human rights remain the major \ndrivers of Angolan foreign policy, based on the \nobservance of the principles of respect for sovereignty \nand territorial integrity, equality and non-interference \nin the internal affairs of other countries.  \n Internally, and as a result of experiences during \ndifferent periods in our history, marked by three \ndecades of war and political instability, Angola is now \nentering a new cycle, of which we are very proud. It is \ncharacterized by the adoption of a new constitution that \nmarks the end of the transition period and definitively \nestablishes democratic rule of law, given that elections \nwill be held in June 2012. \n We are aware that we still have a long way to go, \nespecially in view of all the time lost and the delays \naccumulated in several areas. But it seems important to \nus to emphasize that the progress already achieved did \nnot happen by chance. Rather, it resulted from the \nleadership efforts of the Angolan executive organs, the \npragmatism of its policies and its commitment to better \nthe human development indexes, which are reflected \ntoday in the improved welfare of the people. \n After eight years of peace, Angola has \nimplemented economic and social reform policies that \nhave allowed for the revitalization of its economy and \nthe rehabilitation of key infrastructure. Such policies \nhave enabled the country\u2019s annual growth rates to \naverage double digits, with a direct impact on the \nimprovement of basic indicators of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals.  \n Since 2002 more than 2 million children have \nbeen enrolled in primary education. The percentage of \nchildren attending school has risen sharply, to 76 per \ncent. The rate of infant and maternal mortality fell \nconsiderably, from 1,400 per 100,000 live births in \n2001 to 660 per 100,000 live births in 2010. Moreover, \nin order to eradicate hunger and poverty, Angola has \nadopted its National Food Security Strategy (2009-\n2014) as a mechanism to increase agricultural \nproduction in a sustainable manner. \n We are convinced that the international \ncommunity is also aware of how much still has to be \ndone, particularly in the areas of financing for \ndevelopment and the materialization of the \ncommitments made at major international conferences \non financing for development. \n Finally, the reform of the Security Council, given \nits importance in the democratization of international \nrelations, must remain a topic on the agenda of the \nOrganization. In that connection, Angola reiterates its \nsupport for the African common position embodied in \nthe Ezulwini Consensus. "

        "file_text": "Italy is about to celebrate \nthe one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of its \nunification. We are a young country, but a people with \ndeep roots and ancient traditions. By our history, \ngeographic location and age-old international outlook, \nwe are proud of our illustrious legacy. By necessity and \nvocation, we are dedicated to dialogue, respect for \ndiversity and mutual understanding. \n There is no alternative to this inclusive approach, \neven when it requires compromises or concessions. I \nprefer to call it idealistic pragmatism, since our \nultimate goal is to spread peace, freedom and \nprosperity, an ambition that is best achieved through \ncooperation. This propensity for dialogue is one of \nItaly\u2019s greatest contributions to the United Nations. \n Italy is a strong supporter of the central role of \nthe United Nations in global governance and in the \nmanagement of international crises. By virtue of its \nuniversality and impartiality, the Organization has the \nlegitimacy to intervene in crisis situations. Italy \nparticipates in peacekeeping missions not only by \ncontributing large numbers of highly qualified troops, \n  \n \n10-55109 18 \n \nbut also by drafting strategic plans and protocol, and \nby providing training and logistic support. We are the \nsixth largest contributor to the United Nations regular \nand peacekeeping operations budgets and, since 2006, \nthe top troop contributor to the United Nations among \nthe members of the European Union (EU) and Group \nof Western European and Other States. \n Approximately 8,000 Italian troops are assigned \nto operations under the aegis or the mandate of the \nUnited Nations. Our presence is spread across \n22 missions throughout the world: from Lebanon to \nHaiti, the Balkans to Afghanistan. Through its \nexperiences in these difficult areas, Italy has learned \nimportant lessons. In particular, our comprehensive \napproach provides valuable insight into how to \nintegrate the military aspects of a mission with the \ncommitment to economic, institutional and civil \nreconstruction. \n We are convinced that to meet the challenges of \nthe twenty-first century, the United Nations system \nmust be strengthened, starting with its capacity to \ncontribute to the maintenance of international peace \nand security. The United Nations must be empowered \nto fulfil its role as a \u201cproducer\u201d of security and \nstability, a role designed to foster reconciliation, \nstrengthen democracy and, ultimately, help to create a \nmore stable world. \n This is why we support the Secretary-General\u2019s \nNew Horizon and Global Field Support Strategy \ninitiatives. We must also continue to foster synergies \nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations \nthat play a key role in bringing peace to crisis areas. I \nrefer to the African Union and, above all, to the \nEuropean Union. The Treaty of Lisbon includes new \narrangements for the EU\u2019s international representation. \nOnce the resolution on EU participation in the work of \nthe United Nations has finally been approved, I \nsincerely hope the European Union will be able to \nmake a greater contribution to General Assembly \nresponsibilities and to enhance the Assembly\u2019s capacity \nfor providing political guidance. \n In the field of security, a commitment to \ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction has always been a feature of Italian \nforeign policy. Proliferation is a growing threat that \ncan only be countered through international \ncooperation and, in this regard, the Italian Government \nhas just put forth some concrete proposals. We need to \nset the goal of a zero-nuclear option in an appropriate \ntime frame, but without conveying the impression that \nit is an unrealistic aspiration. \n The year 2010 is a key date on the road to \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. In this \nendeavour, our collective responsibility and credibility \nare at stake. Italy is a strong proponent of a holistic \napproach to development. For the sake of true \ndemocratic ownership, the donor community, in \ncollaboration with the private sector and civil society, \nmust work in a partnership that makes the beneficiary \ncountries the protagonists of development. \n The time has come for the international \ncommunity and the United Nations to increase their \ncommitment to two regional crises. Somalia is the most \nserious and urgent situation on the African continent \ntoday. In the past two years, the Italian Government \nhas contributed considerable financing to the African \nUnion Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and the Somali \nsecurity forces, but this is not enough. International \nsupport for AMISOM must be stepped up. \n The second crisis is in Pakistan, where the recent \nfloods have devastated the lives of 20 million people. \nThe Italian Government is disbursing an additional aid \npackage of \u20ac80 million to bring relief to the Pakistani \npopulation. \n But in addition to providing aid, we need to act \nwisely. This is why Italy has called for new trade \nmeasures to increase market access for Pakistani goods \nand bolster Pakistan\u2019s economic recovery. A natural \ndisaster of this magnitude also demonstrates the urgent \nneed to address the effects of climate change through \ncollective and shared measures. \n Globalization has generated a new demand for \nbelonging and identity. But a fruitful dialogue among \ncultures cannot take place without universal values. It \nis imperative to defend the universal validity of \nfundamental rights and avoid the risks of relativism. \nGiven the strength of its humanistic heritage that \naffirms the human being as the measure of all things, \nItaly is well-equipped to play an important part in this \ndialectic. \n True to this heritage, the Italian Government has \npromoted a campaign for a moratorium on the death \npenalty. We welcome the strengthening international \ntrend towards achieving this objective, and hope it will \nbe confirmed when Italy and a broad alliance of \n \n \n19 10-55109 \n \ncountries present a resolution on the moratorium in the \nupcoming months. \n Religious tolerance is a prerequisite for peace and \na founding principle of our civilization. The right to \nsearch for truth through the word of God is the \nfreedom of freedoms, but in some areas of the world \npeople are afraid to freely and openly profess their \nfaith because they face persecution by extremists. Italy \nis strongly committed to protecting freedom of religion \nand will always oppose discrimination against religious \nminorities. In fact, Italy together with its EU partners is \nactively involved in the preparation and presentation of \nthe annual resolution on religious intolerance. \n Another target of our fight against discrimination \nis the international initiative to ban female genital \nmutilation. Since September 2009, Italy, together with \na group of African countries, has promoted such an \ninitiative, which, hopefully, will lead to the \npresentation here in the Assembly of a resolution that \nfully respects African ownership. \n Female genital mutilations, which violate a \nwoman\u2019s physical integrity, affect millions of women \nand girls throughout the world, including in my \ncountry, where 35,000 such cases have been reported. \nWomen\u2019s rights and national progress go hand in hand, \nbut, nevertheless, women are still suffering in many \ncountries throughout the world. \n By pooling together our efforts we can ensure the \nnecessary consensus for resolutions that safeguard our \nown and future generations from prejudice and \nintolerance. In this spirit, we very warmly welcome the \ncreation of UN Women within the Secretariat and hope \nthat it quickly becomes operative. \n Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations \nin global governance requires a constant commitment \nto the comprehensive reform of the Organization. Such \nreform should affect the Secretariat, the various funds, \nagencies and programmes of the United Nations and, \nobviously, its decision-making bodies. \n In regard to reform of the Security Council, we \nseek realistic compromise solutions that garner the \nbroadest possible consensus and ensure an adequate \nrepresentation of African, Arab and other \nunderrepresented groups of countries. More than \n15 years of negotiations have demonstrated that the \nmembership is profoundly divided. It is now time to \nsearch for genuine and far-reaching compromise. Italy \nand its Uniting for Consensus partners are ready to \nparticipate constructively in the reform process and \nhave already demonstrated their flexibility. We look \nforward to engaging with the rest of the membership \nduring the current session of the General Assembly. \n The process of revitalizing the General Assembly \nshould strive to restore its central role. The Assembly\u2019s \nuniversal character gives it potential for providing \npolitical guidance that should be realized. The \nAssembly is the place where we could jointly identify \nthe main problems that threaten the security, stability \nand development of all Member States and draft \ncommon strategies to address them effectively. \n In conclusion, the vision for the future to which \nmy country, Italy, aspires \u2014 a future of peaceful \ncoexistence and mutual enrichment between values and \ncultures \u2014 can only be ensured through the successful \ncompletion of the many reform processes under way. \nWe can achieve this future if we build our actions on \ndialogue and mutual understanding. And when we do \nachieve peaceful coexistence and mutual enrichment, \nthe United Nations system will be equipped with the \ntools it needs to fulfil the main principles and values of \nthe Charter. One of these stands above all the others in \nimportance: each and every individual throughout the \nworld is endowed with inalienable and absolute rights \nconcerning which no kind of compromise can ever be \ntolerated.

        "file_text": "At the outset, I congratulate you, Sir, \non your assumption of the presidency of the Assembly \nat its sixty-fifth session. We are confident that your \nexpertise in international affairs will enable you to wisely \nand capably guide the work of the General Assembly, and \nwe wish you every success in your endeavours. \n I would also like to thank your predecessor, Mr. Ali \nTreki, for his successful leadership of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session, and to thank Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, the Secretary-General, for his great efforts to \nre-energize the role of this international Organization in \npromoting world peace and security and development. \n The international community continues to face \ndaunting challenges that demand strengthened \ncollective action, increased joint international efforts in \nthe United Nations framework and a serious move \ntowards reform of its organs in a responsible and \nbalanced manner, in order to enable the United Nations \neffectively to play its primary role in addressing the \nmajor challenges facing the international community. \n My Government wishes to reiterate in this forum \nits deep regret at the continued Iranian occupation of \nour three islands: Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu \nMusa. It demands the return of the islands, including \ntheir regional waters, airspace, continental shelf and \nexclusive economic zone, to its full sovereignty as \nintegral parts of the United Arab Emirates. All \nprocedures and measures taken by the Iranian \nauthorities since their occupation of the islands are null \nand void and have no legal effect, no matter how long \nthe occupation may last. \n We look forward to seeing the Iraqi parties form a \nnational Government that continues to build its \nsecurity, political and economic institutions, extend its \nauthority over the entire territory of Iraq and achieve a \ncomprehensive national reconciliation, which is the \nreal guarantee for stabilizing the political process in \nIraq and embracing all factions of Iraqi society, with no \nexception or discrimination. \n While we note with satisfaction the withdrawal of \nforeign troops from Iraq, we express our firm \ncondemnation of all acts of violence and bombings that \nhave targeted the Iraqi people. In this context, we \nreiterate the need to respect Iraq\u2019s territorial integrity, \nsovereignty and independence, and to refrain from \ninterfering in its internal affairs, in order to safeguard \nits Arab and Islamic identity. \n The United Arab Emirates believes that peace in \nthe Middle East and resolution of the Arab-Israeli \nconflict cannot be achieved without ending the Israeli \noccupation of the occupied Palestinian and other Arab \nterritories. Israel\u2019s withdrawal to the line of 4 June 1967, \nincluding East Jerusalem, the Syrian Golan Heights and \nthe remaining occupied territories in southern Lebanon, \nis also required in order to achieve a just and \ncomprehensive peace in accordance with the resolutions \nof international legitimacy, and based on the principle \nof land for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative. \n The United Arab Emirates stands by the \nPalestinian National Authority, and supports the \nPalestinian people in their quest to achieve their \nnational goals and restore their inalienable legitimate \nrights. We commend President Mahmoud Abbas for his \npersistent efforts to realize the interests of the \nPalestinian people and restore their rights. \n We affirm our support for the position adopted by \nthe Palestinian National Authority in the direct \nnegotiations with the Israeli. We hope that the \nindependent Palestinian State, with its capital Al-Quds \nAl-Sharif, will see the light of day next year.  \n We welcome the statement of Mr. Barack Obama, \nPresident of the United States, to the General Assembly, \nand his strong commitment to the achievement of peace \nin the Middle East. We also welcome his emphasis on the \nimportance of leading direct negotiations into final \nresults within a year, and seeing Palestine take its seat \n \n \n13 10-55276 \n \nin the General Assembly at the sixty-sixth session. In \nthis context, we rely on an effective American role, and \nactive regional and international support for the peace \nprocess in the Middle East. \n Our commitment to the achievement of peace as a \nstrategic choice means that we must condemn the \nIsraeli practices against the Palestinian people, \nincluding the collective punishment policy and the \ninhumane blockade imposed on the Palestinian people \nin Gaza. We also condemn other flagrant Israeli \nviolations of international law and of the principles and \npurposes of the Charter.  \n In that connection, we emphasize that the \ncontinuation of the Israeli settlement activities, \nconfiscation and Judaization of the occupied \nPalestinian and other Arab territories run counter to the \npursuit of peace. We say to Israel: Either choose to pursue \npeace or insist on pressing ahead with settlements. \nCombining the two is incompatible with peace. \n The United Arab Emirates will continue to pursue \nits international policy guided by the purposes of the \nUnited Nations and the principles of its Charter, \nespecially with regard to the promotion of international \npeace and security, the peaceful resolution of \ninternational disputes, non-interference in the internal \naffairs of States and compliance with the principles of \ninternational law. \n We shall continue to make our distinct \ncontributions to regional and international partnerships \naimed at building a more peaceful, stable and just \nworld, free of all forms of terrorism, violence, \nextremism, crime, discrimination, human rights \nviolations, human trafficking, and any sort of \nhumiliation or degradation of human dignity. We look \nforward to a world that promotes the principles of \ndialogue, interaction, mutual understanding, \ncooperation and interactive civilized coexistence \namong all religions and cultures, without any form of \ndiscrimination, the use of stereotypical images, hatred \nor denigration of religions: a world characterized by \nhuman peace, prosperity and development. \n On that basis, we condemn terrorism in all its \nforms and manifestations, wherever it exists, and stress \nthe need to intensify regional and international efforts \nto combat and eliminate terrorism. \n My country is an active member of regional and \ninternational partnerships and efforts designed to \ncombat terrorism, including the Global Initiative to \nCombat Nuclear Terrorism. We will continue our \nefforts to strengthen cooperation in the areas of \nintelligence exchange, capacity-building, combating \nand drying up sources of terrorism. We expect all other \nStates to shoulder their responsibilities in order to get \nrid of this growing scourge. \n In the meantime, we welcome the positive results \nof the West Point conference on combating terrorism, \nand look forward to the success of the next conference, \nto be held in the Republic of Korea. \n As part of our efforts to strengthen international \ncooperation in addressing the challenges of climate \nchange, and in order to assist States most at risk from \nthe adverse effects of that phenomenon, we have \ninitiated a partnership programme with the Pacific \nsmall island developing States, and we call upon the \ninternational community to support and expand the \npartnership at the global level. It is our hope that States \nparties to the Framework Convention on Climate \nChange will achieve concrete results before the \nforthcoming Conference in Mexico. \n We are pleased to see that the accord establishing \nthe International Renewable Energy Agency has \nentered into force after ratification by the required \nnumber of States. In its capacity as host country, the \nUnited Arab Emirates continues to carry out its \ncommitments to the Agency in order to enable it to \nperform its duties effectively. \n My Government is moving forward with its \npeaceful nuclear energy programme. At the same time, \nit wishes to emphasize its commitment to all the \nrequirements of nuclear non-proliferation and its \ncompliance with the highest standards of transparency \nand nuclear safety. The United Arab Emirates has \nratified the Additional Protocol to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In this context, \nwe wish to express our satisfaction at the positive \noutcome of the recent Review Conference of the States \nParties to the Treaty. We look forward to the \nimplementation of the responsible and valid \nrecommendations agreed in the Final Document of the \nConference. \n The United Arab Emirates is working on \nprotecting the various aspects of human rights, and \nwelcomes the establishment of a new international \nentity on women in the United Nations, UN Women, \nand the appointment of the Under-Secretary-General \n  \n \n10-55276 14 \n \nfor Women\u2019s Affairs. We are implementing various \nnational programmes to empower women, enhance \ntheir participation in the decision-making process, and \ndeveloping their status. \n We attach great importance to the issue of human \ntrafficking. We have therefore enacted legislation and \ndeveloped national mechanisms compatible with our \nobligations under relevant international conventions \nand resolutions. We call upon the international \ncommunity to develop an integrated global strategy to \neliminate this scourge.  \n We support the activities of the Alliance of \nCivilizations Forum, and welcome the fact that its \nfourth session is to be held in the brotherly State of \nQatar next year. We also commend the endeavours of \nQatar to make the interfaith dialogue conference a \npermanent institution. We welcome the decision of the \nEmir of Qatar to establish a centre for interfaith \ndialogue in Doha.  \n We hope that our deliberations during this session \nwill lead to positive results."

        "file_text": "The \ndelegation of Chad echoes previous speakers in warmly \ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election to the \npresidency of the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session, \nand assures you of our desire to cooperate with you as \nyou carry out your mission. \n I also express my delegation\u2019s admiration for \nyour predecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, who \nskilfully guided the Assembly\u2019s work at the sixty-\nfourth session. \n Our tribute and recognition also go to the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his courage \nand passion in seeking solutions to the problems facing \nmankind. \n Over the last two years the entire world has \nstruggled against the effects of the financial, food and \nenergy crises. The international cooperation \nunderpinning that struggle has been exemplary and \nunprecedented. But, while it was able to curb the \nfinancial crisis in the rich countries, the poor countries \ncontinue to suffer from the effects of the food and \nenergy crises, added to which are the negative effects \nof climate change on their environment. \n The Republic of Chad welcomes the fact that the \nUnited Nations is focusing on development challenges, \nin particular the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and their financing, as evidenced \nby the recent high-level meeting. But we fear that once \nagain the relevant recommendations that emerged from \nthat meeting will not be implemented. \n Over recent years our Organization and the \ninternational community have been particularly \nconcerned about the Darfur crisis and its impact on \nrelations between Chad and the Sudan, which have \nbeen fully normalized following the courageous \ndecision of Mr. Idriss D\u00e9by Itno to travel to Khartoum \nand finalize reconciliation with his Sudanese \ncounterpart, Mr. Omer Hassan Ahmat Al-Bashir. \n The two countries agreed, among other measures, \nto establish a joint force to secure their common \nborder. It is now patrolling the entire border to \nmaintain security. High-level meetings are held \nregularly to assess the situation. \n The two countries are also committed to \nproviding no support of any kind to rebel forces in the \nrespective countries, and they call upon those forces to \nlay down their arms and accept a political settlement. \nAs always, the Government of the Republic of Chad \nfavours dialogue. \n Although relations between our two countries are \nbeing normalized, and there is a growing dialogue \nbetween the Government and the armed opposition in \nthe Sudan, the situation in Darfur still merits special \nattention.  \n Chad, no doubt like the entire international \ncommunity, has a dream of peace in the Sudan, which \nis preparing for a major political event: the referendum \non self-determination for southern Sudan. That is a \nhigh-risk undertaking if the process leading up to it is \nnot controlled, and if the balloting is not organized \nunder the best conditions of independence, security and \ntransparency. \n We fear that failures in those respects could \ncompromise peace and security in the Sudan and the \nsubregion. That fear is reinforced by an appeal made \nthis morning by the Archbishop of the Episcopal \nChurch of the Sudan, who expressed concern about the \nserious risks of war. In addressing the appeal to the \n \n \n15 10-55276 \n \nUnited Nations and to the Governments of the United \nStates and Great Britain, the guarantors of the peace \nagreements, Archbishop Daniel Deng drew our \nattention to the significance of those risks. We must \ntake account of that legitimate concern. \n In any event, the international community must \nunderstand that the referendum in southern Sudan, \nwhatever the outcome, will have an impact on the rest \nof Africa. \n My country would like to see the Sudan\u2019s unity \nand integrity maintained, but the Sudanese themselves \nare the only judges of their future, and Chad will \nrespect their choice. \n On the other side of the Sudanese frontier, in \neastern Chad, there are still 290,000 Sudanese refugees \nand 180,000 displaced Chadians, who have been there \nsince the Darfur crisis erupted in 2003. They are living \nin precarious environmental and social conditions; this \nis not to mention the situation of the host populations, \nwho also deserve more attention in order to restore the \nnatural balance disrupted by the massive influx of \nrefugees and displaced persons.  \n In anticipation of the withdrawal of the United \nNations Mission in the Central African Republic and \nChad (MINURCAT), Chad has committed itself to \nhaving its own forces assume the protection of those \nrefugees and internally displaced persons, as well as of \nUnited Nations and associated humanitarian personnel. \nThus, in accordance with Security Council resolution \n1923 (2010) of 25 May, the Government has developed \na sustainment plan to ensure support for elements of the \nIntegrated Security Detachment (DIS) post-MINURCAT. \nIt must be remembered that DIS is composed entirely of \nnational elements of the gendarmerie and police whose \nmission it is to maintain order and the rule of law in \nthe refugee camps and in areas with concentrations of \ninternally displaced persons, and to help ensure the \nsafety of humanitarian operations. \n Respect for security and humanitarian \ncommitments in Chad has led the Government to make \na financial effort of around $12 million a month. That \ndoes not include the cost of the joint Chad-Sudan \nforces\u2019 operations to secure the border.  \n Logistical support for security and for managing \nhumanitarian needs requires the combined efforts of \nall. Therefore, the Government intends to organize in \nChad in the coming days consultation with all partners \nin order to mobilize the necessary financial and logistic \nsupport for DIS.  \n We take this opportunity to reiterate, once again, \nthe Government\u2019s readiness to continue to cooperate \nwith the United Nations in all initiatives that will \nbenefit peace and security in eastern Chad, the Central \nAfrican Republic and Darfur. Accordingly, Chad \nwelcomes the meeting on the Central African Republic \nheld on the margins of the Millennium Development \nGoals summit. We hope that that important meeting \nenabled the international community to understand the \nextent of the challenges facing that country and to \nassist effectively both in the organization of the \ncoming elections and in the maintenance of peace \nthroughout its territory.  \n We believe that the cessation of armed incursions \ninto the area will have satisfactory effects on the \nphenomenon of recruiting child soldiers. The \nGovernment had already firmly resolved to eradicate \nsuch recruitment, long carried out by the armed groups. \nIt was with that clear intention that my country hosted \nlast June a regional conference on ending the \nrecruitment and use of children by armed forces and \narmed groups. My country makes its full contribution \nalongside the contributions of the African Union and \nthe United Nations.  \n In national politics, a climate of trust between the \nGovernment and the democratic opposition has existed \nsince implementation of the political agreement of \n13 August 2007. This has enabled the various political \nactors to agree on the conduct of our electoral process. \nAn independent joint national electoral commission has \nbeen set up to organize consultations on the various \nlocal and national elections, and it has decided on the \nschedule for local, parliamentary and presidential \nelections in the first quarter of 2011. \n With regard to development, the country has \nspent 60 per cent of its additional oil resources in the \nsocial sectors and on basic infrastructure as the basis of \nits socio-economic development. However, funding \nneeds for the MDGs in 2008-2011 show a gap of more \nthan $3.5 billion. Domestic financial resources remain \nwoefully short of our needs. Additional resources are \ntherefore essential to finance our development. \nAccordingly, we call for the support of international \nfinancial institutions, including the World Bank, to \nreach the completion point of the Heavily Indebted \nPoor Countries Initiative.  \n  \n \n10-55276 16 \n \n In spite of all those difficulties, the Government \nhas implemented a social policy based on free access to \neducation and exemption from all charges related to \nmaternal health, HIV/AIDS and malaria.  \n On the environmental front, Chad has taken \nstrong measures to protect the environment, including \nthe prohibition of excessive cutting of green wood, to \nconserve our forests and savannahs and to fight \ndesertification.  \n In addition, last June Chad hosted the first \nsummit of heads of State and Government on the \nestablishment of the Pan-African Great Green Wall \nAgency, and on its programme. Chad was given the \nhonour of hosting the summit, organized by the Sahel \ncountries, because of its pioneering role in the large-scale \nreforestation of the region. A national programme, \u201cGreen \nBelt\u201d, to plant more than 10 million trees a year \nthroughout the country, began in 2009. Beyond the \nsubregional aspect, such programmes integrate \nperfectly with global initiatives in the worldwide \nstruggle against the ill effects of climate change, and \ntherefore deserve the international community\u2019s \nsupport. \n Moreover, in October Chad will host the eighth \nWorld Forum of Sustainable Development, whose \ntheme will be \u201cSave Lake Chad\u201d. Lake Chad, part of \nworld heritage, is in danger of disappearing; it has \nshrunk from 25,000 square kilometres to less than \n2,500 square kilometres in 40 years, and is a typical \nexample of the disastrous consequences of climate \nchange. I take this opportunity to invite all people of \ngood will to take part in the Forum in large numbers. \n In regard to international issues and the alarming \nincrease in terrorist activities in several regions of \nAfrica and throughout the world, we express our total \ncondemnation of the gratuitous violence that threatens \nthe peaceful and calm existence of innocent citizens. \n I turn to the issue of Israel and Palestine. We \nremain constant in our support for this Organization \nand the Government of the United States with regard to \nreaching a peace agreement allowing the peaceful \ncoexistence of two sovereign States. To that end, we \nsupport President Barack Obama in his courageous \ninitiative with the two parties. We sincerely hope that \nhis mission will succeed. \n Our world has changed considerably over the past \n20 years. Peoples and States aspire to greater well-\nbeing, freedom and justice. Our common Organization \nmust treat those aspirations as part of its primary \nvocation. My country therefore again calls on the \nAssembly to work for Security Council reform, without \ndelay, in order to integrate Africa. The international \ncommunity must not accept the marginalization of the \nAfrican continent, which has so much to offer to the \nworld."

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to \ncongratulate Mr. Deiss on assuming the post of \nPresident of the General Assembly at the current \nsession. I pledge him Latvia\u2019s full support. \n Sixty-five years ago, the United Nations was \ncreated on the ashes of the bloodiest war in the history \nof mankind as an international forum where all nations \nmeet as equals, willing to address international \nchallenges and to prevent the scourge of war. Since \nthen it has become the most broadly representative \nbody of nations focused on promoting security, peace \nand prosperity all over the world. \n This year also marks the twentieth anniversary of \nLatvia\u2019s freedom, regained after 50 years of Soviet \noccupation, oppression and injustice. Latvia\u2019s story \nshows that the values enshrined in the Charter are \nuniversal and, with the people\u2019s persistence and \ncommon vision, can come alive, even if it takes \ndecades. It also shows that it is possible to overcome \neven the deepest of divisions. It shows that, while \nhonouring our history, we can extend a hand of \ncooperation and look into the future with hope. \n There are many global issues that need our real \nattention and require urgent action. Just a few days ago \nwe renewed our commitment to development at the \nHigh-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). While important \nimprovements have been made globally, progress \ntowards achieving the MDGs by 2015 has not been \nsufficient. If we are serious about achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals, we need to show \ncommitment and action. \n A new consciousness is emerging from the \nawareness of the negative impact of climate change. \nClimate change is a fact. We are witnessing a rising \nnumber of storms, excessive rainfall and atypical \ntemperatures, which lead to flooding, forest fires and \ncrop failures. All those disasters have an immense \nmaterial cost and claim people\u2019s lives, and therefore \nthey should be treated as a serious security threat. The \nresponse must be twofold. We have to adapt to the \nchanges already in place and to those we will face in \nthe coming decades. And most importantly, we have to \nwork on preventive measures, such as the reduction of \nemissions. \n We have a road ahead of us on the issue of \nclimate change, and every country has to contribute if \nour actions on it are to be successful. Within the \nframework of the Copenhagen Accord, Latvia, among \nother European Union member States, is providing \nassistance that, along with financial contributions from \nother key players, helps developing countries fight \nclimate change. We must make the next step in \nCanc\u00fan. We have to agree on global action to address \nclimate change. The future of the next generation is at \nstake. \n While we are working for long-term goals, we \nalso have to address immediate crises wherever they \noccur. The international community, with the United \nNations in the leading role, has been addressing \nhumanitarian needs following the devastating flooding \nin Pakistan, which has affected more than 14 million \npeople. This year we also witnessed a terrible \nearthquake in Haiti. Latvia, despite its economic \nchallenges, was able to respond to those international \nemergency humanitarian needs, both through the \nUnited Nations Central Emergency Response Fund and \nthrough additional pledges of \u20ac150,000 for Haiti\u2019s \nrecovery. We will continue to help countries affected \nby such tragic disasters. \n Latvia has always supported the strengthening of \nthe United Nations as the only truly global \ninternational organization. However, in a time of \nglobalization and rapid development, the need for \nreform is an inevitable reality. We must therefore \ncontinuously seek maximum effectiveness and \nefficiency in the work of the United Nations in order to \ndeliver results worthy of this Organization. A Security \nCouncil that reflects the realities of the twenty-first \ncentury would be a significant step towards a more \neffective United Nations. We sincerely hope for a faster \npace for the reform process. \n We commend the work of the United Nations in \nthe promotion of gender equality and welcome the \ncreation of a unified gender entity. I would like to \ncongratulate the new head of the United Nations Entity \nfor Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, \nthe former Chilean President Mrs. Michelle Bachelet, \non her appointment and to wish her every success in \nthat highly important post.  \n \n \n37 10-54965 \n \n This fall we also mark the tenth anniversary of \nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women and \npeace and security. We see it as an opportunity to \nreview implementation of the resolution with a view to \nidentifying best practices and challenges, particularly \nregarding equal participation of women in decision-\nmaking and the eradication of all types of gender-based \nviolence, especially in conflict situations. \n At this session we have a very important task \nahead of us: reviewing the work of the Human Rights \nCouncil. The Council has already shown itself capable \nof addressing many human rights situations and of \nadvancing human rights. I particularly wish to \nhighlight the independent work of the special \nprocedures and the establishment of the universal \nperiodic review mechanism. However, improvements \nare still necessary. I am confident that with goodwill, \nand with participation and input from all of us, the \nreview process will lead to a strengthened institution \nwith increased credibility and greater impact on the \nimprovement of human rights.  \n Latvia has always placed the promotion of human \nrights among its top priorities. We have therefore put \nforward our candidacy for the Human Rights Council \nfor the year 2014. \n The role of the United Nations in maintaining \ninternational peace and security is irreplaceable. We \nmust continue to work with all the means at our \ndisposal to create a more stable world. Latvia \nappreciates the positive momentum that was created at \nthe Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference \nearlier this year. Stabilizing and strengthening a \nnuclear non-proliferation regime is a shared \nresponsibility of all United Nations Members. As a \nmember of the international community, Latvia \nexpresses the hope that every diplomatic opportunity \nwill be used to find a comprehensive long-term \nsolution to the Iranian and North Korean nuclear \nissues. \n The New START treaty between the United \nStates and Russian Federation sets a powerful and \nremarkable example of real steps to reduce the threat of \nstrategic arms and to engage other Powers in fulfilling \nthe goals of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Latvia firmly \nsupports the nuclear security discussion initiated by \nPresident Obama. Promising signs on the international \nagenda have positively influenced European security \nand fostered the debate on conventional regimes in \nEurope. An ambitious road map is before us, and \ntogether we should all move forward to strengthen \nsecurity around the world. \n Stability and security in a number of regions \nremain on the international agenda. In the Middle East, \nthe international community must encourage the parties \nto move towards real compromises leading to a \ncomprehensive settlement of the conflict. Common \nefforts of the international community, including the \nQuartet, and the unity of Arab States are decisive to \nensure continuation of the peace process with a very \nclear final aim of establishing an independent, \ndemocratic and viable Palestinian State living side by \nside in peace with the State of Israel. \n We welcome the launch of direct negotiations \nbetween Israel and the Palestinian Authority and \ncommend all involved partners for their efforts. \nSustainable and durable solutions for Gaza, Palestinian \nreconciliation, and extension of the settlement \nmoratorium are crucial for the Palestinian State-\nbuilding process. We sincerely hope that the talks will \ncontinue in a constructive manner and be supplemented \nby negotiations on the Israel-Syria and Israel-Lebanon \ntracks towards comprehensive peace and stability in \nthe Middle East. \n A week ago the people of Afghanistan voted for \ntheir new parliament. The elections showed that the \nAfghanis are determined to build a peaceful and \nprosperous country that is at peace with its neighbours. \nWe commend the work done by the Independent \nElectoral Commission. The elections were conducted \nin a difficult security and political environment. It is of \nthe highest importance that the Government of \nAfghanistan corrects the irregularities caused by the \nharsh environment.  \n The international community plays a substantial \nrole in coordinating civilian efforts in Afghanistan. The \nwork of the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Representative \nmust be commended. The recently released Mid Year \nReport 2010 Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict \nis worrisome and shows how much work remains to be \ndone to improve the situation.  \n To be successful in Afghanistan, one should not \nforget the regional aspect of the issue. Stability in \nCentral Asia is an important factor for success in \nAfghanistan.  \n  \n \n10-54965 38 \n \n We are satisfied to see that the Kabul process is \nunder way and that the Government of Afghanistan is \nresolved to act in order to regain the trust of the \nAfghan people and to align the support of the \ninternational community behind the goals of national \ndevelopment. A well-coordinated effort is necessary to \nfollow up the Kabul commitments so that in 2014 the \nGovernment of Afghanistan will be able to take full \nresponsibility for the governance of the country. Latvia \nis therefore putting more emphasis on training Afghan \nsecurity forces, both army and police. In June, Latvia \ncarried out a training project for Afghan police officers \nin the field of criminal investigation.  \n Another important task is to foster Afghanistan\u2019s \neconomic and social development. Regional \ncooperation can be very useful in that effort, especially \nwith regard to energy and transport infrastructure. \nLatvia envisions multiple transport corridors \nconnecting Afghanistan to the neighbouring region, as \nwell as to Europe. \n I would like to refer to the European Union as an \nimportant partner of the United Nations. The United \nNations and the European Union share the same \nfundamental values \u2014 freedom, democracy, rule of \nlaw, human rights, equality and tolerance. It is our duty \nto work together to ensure that those values are not just \nwords but something to be enjoyed daily by everybody. \n The European Union has been changed through \nthe Lisbon Treaty. We hope that that change will give \nthe European Union a clearer voice in relations with \nour partners, including the United Nations. I hope that \nagreement will soon be reached to ensure the European \nUnion\u2019s effective participation in the work of the \nGeneral Assembly. \n Finally, I would like to touch on the economic \nslowdown in the global economy during the past \ncouple of years. Latvia was one of the countries hit \nhardest by the crisis. Now Latvia\u2019s economy is \nshowing signs of recovery. We have seen positive \ntrends in macroeconomic indicators since the \nbeginning of the year. We are on the way up. \n The reason for our recovery is the tough fiscal \nadjustment that Latvia has demonstrated since 2008. I \nam certain that other countries will need to go through \nconsiderable budgetary consolidation soon. Our \nexperience shows that it is possible, but only with the \nfull understanding and support of the population. \nLatvia has carried out large-scale reforms, and we are \nready to share our experience. That is one of the \nreasons why Latvia has put forward its candidature in \nthis year\u2019s elections to the Economic and Social \nCouncil. \n Prudence will be a key element to prevent future \neconomic crises, but not the only one. Global financial \ngovernance will be another such element. Latvia \ncommends the role and leadership shown by the Group \nof Twenty (G-20) countries. Financial governance \nshould be global, and we highly value the initiatives \nput forward towards that end by the G-20, international \nfinancial institutions and other forums. \n The world is entering the second decade of the \ntwenty-first century, and there are challenges to \nsecurity, peace and prosperity. They can be met only by \na common effort and the unity of mankind. I wish us \nall the wisdom and courage to maintain the higher \ninterest in the common good. Latvia looks forward to a \nfruitful sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly."

        "file_text": "Allow me, Sir, to \ncongratulate you on your well-deserved election to the \noffice of President at the sixty-fifth session of the \n  \n \n10-55122 24 \n \nGeneral Assembly. Your career as a leader and \ndiplomat speaks for itself. I assure you of my \ndelegation\u2019s support during your tenure of office. I \nshould also commend your predecessor, His Excellency \nMr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, for a job well done. \n The choice of theme for this session of the \nGeneral Assembly, namely, reaffirming the central role \nof the United Nations in global governance, is not only \napt but inspired. The founding of the United Nations \nwas propelled by the determination to save future \ngenerations from the scourge of war. It was driven by \nthe desire to reaffirm faith in fundamental human \nrights, the rule of law and, not least, to promote social \nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom. \n For the past 65 years, this Assembly of nations \nhas been convening here every year in pursuit of the \nlofty ideals of the United Nations. Yet for 65 years, the \nachievement of these ideals has eluded us. \nUnilateralism and war remain the order of the day. \nDisrespect for international law, vast economic \ninequities, injustice and suppression of basic freedoms \nare the challenges we face today, just as we did 65 \nyears ago. In addition, we have climate change, \nfinancial and economic crises, terrorism and religious \nintolerance to contend with. Needless to mention, such \nchallenges have heightened threats to world stability \nand international peace and security. \n Let the events of the first decade of this \nmillennium be a lesson for all of us to learn and \ntreasure. We have learned a lesson in the futility of \nunilateralism, intolerance and war; that selfishness in \nworld relations is suicidal. We have learned a lesson in \nthe value of collective decision-making and inclusive \ndevelopment, if our planet and its inhabitants are to \nsurvive. These lessons say to us that mankind must turn \naway from the path of self-destruction. The route to \npeace and stability is clear to all of us, yet we continue \nto lose ourselves in the wilderness of instability and \npoverty, because we are blinded by ulterior motives. \n If we value the lessons of the past decade, we \nmust accept that war is brutal, destructive and \nunacceptable. The founding fathers of the United \nNations were right when they affirmed the centrality of \nthe United Nations in global decision-making and \ngovernance. We must admit that great injustices are \nbeing committed during our times and that human \nrights are being trampled upon as we stand by silently. \n In this regard, for decades now, the people of \nWestern Sahara, Cuba and Palestine have been calling \non this august body for help in reversing the injustices, \nhumiliation and atrocities that are visited upon them by \ncolonialism, unilateral economic blockades and brutal \noccupation. Even today, the people of these territories \nare still calling. They are calling to you. Will you listen \nand respond, or will you look or walk away? Surely we \ncannot condone injustice and yet hope for peace. \nSustainable peace can only be based on justice and the \nprotection of basic freedoms for all. \n By the same token, Zimbabwe must be freed from \nunilateral sanctions, as her people work together under \nthe unity Government to determine their own future \nunder the leadership of their own choice. In addition, \nexternal interests must not be allowed to take \nprecedence over the desire of the people of Madagascar \nfor democracy and stability in their country. \n Somalia is a festering wound on the African \ncontinent. Let us rise to the appeal that was made by \nthe President of the Transitional Federal Government \nof Somalia to the Assembly a few days ago. He urged \nus to assist the people of Somalia to join the \ninternational movement for the achievement of peace, \nthe rule of law and the Millennium Development Goals \n(see ). \n Planet Earth is the only world in which we can \nlive in shared prosperity and peace. In the wake of the \ndevastating effects of climate change, we all converged \nin Copenhagen with optimism, but left with mixed \nfeelings following lack of international consensus and \nthe necessary political will. In the meantime, climate \nchange continues to wreak havoc, particularly in those \nvulnerable developing countries that do not have the \nmeans to adapt to or mitigate the impacts of global \nwarming. Lesotho signed the Copenhagen Accord \nbecause we believed that it represented a step forward, \neven though it did not fully satisfy our aspirations. It is \nour hope that, the forthcoming Conference in Canc\u00fan, \nMexico, will achieve international consensus, leading \nto a legally binding regime on the management of \nclimate change. \n The just-ended High-level Meeting on the \nMillennium Development Goals confirmed to us that \nthe recent economic and financial downturn has \ndisrupted our strategies for achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals by 2015. Despite this fact, we \nappeal to our development partners to fulfil their \n \n \n25 10-55122 \n \nofficial development assistance commitments to help \naccelerate our progress in the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n The world is still grappling with terrorism. For as \nlong as this menace exists, there will not be peace on \nEarth. Terrorism knows no boundaries and does not \nrespect human life. There is neither a country nor an \nindividual who can claim immunity from terrorism. \nTerrorist groups are benefiting from globalization by \ndecentralizing their operations, building new \npartnerships with armed groups, and using advanced \ntechnology to further their cause. This menace will not \nbe eradicated until we address the root causes, not the \nsymptoms, of terrorism. \n Religious intolerance is closely related to \nterrorism. We must acknowledge that religious \ntolerance is a prerequisite to international peace and \nstability, and that the world\u2019s diversity of cultures and \nreligions must be respected and tolerated, as it \nrepresents the strength and collective heritage of \nhumankind. Cultivation of the culture of religious \ntolerance must be inscribed high on the agenda of the \ninternational community. \n One of the fundamental conditions for \nmaintaining international peace and security is our \ncommitment to the disarmament and non-proliferation \nagenda. More than six decades after the founding of the \nUnited Nations, disarmament sadly remains a major \nchallenge for the international community. Today we \nsee a steadily growing list of de facto nuclear-weapon \nStates. Proliferation of the weapons of mass \ndestruction must stop. So must the development of new \ngenerations of nuclear weapons by nuclear-capable \nStates. We must strive for a nuclear-weapon-free \nworld. It is the responsibility of those States to stop \nthreatening the use of nuclear weapons as an option in \nthe pursuit of their foreign policy interests. Lesotho \nwill continue to join hands with all peace-loving \nnations to support international disarmament and \nnon-proliferation regimes. \n While the international community has registered \nsome successes in consolidating peace in some parts of \nthe world, a significantly large number of conflicts \nremain unresolved. Some of these conflicts are in \nAfrica. As African leaders, we purposefully declared \n2010 as the Year of Peace and Security in Africa. We \nresolved to find African solutions to African problems. \nHowever, we have acknowledged our shortcomings in \nterms of capacity in peacekeeping and peacebuilding. \nConsequently, we look to the international community \nto complement our efforts and resources in this regard. \nConflict-affected countries must also have the \nnecessary political will to accommodate and facilitate \nlegitimate external intervention that is intended to \nresolve conflict. At the same time, they must not \nabandon their primary responsibility as Governments \nto protect all their citizens. \n In conclusion, it is my considered view that all \nthese challenges can be overcome, if we accept that the \nUnited Nations is a place where a better and more \nsecure life for humankind must be championed. But its \nstructures should be reformed to efficiently fulfil this \nnoble mandate. Multilateral diplomacy should supplant \nthe traditional unilateral path in the resolution of \ndisputes. The United Nations must not be held hostage \nto the desires of any single country or group of States. \nIts actions should reflect as wide a consensus of \nMember States as possible. \n Let us continue to reaffirm the central role of the \nUnited Nations in global governance. Let us remember \nthat might can never be right and can never defeat \ncollective resolve. It is only then that collectively we \nshall be able to promote progress and better standards \nof life in larger freedom."

        "file_text": "Please permit me, Sir, on \nbehalf of the Belize delegation to congratulate you on \nyour election to the presidency of the sixty-fifth \nsession of the United Nations General Assembly. As \nmuch as our peoples share common values of peace \nand democracy, your country and my own could not be \nmore different. Switzerland is landlocked with a land \nmass twice the size and a population 25 times that of \nmy coastal country. Belize has a $1 billion economy \nand Switzerland has a $400 billion economy. Nominal \ngross domestic product per capita in Switzerland is \nestimated at $67,000, while in Belize that figure is \nroughly $4,000.  \n I bring up the differences between Belize and \nSwitzerland because they are illustrative of the stark \ndifferences that epitomize today\u2019s world. We in this \nHall tout sovereign equality, but we experience social \nand economic disparity on a daily basis, across the \nglobe. Inequality persists between nations and within \nnations. Poverty proliferates in the midst of plenty. \n In my own country, although real output per \ncapita grew over the past 10 years, so too did the \nproportion of Belizeans living in poverty. In other words, \nwe experienced growth without the commensurate \ndevelopment of our people. \n Belize accepts that development is a matter of \nnational responsibility. However, our contemporary \nreality now renders questions that were hitherto matters \nof national concern, matters of global concern. As a \nconsequence of globalization, the management \ncapacity of a State has diminished. Our macroeconomic \npolicy and fiscal capacity cannot adequately address \nthe multiple exogenous shocks occasioned, inter alia, \nby the triumvirate of the financial, food and fuel crises. \n Adequate and appropriate international support at \nthis time is therefore critical if we are to avoid drifting \nfurther and further away from the attainment of our \ndevelopment goals. In that connection, developed \nnations urgently need to make good their promise to \ndeliver 0.7 per cent of their GDP for official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA). \n For Belize, meaningful international support is \nbecoming increasingly harder to come by because of \nour designation as a middle-income country. While we \ncontinue to benefit from ODA and foreign direct \ninvestment in our quest to further integrate Belize into \nthe global economy, for the most part expensive \nforeign and local commercial debt has in fact fuelled \nthe country\u2019s development strategy. \n Thus, in the past 15 years, Belize has built up a \nhigh level of public debt, with high-cost long-term \nfinancing. The ratio of public debt to GDP grew \nsteadily, from about 27 per cent in 1995 to 70.3 per \ncent in 2008, with a peak of 87 per cent in 2005. That \n  \n \n10-55396 2 \n \ndebt-led strategy, which was the model of many other \ncountries, will surely become an unwelcome and \nunwanted burden for our children. \n Perennial debt-servicing obligations constrain my \nGovernment\u2019s capacity to increase social investments, \nespecially in those areas where they are most needed. It \nis therefore not surprising that Belize finds itself off \ntrack in meeting Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) on poverty, hunger, education and the \nempowerment of women. Considering the synergies \nbetween Goals, slippage in one threatens the \nachievement of others. \n The terms of engagement between international \nfinancial institutions and middle-income countries \nmust be revised if countries such as my own are to \nbreak away from the vicious cycle of debt-led \ndevelopment. While those terms will necessarily have \nto provide for suitable risk-mitigation strategies, they \nshould not be so burdensome as to constrain our policy \nspace. They must respect the national ownership of our \ndevelopment initiatives. International cooperation and \nsupport therefore must complement, rather than dictate, \nthe way forward. \n While Belize\u2019s traditional donors have long \nprovided valuable assistance, for which we will always \nbe grateful, we are now benefiting from new modalities \nof cooperation, which are yielding more direct and \nimmediate returns for our people. Belize\u2019s cooperation \nexperience with Taiwan exemplifies a model of \ncooperation based on partnership. With the help of the \nGovernment of Taiwan, Belize has steadily developed \nits capacity in agricultural research, aquaculture, \neducation and social-sector investment. \n In the Latin American and Caribbean region, \ncooperation has long been based on that approach. \nBelize has benefited immensely from partnerships with \nCuba, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela. Of special \nsignificance is the cooperation in the health sector. In \nfact, today the progress that we can claim on the \nhealth-related MDGs is a testament, in part, to those \npartnerships. \n Beyond our hemispheric relations, we are forging \nnew partnerships. We recently received two years\u2019 \nworth of emergency relief materials from the United \nArab Emirates, for which we are most appreciative, \ngiven the frequency of hurricane visitations to our \nshores in recent years. Through those partnerships, \nBelize is being enabled to pursue its broader national \ndevelopment objectives. Our experience is being \nreplicated the world over, as we see in other examples \nof South-South cooperation. We need now to make \nthose partnerships the standard for global cooperation. \n At the United Nations, we have long focused on \nofficial development assistance as being synonymous \nwith global partnerships. That myopic view needs to be \nbroadened, and we must disabuse ourselves of the \ndonor-driven dialectic. The United Nations has the \nresponsibility to craft a new orientation, from a donor-\nrecipient culture to one of true partnership with mutual \nrespect.  \n As every speaker in this debate has emphasized, \nin order for this institution to meet that challenge, it \nmust itself reform. \n Current decision-making structures and \norganization tend towards a North-South polarity. That \ndynamic imperils cooperation and renders debate more \nceremony than meaningful dialogue. Over the 65 years \nof the United Nations existence, our world has \nchanged. We are dealing with new realities. The \nOrganization is nearly universal, with 192 countries \nrepresented here. The club of nuclear-power States has \nexpanded, and may yet continue to expand. Global \nintegration has deepened with technology, market \nliberalization and the freer movement of capital. Our \ninterdependence has generated global systemic risks.  \n We need a United Nations that reflects more \nequitable North-South representation and that can \neffectively deliver. That means that the organs of the \nUnited Nations must be reformed. The process of \ndecision-making must ensure coherence and be \ninclusive. Above all, equity and justice must inform \nour mechanisms for delivery. The reform we seek goes \nmuch deeper than the changing of the guards; it is a \nreform that would rebuild trust among each other and \nconfidence in the system. \n Belize is crafting a twenty-first century vision for \na modern, green and sustainable economy predicated \non capacity-building, human dignity, human \ndevelopment and innovation. Our Government is \nworking towards building domestic capital through \nsocial investments, job creation, improved access to \ncredit and combating crime and violence. \n To that end, we have launched project Restore \nBelize, which encompasses a comprehensive anti-crime \ninitiative complemented by a socio-economic \n \n \n3 10-55396 \n \ncomponent aimed at restoring the social fabric of our \nsociety through the provision of skills training, \ncontinuing education for adults, infrastructure \ndevelopment and fostering civic pride. We have \ninstituted school feeding programmes, subsidies for \nstudents of secondary schools, seed programmes for \nfarmers and capitalization of our own development \nfinance corporation for onward lending to \nentrepreneurs.  \n The Government has also undertaken a national \nmultiparty and multisectoral consultative process to \nredefine our national development objectives in our \nHorizon 2030 project. In addition, the Prime Minister \nhas established a council of science advisers to better \ninform the Horizon 2030 process on the integration of \nscience and technology in the national development \nagenda. \n Belize is resolutely embracing its responsibility \nfor its national development. Our efforts are aimed \ntowards ensuring that we achieve the type of \ndevelopment that genuinely affords all our people the \nopportunity to realize their true potential with dignity. \nTo that end, we seek only empathy and partnership \nfrom the United Nations, not charity."

        "file_text": "May I, on behalf of \nthe Myanmar delegation and on my own behalf, begin \nby extending to the President our warm congratulations \non his well-deserved election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. We are \nconfident that under his wise and able leadership our \ndeliberations will produce fruitful results. Allow me \nalso to express my delegation\u2019s appreciation to his \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki \nof the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. \n There is no doubt that the United Nations is the \nbest forum for practising multilateralism to address the \nchallenges facing the world today. The near-universal \nparticipation of the world\u2019s nations in this global body \nis a living testimony to that. At the heart of its Charter \nlies the maintenance of international peace and security \nas the main noble purpose of the United Nations, which \nall Member States are committed to strive for. \n While the United Nations has been devoting the \nlarger portion of its attention to maintaining \ninternational peace and security, new forms of global \nchallenges such as climate change, poverty, hunger, \nwater and energy insecurity have emerged and demand \nthe international community\u2019s urgent and careful \nattention. At the same time, humankind\u2019s shared dream \nof making the world a prosperous, peaceful, just and \n \n \n15 10-55264 \n \nsecure place remains elusive. The world today remains \nfull of inequality, injustice, conflict, instances of the \nuse of force, interference in the internal affairs of \nStates and attempts to impose domination on \ndeveloping nations. \n Against that backdrop, the pre-eminent role of the \nUnited Nations in advancing peace, security and \ndevelopment must be asserted and enhanced in order to \neffectively address those daunting challenges. We \ntherefore wish to stress the pressing need for \nstrengthening the United Nations with speedy reform \nmeasures, adapting it to present-day realities in order \nto make it more democratic and effective in meeting \ngrowing challenges. \n Myanmar firmly believes that any reform effort \nmust be aimed at strengthening the central role of the \nUnited Nations in global governance. We share the \nwidespread view that the United Nations must be \nreformed to reflect its increasing membership and to \npush for internal reform measures, including \nrevitalization of the General Assembly and reform of \nthe Security Council. We share the view that the reform \nof the Council must be designed to make it more \ntransparent, more efficient and more accountable. We \nalso support the idea of expanding both categories of \nCouncil membership. \n With only five years remaining before the target \ndeadline, the international community must step up its \nefforts to realize the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) by 2015. We therefore welcome the successful \nconvening of the High-level Plenary Meeting on the \nMDGs and its sideline activities last week here in New \nYork. While important improvements have been made \nglobally, progress towards achieving our MDG targets \nis not sufficient as yet. \n Progress remains uneven and varies from region \nto region. While national Governments have the \nprimary responsibility to ensure progress, the \ninternational community must help by creating an \nenvironment that would enable developing countries to \nmake greater strides on their road to development. \nInternational assistance plays an important catalytic \nrole in the developing countries\u2019 efforts to attain their \ndevelopment goals. \n We therefore wish to emphasize here that \nfulfilment by developed countries of their official \ndevelopment assistance commitments, increased \ninvestment flows, market access and resolution of debt \nproblems are essential to enabling the developing \ncountries to realize their MDG targets. It is high time \nthat the unjust and coercive economic measures and \ntrade embargoes that are hampering the attainment of \nthe MDGs and the development of the developing \ncountries, and thus hurting the people, be removed. \n We are pleased to report that despite challenges, \nMyanmar has made certain progress towards achieving \nmost of the eight MDGs in varying degrees, especially \nin areas such as poverty alleviation, food security and \nthe promotion of education and health. \n As a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \nof Nuclear Weapons and to the Treaty on the South-\nEast Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone, Myanmar has all \nalong recognized the legitimate right of every State to \nthe use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. \nHowever, we firmly oppose the proliferation or \nproduction of nuclear weapons and strongly support \nany efforts leading to realization of the vision of a \nnuclear-weapon-free world. \n Therefore we heartily welcomed the signing of \nthe New START treaty by the leaders of the United \nStates and the Russian Federation with a view to \nreducing their respective nuclear arsenals. It gave us \nhope and expectation with respect to the elimination of \nnuclear weapons and further reduction and limitation \nof strategic offensive arms. We also join others in \ncalling for the early entry into force and full \nimplementation of the New START treaty. \n In our noble fight against growing transnational \ncrime and terrorism, no single country can act alone, as \nit requires a global solution and concerted action by the \nworld\u2019s nations. Myanmar unequivocally condemns all \nforms and manifestation of terrorism. We are working \nclosely with the international community to strengthen \nour efforts and cooperation in regional and multilateral \nframeworks in order to prevent and combat terrorism \nand transnational crime, such as illicit drug trafficking, \ntrafficking in persons and cybercrime. We are also \nworking together with fellow members of the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations to step up \nefforts to deal with prevention, control, preparedness \nand response to pandemic diseases in our region. \n The issue of climate change has become a \npressing global challenge that threatens humankind. \nThe environmental problem knows no national \nboundaries; no country can be insulated from the \nconsequences of climate change. The unprecedented \n  \n \n10-55264 16 \n \nfrequency and severity of recent natural disasters, such \nas the earthquake in Haiti, floods in China and Pakistan \nand heat waves around the world, clearly testify to the \nconsequences of global climate change. \n Myanmar was also a victim of climate change in \nMay 2008, when it was hit by the devastating Cyclone \nNargis, the strongest ever in our history. After more \nthan two years we are pleased to say that we have now \npassed the emergency relief stage and successfully \nrebuilt better in the affected areas through our massive \nreconstruction efforts, together with the United \nNations, ASEAN and the international community. I \nwish to take this opportunity to express our \nappreciation to the international community for all the \nhumanitarian assistance to Myanmar in response to that \nnatural disaster. \n In addressing the pressing global issue of climate \nchange we must redouble our efforts not only to reduce \nharmful greenhouse gas emissions but also to provide \nfinancial resources and technology to developing \ncountries so that they might take effective mitigation \nand adaptation measures. Although industrialized \ncountries are mainly responsible for climate change, \nthe developing countries are the most severely affected \nby its consequences. Myanmar therefore believes that \nany approach to address climate change must be based \non the principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibilities and respective capabilities. \n We therefore look forward to the United Nations \nClimate Change Conference in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, later \nthis year. We hope the negotiations in that Conference \nwill result in fruitful outcomes that will translate into \nconcrete action on commitments made by the \ndeveloped countries to reduce substantive emissions \nand to assist developing countries in their mitigation \nand adaptation efforts. \n May I take this opportunity to briefly apprise this \nAssembly of ongoing political developments in my \ncountry, Myanmar. \n Today, Myanmar is at a critical phase of its \npolitical transformation. The multiparty-democracy \ngeneral elections are set to be held on 7 November \n2010, as the fifth step of our charted political road \nmap. A total of 37 political parties, including those \nrepresenting various ethnic nationalities and groups, \nwill take part. Over 3,000 candidates will contest for a \ntotal of 1,171 seats in the Peoples\u2019 Parliament, the \nNational Parliament and state/regional parliaments. \nSuch a large participation has made it crystal clear that \nthe elections have become virtually inclusive. Political \nparties have already started their campaign activities. \nThe people will exercise their democratic right to elect \nthe representatives of their choice who can best serve \ntheir interests. \n Based upon its ample experience and lessons \nlearned in holding multiparty general elections, \nMyanmar is confident of its ability to conduct the \nelections in an orderly manner. Whatever challenges \nmay face us, we are committed to do our best to hold \nsuccessful, free and fair general elections in the best \ninterest of the country and its people. \n As our new State Constitution subscribes to the \npresent foreign policy, we believe that the new \nGovernment to emerge after the elections will continue \nto embrace the policy of maintaining and strengthening \nfriendly relations with all nations and will work closely \nwith the United Nations. Myanmar looks forward to \nstrengthening closer engagements with the \ninternational community in the post election era."

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, allow me to extend my congratulations and \nthose of the Togolese people to Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fifth session and to wish him every success in the \naccomplishment of his great task. My delegation will \nspare no effort in working at his side towards the \nsuccessful achievement of his mandate. Like him, we \nare firmly convinced that the values that lie at the heart \nof the United Nations remain very relevant today to \nsuccessfully meeting the challenges facing humankind.  \n I also congratulate his predecessor for his \ninvaluable efforts during his term of office to advance \nthe agenda of the General Assembly in many diverse \nand different areas, in particular those of peace and \nsecurity, human rights and the development of our \nnations. \n I would like to renew my personal support and \nthat of my country to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \nfor the dynamism he has shown over the course of the \npast four years at the head of the United Nations. I also \ntake this opportunity to congratulate him on the \nimportant report that he introduced to us yesterday on \nthe work of the Organization (A/65/1). \n The theme that the President of the General \nAssembly has proposed for the current session, \n\u201cReaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \nglobal governance\u201d, eloquently translates the \naspirations of our States, particularly the developing \ncountries. The theme implies that the United Nations \nmust remain at the heart of multilateralism and that the \ninstitutions of our Organization must therefore be \nreconsidered, beginning with the long-awaited reform \nof the Security Council, in order to bring greater \ndemocracy and equity and, above all, to respond more \neffectively to the many challenges to our world.  \n In its own search for better governance and the \nwell-being of its people, my country, Togo, has \ntirelessly and irreversibly continued its march towards \ngreater democracy, freedom and justice in an \nenvironment of peace and stability. Seeking to turn the \npage once and for all on the dark years of our \ndemocratic deficit, the Head of State has established a \nnew policy of openness. In August 2006, this \ncommendable initiative led to the signing of the \nComprehensive Political Agreement among the main \npolitical actors in Togo and to the establishment of a \nGovernment of national unity and the holding in \nOctober 2007 of legislative elections that were \nuniversally recognized as free and transparent and, for \nthe first time, without violence. These elections, which \nestablished a pluralist National Assembly, are without a \ndoubt the emblem of our democratic renaissance.  \n The Government has since initiated political and \neconomic reforms leading to the adoption of a statute \nof the opposition and of a law on the financing of \npolitical parties; the consensus appointment of \nmembers of the National Independent Electoral \nCommission; and the creation of a security force for \nthe presidential elections, the members of which are \ntrained according to universally recognized standards \nand have maintained security throughout the electoral \nprocess in an exemplary fashion. All of these efforts \nnaturally allowed Togo to hold, on 4 March 2010, a \npresidential election that was democratic, peaceful and \nwidely praised by the international community.  \n I reiterate here the profound gratitude of the \nGovernment and people of Togo to all of our partners, \n  \n \n10-54965 42 \n \nto regional and international institutions, and to the \nfriendly countries that supported us throughout the \nelectoral process, making it a success and a good \nexample. Our gratitude goes to the United Nations for \nits many forms of support throughout the process of \ndemocratization and consolidation.  \n I would also encourage the United Nations to \ninvest even more in preventive democracy by, \ninter alia, beginning to envision mechanisms that could \nlead all parties to accept the results of elections that are \nrecognized as credible and transparent by the \ninternational community. That is a challenge we have \nto take up, particularly in our young democracies, and \nespecially the African democracies, so that the post-\nelectoral period is no longer a nightmare or a source of \ndivision among our peaceful populations. \n Notwithstanding his outstanding victory, and \nfaithful to his policy of reaching out to his opponents, \nPresident Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 appealed to all persons of \ngood will to take part in the building of the Togolese \nnation. It was in this vein that an historic political \nagreement was concluded in May between the \npresidential majority and the Union des Forces de \nChangement, the main opposition party in Togo, which, \nwith seven ministerial posts, has for the first time \njoined a Government after 40 years of political \nfighting.  \n Moreover, the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation \nCommission, which seeks to promote reconciliation \namong the Togolese people by shedding light on the \npolitical violence that took place in Togo between 1958 \nand 2005, is currently in the depositions phase. My \ncountry will work tirelessly to consolidate the \nachievements of democracy and peace, while devoting \nincreasing efforts and energy to the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) in order to \nbring human and sustainable development to the entire \npopulation. Now that Togo has reconciled with itself, I \nhave faith in our capacity to fully renew our relations \nwith all of our bilateral and multilateral partners and to \nopen up new horizons in the vast field of solidarity that \nis international cooperation. \n Although there are some positive signs of the \nrecovery of the world economy, it is no exaggeration to \nsay that the path to stabilization and the suppression of \nthe disturbing effects of the crisis is still long, perilous \nand uncertain.  \n The new problem of climate change has brought \nin its wake catastrophes linked to rainfall phenomena, \nsuch as floods, drought and landslides. Without a \ndoubt, all of these phenomena will have a negative \nimpact on global economic growth in general and, \nmore specifically, a tragic effect on the least developed \ncountries in particular. Despite this threat, we still \nhesitate to reach agreement, as was demonstrated \nrecently by the Copenhagen Conference on innovative \nand proactive strategies to significantly reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions, on the one hand, and, on the \nother hand, to pursue discussions to adopt as soon as \npossible a schedule for concluding a new agreement to \nsucceed the Kyoto Protocol. The time for speeches is \nover; the time to act is now. \n The High-level Plenary Meeting that we have just \nheld here on the implementation of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals revealed once again the intrinsic \nlink between aid and development, on the one hand, \nand development and political will, on the other, at the \nnational and international levels. The modest results \nmy country has achieved with respect to the MDGs \ncould have been better, and we would have been closer \nto attaining them within the deadlines set if we had not \nbeen deprived for far too many years of the precious \nhelp afforded by development aid.  \n The peaceful political climate being enjoyed by \nmy country will also enable us to effectively pursue the \nimprovement of the management of our public finances \nso that we are able to devote more domestic resources \nto achieving the MDGs. However, the efforts \nundertaken by poor countries to consolidate the bases \nof sustainable development will be a genuine success \nonly if developed countries provide them with their \nvarious forms of assistance and if they honour their \ncommitments. Let us not close our eyes to this fact. We \nneed better aid in terms of quantity and quality.  \n Although the international community can \nwelcome the fact that the number of armed conflicts in \nthe world has fallen, we cannot forget that several \npeacekeeping operations of the United Nations are still \nunder way. That is undeniable proof that we are still far \nfrom the ideal of international peace and security that \nthe founding fathers of the United Nations envisaged. \nCivil wars and terrorism continue to plunge many \nfamilies into mourning throughout the world. More \nthan wars, terrorism today is the most murderous form \nof violence inflicted upon people because it attacks \nindiscriminately, killing children, men, women and the \n \n \n43 10-54965 \n \nelderly. The eradication of terrorism in all its forms is a \nlong-term task and the responsibility above all of \nStates and the international community acting in \nsolidarity. They are obligated to find the best way to \nfight this phenomenon. In this regard, prevention, \nprotection, prosecution and punishment, as well as \ninternational cooperation, must remain the main focus \nof State action. \n While Member States struggle to find a definition \nof terrorism in order to better fight it, the scourge is \naffecting an increasing number of countries because of \nthe support that terrorists receive, particularly from \ndrug trafficking networks. In West Africa, all leaders \nhave become aware of the threat posed by drug \ntrafficking and are engaged in a fight to the death \nagainst the phenomenon. I call on wealthy countries to \nhelp fight drug trafficking in my subregion in order to \nprevent it from becoming an unstable zone of \nunrestrained violence. \n The purposes and principles for which the United \nNations Organization was created are noble, but \n65 years after its birth the work that remains to be done \nis immense because the social situation of the \ninhabitants of the planet does not always follow the \ndevelopment that our world has achieved. Poverty and \ndestitution are not mere words; they are oppressive \nrealities experienced day by day. They lead to violence, \ninstability, conflicts and other scourges that we, today, \nare not fighting successfully. Only international \nsolidarity will allow us to overcome the evils of this \nworld."

        "file_text": "This great body has been \nin existence for two thirds of a century \u2014 three times \nlonger than its predecessor body, the League of \nNations, and longer than previous attempts to fashion a \ncontinuing collective approach to the common \nproblems of nation States. The question we must ask \nourselves today is whether the United Nations remains \neffective in confronting the challenges of our time. \n The United Nations was established in the grim \naftermath of the two deadliest conflicts in human \nhistory, in which close to 80 million people were killed \nand entire families and almost entire generations lost \nfor all time. The world came together out of necessity. \nThere had to be a better way, and in the decades since \nwe first met at San Francisco, we have managed to \navoid another world war, although at times that seemed \nless than certain. \n Today, we are faced with a different set of \nchallenges and in different strategic, political and \neconomic circumstances. We now live in a world that is \nmore multipolar and more interconnected than ever \nbefore. We are confronted with the double-edged sword \nof globalization. The transformation of the global \neconomy has increased living standards and lifted \nmany hundreds of millions out of poverty. \n At the same time, the increased interdependence \nof global financial markets ensured that no country \nconnected to the world economy was spared the impact \nof the global financial crisis. Furthermore, the rapid \ntransformation of global communications and the \nradical increase in global people movements have \nimproved the well-being of all humankind. But equally, \nthey have created or at least amplified a new set of \nsecurity threats to all humankind: pandemic diseases, \ntransnational organized crime and the continuing threat \nof global terrorism. There is also the global challenge \nof climate change. The unconstrained carbon emissions \nof one State impact on the long-term survival of all \nStates. Climate change respects no national or \ngeographic boundaries and thus simultaneously \ndemands both national and integrated global responses. \n So two thirds of a century after our formation, we \nthe United Nations now face increasingly complex \nglobal challenges in an increasingly fragmented world \nand a much more contested international space. These \nnew global realities create an imperative for \nresponsive, representative and, most critically, \neffective systems of global governance. \n If we fail to make the United Nations work and to \nmake its institutions relevant to the great challenges we \nall now face, the uncomfortable fact is that the United \nNations will become a hollow shell. Nation States may \nretain its form, but will increasingly seek to go around \nit and deploy other mechanisms to achieve real results. \n And that is the question we all face today. It is a \nquestion of our collective political will to make the \nexisting institutions work and combine the existing and \nunique legitimacy of the United Nations system with a \nnew-found effectiveness on security, development and \nclimate change. \n The United Nations has most of the essential \nstructures in place, but if the structures are to work we \nmust harness the political will necessary to make them \nwork. In other words, we must enable the institutions \nwe have created to do the job for which they were \ncreated. Put even more starkly, we must do that which \nwe say. If we have a Conference on Disarmament, it \nshould do disarmament \u2014 not pretend. If we have a \nconvention on climate change, it must do the job to \ntackle climate change \u2014 not just talk about it, and \nsimilarly with development. Otherwise, the credibility \nof the United Nations in the eyes of the world and our \nown citizens will eventually collapse. The international \ncommunity can no longer tolerate the actions of a few \ndissenting States to roadblock the common resolve of \nthe many. \n The international community faces the continuing \nchallenge of international terrorism. Terrorism knows \nno geographic or political boundaries. We are now in \nthe tenth year since terrorists launched their murderous \nattack on this great city of New York. The threat of \ninternational terrorism remains alive. It continues to \nchallenge civilized norms, to generate fear and \ninsecurity, and to take innocent civilian lives in many \nparts of the world. \n \n \n41 10-55103 \n \n The outlawing of terrorist organizations under the \nprovisions of the relevant Security Council resolutions, \ntogether with the individual and cooperative measures \ntaken by Member States, reflect the unprecedented \nlevels of international collaboration in responding to \nthe worldwide threat of terrorism. \n As part of the effort to combat terrorism, many \nMember States have their armed forces and other \npersonnel committed to Afghanistan, again sanctioned \nby Security Council resolutions. These brave soldiers, \npolice officers and aid workers, representing so many \nof the countries represented here in the General \nAssembly, including Australia, remain in Afghanistan \nfollowing many years of conflict. \n The result is that Afghanistan no longer \nrepresents an unimpeded base for the global operations \nof terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaida. The result \nis also that we are all contributing to the security and \nstability of Afghanistan as a nation. This has been a \ndifficult war, but our collective resolve is strong \nenough to prevent Afghanistan from once again \nbecoming a base for the export of terrorism. \n Beyond Afghanistan, terrorism continues to \nremain a threat to people of all faiths and civilizations. \nWe must remain nationally and internationally vigilant \nagainst the possibility of further terrorist attacks. The \nthreat remains real. \n We must equally be concerned about the \ncontinued challenge of nuclear proliferation. Violations \nof the non-proliferation regime by States such as the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and Iran \nrepresent a potent and potential threat to us all. It is for \nthis reason that Australia provides robust support to the \nUnited Nations sanctions regime against both the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and Iran. \n The United Nations has played a critical role in \npromoting the goal of a world without nuclear \nweapons. Non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament \nare mutually reinforcing processes and cannot be \nseparated. \n Australia\u2019s activism on arms control and \ndisarmament remains undiminished. And there remains \nmuch urgent work to be done. In 1996, Australia \nsponsored the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \nin this Assembly to ensure its adoption. Since then, \n182 States have signed the Treaty and 153 have ratified \nit. Nine more States are needed to ratify in order for the \nTreaty to enter into force. Australia welcomes recent \nstatements by Indonesia and the United States \nconcerning their intention to ratify the Treaty, and we \nwould urge all States that to date have failed to indicate \ntheir intention to ratify the Treaty to do so in order to \nenable it to enter into force. \n The most recent Treaty on the Non-proliferation \nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) Review Conference was \nheld earlier this year. Australia and Japan worked \nclosely together in the lead-up to the Conference, \nincluding through the jointly sponsored report of the \nInternational Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation \nand Disarmament (ICNND), prepared by the former \nForeign Minister of Australia, Gareth Evans, and his \nJapanese counterpart, Yoriko Kawaguchi. This \nsignificant report provided substantial momentum in \nthe lead-up to the Review Conference. We believe that \nthe Evans-Kawaguchi report of the ICNND also \nrepresents the most comprehensive, practical and \ncontemporary blueprint for the international \ncommunity to both consider and adopt a \ncomprehensive arms control and non-proliferation \nagenda. \n The Review Conference agreed by consensus on \n64 sets of actions. And Australia and Japan took the \ninitiative this week in New York to jointly host a cross-\nregional meeting of Foreign Ministers, with the aim of \nworking towards the implementation of those 64 \nactions. The potential catastrophe of nuclear conflict \nmeans that the status quo is not an option. We must \nmove ahead with the negotiation of a fissile material \ncut-off treaty, and we must ensure that the United \nNations disarmament machinery is doing its job. \n On the wider question of security, the Australian \nGovernment, under Prime Minister Gillard, warmly \nwelcomes the statement to this Assembly by the \nPresident of the United States concerning his efforts to \nachieve a comprehensive, just and sustainable peace in \nthe Middle East (see ). Australia\u2019s position \nremains constant: such a settlement must allow both \nIsrael and a future Palestinian State to live side by side \nin peace and security. Australia calls on all parties to \nput their shoulders to the wheel, to seize the historic \nopportunity that now presents itself to bring about a \nlasting peace. All States members of the General \nAssembly should welcome the prospect of both an \nIsraeli and a Palestinian State being represented at the \nsixty-sixth session of the Assembly, to be held next \nyear. \n  \n \n10-55103 42 \n \n Over the past several years, Australia has \npromoted the concept of an Asia-Pacific community \ninvolving the active membership in the future \narchitecture of our region of both the United States and \nthe Russian Federation. Australia therefore welcomes \nthe imminent membership of the United States and \nRussia in the East Asia Summit. The East Asia Summit \nleaders will take this historic decision in Hanoi in \nOctober. Australia, as a founding member of the East \nAsia Summit, looks forward to contributing to the \nevolution of this wider sense of community across this, \nthe most dynamic region of the world. \n On questions of wider human security, Australia \nremains fully engaged on international and regional \nchallenges, including irregular movements of people, \norganized crime and people-smuggling. \n The most immediate and pressing threat to the \nphysical security of Australia\u2019s wider region lies in the \nscourge of natural disasters. The Asia-Pacific region \nhas seen tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanoes and floods \non a massive scale. Australia proposes that the \ninternational community consider afresh our capacity \nto respond rapidly, coherently and proportionately to \nlarge-scale natural disasters. \n Within our own region, Australia argues that this \nwould also represent an effective benefit to the peoples \nand countries of our region, which are particularly \nprone to natural disasters. It would also in time \nconstitute a valuable confidence- and security-building \nmeasure among the armed forces, emergency services \nand security agencies of the various nation-States of \nthe Asia Pacific. The magnitude of what I witnessed \nlast week when I was in Pakistan underlines the \nimportance of better planning, preparation and \ncoordination to deal with natural disasters on a mass \nscale. We cannot afford simply to wait for another such \ndisaster to occur before realizing that the resources of \nthe United Nations and its agencies are simply \nincapable of meeting challenges of such an order of \nmagnitude. \n The challenges to global economic stability \nremain significant. The full impact of the global \nfinancial crisis is not yet clear. There are still systemic \nproblems within the global financial system. These \nmust be dealt with through the appropriate national and \ninternational institutions if we are to remove the \nunderlying causes of the crisis that began in the United \nStates in September 2008 and then proceeded to ravage \nthe economies and the working people of the world. \n Beyond the specific reforms necessary in the \nglobal financial system, the parallel problem of global \nfinancial imbalances must also be addressed. These \nhave formed part of the Group of 20 (G-20) agenda, in \nwhich Australia is active. The objectives of the \nFramework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced \nGrowth agreed to by the G-20 States at their Pittsburgh \nsummit in September 2009 remain essential and must \nbe implemented if we are to act on the causes of the \nrecent crisis. \n Last December, the nations of the world \nassembled in Copenhagen for the Conference of the \nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change (UNFCCC). Australia was an \nactive participant at Copenhagen. Together with a \nnumber of other States, Australia worked tirelessly to \nproduce the Copenhagen Accord. The Accord did not \nrepresent all that the international community needed \nthen in order to bring about a comprehensive response \nto the continuing challenge of climate change. It did, \nhowever, represented four significant advances. \n For the first time, the Accord entrenched 2\u00b0C or \nless as the limit beyond which global temperatures \ncould not be allowed to rise in order to avoid \nirretrievable climate change for the planet. \n For the first time, both developed and developing \ncountries accepted that they had responsibilities to \nbring about this outcome. \n For the first time, developed and developing \ncountries agreed to develop a framework for the \nmeasurement, reporting and verification of mitigation \nactions. \n And for the first time, developed countries \ncommitted themselves to mobilizing an amount \napproaching $30 billion in international public \nfinancing for immediate action in developing countries \nto 2012, and to work towards a goal of mobilizing \n$100 billion annually by 2020 in funding from all \nsources. \n Much, however, remains to be done. Australia \nbelieves the international community must urgently \naddress the particular climate-change adaptation needs \nof the world\u2019s most vulnerable States, in particular the \nisland countries of the Pacific, the Caribbean and the \nIndian Ocean. \n \n \n43 10-55103 \n \n One significant area of progress in the period \nahead lies in the proper protection, preservation and \nreforestation of the world\u2019s rainforests. Collectively, \nrainforest degradation and deforestation in developing \ncountries represents about one fifth of global \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Australia stands ready to act \nwith other States, including Norway, to build on the \nwork already done, in order to achieve an effective \noutcome in this area as rapidly as possible. The \ninternational community needs to see an early sign of \nreal success in our international efforts to combat \nclimate change. We believe that action on rainforests, \nthrough what is called the REDD-plus set of \ninitiatives \u2014 on reducing emissions from deforestation \nand forest degradation in developing countries \u2014 \nrepresents one such area of possible early advance. \n Australia is now active on both the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s High-level Panels, on global sustainability \nand on climate change finance. This, added to our \ncontinued participation in the UNFCCC, means that \nAustralia will continue to be among the most globally \nactive States in global forums for bringing about a \ncomprehensive and effective global response to climate \nchange. In doing so, the Governments of the world will \nhave to closely consider new growth models that \nincorporate both the concept and the reality of lower-\ncarbon economies. \n For the economies of the world, this \ntransformation \u2014 which some have called the next \nindustrial revolution \u2014 also represents an \nunprecedented opportunity for investment and \nemployment as the global economy embraces new \nefficiency measures and new renewable energy \nstrategies. The international community needs to \nembrace a new way of looking at climate change, \nwhich sees action on climate change providing new \nindustries, new investment and new job opportunities \nfor the future. \n All Governments represented in the Assembly \nparticipated in the High-level Plenary Meeting on the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Australia \nfully embraces the MDG framework. \n This week, in New York, we said that our aid \nprogramme has doubled over the last five years and is \nprojected to double again by 2015. Over time, more of \nour aid will go to the least developed countries, and we \nwill continue to give high priority to assisting the \nworld\u2019s small island States, particularly our Pacific \nneighbours, in recognition of their special needs. \n We expect to invest some $5 billion in education \nby 2015, including support for universal primary \neducation. Australia also expects to invest at least \n$1.6 billion in women\u2019s and children\u2019s health up to \n2015. \n Australia applauds the initiative to create a new \ninstitution entitled UN Women, under the capable \nleadership of the new Under-Secretary-General, \nMichelle Bachelet, former President of Chile. Australia \nlooks forward to working with UN Women on the vast \narray of challenges which half of humanity faces and \nfor which our existing international frameworks have \nbeen found wanting. The education of women and girls \nand the security of women and girls from violence and \nsexual abuse and exploitation must now become a core \npart of our global campaign for a fairer world. \n Human rights abuses and humanitarian crises in \nfailing States continue to plague us. We must enhance \nthe negotiations on the responsibility to protect and \nsupport the mandate of the International Criminal \nCourt. We must also continue to speak out against \nflagrant abuses. \n Often it is the indigenous peoples of the world \nwho suffer most. I am proud of Australia\u2019s apology to \nour own indigenous peoples and our policy of closing \nthe gap between indigenous and non-indigenous \nAustralians. I am also proud of Australia\u2019s support for \nthe Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. \nAustralia is making a major effort in the treatment of \nour indigenous peoples, although we still have a long \nway to go. \n Australia is a founding Member of the United \nNations. We have been active in this institution for the \nlast 65 years. \n We are also a candidate for the Security Council \nfor the 2013-2014 term. Australia has contributed \n65,000 of our number to 52 different peacekeeping \nmissions across the world. We remain active in several \nsuch peace operations today, including in Cyprus, \nSudan, Timor-Leste and Afghanistan. \n Over the years, Australia has a led a number of \nsignificant United Nations initiatives, including the \nCambodia peace settlement and the conclusion of the \nComprehensive Test-Ban Treaty and the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, as well as leading the force that \n  \n \n10-55103 44 \n \nstabilized Timor-Leste after its people voted for \nindependence. \n Australia remains intimately engaged in all the \nfunds, programmes and specialized agencies of the \nUnited Nations. We are also active in other \ninternational institutions, including the \nCommonwealth. \n Australia is the twelfth largest source of funding \nfor the United Nations budget. Australia pays in full \nand on time. We always seek to do that which we say \nwe will do. \n Australia wants to be part of the solution to the \nmany challenges that the international community now \nfaces, not just point to the problems. Australia believes \nin the power of creative ideas and active diplomacy to \nsolve long-standing international problems. Australia \nvalues good international citizenship. It is for these \nreasons that Australia has been committed to the \nUnited Nations since the very beginning. \n The United Nations is inevitably imperfect. As \nthe Organization\u2019s second Secretary-General \u2014 the \ngreat Swede, Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld \u2014 famously said, \n\u201cThe United Nations was not created in order to bring \nus to heaven, but in order to save us from hell\u201d. \n Our responsibility today is to fulfil the vision that \nour forebears had for this great institution 65 years \nago. Our responsibility is to make the United Nations \nfulfil its mission \u2014 to make the United Nations work \nthrough the combined political will of all Member \nStates."

        "file_text": "The Headquarters \nof the United Nations is currently undergoing a major \nrenovation, and that is a good thing. It is good because \nthe building no longer meets the requirements of the \nnew century. In the meantime, work goes on as usual, \n \n \n27 10-55103 \n \nand here we all are, discussing the big issues of the \nday. \n Of course, the parallel is obvious. The United \nNations system itself has now reached a certain age \nand is also in need of renovation. And in this sense, \ntoo, the day-to-day work of the United Nations must go \non, for we cannot afford to take a break from tackling \nthe global problems we face. The United Nations may \nbe under renovation, but it still has to stay open for \nbusiness. \n It was 65 years ago that the United Nations was \nestablished in San Francisco. There, and at Bretton \nWoods, the world\u2019s leaders laid the foundations for a \nmultilateral system that would be built upon the \nsmoking ruins of the Second World War. This system \nhas demonstrated its usefulness, but it is based on post-\nwar realities, not on the international balance of power \nand the global problems of today. \n I use the word \u201crenovation\u201d, because we do not \nneed to build from scratch. Over the past 65 years, the \nsystem has more than proved its worth. There is \nnothing wrong with the foundations or the basic \nstructure. Besides, experience has taught us that a \npractical step-by-step approach is a more effective way \nto reform a large organization than reliance on a \u201cbig-\nbang\u201d strategy. Or, as Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, one of the \ngreat leaders of the United Nations, put it, \u201cConstant \nattention by a good nurse may be just as important as a \nmajor operation by a surgeon\u201d. \n Today, I would like to look briefly at three of the \ncore tasks of the United Nations in order to show how \nthe Dutch Government views various concrete reforms \nin practical terms. Those tasks relate to human rights, \nthe international legal order, and peace and security. \nLet me begin, however, with the background to these \nrenovations, using my own experience as a guide, \nstarting with the question of why they are necessary. \n In human terms, 65 years is often an age at which \nwe start to take things easier. Unfortunately, that is not \nan option for the United Nations, for despite all our \nefforts, peace, security, legal certainty and \ndevelopment are still not guaranteed for everyone. In \nfact, since the United Nations was established, the \nglobal challenges facing us have only grown larger. \nConsider the climate crisis, or the energy and food \ncrisis, or the international economic crisis that has \nshown so clearly how closely connected everything is \nin our time. We need each other more than ever before, \nand we need the United Nations as the organization \nuniting us more than ever before. \n In this light, I applaud the choice of theme for \nthis sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly: \n\u201cReaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \nglobal governance\u201d \u2014 although I must confess I would \nhave replaced the word \u201creaffirming\u201d with \n\u201crecovering\u201d, because ground has clearly been lost, as \nhas become especially apparent in the last few years. \nThe Group of 20, and not the United Nations, has taken \nthe lead in tackling the economic crisis, for example. \nThe United Nations Climate Change Conference could \nhave delivered more if the world had been able to unite \nbehind the tough decisions. And where the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) are concerned, we see \nmixed results. A lot has been achieved, but on some \nGoals we are lagging far behind, thanks to a \nfragmented and defective international aid architecture. \nWe discussed this earlier in the week at the MDG \nsummit. \n What these examples show is that the United \nNations is losing its position \u2014 and its convening \npower \u2014 as the obvious global platform for discussion \nand decision-making. It pains me to say that. However, \nI also have every faith that the United Nations can \ncontinue in the future to claim its vital role as the \nworld\u2019s overarching governance organization. \n In my view, the end of the cold war freed the \nUnited Nations from a long period of confrontation and \nstagnation. In its wake the international agenda was \nredefined with great speed and vigour. Relatively new \ntopics like the environment and climate change, social \nthemes and gender issues began to claim our attention. \nThe international legal order was strengthened by new \ninternational tribunals, the International Criminal Court \nand a growing number of peace missions under the \nUnited Nations flag \u2014 and of course, in setting the \nMDGs at its Millennium Summit (resolution 55/2), the \nUnited Nations showed how ambitious it can be. \n The United Nations is only able to achieve such \nthings because every country is involved and everyone \nhas a voice. That is the power of the United Nations, \nbut also its greatest weakness. Inclusion does not only \nfoster legitimacy \u2014 the unique selling point of the \nUnited Nations. It also leads to sluggish decision-\nmaking, politicized relationships and a bureaucratic \nstructure that lacks transparency. I believe that anyone \n  \n \n10-55103 28 \n \nfamiliar with the international circuit over the past 10 \nyears will recognize this picture. \n It is often said, \u201cIf the United Nations did not \nexist it would have to be invented\u201d \u2014 and indeed, a \nglobal organization with universal membership is \nessential. Still, no matter how representative an \norganization may be, it will lose its relevance if it does \nnot deliver sufficient results. In short, legitimacy and \neffectiveness are two sides of the same coin. \n The Dutch Government is convinced that the \nUnited Nations can improve its effectiveness and \ndecisiveness and so increase its legitimacy and public \nsupport. This can be done by utilizing the United \nNations and its process to solve problems and by \nputting practical considerations first when problems \nare tackled. The Netherlands wants to see that happen \nand will work to make it happen. We will do so as a \nfounding Member of the United Nations but also \ntogether with our partners in the European Union, of \nwhich we also are a founding member. The European \nUnion is strongly committed to the United Nations, and \nwe subscribe to its contributions to secure the future of \nthe United Nations. \n That brings me to the first of the three core tasks \nI mentioned at the start of my speech: human rights. \nThis, without question, is an area in which the United \nNations has achieved great success in setting standards, \nwith the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as an \nunshakeable basis. Unfortunately, though, it still falls \nshort in enforcing those standards. We still hear reports \nevery day of torture, unfair trials, curbs on freedom of \nexpression and other human rights violations. The \nDutch Government considers it unacceptable that \npeople, often women, are still being stoned to death in \n2010. We must continue to resist this practice with \nevery ounce of our being. \n The Dutch Government urges that the capacity of \nthe human rights machinery, and particularly the \nHuman Rights Council, be strengthened. To start with, \na clear division of tasks between the Human Rights \nCouncil and the Third Committee of this General \nAssembly is needed. Overlap and lack of clarity make \nit too easy for some regimes to distract attention from \nhuman rights violations. The Netherlands will press for \nclarity. \n Of course, human rights are closely related to the \ninternational legal order, the second area I want to \ntouch on. As you know, this is a subject very close to \nthe Netherlands\u2019 heart. The city of The Hague is not \nonly the centre of Dutch democracy, it is also known as \nthe legal capital of the world \u2014 and we are proud of \nthat. More important, though, of course, is the fact that \nthe international institutions based in The Hague are \nsending a clear message with the work they undertake. \nThe international community will not allow human \nrights violations and crimes against humanity to go \nunpunished. That applies to the various ad hoc \ntribunals, such as the International Criminal Tribunal \nfor the Former Yugoslavia. It also applies to the \nInternational Court of Justice and of course the \nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). \n Over the last 20 years international criminal law \nhas developed at an impressive rate. Today, those who \ncommit the most terrible crimes, wherever in the world \nthey may be, know that their chances of being called to \naccount are growing by the day. Now we must act \nboldly. We must strengthen these institutions\u2019 visibility, \ncredibility and authority. We can do that by improving \ninternational cooperation on investigations and \nprosecutions, by increasing compliance with the \nrelevant Security Council resolutions and by pushing \nfor as many countries as possible to sign the Rome \nStatute and to conduct themselves according to both its \nletter and its spirit. With that in mind, I say that it is \nunacceptable to the Dutch Government that someone \nlike President Al-Bashir of the Sudan, against whom an \narrest warrant is outstanding, should be allowed to \nmove freely in a country that is an ICC partner. \n In closing, I would like to say a few words about \nthe broad topic of peace and security. At this moment, \nthere are some 100,000 people taking part in United \nNations peace missions around the world. So no one \ncan deny that the United Nations plays a leading role in \nthis area \u2014 and rightly so, because it is precisely in \nmatters of war and peace that legitimacy and resolve \nare most essential. Such legitimacy and resolve can \nonly be provided by the United Nations and the \nSecurity Council. \n We saw only recently, in the incident involving \nthe Republic of Korea\u2019s naval ship, the Cheonan, how \ndifficult and shaky the position of the Security Council \ncan sometimes be. On the one hand, the Council \ncondemned the attack unanimously and in strong \nterms, and that has to be applauded. On the other hand, \nthe Council remained silent on the question of blame, \nwhich is an extremely hard thing to bear for the \nsurvivors and the victims\u2019 loved ones. \n \n \n29 10-55103 \n \n It is precisely in order to guarantee the legitimacy \nand strength of the Security Council in the future that \nthe Dutch Government continues to support reforms of \nthe Council that reflect the geopolitical realities of \ntoday and not of 1945. Naturally, the exact substance \nof those reforms is still open to debate. But it is clear \nto the Netherlands that there should be more room for \nmore countries to join the discussions and exert \ninfluence: room for large countries that in 1945 were \nnot yet large enough or were not yet Members of the \nUnited Nations; but also room for smaller nations that, \nas troop-supplying countries or as interested parties in \na particular region, should have the right to speak. I \nwould add immediately that countries that want \ninfluence should realize that this entails financial, \npolitical and moral obligations. Or, in the words of \nWinston Churchill, the price of greatness is \nresponsibility. \n I have briefly sketched why the United Nations is \nin need of renovation. I hope I have made clear that its \nrelevance is tied not only to its legitimacy but also to \nits effectiveness. And I have suggested the direction the \nrenovation might take in three specific areas. One thing \nI have not yet done, however, is to reaffirm that the \nNetherlands, in keeping with its long international \ntradition, will continue to work for quality in the \nUnited Nations system. Together with others, together \nwith all represented in this Hall, we will work in the \nknowledge that this renovation, like all our activities, \nrequires us to pool our resources. Or, as the United \nNations Charter says: \u201cunite our strength\u201d and \n\u201ccombine our efforts\u201d. Let those words inspire us in \nthe work that lies ahead."

        "file_text": "First, I \nwould like to congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \nelection to preside over the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fifth session and to thank his predecessor for his \nable management of the Assembly\u2019s work at its \nprevious session. I also wish to express my \nappreciation to His Excellency Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon for his valuable report on the various \naspects of the work of our international Organization \n(A/65/1). \n This is the first time I have addressed this \nAssembly since Lebanon was elected a non-permanent \nmember of the Security Council for the 2010-2011 \nterm. That status confers on us responsibilities that \nLebanon is proud to assume in service of its causes and \nthe just causes of the Arab world, and in the service of \njustice and peace around the world. In that context, I \nwould like to commend the efforts and commitments \nundertaken as a result of the high-level meeting of the \nSecurity Council (6389th meeting) aimed at increasing \nthe effectiveness of its role and enabling it to \nimplement its resolutions without resorting to double \nstandards. \n Moreover, we welcome the statement issued after \nthe Assembly\u2019s High-level Plenary Meeting on \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals, \nwhich contribute to alleviating poverty, promoting \neducation and improving health services. We also \ncommend the progress achieved by the United Nations \nin strengthening the role of women, an issue to which \nLebanon attaches special importance, in line with its \nenlightened role in that regard. Indeed, Lebanon was \namong the first countries in our region to grant women \nthe right to vote in legislative elections, in 1953. \n Despite the growing and important role the \nUnited Nations plays in the field of socio-economic \ndevelopment, our Organization remains, in essence, a \npolitical organization, one that was created primarily to \nmaintain international peace and security and to protect \nhumanity from the scourge of the wars and conflicts \nthat had befallen it and that had blocked progress and \ndevelopment over successive periods of history. \n In that context, since the outbreak of the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict the United Nations has not hesitated to \naddress that issue and has adopted a series of \nresolutions aimed at reinstating peoples\u2019 rights and \nconsolidating the pillars of peace and development. \nHowever, those efforts abated and faded in the face of \nIsrael\u2019s intransigence and its obvious inclination to \nexpand and to implement a settlement policy. Indeed, \nto this day Israel refuses to join the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to place all of its \nnuclear facilities under the comprehensive safeguards \nregime of the International Atomic Energy Agency. \n We welcome the current growing international \nawareness of the urgent need to find a settlement, \nwithin set time frames, to the Middle East problem, \nwith the Palestinian issue at its heart, and to revive \nefforts to reach such a settlement. However, decades of \nexperience show that a genuine, permanent solution for \nthe Middle East problem is impossible unless it is a \njust and comprehensive solution, one that addresses all \naspects of the conflict on all tracks.  \n Also, such a solution is impossible unless the \ninternational community musters the necessary \ndetermination to move from making declarations on \nguiding principles towards working to ensure the \nappropriate means for implementation, while \npromoting the elements that would lead to a solution \nbased on internationally legitimate resolutions, the \nMadrid terms of reference and all the provisions of the \nArab Peace Initiative. We highlight in particular those \nprovisions that ensure a rejection of any settlement by \nPalestinian refugees in Arab host countries, since the \ncircumstances of those countries do not allow for such \nsettlement. \n In fact, Lebanon has frequently declared that it \nwill not accept any form of settlement of Palestinian \nrefugees on its territories. That is due to the reasons \n \n \n11 10-54959 \n \nand considerations I emphasized in the Security \nCouncil yesterday (see S/PV.6389), and is especially \ntrue because such settlement would entail dangerous \nrepercussions and would threaten security and the \npillars of stability. It is important to note that the issue \nof Palestinian refugees cannot be solved through \nisolated Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in a way that \ndisregards Lebanon and other concerned host \ncountries. \n At this point, we must reiterate that the primary \nresponsibility for guaranteeing decent living conditions \nfor and the well-being of the Palestinian refugees falls \non the shoulders of the international community. We \nalso reiterate that increasing the contributions to the \nbudget of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency \nfor Palestine Refugees in the Near East \u2014 which was \ncreated specifically for that purpose in 1949 \u2014 would \nguarantee a life of dignity for Palestinian refugees, \nunder the sovereignty of the host countries and with \ntheir assistance, without extremism or violence. \n On the other hand, Lebanon once again condemns \ninternational terrorism, from which it has suffered in \ndifferent ways. Lebanon cooperates with the \ninternational community in combating terrorism and \nsupports the calls to explore measures to clearly define \nterrorism and address its root causes in order to clearly \ndistinguish it from legitimate resistance to foreign \noccupation, which is recognized by the United Nations \nCharter and relevant resolutions. \n While Lebanon is committed to Security Council \nresolution 1701 (2006) and seeks to compel Israel to \nimplement all its provisions, Israel continues its daily \nviolations of Lebanese airspace, territory and waters, \nviolations that the Secretary-General has described as \nprovocative in many of his reports. Moreover, the \nIsraeli spy networks and recruitment of agents aimed at \nsowing strife and destabilizing our country have \nreached a point where the international community \nmust take a firm position and thwart those acts of \nIsraeli aggression and persistent threats against \nLebanon, its people and its infrastructure.  \n The international community must also compel \nIsrael to withdraw from the Lebanese territories that it \nstill occupies in the Sheba\u2019a farms area, the hills of \nKfar Shuba, and the northern part of Al-Ghajar village, \nwithout delay or preconditions. In that regard, it is \nimportant to note that we retain our right to retrieve or \nliberate our remaining occupied territories by all \nlegitimate and available means.  \n Furthermore, Lebanon looks forward to receiving \nmore financial and technical support to pursue the \nremoval of mines and cluster bombs that were \nrandomly planted by Israel in residential areas during \nthe aggression of July 2006 and the periods of its \noccupation of Lebanese territories. Within the \nappropriate framework, Lebanon will spare no efforts \nto seek to compel Israel to compensate for all the \nlosses and damage it caused Lebanon throughout its \nsuccessive aggressions. \n In the face of Israel\u2019s designs and in keeping with \ninternational law, Lebanon also wishes to assert its \nright to use its waters, oil and natural gas wealth, \nespecially as it plans to exploit those resources within \nthe limits of its exclusive economic zone. Parts of the \nsouthern border of that zone were delineated as shown \non the map that the Lebanese Government submitted to \nthe Secretariat on 9 July 2010. \n While we commend the efforts and sacrifices \nmade by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, \nwhich operates in south Lebanon, and while we are \nkeen to continue that arrangement, we re-emphasize \nthe importance of continued coordination and \ncooperation between the Lebanese army and the \ninternational forces, in accordance with the agreed \nrules of engagement, in order to ensure the proper \nimplementation of the mission entrusted to those \nforces. That cooperation is matched only by arrogant \nand provocative Israeli positions that are the root \ncauses of the incidents that occur every once in a while \nalong the Blue Line and that, with some work, could be \nprevented. \n During the past few years, Lebanon has strived to \nmaintain its internal stability through dialogue, by \ncompleting its implementation of the Taif Accords, by \nresorting to legal institutions to resolve any disputes, \nand through its commitment to the resolutions of the \nSecurity Council and other internationally legitimate \nresolutions. Lebanon was keen to meet all \nconstitutional deadlines without any delays, whether \nfor municipal or parliamentary elections. Those \nelections took place in a free, transparent and calm \natmosphere, in accordance with the requirements of \ndemocracy and the principle of the peaceful devolution \nof power. \n  \n \n10-54959 12 \n \n In addition, Lebanon undertook efforts to prevent \nany external aggression by seeking to compel Israel to \nimplement Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) \nand by mobilizing all its national deterrence \ncapabilities within the framework of its national \ndefence strategy. \n As we vow to persevere with that solid approach, \nno matter the dangers, with the support of the free and \nconscious will of the Lebanese people and the support \nof friendly and sisterly States, we are confident that \nLebanon will always be open to dialogue and to \ncivilized, rich and innovative interaction. We remain \nloyal to our mission and committed to strengthening \nthe state of justice and law, despite all challenges, and \nto upholding the values of freedom, democracy and \nconcord \u2014 values our country has based itself on since \nits inception.

        "file_text": "\nI would first like to congratulate you, President Deiss, \non your election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at it sixty-fifth session. I wish you every \nsuccess. \n For Kyrgyzstan, 2010 has been a year of \nprofound changes and serious challenges to our \ncontinued existence, unity and statehood. In April, \nhaving overthrown the authoritarian system of State \ngovernance, with its flagrant corruption and illegality, \nthe Kyrgyz people resolutely chose a path to renewal \nand genuine democratic development. \n Nevertheless, in May and June, the world \nwitnessed acutely destabilizing situations in the south \nof Kyrgyzstan, where radical forces of the former \nGovernment and criminal and extremist groups sought \nrevenge. Accordingly, they provoked bloody clashes \n \n \n41 10-55122 \n \nbetween Kyrgyz and Uzbek communities, who have \nlived and worked in peace side by side for centuries. \n Those extremist forces insidiously played the \nethnic card by knowingly exploiting the precariousness \nof such socio-economic problems as poverty, high \nunemployment \u2014 especially among youth \u2014 corruption \nand unequal access to economic and financial resources, \nwhich were ignored by the former Government. \nIn that difficult period, the interim Government \nsucceeded in consolidating all positive and patriotic \nforces among the people. With the assistance of the \ninternational community, the interim Government was \nable to stabilize the situation and thereby prevent a \nreturn to the past. \n On 27 June, a new Constitution was adopted by \nnational referendum that provided the basis for \nparliamentary Government in the country. Today, we \ncan in good conscience declare that all the necessary \npolitical, economic and organizational conditions have \nbeen established for the holding of transparent \nparliamentary elections in Kyrgyzstan on 10 October \n2010. Kyrgyzstan has a unique opportunity to build a \ntruly democratic parliamentary State based on the rule \nof law and human rights. I am confident that the people \nof Kyrgyzstan will show wisdom and a high level of \npolitical involvement and not miss this chance. \n In order to move successfully along the path of \ndemocratic development and prevent future political \nand socio-economic disturbances, we intend to \nthoroughly analyse the origins and reasons behind the \napparent conflicts that took place in our country in the \npast year, and more specifically over the past six \nmonths. \n At present a State commission to investigate the \nreasons for the conflict is at work. The commission \nconsists of prominent political activists, scientists and \nexperts, of Kyrgyz, Uzbek and other nationalities that \nmake up multinational Kyrgyzstan. An international \nindependent commission has also begun its work, \nsupported by the United Nations, the European Union, \nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope (OSCE) and Nordic countries. We should \nidentify the organizers of the bloody clashes, seek what \nlessons can be learned, try to comprehend and \neradicate the causes of friction and seek ways to reach \ninter-ethnic accord in the society. \n But most important, the realization of the tragic \nand futile nature of the results of extremist actions \nmust become established in the minds of the peoples of \nthe various ethnic communities living in Kyrgyzstan. \nAn unshakable commitment to national unity and \nnationhood must become the cohesive element and \nuniting force in the country. \n We are expanding the various forms of \ncooperation with regional international organizations in \norder to further stabilize the situation in Kyrgyzstan. \nThus, with a view to rendering assistance to law \nenforcement staff and restoring confidence between \npeople and local administrations, the negotiations on \nengaging the OSCE police advisory group are \nconcluding. In line with agreements reached, the \npartner countries of the Collective Security Treaty \nOrganization render procurement and advisory \nassistance. \n The Kyrgyz Republic highly appreciates the \nposition and actions of the leadership of the Republic \nof Uzbekistan, and of President Islam Karimov \npersonally, in stabilizing the situation in the south of \nour country, especially in the first days of the unrest. \nWe are also grateful for the support and invaluable \nassistance rendered by the Government of that \nbrotherly country to citizens of Kyrgyzstan displaced \ninto Uzbekistan, and for facilitating their return. \n We are sincerely grateful to all those who \nresponded to the call for help and assistance in the \nframework of the flash appeal for Kyrgyzstan launched \nby the United Nations, and also for comprehensive \nsupport provided on a bilateral basis. \n The immediate humanitarian assistance from \nfriendly countries, international organizations and \nagencies and United Nations institutions has been vital \nin stabilizing the crisis situation and overcoming the \ndestructive consequences of a humanitarian \ncatastrophe. As of today we have received 40 per cent \nof the required help within the framework of the \nappeal. It is obviously not sufficient, given the urgent \nneed of the population on the streets of the affected \ncities and settlements. People still need housing, the \nwounded need medical care, and schools and social \nservice buildings need to be rebuilt. \n  \n \n10-55122 42 \n \n At present our Government is focusing its basic \nefforts on post-conflict reconstruction of the country\u2019s \nsocial and economic infrastructure, especially in the \nsouthern regions. Therefore, timely and practical \nimplementation of commitments made at the donor \nconference on Kyrgyzstan held in Bishkek this July is \nextremely important. \n Kyrgyzstan supports the position of Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, stated on 23 September at the \nSecurity Council Summit (see S/PV.6389), on \nstrengthening the role of the United Nations in \nresponding to humanitarian catastrophes and resolving \ncrisis situations. \n The establishment of the United Nations Regional \nCentre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia was \nan important and necessary step on the part of the \nUnited Nations. We consider it essential to expand and \nstrengthen its operations, which will allow it to \nimplement a package of preventive measures and to \nactivate mediation services. We also welcome the \nlaunch of a counter-terrorism strategy for the Central \nAsian region and are ready to strengthen cooperation \naimed at adoption of a joint action plan by 2011. \n The Security Council summit prompts us to \nconsider more seriously the problem of terrorism. The \nevents of June of this year in the Kyrgyz Republic \u2014 \nwhen various terrorists groups attempted to enter the \nterritory of Kyrgyzstan by mountain paths from \nneighbouring countries \u2014 testify to the presence of \nreal threats of terrorism to the peace and security of the \nStates bordering Afghanistan. \n Terrorist groups joining forces with drug barons \nand other criminal elements is a great concern. Such \ncombustible hybrids should be eliminated by the most \ndrastic measures. Therefore, the Kyrgyz State drug \ncontrol agency, which was liquidated a year ago, has \nrecently been restored. As we intensify our efforts in \nthe fight against illegal drug trafficking, we are \nextremely interested in furthering a strategic \nprogramme for the countries of Central Asia to oppose \nillegal drug trafficking and fighting international \ncrime. We must further strengthen the activity of the \nCentral Asian Regional Information and Coordination \nCentre in fighting illegal trafficking of psychotropic \nsubstances and their precursors under the aegis of the \nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. \n The action plan of the European Union and the \nCentral Asian countries for 2009-2013 should become \nan important part of international efforts to fight illegal \ndrug trafficking, along with coordinated actions within \nthe framework of the Commonwealth of Independent \nStates and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. We \ncontinually call upon the United Nations to improve \ncoordination of the fights against drug trafficking and \ntransnational organized crime. \n In Afghanistan, the fragile process of \npeacekeeping and reconciliation and the development \nof the institutional structures are points of special \nconcern. The recent parliamentary elections in that \ncountry inspire some optimism about strengthening \ncivil society and creating a parliament of national \nunity. The construction of a stable economy and \neffective support of Afghanistan\u2019s State institutions \nwill serve as the basis for a durable peace in that \ncountry and will reduce the threat to security in the \nCentral Asian region. Kyrgyzstan supports \ninternational programmes for Afghanistan\u2019s economic \nreconstruction and is ready to contribute material and \npersonnel and to work closely with the anti-terrorist \ncoalition. \n The Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference \nlast May demonstrated the possibility of achieving an \nunderstanding in the critical sphere of nuclear \ndisarmament. My country is also contributing to that \neffort. Kyrgyzstan has been designated as the \ndepositary of the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free \nZone in Central Asia. Thus it promotes regional \nsecurity while broadening collaboration with other \nnuclear-weapon-free zones. \n The ecological dimension is a special feature of \nthe Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central \nAsia. That is because there remains a large quantity of \nuranium tailings in Kyrgyzstan, which poses a serious \nrisk to human life and to the environment in general. \nOn this matter, we are grateful to the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme for its increased attention to \nthose zones of high ecological risk and for conducting \nan international meeting in 2009. \n We would like to call delegates\u2019 attention to item \n97 (i) on the Assembly\u2019s agenda for this session, \nentitled \u201cEstablishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone \nin Central Asia\u201d, and we ask them to support it. \n United Nations peacekeeping operations are a key \ntool in preserving and maintaining peace on our planet. \nKyrgyzstan is the only country in the region that is \ncontributing more than 30 peacekeepers to United \n \n \n43 10-55122 \n \nNations missions in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean, \nand it is ready to increase its participation in United \nNations peacekeeping operations. \n The delegation of Kyrgyzstan has repeatedly \ncome out in favour of fully optimizing the management \nof peacekeeping operations. It supports the \ncomprehensive strategy for field support and its \nreform, as documented in \u201cA New Partnership Agenda: \nCharting a New Horizon for UN Peacekeeping\u201d. We \nare convinced of the vital importance of involving such \nauthoritative regional organizations as the European \nUnion, the Organization for Security and Cooperation \nin Europe and the Collective Security Treaty \nOrganization in peacekeeping activities and post-\nconflict reconstruction. \n Kyrgyzstan is devoted to the purposes and tasks \nof strengthening international peace and security, and, \nas a candidate for non-permanent membership on the \nSecurity Council, is ready to contribute to the cause of \npeace, especially by participating in the work of the \nCouncil and its committees. \n We wish to focus the Assembly\u2019s attention on the \nissues of environmental safety and hydropower. Recent \nstudies have confirmed the loss of more than 20 per \ncent of Kyrgyzstan\u2019s glaciers and snowfields, which \nrequires urgent efforts to preserve our river headwaters \nand restore our forests. Kyrgyzstan is interested in the \nrational exploitation of its resources, an attractive \ninvestment climate, preserving ecological security and \ndeveloping alternative energy sources. We need to \nlaunch regional projects within the framework of the \nCentral Asia/South Asia Regional Electricity Market, \nstarting with the construction of a Kyrgyzstan-\nTajikistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan electric power line. \n We pledge our full support to developing concrete \nmeasures at the forthcoming sixteenth Climate Change \nConference in Canc\u00fan in November. Among the \npractical steps to be taken in this area, I will mention \nthat the forthcoming International Conference of \nMountain Countries, on climate change, to be held in \nKathmandu, will be making broad proposals for the \nCanc\u00fan meeting. \n Kyrgyzstan is studying significant projects on \nsustainable development and supports Mr. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 \nBorb\u00e9ly in his work for the nineteenth session of the \nCommission on Sustainable Development. Our \nimperative is achieving the agenda of the twenty-first \ncentury and making the Johannesburg Plan of Action a \nreality. \n In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that the \nactivity of the United Nations must respond fully to the \nexpectations of people throughout the planet and that \nwe, countries both small and large, must not forget the \nresponsibility we bear for our actions. I also wish for \nall the wisdom and courage that will help us in \nachieving the enduring purposes and values of our \nOrganization in building a better peace."

        "file_text": "Once again, it is a great \nhonour and pleasure for me to address this \ndistinguished Assembly. Let me start by congratulating \nMr. Joseph Deiss on his assumption of the presidency \nat the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly and \nassuring him of my delegation\u2019s full support and \ncooperation. I would also like to convey my sincere \nappreciation to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki, for his efficient and effective \nconduct of the previous session. My gratitude also goes \nto the Secretary-General for his comprehensive account \nof the work of the United Nations and his analysis of \nthe challenges facing our global community. \n In my statement I would like to talk both about \nthe successes that my country has achieved with the \nhelp of the international community and about the \nreforms we now need to make in the way we interact \nand govern ourselves globally. My Government is \nsincerely grateful for the international community\u2019s \nengagement with Sierra Leone\u2019s efforts to put the \ncountry on a path to sustained economic growth and \ndevelopment. Building on this engagement, our \ncountry has significantly improved our international \nstanding in many areas. \n The Global Peace Index now ranks Sierra Leone \nas the fifty-third most peaceful country in the world. \nThe Mo Ibrahim Index records that we are one of the \nfive crisis-affected countries that have made a \nsignificant leap forward in democratic governance. A \nrecent International Monetary Fund review shows \nimprovement in our public finances, with our 4 per \ncent annual economic growth rate higher than the \naverage rate of 2 per cent for sub-Saharan Africa. We \nhave also made steady progress in our rankings on \ndoing business, corruption perception and democracy. \nIn addition, earlier this year I was the proud recipient \non behalf of the people of Sierra Leone of a peace prize \nawarded by ACCORD, the African Centre for the \nConstructive Resolution of Disputes. And only last \nweek my country received a Millennium Development \nGoal Award for showing outstanding leadership in the \nfight against HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. \n My Government has also continued to emphasize \nthe protection of the basic rights of the people of Sierra \nLeone. We have put in place comprehensive justice \nsector reforms in response to both national and global \ndemands, to ensure that the rights of citizens are \npreserved, and that they have access to justice for all. \nAnd the Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone \n \n \n39 10-54833 \n \nhas assumed a lead role in advising my Government on \nbuilding a culture of human rights. It ensures that the \nGovernment ratifies international treaties and protocols \nand fulfils its reporting obligations. A case in point is \nour recent validation of the common core document \nthat forms the basis for all reporting on international \ntreaties. \n Sierra Leone is among the few countries \nemerging from conflict that have formulated a \ncomprehensive action plan for Security Council \nresolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008). My \nGovernment is determined to ensure effective \nimplementation of the action plan, particularly in \naddressing gender-based violence as well as enhancing \nwomen\u2019s participation in politics and the public sector. \n My Government\u2019s commitment to free media is \nequally strong. No journalist has been imprisoned in \nmy country since I assumed office. We have transformed \nthe Government-owned broadcasting services into what is \nonly the second independent public service broadcaster in \nAfrica, the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation. \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon witnessed the launch of \nthis historic, groundbreaking initiative in June. It is the \nbeginning of a new era of access to independent, unbiased \nand impartial information in our country. \n My Government is also delivering results on the \nkey priorities in my Agenda for Change to improve the \nlives of all Sierra Leoneans. We have launched free \nhealth care for pregnant and lactating women, as well \nas children under five, for the first time in our history, \nimproving access to around 300,000 women and more \nthan a million children. We have also begun the serious \ncommercialization of agriculture, the mainstay of our \neconomy, particularly through smallholder farmers, for \nwhom we are facilitating improved mechanization, \nirrigation and the establishment of farming \ncooperatives. We have successfully made significant \nprogress on road construction and the rehabilitation of \nelectricity supply in key provincial cities and towns, to \ngenerate economic activity across the country. We have \nmade great strides in attracting large-scale private \nsector investors from international companies, \nfollowing the Sierra Leone Trade and Investment \nForum in London last year. Furthermore, to maintain \nmacroeconomic stability and make those achievements \nsustainable, my Government also remains firmly \ncommitted to the fight against corruption. \n Despite that progress, many challenges remain. I \nam proud of what Sierra Leone has achieved so far. But \nwe need to further enhance our capacity to promote \nand protect human rights, establish good governance \nand managerial capacity across the whole public sector \nand fight corruption and trafficking in narcotic drugs. \nFor all that, our country will need further technical \nassistance and cooperation, private capital investments \nand technology transfer. \n Most importantly, we are not oblivious to the \nimperative of consolidating peace through enhanced \npolitical dialogue, tolerance and ensuring a free and \nfair electoral process. With those elements and our \npolitical resolve, we will make further progress \ntowards peace, security and a stable and open \ndemocracy. \n I shall now turn to the theme of the Assembly\u2019s \nsixty-fifth session: reaffirming the central role of the \nUnited Nations in global governance. It could not have \nbeen better timed, at a moment when the global \ncommunity is grappling with myriad challenges facing \nthe international system. The end of the cold war, \ntogether with an explosion in information and \ncommunication technologies, gave rise to a new \nparadigm of flexible or loose functional coalitions \ninvolving State and non-State actors. A new \nconfiguration of interdependent relationships, \neconomic, social, political and ethnic in nature, has \nemerged from those historic circumstances. \n There are fears that globalization nurtures the \ndominance of power politics, a growing disparity \nbetween the North and the South, intolerance of \ndifferent values, a tendency to resort to force to solve \ninternational conflicts, and neglect of the environment. \nAt the same time, globalization has led to a multilevel \nsystem of governance that is beginning to address \nglobal issues ranging from economic interdependence, \nmigration, financial crises and drug trafficking to the \npandemics of tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and \nmalaria. \n It is in recognition of the imperative to promote \nmultilateralism and build synergies with both State and \nnon-State actors that I commend the choice of theme. \nWe support the United Nations more than any other \norganization as a centre of global governance. It has \nthe unique characteristics of a global mandate and \nuniversal membership. Those characteristics make it an \nindispensable and neutral catalyst for the achievement \n  \n \n10-54833 40 \n \nof international cooperation in solving international \nproblems of an economic, social, cultural or \nhumanitarian character. The centrality of the role of the \nUnited Nations in global governance cannot be \noveremphasized. \n The recently concluded High-level Meeting on \nthe Millennium Development Goals revealed that \nprogress has been uneven and that developing \ncountries, particularly those in Africa, continue to be \nmost vulnerable to the effects of globalization. The \nprevailing global recession resulting from the \neconomic and financial crisis that struck developed \neconomies has further compounded that challenge. In \nthis context, my Government believes that the United \nNations remains the crucial hub for norm-setting and \nharmonizing the actions of nations for the maintenance \nof international peace and security and for the \nattainment of our development goals. \n The Assembly, meeting at the turn of the \nmillennium, decided that reforming the Security \nCouncil and making it more accessible, transparent, \nequitably representative and accountable was long \noverdue. That brings me to the crucial issue that has \nled us in Africa to consistently reiterate that there can \nbe no meaningful reform of the Council without \nallocating permanent seats to the continent. \n No one continent should have an exclusive \nmonopoly over membership of the Security Council. \nThere is no justification for a discriminatory allocation \nof seats, nor can we debate endlessly and ignore the \nrealities of our rapidly changing global circumstances. \n While the fifth round of talks has not truly led to \na compromise-oriented solution, distilling all positions \ninto a single negotiating document has been a \nsignificant step in the right direction. We in Africa look \nforward to and support a process that will allow the \ntext to evolve during the next session of the General \nAssembly in an open, inclusive and balanced manner, \ntowards a solution that can garner the widest possible \npolitical acceptance by Member States. We urge all \ndelegations to muster the political will required for \nprogress. \n I wish to conclude my statement by saying that \nthe moment has come for us to address the historical \ninjustice inflicted on Africa by allocating the continent \nno less than two seats, with all their attributes and \nprivileges, and two additional seats in both the \nnon-permanent and permanent categories of the \nCouncil. I do not need to emphasize that at the \ninception of the United Nations, most of Africa was not \nrepresented and that as a result Africa remains to this \nday the only continent without a permanent seat in the \nCouncil. To ensure greater relevance of the Security \nCouncil within a revamped United Nations system, \nAfrica demands permanent representation on the \nSecurity Council, with all the requisite attributes."

        "file_text": "The \nbeginning of the sixty-fifth session of the General \nAssembly coincides with the preparations of the \nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM), chaired by my \ncountry, to celebrate 50 years of achievements. During \nthose years, the Movement has greatly helped to \nreinforce international and multilateral action under \nchanging regional and international circumstances. The \nMovement\u2019s work over those years has demonstrated \nthe ability of developing countries to contribute \neffectively to the maintenance of international peace \nand security, make progress in development, and \npromote human rights, basic freedoms and the \nfurtherance of good governance at the international \nlevel. \n \n \n37 10-55103 \n \n This week\u2019s NAM ministerial meeting represents \nthe point of departure for a major celebration, to be \nhosted by Indonesia in April or May 2011. The meeting \nwill chart a clear and integrated future course, drawing \non past achievements as an impetus for future \nendeavours. It will define the elements of the \nMovement\u2019s future commitment to greater openness \ntowards and interaction with the international \ncommunity, in the context of fairness and mutual \ninterest, to ensure that the aspirations and hopes of our \ncountries and peoples are met. \n Egypt appreciates the main theme that the \nPresident proposed for discussion at this session. \nGlobal governance touches on many political, \neconomic and social issues. Egypt believes that the \nelected organs of the United Nations should handle the \nprincipal tasks in that area. We must all ensure that the \nUnited Nations discharges such roles effectively and \nwisely. \n In the political field, for example, it is no longer \nacceptable for permanent membership of the Security \nCouncil, the main organ entrusted with maintaining \ninternational peace and security, to continue to operate \nunder obsolete rules of an era long past. Similarly, it is \nunacceptable for the work of the Council or its \nmechanisms to continue to be characterized by a lack \nof transparency or balance. \n A serious approach to current historic challenges \nrequires more balanced, conscious and responsible \nmanagement of this core issue. The Security Council \nhas made numerous grave mistakes, resulting in the \nloss of innocent lives. Many resolutions that have been \nblocked by the Council would have corrected the \ndisparities, returned rights to victims and restored the \nconfidence of world public opinion in the Council\u2019s \nperformance and impartiality. \n Turning to the economic sphere, we note that the \nUnited Nations, and even the key Bretton Woods \ninternational financial institutions, no longer lead in \nmanaging the top international economic issues. Other \ninternational bodies are now beginning to assume that \nrole. \n At its summit last year, the Group of 20 declared \nitself the forum to coordinate global economic policy. \nSuch a development prompts us to be cautious of its \nrepercussions, since that forum or any other assuming \nsuch a responsibility should have the geographical \nrepresentation necessary to ensure the fair airing of all \ntrends and approaches prevailing in the international \ncommunity. It must also ensure fair participation in \nformulating policy and in providing a balanced \napproach to current challenges. Marginalization is no \nlonger acceptable. Countries of the South have rights \nand must have a voice and participate in any forum that \ndeals with the international situation. \n Egypt will continue its tireless work to achieve \nthe wider and more balanced participation of the \ndeveloping world in international economic decision-\nmaking. Our world has experienced successive years of \npoor economic performance and stubborn crises. That \nhas aggravated the current inequities and heightened \nthe challenges faced by all countries, developing \ncountries in particular. It requires us all to support \ncoordinated and joint action to address the \nshortcomings and inequities and to achieve sustainable \nand balanced global growth. \n In that context, we welcome the outcome of the \nrecent High-level Plenary Meeting of the General \nAssembly on the Millennium Development Goals, at \nwhich the delegation of Egypt expressed its view on \nthe Goals and the extent to which we will be able to \nachieve them. We hope that the conclusions of the \nsummit will provide us with the necessary momentum \nto speed up the achievement of the Goals ahead of the \nfinal review in 2015. \n The fact that Egypt is part of the Islamic world is \ncommon knowledge. We feel the pain of Muslims \nwherever they are. We share their joys and \ncelebrations; we grieve with them and we feel their \npain. There is no doubt that regrettable and appalling \nincidents against Muslims and Islam are increasingly \nfrequent, and systematic in certain cases. They have \nranged from attacks on the symbols and sanctities of \nthe faith to the harassment of Muslims. In general, we \nfind the West being drawn into a clash with the Muslim \nworld. Such a clash would serve no one except \nextremists and those who hold perverse ideas on both \nsides. It would not be in the interest of security and \nstability in the world. It would not be in the interests of \nmoderates. In such a clash, the winner is a loser and \nthe victor is defeated. \n Need I remind this gathering of the need for \ncoordinated action among the influential advocates of \nreligious, civilizational and cultural moderation in \norder to eliminate the threat before it becomes more \nominous and destroys much of everything? We can no \n  \n \n10-55103 38 \n \nlonger accept pretexts to condone practices against \nIslam and its followers \u2014 such as the right to freedom \nof expression \u2014 which are surprisingly na\u00efve, \nexcessive in essence and offensive in nature. \n Egypt will continue to do its utmost at the \npolitical, cultural and religious levels to address such \nthreats. We call on all countries, in particular \nGovernments, to play their part in highlighting the \npotential horror of a terrible clash of faiths and \ncivilizations. We call on them to spread a culture of \nenlightenment based on tolerance, respect for \ndifferences and the renunciation of fanaticism, hatred \nand zealotry. Laws must be enacted to protect \nminorities and their beliefs from the aggression of \nextremists and promoters of strife. \n With regard to matters of international peace and \nsecurity, disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are \npriorities on Egypt\u2019s agenda. Only a few months ago, \nthe Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons successfully \nconcluded its work. It adopted an important document \non the Middle East that included an action plan and \nmeasures to implement the 1995 resolution on the \nMiddle East. Egypt will closely follow all steps taken \nto implement that plan, including the serious \npreparations for the 2012 conference. \n Once again, let me reiterate Egypt\u2019s position that \nadopting double standards on the question of \nnon-proliferation will result in a continued threat to \nworld stability. In the Middle East particularly, we note \nincreasing efforts to add to the commitments of \nnon-nuclear-weapon States that are signatories to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \nwhile the need for the Treaty to become universal in \nour region and for all nuclear installations in the \nMiddle East to be subjected to the comprehensive \nsafeguards system of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency is disregarded. This uncomfortable situation is \na source of concern to us. We will work with all like-\nminded parties to address and redress this situation in \nrelevant international forums. \n Year after year, we return to the United Nations \nto debate the question of Palestine and the ongoing \nArab-Israeli conflict. Every year, our words swing \nbetween the hope for a complete but unrealized \nbreakthrough, and the fear of a deterioration and an \nexplosion that would compound the pain and suffering \nof the Palestinian people and aggravate the dangers of \noverreaching extremism, militancy and violence faced \nby our region. \n This year is no different. It is true that there is \nhope in the wake of the start of direct negotiations \nbetween the Palestinian and Israeli sides; however, \nchances for success remain slim. Despite the agony of \nthe road to negotiations, Egypt believes that their \nrelaunch may represent an important opportunity that \nshould not be squandered. \n It is important for the Israeli side to realize that \nnegotiations are not an end in themselves. They are \nneither a game nor a waste of time. A serious approach \nmust be the basis and distinguishing mark of the \nnegotiating process. Without the required seriousness \nand credibility, the process will soon lose the little \nsupport it enjoys from the public on both sides. Egypt \nbelieves that these negotiations should seek to end the \nIsraeli occupation of Palestinian territories and the \nimplementation of the two-State solution through the \nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State, with \nEast Jerusalem as its capital and its borders based on \nthe lines of 1967, as has been confirmed by the United \nStates, the sponsor of the negotiations, and the \ninternational Quartet on all occasions and mentioned \nby President Obama a few days ago. \n During the first round of negotiations in \nWashington, D.C., and later in Sharm el-Sheikh, we \nheard Israel\u2019s assurances of its commitment to the \nrequired seriousness. Therefore, we call on the Israeli \nside to take the difficult and necessary decisions, as \nPresident Mubarak said two days ago, to achieve a just \npolitical settlement that would allow the peoples and \ncountries of the region to transcend decades of conflict, \nvictimization and wasted resources. \n There is no doubt that a freeze in Israeli \nsettlement activity in the occupied Palestinian \nterritories has become a major factor in determining \nthe intentions of the Israeli side and its level of \ncommitment to the success of the negotiations. Should \nIsrael fail in its commitment to prolong the moratorium \non its settlement activities, it would expose the \nnegotiation process to collapse and bear full \nresponsibility before regional and world public \nopinion, as well as the sponsor, for wasting a valuable \nopportunity afforded by a major United States effort. \nIsrael would also bear responsibility for any negative \nconsequences. Were Israel to pass this test, we would \nlook forward to a quick resolution by both parties of \n \n \n39 10-55103 \n \nthe question of borders between them. The solutions in \nthis respect are known to all. Settling the matter of \nborders would enable us to take important steps \ntowards settling the conflict as a whole. \n Egypt also supports any serious effort to resume \ndirect negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks \nin a way that would allow both countries to regain their \noccupied territories and consequently reach a \ncomprehensive peace, implement the Arab Peace \nInitiative and end the Arab-Israeli conflict once and for \nall. \n Brotherly Sudan is currently facing the most \ndifficult juncture since its independence. In addition to \ndevelopments in Darfur, the referendum on self-\ndetermination for Southern Sudan is drawing near. \nEgypt follows this situation with the greatest interest, \ngiven our common border with that country. Our \ninterest is based not only on the close brotherly \nrelations between our two peoples, but also on our \nanticipation of any possible consequences of the \nreferendum. Egypt will pursue its efforts to preserve \nthe unity of the Sudan as long as that is the choice of \nthe majority in that country. But if the wish of the \nSouthern Sudanese, who are also our brothers, were \nany different, Egypt would respect the outcome and \nwork with all parties in the interests of development \nand stability. \n The security of the Arab Gulf is one of Egypt\u2019s \nmajor concerns and foreign policy priorities. Apart \nfrom our age-old relations, Egypt understands that it is \nof strategic importance for its Arab brethren in the \nGulf. Egypt will therefore continue to work with the \nGulf Cooperation Council countries for the \nmaintenance of Arab national security in the region and \nto ensure that any security arrangements reached are in \nconsonance with the requirements and concerns of \nArab countries. \n Egypt affirms the urgent need to reach a political \nsettlement on the Iranian nuclear issue, especially since \nits dangerous escalation would threaten an eruption of \nthe situation that could endanger peace and stability in \nthat vital region of the world. While it is true that \nthreats against a State member of the Organization of \nthe Islamic Conference are not acceptable, we \nnevertheless ask Iran to refrain from any measure that \ncould exacerbate the situation in the region, and \nspecifically in the Gulf area, and lead to a \nconfrontation with different forces in the international \ncommunity. All parties must adhere to negotiations as a \nway to a peaceful, political settlement of this issue. \nSuch a settlement would guarantee Iran\u2019s legitimate \nright to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and enable \nthe international community to verify that Iran is in \ncompliance with its obligations under the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. No evidence \nhas yet been seen to suggest otherwise. \n The southern strait of the Red Sea is an area of \nstrategic importance for Egypt. It leads to the Suez \nCanal, a vital waterway at the centre of the world. \nSecuring this critically important area is at the heart of \nEgyptian interests. On that basis, Egypt has \nparticipated extensively in all international efforts to \ncombat piracy off the Somali coast and in the Arabian \nSea and the Indian Ocean. Egypt has also provided \nsupport to some countries of the region in areas such as \nthe development of coast guard capacity, raising \nawareness about the prevention of piracy, and the \nimplementation of a media and communications \nstrategy to combat piracy. In the same vein, continued \nfratricidal fighting in Somalia has consequences for \nstability in the Horn of Africa and, as such, remains a \nsource of concern to us. \n Egypt is pursuing its efforts, including in \noutreach, to further raise international interest in \nSomalia with a view to achieving a ceasefire and \nproceeding to a comprehensive and peaceful political \nsettlement. Such a settlement will be conditional on the \nexistence of the political will of the Somali parties to \nachieve peace and on the commitment of external \nparties to refrain from interfering in Somali affairs \nwhile seriously participating in efforts to achieve a \npolitical settlement. \n In conclusion, Egypt is a country of many \ncivilizations, features and characteristic, from its Arab \nnationalist to its deep-rooted Islamic and Coptic \nidentities, and from the genuine African to the \nhistorical Mediterranean. All have intermingled over \nthe years and left their mark on Egypt\u2019s foreign policy. \nAll these influences define our overlapping interests \nand guide our thinking and action in addressing \nproblems and crises. \n Egypt will continue to work for the achievement \nof peace and stability in the Middle East and the world. \nIt will do its utmost for the well-being of its people, \nnation and region. We will continue the struggle for \nbalanced and sustainable development. We will also \n  \n \n10-55103 40 \n \npursue our serious work for the benefit of the countries \nof the South. \n Our delegation looks forward to working with \nMembers in a spirit of openness to ensure the \nsuccessful outcome of this session. We extend our hand \nto all countries, with an open mind and a sincere desire \nto achieve the international agenda before us. "

        "file_text": "It is an honour to \nlead New Zealand\u2019s delegation this year. The opening \nof the General Assembly\u2019s new session is the best \nexample there is of the capacity of the United Nations \nto bring us all together. Our discussions here will be \nwide-ranging, but inevitably settle on two main issues: \nglobal security and sustainable economic development.  \n We want to make our world safer, more secure \nand more prosperous. These goals will require strong \ncollective action with a focus on practical outcomes. \nNew Zealand is seeking every opportunity to \ncontribute. We are a young, small and fair-minded \ncountry. We depend upon a United Nations that is \neffective and credible. \n New Zealand takes pride in its diversity. In \naddition to our indigenous Maori population, we are a \nmix of people from Europe, Asia and the Pacific. Our \nlinks with Europe are built on history and tradition. \nWithin Asia, we are developing ever-stronger economic \nand security relationships. Our future is closely tied to \nboth of these regions. We have an equally strong focus \non our closest neighbours in the South Pacific. New \nZealand is a Pacific country. Auckland is the largest \nPasifika city in the world, and a number of Pacific \ncountries have more citizens living in New Zealand \nthan at home. \n The security and development of the region is \nNew Zealand\u2019s constant preoccupation. It is a matter of \ngrave concern that the South Pacific is second only to \nsub-Saharan Africa in terms of lack of progress \ntowards the achievement of some of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). We want to see the \nMDGs achieved, and we want to see the wider Pacific \nprosper through good governance and sustainable \neconomic development. That is why New Zealand is \nincreasingly deploying our development resources \nwithin its region, since that is where they are most \nneeded and where they can be most effective. \n The development challenges in the Pacific are \nextremely complex, with vulnerable economies and \nchallenging environmental circumstances. New \nZealand has increased and will continue to increase our \noverall level of development assistance, despite \nchallenging times for our domestic economy. A higher \npercentage of that larger budget will be focused on our \nregion. \n But money alone is not enough; aid effectiveness \nand donor coordination are vital. Progress will also \ndepend on good governance within the region. \n Next year we will mark the fortieth anniversary \nof the Pacific Islands Forum, the central body for \nregional engagement in the Pacific, which held its first \nmeeting in New Zealand in 1971. We will welcome \nleaders from around the region back to New Zealand \nnext September to celebrate our achievements over \n40 years and to take stock of the challenges we must \nface in the future. \n The past year has reinforced the need for better \ndisaster management. Just three weeks ago, residents in \nChristchurch woke to the most destructive earthquake \nin New Zealand in 80 years. Miraculously, there was \nno loss of life, but the damage runs into billions of \ndollars and people\u2019s lives and livelihoods were \naffected. Significant aftershocks are still affecting the \n \n \n51 10-54965 \n \npopulation. But less than a month after the earthquake \nhit, roads and buildings have been repaired, tourism \ninfrastructure is at almost full capacity, and people\u2019s \nlives are being rebuilt. \n Others have not been so lucky. The earthquakes \nin Haiti and Chile and the recent flooding in Pakistan \nare reminders of the devastating scale of such disasters. \nThe Pacific has been hit hard, too. This month will \nmark the first anniversary of the Pacific tsunami that \ntook the lives of 184 people in Samoa, American \nSamoa and Tonga. \n These events and others demonstrate the \nimportance of disaster preparedness, management and \nrecovery. New Zealand\u2019s experience with major \nearthquakes has taught us how to mitigate risks, \nenforce strong building codes, and implement effective \nrecovery plans. But there will be lessons we should \nlearn from this recent experience. We will work with \nthe United Nations system, non-governmental \norganizations and other international agencies to \nensure that those lessons are shared and help others to \nprepare. \n While development and disaster management are \ncrucial to our quest for a safer world, underpinning \nboth is security. Peacekeeping is a key responsibility of \nthe Organization. Indeed, it is its peacekeeping \noperations that shape perceptions of the United Nations \nfor many people around the world. \n New Zealand is committed to supporting global \nsecurity and United Nations peacekeeping. That is why \nwe have been engaged in peacekeeping and peace \nsupport operations since the 1940s. New Zealand\u2019s \nsoldiers, police, engineers, corrections and customs \nofficers, doctors and other personnel are today \ninvolved in 12 operations that span the globe from \nAfrica, Afghanistan and the Middle East to Asia and \nthe Pacific. \n One of the clearest examples of New Zealand\u2019s \ncommitment to the principles of collective \nresponsibility is through the United Nations effort in \nTimor-Leste. Since 1999, New Zealand has been a part \nof every United Nations mission that has served in \nTimor-Leste. We have played a major role in the \nUnited Nations-sanctioned international military \noperations that restored order there in 1999 and again \nin 2006. Over 6,000 New Zealanders have served in \nTimor in the past decade \u2014 a significant undertaking \nfor a country of only 4.4 million people. \n Of course, helping ensure peace and stability in \nour region alone is not enough. New Zealanders are \namong those who have been affected by terrorism, \nkilled in the attacks that took place just a few blocks \naway from here in September 2001, and more recently \nin Bali, in London and in Jakarta. \n The need to respond decisively to those who \nperpetrate such atrocities is a key reason why New \nZealand has led the provincial reconstruction team in \nBamyan, Afghanistan, since 2003. We have redeployed \nour special forces to work alongside the Government of \nAfghanistan and the international community to ensure \nthat that country does not return to being a safe haven \nfor Al-Qaida. We must address the conditions in which \nterrorism thrives. We are increasing our development \nspending in Bamyan and recently placed the Provincial \nReconstruction Team under civilian leadership for the \nfirst time. \n New Zealand is also strongly supportive of \npeacekeeping reform. The expansion in peacekeeping \nsince 1990 has been dramatic. Never before has this \nOrganization deployed so many missions to such \ncomplex environments. This expansion has opened up \ndiscussion of the way the United Nations conducts its \npeacekeeping operations. Clear and achievable \nmandates are needed, progress needs to be better \nmonitored, and efficiency needs to be improved. \n We are also contributing to United Nations efforts \nto strengthen peacebuilding in practice, including the \nneed for better participation of women in \npeacebuilding. Of course, the response of the United \nNations to crises has not always been successful. It is \nfor this reason that New Zealand has strongly \nsupported the responsibility to protect (R2P). We were \npleased to contribute to the proposed joint Special \nAdviser on the Prevention of Genocide/R2P office and \nlook forward to the more comprehensive \nimplementation of R2P throughout the United Nations \nsystem. \n Effective pursuit of these goals \u2014 countering \nterrorism and maintaining peace and security \u2014 \ndemands coordinated, collective action. The United \nNations is the best vehicle for that action. New Zealand \nhas been, and remains, proud to be a part of that \ncommunity of collective action. In line with that \ncommitment, New Zealand is seeking a seat on the \nSecurity Council for the 2015-2016 term. In doing so, \n  \n \n10-54965 52 \n \nwe will work with others here who want the world to \nbe a safer and more prosperous place. \n This year significant gains have been made in \nglobal disarmament. New Zealand welcomes the action \nplan adopted at this year\u2019s Non-Proliferation Treaty \nReview Conference, the groundbreaking nuclear \nsecurity summit, and the entry into force of the \nConvention on Cluster Munitions. These are tangible \nand practical successes. But we still face some \nsignificant challenges. New Zealand is concerned by \nthe continuing inertia of the Conference on \nDisarmament. The Secretary-General\u2019s High-level \nMeeting on disarmament this morning was a valuable \nstep in acknowledging this problem and trying to find a \nway forward. \n As a country that prides itself on sustainable \ndevelopment, New Zealand is also greatly concerned \nabout global environmental issues. As well as working \ntowards an outcome in Canc\u00fan, we are involved in \npractical projects for addressing climate change. One \nsuch project is the Global Research Alliance on \nAgricultural Greenhouse Gases. Fourteen per cent of \nworldwide greenhouse-gas emissions come from \nagriculture. At the same time, there are projections that \nworld food production needs to increase by 50 per cent \nin the next 20 years, and to double in the next 40 years, \nto feed a growing world. \n Clearly, we need a scientific breakthrough to help \nmeet the challenge of producing more food while \nreducing emissions. New Zealand formed the Alliance, \nwhich now includes more than 30 agricultural nations, \nto find ways to address this problem. Scientists and \nresearchers are now linking up across the world to try \nto balance the need for increased agricultural \nproduction with the need to address climate change. \nThis is just one example of how countries can come \ntogether to address climate change in a very real way. \n When I was here a year ago, we were watching to \nsee whether the world would be able to climb out of \nthe global economic recession. Much progress has been \nmade and key economic indicators are generally \npointing in the right direction. The rapid and \ncoordinated international response, including by the \nGroup of 20, has been effective. The World Trade \nOrganization\u2019s rules-based trading system has held up \nwell. But, like many countries, New Zealand is \nfrustrated that the conclusion of the Doha Development \nRound still eludes us. \n Over these last few days, especially in the context \nof discussion of progress towards the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, I have heard many fine words \nspoken in support of the world\u2019s disadvantaged. I take \nthis opportunity to remind those speakers and countries \nthat the single most effective step that could be taken \nto advance the position of the world\u2019s disadvantaged \nwould be to create a framework within which they can \ntrade themselves to a better future. \n I want to strongly endorse President Obama\u2019s \nstatement, made yesterday, that there is no viable \nalternative to the resolution of conflict in the Middle \nEast other than two States, Israel and Palestine, living \nside by side in peace and security. We believe that \ndirect negotiations, with both parties at the table, are \nthe only way to resolve the conflict. We congratulate \nPresident Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu on \nhaving the courage to negotiate in very difficult \ncircumstances. We ask that Israel heed the international \ncommunity\u2019s unanimous call to extend the moratorium \non settlements and create the enabling atmosphere that \nwill allow direct negotiations to continue. \n We also agree with President Obama that \nresolution of the Middle East conflict is not just the \nresponsibility of Israel and Palestine. Countries in the \nregion especially, but also countries elsewhere, must \nwork towards Middle East peace. New Zealand, as a \nfriend of both Israel and Palestine, will play its part. I \nrecently visited the Sinai, where a New Zealand officer \nhas command of the Multinational Force and \nObservers. I was reminded that there has been peace \nbetween Israel and Egypt for more than 30 years, a \nprospect once unthinkable. With the commitment of the \ntwo parties and the support of the international \ncommunity, Israel and Palestine can enjoy the same \nfreedom from conflict. We all have a huge stake in \nachieving that objective. Resolution of the Palestinian \nquestion would tear out the fuse that threatens to ignite \nconflict in the Middle East and beyond. \n So today we add our voice to that of President \nObama and of others who believe that this dispute can, \nand must, be solved. And we call on all Members of \nthe United Nations to lend their support to this process \nin the critical weeks ahead."

        "file_text": "I did not attend the High-\nlevel Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs), as I was not yet in New York. Nevertheless, I \nwould like to inform the General Assembly that \nUganda will definitely achieve the following MDGs: \nGoal 1, on the eradication of extreme poverty and \nhunger; Goal 2, on achieving universal primary \neducation; Goal 3, on the empowerment of women and \nthe promotion of gender equality; Goal 7, on ensuring \nenvironmental sustainability; and Goal 8, on creating a \nglobal partnership for development. \n It is only in the areas of maternal and child health \nthat we may not achieve by 2015 the targets set. \nHowever, in Uganda, we have developed a national \nroad map to accelerate the reduction of maternal and \nchild mortality and morbidity, which is a \ncomprehensive strategy that clearly spells out our \nnational priorities in this area. In this strategy, we have \ngiven priority to four key intervention types, namely \neffective antenatal care, skilled attendance at birth, \nemergency care for women who experience \ncomplications in childbirth and family planning. We \nhave also given priority to creating infrastructure that \nsupports and strengthens the health-care system.  \n Regarding MDG 6, Uganda has made tremendous \nefforts with respect to HIV/AIDS prevention and \ncontrol. We are now renewing our efforts to deal with \nthe challenges of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. \n It is noteworthy that, overall, Uganda was \nrecently ranked among the middle performing \ncountries according to the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme\u2019s Human Development \nIndex. However, in Uganda, we have never believed in \ndonor-anchored responses to the MDGs as a \nsustainable solution. Responses to the MDGs should be \nanchored in the growth and transformation of the \neconomies of the target countries. I am therefore glad \nthat the cloud of Afro-pessimism is dispersing. The \nopinions of the Afro-pessimists are being consigned to \n  \n \n10-54965 30 \n \nwhere they have always belonged \u2014 to the dung-heap \nof history.  \n Some groups in the West, where Afro-pessimism \nabounded in the past, have now started talking of the \nAfrican lions, no doubt equating in their minds the \nperformance of the African economies with the Asian \ntigers of yesteryear. Groups like the McKinsey Global \nInstitute are beginning to group the African \neconomies \u2014 which collectively recorded a growth \nrate of 4.9 per cent of gross domestic product in the \ngloomy years of the recent global depression, \ncompared with the mere 2 per cent of gross domestic \nproduct that the countries of the Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development recorded in \nthe same period \u2014 into four categories. Those \ncategories are: diversified economies, oil-exporting \neconomies, economies in transition and pre-transition \neconomies. Uganda was put in the group of transition \neconomies.  \n Although the McKinsey group needs to improve \ntheir statistical base and some of their insights, they are \namong the first Western groups to recognize what \nwe \u2014 who have been working on African issues for a \nlong time, on goals we set out to achieve in the years \nafter independence \u2014 long knew was possible: to make \nAfrica move from Third World to First World, in the \nwords of Lee Kuan Yew, the former Prime Minister of \nSingapore. \n Although there are 53 economies of Africa being \nmanaged by the respective national authorities, reform \ntrends and ideas are sometimes shared. The McKinsey \ngroup estimates that the consumption level of Africa, \nwhich stood at $860 billion in 2008, will grow to \n$1.4 trillion by 2020.  \n What one needs to add is the fact that those \neconomies have become roaring lions, underdeveloped \ninfrastructure notwithstanding. What will happen when \nthe infrastructure bottlenecks are resolved? That is the \nquestion that one should ask oneself. What will happen \nwhen there is cheap and abundant electricity, cheap \nroad transport and cheap rail transport? Those areas \nhad been neglected for a long time. The study by the \nMcKinsey Global Institute revealed that there are now \n316 million new mobile phone subscribers since the \nyear 2000 in Africa, more than the entire population of \nthe United States. In other words, there are now more \nmobile phones in Africa than there are American \npeople living in the United States.  \n There are 600 million hectares of uncultivated \narable land in Africa. If our partners could concentrate \non assisting infrastructure development, Africa\u2019s \ntransition would be that much faster. All the same, a \ncountry like Uganda is transitioning. Aid in relevant \nsectors is welcome, but even without aid we are \nmoving forward. \n I know the theme of the general debate is \n\u201cReaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \nglobal governance\u201d. In my short address I have not \ntalked directly about this. I have instead spoken about \nAfrica\u2019s economic reawakening as a roaring lion. Was I \nirrelevant? I do not think so. It is those strong building \nblocks that will strengthen the United Nations.  \n Africa has been a weak link in the chain of the \nstruggle for improved governance in the world over the \nlast 50 years. Improved economic performance in \nAfrica is, therefore, good for the continent and also \ngood for the rest of the world."

        "file_text": "I \nwould like first of all to pay tribute to you, Sir, for \nyour election as President of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-fifth session, and wish you every success as \nyou carry out your duties in that role. Cape Verde \noffers you its full support.  \n I also appreciate the commitment of and the very \nfruitful work carried out by his predecessor, \nAmbassador Ali Abdussalam Treki, who was able to \nlead the Assembly during its sixty-fourth session with \nremarkable dynamism.  \n We confirm our support for the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, as he seeks to make the \nUnited Nations system ever more effective in working \nfor the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of the \nworld to peace, dignity and progress.  \n Our theme this year is reaffirming the central role \nof the United Nations in global governance. The points \nwhich I shall develop relate to that theme, which is a \ncross-cutting issue par excellence.  \n First of all, we have to save the planet. To do that \nwould seem self-evident \u2014 here everybody would \nseem to agree \u2014 yet if one considers the negotiations \nunderway with reference to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, there is a \ntendency towards pessimism rather than optimism. \nScientists have for some time now shown that our \nplanet seriously risks not being able to provide for life \nin all in its plenitude because of the consequences of \nglobal warming. We know today that time to act \neffectively is running out.  \n The participants at the Copenhagen Summit left \nknowing that there was no time left for quibbling. We \nsaid that last year here ourselves. Now is the time for \nus to take concerted, coherent and systematic action, so \nthat we can substantially reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, slow down global warming and avoid a rise \nin the sea level which could jeopardize vast coastal \nregions of the world, and in particular the small island \ndeveloping States, which are particularly vulnerable \nand suffer first-hand the consequences of increasingly \nfrequent and extreme inclement weather. \n Cape Verde is a State of the Sahel. For a long \ntime, therefore, we have faced drought, desertification \nand dramatic water scarcity. Those phenomena strongly \ninfluence what we do to preserve the environment and \nachieve human development.  \n We are seeking to adapt to and reduce the impact \nof climate change, whether it be in the specific terms \nof land reclamation and water conveyance or in the \ndevelopment of renewable energy, all of which are part \nof our national growth dynamics, alongside education, \nhealth, employment, infrastructure and so on.  \n We are in process of implementing an ambitious \nprogramme to use surface water by building dams and \nreservoirs to support the modernization of agriculture, \nthe development of livestock farming and food \nprocessing \u2014 all of which will help farmers \neverywhere. Following the food crisis of two years \nago, , similar efforts were made in Africa and small \nisland developing States to help farmers make a profit, \nhelp the economy make progress and help countries \nface the challenges of climate change. Financing, \nwithout which there would be many failures, projects \nwould be abandoned and obstacles would remain \ninsurmountable, was a key factor. So we need quickly \nto set up the financing announced within the fast-track \nframework. Time is running out. \n We believe that the international community, \nparticularly the developed countries and large \nemerging countries, must address the increased threat \nto global security and the repercussions for everybody \nof the devastating consequences of natural disasters \nand must continue to support the specific dynamics \naffecting the most vulnerable States with respect to \nclimate change in the areas of mitigation and \nadaptation and help them minimize the risks \nthreatening them in the present situation, knowing that \nsome of them are already facing the problems of \npopulation shifts and forced migration.  \n Solidarity is not a meaningless word for people \nwho live on islands. For some individuals, it is a \nquestion of survival; for nations, it is a question of \ntheir continued existence as peoples. Let us not offer \n \n \n43 10-55276 \n \nup the weakest as sacrificial lambs, for tomorrow all of \nus may be in a similar situation. Let us also not forget \nthat conflicts resulting from water scarcity on the \nplanet are foreseeable, which should be a major \nconcern that we must start tackling as of today.  \n We wish to reaffirm here that the ocean, which is \nfor our island country our vital environment, our \ncivilization and our inspiration, as well as our potential \nfor the future, must be protected and preserved. Just a \nfew days ago, with six coastal countries in West Africa \nand Norway, we signed an agreement that will help us \ncollectively to better manage this huge common \npotential and to keep watch over the protection of our \nocean interests. With the coastal States along the \nAtlantic Ocean, particularly those in the southern \nAtlantic, we confirm our resolve to make it an area for \ntrade and active solidarity, not unfair competition. \nInstead of making the ocean just one more element to \nbe gobbled up by human greed, let us try to preserve its \nunique value as a precious container of life and \nguardian of the hopes of the planet.  \n We must protect and empower women. We firmly \nbelieve that one of the major revolutions to be made in \nour time is the one enabling women to truly become \nfull and equal partners with men in their shared quest \nfor progress. In Cape Verde, we have made substantial \ngains in gender equality and equity, but there are still \nmajor challenges. For example, in our current \nGovernment consisting of 14 Ministers, eight of them \nare women. The report on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) for 2010 shows that Cape \nVerde has achieved gender parity in primary and \nsecondary education. Indeed, in some cases, there are \nmore girls than boys in school. \n Major investment in maternal and infant health \nmeans that 98 per cent of births are in a hospital \nenvironment with specialized assistants. Yet, 25 per \ncent of women suffer from domestic abuse. In \nParliament and in local authorities, there are few \nwomen participating. Poverty and unemployment affect \nmore women than men. We continue to work on this \nissue, and we think we are going in the right direction. \n UN Women, recently launched by Economic and \nSocial Council, is a universal entity charged principally \nwith overcoming the obstacles that prevented the four \nformerly separate bodies working in the gender area \nfrom responding more effectively to challenges in the \narea of gender equality and the empowerment of \nwomen.  \n UN Women is part of the effort to reform the \nUnited Nations begun nearly two decades ago with a \nview towards strengthening system-wide coherence. \nWe would like to congratulate Ms. Michelle Bachelet \nand assure her of Cape Verde\u2019s support in her new \nduties to defend, promote and empower women. We \nbelieve that the robustness of her mandate and her \npotential role of catalyst for the new entity should \nencourage donors to respond positively to meet its \nfunding needs.  \n We must continue to work for peace. The \nevolving international situation with groups of States \ncoming together to discuss major regional and global \nissues and to propose solutions is evidence of a trend \nthat, despite everything, is struggling to show its \nefficiency and cannot seem to reduce the worry of \nsome and the doubts of others.  \n We continue to believe that the United Nations, \nwhere each one of us has his or her place, can play a \ntruly effective part by ensuring going forward so that \nits dynamism is maintained, its mission is clearly \ndefined, and we all share in the responsibilities and the \ndecision-making. It is our universal institution that \nbrings together the essential conditions for handling \nthe problems of the world and that has been endowed \nwith the necessary collective responsibility. \nAccordingly, the huge mission of promoting and \nensuring better and more effective global governance is \na job that must be carried out by the United Nations. \n World peace remains a distant goal, and the \nhotbeds of tension, far from abating, persist, ever \ncloser. Conflicts weaken entire regions, creating \nrefugees and displaced persons by the millions, \nparalysing economies, destroying infrastructure and \nobliterating decades of work aimed at promoting \neducation, health and justice for the people. Sometimes \nthe very concept of the human being seems to be \nvanishing, giving way to an era of modern slaves who \ncan be moulded and exploited at will. Women suffer \nsexual violence, which has become a weapon of war, \nand child soldiers are often deployed unscrupulously as \ncombatants by both sides.  \n The United Nations, in this arena as in others, is \nstill the central element, functioning as the collective \nconscience of the community of nations, dedicated to \nmanaging our communal actions and finding solutions \n  \n \n10-55276 44 \n \nof consensus and cooperation. In this light, the \nrevitalization of the United Nations seems a \nrequirement of our time, inviting the participation of \nall. \n Cape Verde has always favoured universal and \ntotal disarmament. It wishes to help create a world \nwhere fear of the other is replaced by the need to \ncooperate with the other and a recognition of the other \nas a necessary, complementary partner. We continue to \nbelieve, for instance, in the future of talks between \nIsrael and the Palestinians, and we continue to hope \nthat we will see a Middle East with two independent \nStates living side by side in peace and security. But \nrestoring credibility to the Middle East peace process \nrequires, more than anything else, that the parties \nhonour their own obligations, which derive from their \ncommitments and from decisions and resolutions \nagreed to here in the United Nations. From this point of \nview, putting an end to hostilities in Gaza and on \nIsraeli soil, halting settlement in the occupied \nterritories, dismantling the wall and ending the \nblockade seem to us incontrovertible imperatives. We \nardently hope that the new talks will bring us closer to \npeace. \n Organized crime is a scourge that my country is \nfighting directly, with the support of many of our \npartners. Drug traffickers now swarm into our West \nAfrican subregion, threatening the stability of our \ncountries and destroying our efforts towards regional \nstability and peace for our peoples. A determined \nbattle, uniting producing nations, nations of transit and \nconsumer nations, must be vigorously and tirelessly \nwaged. We must not allow drugs to turn our children \ninto pariahs, the unfortunate victims of dirty money. \nHuman rights are at stake in that struggle for our \nchildren to live and flourish free of the influence of \ndrugs, so that tomorrow they may become citizens of \nthe world.  \n At the beginning of the twenty-first century \nthings are evolving in all spheres \u2014 and especially in \ninternational politics \u2014 because of circumstances and \nevents, but also because of the political will of the \nmost enlightened. Is it not time to put an end to \nsituations that are now obsolete vestiges of the cold \nwar and the Second World War, such as in the case of \nCuba? The isolation and blockade are sources of \ntension and frustration and can hardly serve as the \nbasis for new hope. Generations are changing, attitudes \nare evolving and the aspirations of the young are \ndifferent now. New generations have the right to a \nfuture of peace, understanding and healthy exchange. \nLet us show the wisdom to offer them a world worthy \nof their dreams and aspirations.  \n We must innovate for the future. When we \nbecame one of the eight pilot countries for the \nDelivering as One experiment in 2006, we wanted, of \ncourse, to benefit from positive impact of such a leap \nforward in this way in our relations with the various \nUnited Nations agencies. We also wanted to participate \nin reforming the United Nations system, so that it \ncould better meet the demands of the world today. \nMoreover, our Government believes that reform means \nsimplifying the well-known United Nations \nbureaucracy. Today we are witnessing real progress and \nclear mutual benefits. The funds allotted to our country \nare increasing, the effectiveness of the various agencies \nis improving, there is a real sense of ownership, and \nthere is also leadership by the Government and \ndynamic synergy among all the parties involved \u2014 \npointing us ever forward on this path. The recent \nmeeting of the eight pilot countries in Hanoi was a \nsuccess, and we eagerly await new additions to the \nfamily. \n Since independence 35 years ago, Cape Verde has \nmade great strides in human development and has \nbecome a middle-income country. Between 1990 and \n2007 our human development index rose from 0.589 to \n0.708. Per capita income, barely $300 per year at the \ntime of our independence, is now $3,041 per year. \nSchool enrolment stands at 96 per cent. Illiteracy has \nbeen reduced to 18.5 per cent, declining as much for \nwomen as for men. We project 6 per cent growth for \nthe year 2010. \n We have achieved much in education, health and \npolitical participation thanks to our Government\u2019s \npolicy aimed at eradicating poverty and achieving food \nsecurity and gender equality and equity. In the last \ndecade poverty has dropped from 49 per cent in 1989 \nto 36.7 per cent in 2002 to 26 per cent in 2007. \nEstimates predict a poverty rate in 2010 of 24 per cent. \n That progress is the result of investing in people. \nEducation and vocational training are the strategic axes \nof our governance and take up over half of our State \nbudget. We have also invested in health and social \nsecurity. Moreover, the Government is following a \nstrategy of making the country an international service \nprovider, so that it can compete in the world economy \n \n \n45 10-55276 \n \nand accelerate growth and job creation, thereby \nincreasing family income and significantly decreasing \npoverty. \n While we know that we must act quickly and \ndecisively to save the planet, we seem to drag our feet \nwhen it comes to matching concrete actions to our \nwords. While we proclaim the virtues of equality \nbetween men and women and gender parity \u2014 and \ntheir positive effects on development and therefore on \npeace and security \u2014 we still note that substantial \npolitical will at the national level and a determined \ndrive at the international level are still needed to push \nforward the fight to make women full partners in the \nfuture of the world. If peace is everywhere considered \na fundamental, legitimate aspiration of peoples and \nnations, and indeed a universal necessity, it is no less \ntrue that it must be won every day, and that millions of \nhuman beings wake to the sound of guns and wonder \nevery night if they will see the next morning or if their \nfamily will still be alive. Peace can no longer be a \nutopian dream or a fragile, always tentative reality, as \nin the Middle East, Central Africa or other places in the \nworld. \n In an increasingly interdependent and threatened \nworld, we need to give our collective energies a chance \nand not seclude ourselves in a defeatist attitude of \nisolation, bereft of any future. We must be innovative \nin our ways of thinking, in our political ideas and in \nour vision of the State. We must be innovative and \ncarry our innovation into our inter-State relations and \nour defence of our own interests, so as to promote \nequity and democracy in international relations, \npromote a greater awareness of fair exchange and \njustice in the relations of States and thereby foster \nsecurity for all, in a multilateralism driven by the \ncontributions of all members of the international \ncommunity, thus preserving the hope for peace all \naround the world.  \n All the great revealed religions talk of hope and \ncompassion. Will those universal values be condemned \nto remain the poor relations of international politics? \nLet us make of their inspired message the bedrock of \nour international relations. Let us make the individual \nhuman the centre of our national concerns and our \nglobal interests. That is the basis, it seems to me, of the \nresponsibility to protect that we proclaim here in this \nHall. Let us make that message a harbinger of the \nfuture for our nations and our peoples, for now more \nthan ever our destinies are shared and tied to our \nMother Earth. Humankind is humankind\u2019s best \nmedicine, an old African proverb tells us. We can be if \nwe want to be."

        "file_text": "I am honoured to \naddress this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly \non behalf of the people of Liberia. I congratulate you, \nMr. President, on your election to lead this Assembly \nand am convinced that you will bring to the office your \nwealth of experience as a former President and Foreign \nMinister of the Swiss Confederation. \n Let me express appreciation to your predecessor, \nHis Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, for the \ncapable manner in which he conducted the affairs of \nthe sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. \n Allow me also to extend highest commendation \nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his unwavering \ncommitment to the Organization and his efficient \nmanagement of its affairs.  \n I wish to congratulate President Jacob Zuma and \nthe Government and people of South Africa on having \nsuccessfully hosted the 2010 World Cup for the first \ntime on our African continent. They made Africa \nproud, and we in turn are proud of them. \n Some four years ago, I stood at this rostrum and \ntold the story of a country exhibiting the symptoms of \ntwo decades of self-destruction: a criminalized and \ncollapsed economy, a suffocating external debt overhang, \ndysfunctional institutions, destroyed infrastructure, a \npariah nation in a state of decay, and a people in a state \nof despair. All of this translated into hundreds of \nthousands in refugee camps, equal numbers of the \ntalented in the diaspora, and thousands of women, \nyoung people and children struggling for survival. \n Today, I stand here to report on the progress that \ncan be made from the collective effort of a resilient \npeople, a responsive partnership, and effective \nleadership. We have come to report with confidence \nthat Liberia is well on the way to recovery. In less than \nfive years, our economy has experienced an average \nannual growth rate of 6.5 per cent, despite the drag on \nthe two-digit potential occasioned by the 2009 global \neconomic crisis. \n I can say with pride that, having successfully \ncarried out the reforms required under the Heavily \nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative, on \n17 September, at the Paris Club, the final segment of \nLiberia\u2019s $4.9-billion external debt was written off the \nbooks. I can report that we have opened the economy \nto put the private sector at the centre of our \n  \n \n10-54965 2 \n \ndevelopment effort and thereby have attracted some \n$16 billion in private investment in the reactivation of \nour mining, agriculture and forestry sectors. In \naddition, a new potential was recently discovered in oil \nexploration. \n The results of reform in our security sector, \nenhanced by the continued deployment of the United \nNations peacekeeping force, have stabilized the \nsecurity situation in the country, where people move \nfreely around. Experience in this regard shows that \npeacekeeping and peacebuilding can and should take \nplace concurrently, and we are pleased that Liberia is \nnow formally placed on the agenda of the \nPeacebuilding Commission to enable us to chart the \nway for a smooth transition from peacekeeping and \npeacebuilding to recovery. \n Moreover, we have encouraged a vibrant \nenvironment in which people have exercised their \ninalienable rights to free expression, association, \nreligion and access to the press without hindrance. \nNobody has been molested on account of views \nexpressed. Liberia has no prisoners of conscience in \ndetention, nor does anyone have cause to flee in fear \nfor their life or safety on account of their political \nbeliefs or association. \n Thus, in promoting a liberal environment in \nwhich freedom, equity and equality are exercised as the \nbest guarantees of peace, security and stability, we can \nboast of being counted among the Governments that \nhave demonstrated commitment to good governance \nand proven respect for human rights. \n Regionally, Liberia continues to demonstrate its \ncommitment to good-neighbourliness, peaceful \ncoexistence and respect for the sovereign integrity of \nother nations. We actively participate in subregional \nand regional affairs through the African Union, the \nEconomic Community of West African States, the \nCommunity of Sahel-Saharan States, and the Mano \nRiver Union. The Mano River Union is currently under \nLiberia\u2019s chairmanship, and this has allowed us to stay \nengaged with our members, Guinea and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, \nas they embark upon their political transitions. \n We hail the recent breakthrough by President \nBarack Obama in bringing the Palestinians and Israelis \nback to the negotiating table and holding their leaders \nto their words to fulfil their promise to remain engaged \nand conduct direct talks aimed at ending that long-\nrunning crisis. \n Because we live in a global village, a continued \ncrisis in any Member State or region should warrant \nour concern. Moreover, an unending crisis contradicts \nthe cardinal objective of the United Nations, which is \nthe promotion of international peace and security. In \nthat regard, we suggest that the situation in Somalia \nwarrants a Chapter VII intervention. In a country that \nhas gone many years without a stable constitutional \nGovernment, the presence of pirates, extremists and \nother terrorist elements there should sound the alarm. \nThe world needs to act promptly, as we cannot afford \nto see Somalia remain a haven for anarchists and \nextremists. \n That is why our Government supports the role of \nthe African Union in fielding troops in Somalia. We \ncall for more troop deployment from other countries, \nand we strongly support action to put an end to the \nSomali quagmire. We also call on the Somalis \nthemselves to accept dialogue and go to the negotiating \ntable to thrash out their differences and restore their \ncountry to rightful peace and dignity. While we \nacknowledge the right of States to self-defence and the \npromotion of programmes in support of national \ninterests, we call on them to do so responsibly, with \nrespect for international public opinion and the \nprotocols and conventions surrounding such \ndevelopments. \n At this week\u2019s Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) summit, we reaffirmed Liberia\u2019s commitment \nto continuing to work for the achievement of all eight \nGoals, although we are implementing those Goals \nunder a more challenging context. Our national \ndevelopment agenda and programmes for ensuring \nnational reconciliation, good governance and the rule \nof law, national security, food security, and the \nimplementation of our poverty reduction strategy are \nconsistent with the objectives of the MDGs. Our \nprogress bears the fruits of this commitment. \n We are pleased to note the progress the world has \nmade in the advancement of women. Today, there is \ngreater representation of women in Government, in \npolitical life, business and civil society. Liberia\u2019s own \neffort was recognized on Sunday when we received an \naward for our progress on MDG 3, on the \nempowerment of women. We also commend this body \nand the Secretary-General for their work in \nestablishing the United Nations Entity for Gender \nEquality and the Empowerment of Women, and we \n \n \n3 10-54965 \n \napplaud the appointment of the former President of \nChile, Michelle Bachelet, to take on this responsibility. \n We have five years left to go to achieve the \nMDGs. For us, it is not the target date that matters; \nrather, it is the commitment to achieving the Goals that \nis important. We therefore call upon our partner \ncountries to support the realization of the Goals \nthrough strong global partnership, as recommended in \nMDG 8. We believe in the partnerships we have \nenjoyed with the bilateral and multilateral institutions \nthat have made our progress possible. We call upon all \nin this Hall to secure the strength of this partnership, \nwhich benefits all of our countries, by supporting the \nreplenishment of the resources of the World Bank and \nthe African Development Bank. \n Liberia\u2019s progress is not without challenges. The \nsatisfactory security environment of which I speak is \nstill fragile, and made more so by the political \nuncertainties in our subregion. We also continue to face \nthe tensions associated with the thousands of our \nyoung people who, lacking skills, are still unemployed. \nMoreover, we continue to manage the raised \nexpectations expressed in the demand from villages \nand communities across the country for essential \ninfrastructure such as roads, schools and clinics. \nPerhaps the greatest challenge we face is to go beyond \nthe measures we have taken in formulating a public \nservice code of conduct, in introducing new \nprocurement and financial management systems, and in \nestablishing and strengthening the pillars of \nintegrity \u2014 all aimed at addressing long-standing \ncorruption. Reform of the judicial system and efforts to \nchange an inherited value system are additional \nmeasures that are under way. \n Another challenge is Liberia\u2019s vulnerability to \norganized cross-border crime, including drug and \nhuman trafficking, as the result of porous borders and \nlimited law-enforcement capacity, with weak national \nsecurity organizations. Against this background, we \nrecently signed the Freetown Commitment on \nCombating Illicit Trafficking of Drugs and \nTransnational Organized Crime in West Africa, which \nshould assist us in promoting capacity-building in the \nregion to combat transnational crime. \n The root cause of civil crisis in Liberia was the \nconsistent failure of democratic transitions that would \nusher in Governments elected by the people. With the \nsupport of the United Nations, multiparty democratic \nelections were held in 2005, following the end of the \ncivil crisis. In keeping with our Constitution, the \nLiberian people will once again exercise the right of \nchoice when we hold elections in 2011. \n The 2011 elections will mark a groundbreaking \nturning point. They will complete Liberia\u2019s transition \nto full constitutional rule and participatory democracy. \nThis will be the true test of Liberia\u2019s progress on the \nroad to development and its defining moment, which, if \nsuccessful, will serve as proof that we can truly stay on \nan irreversible course towards peace and development. \nIt is absolutely essential that everything be done to \nensure a peaceful, legitimate and transparent process. I \nwish to state categorically that my Government is \ncompletely and fully committed to this objective, and \nwe call on the international community to stay with \nLiberia on this last stretch. Already, the process leading \nto the holding of elections in 2011 has begun with the \nrelease of the election timetable. \n As a founding Member of this Organization, \nLiberia remains inspired by the noble objectives of the \nUnited Nations in meeting enormous global challenges. \nWe believe in its ability to formulate and implement \nprogrammes, particularly those aimed at raising the \nstandard of living of people, forging global cooperation \nand solidarity, and encouraging dialogue to reduce \ntension and conflicts. \n In closing, we say again that Liberia is on the \nway to recovery. We have thrown off the label of a \npariah State. We have restored hope to our people, \ncredibility and honour to our national integrity, and \nwon international creditworthiness and respect. Our \nconfidence in the future of our country is firm. Our \nnew vision of a rising Liberia seeks to move us to a \nmiddle-income country by the year 2030. This is an \naggressive goal, but we are determined, and through \nefficiency in the allocation and use of our natural \nresources, we will succeed. We thank you, Sir, and all \nthe members of this noble institution for the support \nthat has brought Liberia to this point of progress."

        "file_text": "I would like \nfirst to extend my hearty congratulations to you, Sir, on \nyour unanimous election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session. With your rich \nexperience in international affairs, we believe you will \nsucceed in your task. I would also like to pay tribute to \nyour predecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalem Treki, for his \ncommitment and skill in discharging his challenging \nfunctions during the previous session, and I convey to \nhim my special thanks. \n I also wish to thank Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon and his aides for their untiring efforts in the \nservice of peace and development throughout the \nworld, particularly in the least developed countries. \n As the first decade of the twenty-first century \ndraws to a close, it is certainly worthwhile to review \nthe ground covered since we proclaimed, some \n10 years ago in this very Hall, our common resolve to \ncut poverty in half by 2015, worldwide. We all recall \nthe enthusiasm engendered by that solemn \ncommitment. \n Today, we are forced to note that we are still \nquite far off the track. More than one billion people are \nstill living in extreme poverty. The development gap \nbetween the countries of the North and those of the \nSouth continues to widen instead of narrowing. \nInternational assistance is stagnating and remains \nbelow the level of commitment made by developed \ncountries to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national \nproduct to it. The results in the eight priority areas of \nthe Millennium Development Goals are disappointing, \neven unsatisfactory, while the deadline of 2015 is just \naround the corner. \n So what happened? The economic crisis caused \nby the recent upheavals in financial markets is \ncertainly to blame. The slowdown in activity \nworldwide \u2014 and, in some cases, recession \u2014 \nmonopolized the attention of the countries of the \nNorth. They gave priority to reviving their own \neconomies and solving their own social problems. \nHowever, even though we can understand that, it does \nnot explain everything. \n In fact, the awareness shown at the turn of the \ncentury of the disastrous consequences of deepening \npoverty in the third world seems to have waned \nsignificantly. Yet the situation has not only failed to \nimprove, it continues to deteriorate. On several \noccasions, from this rostrum and elsewhere, I have \ndrawn the attention of the international community to \nthe problem posed by the growth in poverty worldwide. \nI have pointed out that, for ethical reasons, it behooves \nus all to express solidarity with the most \nunderprivileged. I have further indicated that this is, of \ncourse, in everyone\u2019s interests, for the ever-widening \ngap between the rich and the poor can only exacerbate \ntensions and jeopardize international peace and \nsecurity. \n I will be pardoned, I am sure, if I dwell a little on \nthe case of Africa. It is undeniably the continent most \naffected by extreme poverty, which is generally \naccompanied by food shortages, epidemics, population \nmovements and insecurity. Is it any wonder, then, that \nsuch profound misery sometimes explodes, as was the \ncase two years ago during what were dubbed the food \nriots? The international community cannot remain \nindifferent to such a threat, which could undermine our \nefforts to advance democracy and ensure our \ndevelopment. \n Let me make myself clear. It is not a matter of \nengaging in recriminations for the sake of any \nideology, of ascribing motives to this or that country or \ngroup of countries, or of sermonizing. I am the first to \nacknowledge that the United Nations and its agencies \nhave provided assistance and guidance to our continent \nsince independence; that most countries of the North \nhave, through their cooperation, financial assistance \nand debt cancellation, lent and continue to lend \nirreplaceable support to Africa; and that emerging \ncountries have taken over. We are, of course, grateful \nto all of them. \n  \n \n10-54833 24 \n \n However, that obviously is not enough. I am not \ntrying to apportion blame for this state of affairs. I \nmerely want to say that the solutions applied were \nperhaps not the best. I would add that from the African \nperspective, we have been burdened with too many \nhistorical handicaps \u2014 slavery, colonization, economic \ndependence and internal and external conflicts \u2014 and, \nof course, that we have lacked toughness and \nsteadiness of mind. \n For reasons of mutual interest mentioned earlier, I \nthink we should review the issue thoroughly, without \nulterior ideological motives or political or economic \nprejudices. No matter what is said, Africa has changed \nsignificantly over the past 50 years and seems to me to \nbe ready for a wide-ranging ideological debate on the \nissue, provided that it is conducted in a true spirit of \npartnership. Through this approach we can realize the \nfamous Marshall Plan for Africa, which is often \nmentioned but has yet to see the light of day. \n That concern led Cameroon to organize an \ninternational conference \u2014 Africa 21 \u2014 in Yaound\u00e9 on \nthe occasion of the celebration of the fiftieth \nanniversary of its achieving sovereignty. At that \nconference the 50 years of African independence were \nobjectively assessed and the future opportunities for \nour continent were evaluated. The conference was \nattended by several Heads of State and Government, \nformer Prime Ministers, high-level representatives of \ninternational organizations, experts of world renown, \nmajor corporate executives and Nobel Peace Prize \nwinners. \n The final declaration of the conference, which my \ndelegation has made available, can serve as a kind of \nguide for the rehabilitation of Africa, with regard to \nboth its economic recovery and its participation in \ninternational life. That is what it is all about \u2014 \nensuring that our continent does not remain forever \naid-dependent and that it plays its rightful role in \ninternational affairs. \n Allow me, in this Hall, to emphasize the second \npoint. How can we today explain why Africa is the \nonly continent without a permanent member on the \nSecurity Council? How can we explain that Africa is \nunable to make its voice heard when its problems are \nexamined in global economic and financial bodies \nwhile the decisions made there will be imposed on it? \nAt a time when emerging countries are rightly calling \nfor a seat on the Security Council commensurate with \ntheir economic and political weight, Africa as a whole \nshould not be forgotten. \n For a long time our continent has been treated, I \ndare say, as an object of international relations. Yet, it \nis directly affected by most of the major problems \nconfronting humanity today, be they migratory flows, \nglobal warming, economic and financial regulation, \nterrorism, et cetera. In short, it is sometimes the victim \nof phenomena for which it is not responsible. From \nthat standpoint also, there is a need to get out of the rut \nin which major negotiations appear to be bogged down. \n Africans seek more understanding and sympathy \nin the true sense of the words. The delayed \ndevelopment from which they suffer cannot be reduced \nto the Millennium Goals. Admittedly, they want to be \nless poor and to eat their fill, but above all, to be \nprotected from fear and want, to be freer and to \nimagine a future without anxiety. In short, they want to \nlive in a society that guarantees them those minimum \nconditions for existence and well-being. \n Most African countries have embarked on this \npath. For its part, over the last decades Cameroon has \nset up representative institutions, established the rule \nof law and ensured respect for human rights. On the \neconomic and social front, significant progress has \nbeen made in the areas of public finance, education and \nhealth. Should this trend continue, our country can \nexpect, in the medium term, to attain the status of an \nemerging country. \n That to me seems to be the mindset of most \nAfrican countries. Certainly, the international \ncommunity has a role to play in supporting them in \ntheir effort to join the global society. To that end, the \ninternational community needs to show more \nunderstanding, solidarity and, of course, more \nfraternity."

        "file_text": "I wish to extend our sincere \ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as the \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \nsession. I also thank the President at the sixty-fourth \nsession for his excellent stewardship of that session. \nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of \nthe United Nations, deserves our sincere appreciation \nfor his commitment and dedication. \n The message of the High-level Plenary Meeting \nof last week is still reverberating around this \nAssembly: the continuing poverty and hunger in \ntoday\u2019s world, where we have made great strides in all \nour endeavours, is unacceptable and must be brought to \nan end without delay. It is quite disheartening to note \nthat the number of poor has surpassed one billion and \nthat they are concentrated in certain regions and groups \nof countries, mostly in least developed countries \n(LDCs). \n The commitments expressed by the leaders \nattending the High-level Plenary Meeting last week \nrekindled our hope that it will be a different world in \n2015. Otherwise, the Millennium Declaration \n(resolution 55/2) and many other vital documents will \nremain only a compilation of lofty promises. Let us \nhope that we match our commitments with our deeds. \n International peace and security are our shared \ndesire and a common responsibility. The challenges are \nmultiple and complex. In an ever-changing world, the \nsources and the threats are varied, and so are the \nactors. Political and social conflicts have been \naggravated by abject poverty and disparity. Therefore, \nthe stabilization of global peace and security also \ndemands ensuring freedom from want and hunger as a \nbasic human right and enabling people to realize their \nfull human potential. Thus we believe that \ndevelopment, peace and security are inextricably \nlinked with one other. \n Nepal has consistently and unequivocally called \nfor general and complete disarmament of all weapons \nof mass destruction, under effective international \ncontrol. Nepal stands for the complete elimination of \nnuclear weapons in a time-bound manner. The \noperationalization of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty and the early conclusion of a fissile \nmaterials cut-off treaty should be our priority. We \nsupport efforts for the non-proliferation of small arms \nand light weapons. \n We welcome the signing in April this year of the \nNew START treaty between the United States and the \nRussian Federation on strategic offensive arms. We \nwelcome the successful outcome of the 2010 Review \nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the  \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. However, we \ncall for reinvigorating the Conference on Disarmament \nas a multilateral body, to start discussions on \nsubstantive issues. We also appreciate the efforts of the \nSecretary-General to advance nuclear disarmament on \nthe basis of the five-point action plan he has proposed. \n Nepal strongly believes that regional mechanisms \ncomplement efforts to promote the global disarmament \nagenda. The United Nations Regional Centre for Peace \nand Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, which we are \nproud to host, must be strengthened in order to \nrevitalize the Kathmandu process to facilitate dialogue \nand deliberations on confidence-building in the region. \n In today\u2019s world, devastating conflicts are a \nconstant threat to international security. Despite \nprogress on many fronts, violence and civil wars \n  \n \n10-55128 52 \n \ncontinue unabated. It is a matter of concern that \nintra-State conflicts and extremism have steadily \ngrown over the years. We should work collectively. In \naccordance with the principles and Charter of the \nUnited Nations, we should all contribute to resolving \nsuch conflicts through peaceful means and should help \nstabilize situations through peacebuilding efforts. \n In the Middle East, we are encouraged by the \nrecent direct dialogue between the Israelis and the \nPalestinians. We look forward to the success of the \ndialogue leading towards an independent Palestinian \nState alongside a secure Israel. We would like to see a \npeaceful resolution to disputes in the Korean peninsula \nthrough dialogue. \n Terrorism is a threat to all and knows no \ngeographical boundary. We unequivocally condemn \nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations and call \nfor resolute international actions to fight it. Nepal has \nbeen implementing the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy and is party to the South Asian \nAssociation for Regional Cooperation Regional \nConvention on Suppression of Terrorism of 1987 and \nits Additional Protocol. \n Legitimacy, universality and common ideals have \nbeen the defining features of the United Nations. \nContinued adherence to its core principles and \npurposes will reinforce sovereign equality, territorial \nintegrity, non-interference and the peaceful settlement \nof disputes. The inspiring values and the lofty ideals \nthat underpin the United Nations Charter remain as \nrelevant as ever. \n We live in an era of continuous change. The \neconomic landscape is also changing with the \nemergence of new, yet vibrant, poles of growth. \nGlobalization has changed the pattern of economic \nrelations, although its benefits are not widely and \nequitably distributed. \n The effectiveness of the United Nations depends \non our collective will to act and to deal with global \nissues resolutely. In the face of new and emerging \nchallenges, it is urgent that the ideals of the United \nNations be translated into action effectively and in a \ncoherent manner. The theme of this year\u2019s general \ndebate \u2014 \u201cReaffirming the central role of the United \nNations in global governance\u201d \u2014 captures that \nessence. \n We underline the centrality of the United Nations \nnot only in maintaining peace and security, but also in \npromoting international cooperation for development. \nIts role in shaping policy debate on and establishing \nglobal norms for economic and financial matters must \nnot be sidelined. The reform agenda needs to strike the \nright balance to promote stability in the broadest sense. \nJust as security and peace are critical for the \ninternational community, so is the development \nagenda. It must be given a focused priority within the \nUnited Nations system. \n United Nations reform should be pursued in a \nsystematic and holistic manner to further enhance the \nOrganization\u2019s global standing.  \n The realities of the contemporary world call for a \nchange in the composition and working methods of the \nSecurity Council. We support the expansion of \nmembership in the Council in both categories to reflect \nthe current realities of the world. We also call for \ntransparency in its working methods. We welcome \nrecent efforts to structure the debates with a view to \nstarting negotiations by taking into account the views \nof all Member States. \n We welcome the ongoing discussions on the \nrevitalization of the General Assembly in the context of \nthe balance between the various organs of the United \nNations, as envisioned by the founders. The role of the \nEconomic and Social Council must be enhanced in \npromoting global economic relations and in advancing \nthe development agenda, in close cooperation with the \nBretton Woods institutions and other relevant \ninstitutions. The Development Cooperation Forum and \nthe annual ministerial review are a welcome change in \nthat body. \n We need to make the United Nations more \neffective in ensuring coherence and consistency in the \nglobal economic, financial and trading systems. We \ncall for special support for counter-cyclical measures, \nsocial safety nets to protect the vulnerable, and fiscal \nspace to mitigate the crisis. We should make all these \nsteps particularly responsive to the needs and concerns \nof vulnerable countries, such as LDCs. \n Nepal welcomes the adoption of the resolution on \nsystem-wide coherence by the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fourth session, with a view to strengthening and \nstreamlining the operational activities of the United \nNations in the field of development (resolution \n64/289). We also welcome and strongly support the \n \n \n53 10-55128 \n \nestablishment of UN Women as a single consolidated \nentity to deal with issues pertaining to gender equality \nand the empowerment of women. \n Global peace and stability are our cherished goal. \nGuided by that principled objective, Nepal has \nextended unflinching support to all major United \nNations initiatives for the maintenance of international \npeace and security through its active and consistent \nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping \noperations around the world. In 2008, we celebrated \nthe fiftieth anniversary of our association with United \nNations peacekeeping operations with a view to further \nconsolidating our contributions to the cause of \ninternational peace and security. Today, more than \n5,000 Nepalese peacekeepers work in 13 different \npeacekeeping missions around the world. Nepal\u2019s \ninvolvement in United Nations peacekeeping missions \nhas been one of the remarkable features of its \ninternational engagement. We continue to participate \nwith dedication. \n In line with our solemn commitment to the \nUnited Nations Charter and our contribution to \npromoting its ideals, I have the pleasure of announcing \nat this Assembly that the Government of Nepal has put \nforward the candidacy of Mr. Kul Chandra Gautam, \nadviser to the Prime Minister of Nepal on the peace \nprocess and international affairs, for the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. \n The gradual increase in the number of \npeacekeeping missions is an indicator of the sombre \nfact that the number of conflicts around the world has \nincreased in recent years. The sustainable way to \nresolve conflicts is to look at them comprehensively \nand remove the factors that generate and sustain them. \n Nepal\u2019s commitment to human rights is resolute. \nWe are party to major international human rights \ninstruments. We are fully aware that the protection and \npromotion of all human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms strengthen the sustainability of peace and \nprogress. The National Human Rights Commission, an \nindependent judiciary, a vibrant civil society and the \nmedia have all played an important role in promoting \nawareness and protecting human rights in Nepal. \n Our fellow South Asian country Pakistan recently \nsuffered tragic loss of lives and destruction due to \nunprecedented floods. Similarly, fellow LDC Haiti \nfaced a devastating earthquake. Those disasters have \nwiped out hard-earned gains, and therefore we call for \nfull sympathy and support to them in their hour of \nneed. \n Climate change has become a challenge to human \nexistence, a multidimensional threat to human lives \nand all living things, the global ecosystem and human \ncivilization. It has a direct impact on our efforts to \neradicate poverty and hunger and to preserve the \necological balance. \n My country, which is a least developed \nlandlocked country with mountainous terrain, is highly \nvulnerable to climate change. The Himalayas remain \nthe perennial source of freshwater for over a billion \npeople living in South Asia. Global warming has \nprecipitated the melting of snow in the Nepalese \nHimalayas, and about two dozen of our glacial lakes \ncould burst their banks any time, causing a huge loss of \nlives and property. Moreover, we face extreme weather \nevents, floods, soil degradation and desertification. \nBecause of their fragility, mountain countries face \nspecial vulnerability to climate change. \n Countries like Nepal contribute the least to \nclimate change, yet we bear a disproportionate impact, \nand it is the poor and vulnerable people among us who \nface its severe effects. We cannot wait for action \nforever. At the national level, we are pursuing \nafforestation programmes and promoting the use of \nalternative sources of energy, as well as hydropower \ngeneration. \n There is an urgent need to make progress on \nclimate negotiations through an ambitious and \ncomprehensive outcome in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, later this \nyear. The international community should agree on \nnew, predictable, transparent and substantially \nenhanced resource mobilization and a fast-track \nprovision to ensure resources for mitigation, \nadaptation, technology transfer, reducing emissions \nfrom deforestation and degradation \u2014 REDD-Plus \u2014 \nand capacity-building in the least developed countries. \nLDCs must be given priority so that they may \nwithstand the sweeping impact of climate change on \ntheir people\u2019s livelihoods. \n International responses to the special needs and \nconcerns of LDCs have had limited success. The \nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action \nhas produced mixed results. The overall performance \nof LDCs in the Millennium Development Goals and \nother internationally agreed development goals stands \nwell below their expectations, despite some progress. \n  \n \n10-55128 54 \n \nThat is primarily because we continue to face structural \nhandicaps and constraints, as well as a critical resource \ngap in our development efforts. \n Mutually reinforcing and exacerbating food, \nenergy, economic and financial crises, together with \nthe adverse and disproportionate impacts of climate \nchange, have further worsened the conditions of LDCs. \nLimited economic activity, stagnant growth, the early \nstage of industrialization, heavy reliance on \nsubsistence agriculture as the mainstay of the national \neconomy and a lack of employment opportunities in \nother sectors have made poor countries highly \nvulnerable to external shocks. \n Such challenges cannot be overcome without a \nrenewed and scaled-up global partnership for \ndevelopment. The fulfilment of all commitments to \nofficial development assistance in a predictable, \ntransparent and accountable manner, the enhanced \nprovision of duty- and quota-free market access for all \nLDCs, and the early conclusion of the Doha Round \nwith an ambitious, balanced, equitable and \ndevelopment-oriented outcome and early results in \nprovisions aimed at LDCs will help generate economic \ngrowth through equitable trade. Enhanced debt relief \nmeasures, an increased flow of foreign direct \ninvestment, technology transfer and investment in \nbuilding long-term productive capacity will be \ncritically important in order to ensure resources for the \nfinancing of sustainable development in LDCs. \n The United Nations will host the fourth United \nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries \nin Istanbul next year. The Conference must aim to have \nan ambitious, comprehensive, forward-looking and \nresults-oriented outcome. As the Chair of the LDC \nCoordinating Bureau, I call upon the international \ncommunity to make the Istanbul outcome a turning \npoint in addressing the multidimensional challenges \nand constraints that LDCs face today. The success of \nthe Conference will be measured by its contributions to \nmaking a difference in the conditions of the millions of \npoor in our countries. \n Nepal is also a landlocked country. Therefore, our \ndevelopment challenges are further compounded by \nthat reality, which increases the cost of our \ninternational trade substantially. Therefore, specific \nsupport measures to improve infrastructure and trade \nfacilitation in line with the Almaty Programme of \nAction for landlocked developing countries will be \ncritical to promoting their development needs. \n I will now touch on the political situation and the \nongoing peace process in my country. Nepal is passing \nthrough the arduous transition from a 10-year conflict \nto sustainable peace and stability with a nationally \ndriven peace process. We have come a long way since \nJune 2006, when the peace process started, with some \nups and downs, which is only natural for a complex \npeace process. Yet our national determination remains \nstrong and unwavering, and we are fully committed to \nbringing the ongoing peace process to a meaningful \nconclusion by resolving all outstanding issues. \n From a longer-term perspective, Nepal has \nachieved some remarkable progress since the signing \nof the Comprehensive Peace Accord on 21 November \n2006. The promulgation of the interim constitution, the \nelection of the Constituent Assembly and, \nsubsequently, the declaration of Nepal as a federal \ndemocratic republic stand as notable achievements. \n Today, the 601-member Constituent Assembly of \nNepal, a third of whom are women, is one of the most \ninclusive assemblies. The Assembly comprises \nrepresentation from different ethnic groups, backward \nregions and traditionally marginalized communities, \namong others. \n Historic and unique as it is, Nepal\u2019s peace \nprocess is not confined only to the issue of signing the \nPeace Accord and the elections to the Constituent \nAssembly. The next important task is to write a new \nconstitution for the newly born republic. That will \nconsolidate the gains made over the years in \nestablishing the people as the real source of \nsovereignty and State authority and in guaranteeing \nmultiparty democracy, human rights, a federal structure \nand inclusive governance. Therefore, the process \nencompasses a much broader agenda, leading towards \nthe historic transformation of Nepal\u2019s political, \neconomic and social structure. \n The people of Nepal nurture the hope of a better \nfuture, which they rightly deserve. Political \ntransformation needs to be complemented by social \ntransformation and economic prosperity. While \nensuring political stability, we are making efforts to \nrevive the economy with new and focused initiatives \nfor the acceleration of economic activities, including \nthrough the celebration of Nepal Tourism Year in 2011. \nWe hope that visitors will enjoy the flora and fauna of \n \n \n55 10-55128 \n \nNepal, including tours to Lumbini in Nepal, the \nbirthplace of Lord Buddha. To that end and to \nrevitalize and accelerate our economy, we look forward \nto ambitious recovery measures with support from the \ninternational community. \n Recently we have made some progress in \naddressing the core issues of the integration and \nrehabilitation of the former Maoist combatants. In that \ncontext, I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the \nGovernment and the Unified Communist Party of \nNepal-Maoist have agreed to complete the process \nwithin four months, under the monitoring and \nsupervision of the Special Committee, formed on the \nbasis of national consensus, as per the Constitution. \n We anticipate accomplishing the outstanding \nbasic tasks in the peace process within the coming four \nmonths, with the positive contributions of national \nstakeholders and the goodwill and support of the \ninternational community. Earlier this year, we also \nachieved remarkable success, with the help of the \nUnited Nations, in releasing the disqualified minors \nliving in cantonments, based on the action plan signed \non 16 December 2009. \n The United Nations Mission in Nepal has been \ninvolved in support of Nepal\u2019s nationally driven peace \nprocess. We express our appreciation to the United \nNations for its consistent support of our peace process. \n Nepal\u2019s commitment to the purposes and \nprinciples of the United Nations Charter is total and \nunflinching. For us, the United Nations is the best \nexpression of multilateralism. It has served the \ninternational community in the past and continues to \nwork as a linchpin of international relationships today. \nWe have no doubt as to its indispensability. \n However, it needs to do more in this globalized \nworld. Global problems require global solutions. That \nis possible only through multilateralism, based on \ninclusiveness and equity. We look for an enhanced and \ncoherent role of the United Nations in dealing with all \nglobal issues, but in particular those that affect the \nlives and livelihoods of the poor around the world. "

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Holy See, I am pleased to \nwarmly congratulate you, Mr. President, on your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fifth session, and to offer our best wishes for the \nsuccessful fulfilment of your mandate. In this new \nperiod of work for the General Assembly, the Holy See \nwishes to offer its genuine collaboration in tackling the \nnumerous challenges faced by the international \ncommunity. The 65 years of existence of the United \nNations are a unique event in history in and of \nthemselves, particularly when contrasted with the \nannihilation of hopes placed in the peace conferences \n  \n \n10-55396 20 \n \nof the beginning of the twentieth century, and later in \nthe League of Nations. \n The existence of the United Nations shows that \nhumankind has found in the Organization a response to \nthe terrifying tragedies of the two World Wars. Despite \nthe imperfection of its structures and its way of \nfunctioning, the United Nations has sought to bring \nsolutions to international problems in the economic, \nsocial, cultural and humanitarian fields, and has tried \nto fulfil the mandate given to it by its Charter, namely \nto be a centre for the coordination of the action of \nStates with a view to the maintenance of peace and \nfriendly relations among peoples. \n The dialogue among the representatives of States \nthat is renewed every year in the plenary of the General \nAssembly, which remains open and lively in the other \nbodies and agencies of the United Nations family, has \nbeen the basic tool for fulfilling this mandate. There \nhave been times when this dialogue has been, more \nthan anything else, a clash of opposing and \nirreconcilable ideologies and positions. However, the \nUnited Nations has become irreplaceable in the life of \nthe people of the world in the search for a better future \nfor all the inhabitants of the planet. \n It is from the perspective of this productive \ninternational dialogue carried out through the \ndiscussions and deliberations that take place in this \nHall that I would like to recall important developments \nrelated to international peace and security that took \nplace during the sixty-fourth session of the Assembly. \n First of all, the Holy See welcomes the entry into \nforce on 1 August of the Convention on Cluster \nMunitions. This instrument, which the Holy See was \namong the first States to ratify, does represent an \nimportant result for multilateralism, based on \nconstructive cooperation among Governments and civil \nsociety, as well as the connection between \nhumanitarian law and human rights.  \n Another important result was the positive \nconclusion last May of the eighth Review Conference \nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons with the publication of a consensus-\nbased document that provides for different actions \nrelated to the three main pillars of the treaty: nuclear \ndisarmament, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons \nand the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Among these, \nan important sign of hope was a decision to convene, \nbefore 2012, a conference to establish a Middle East \nzone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of \nmass destruction.  \n Furthermore, also in the area of peace and \ndisarmament, the first meeting, last July, in New York, \nof the Preparatory Committee for a Conference on the \nArms Trade Treaty, which is set for 2012 is also worth \nmentioning. This meeting showed that the process, \nwhich has begun for the treaty, is shared by all States \nthat are aware of the need to legally settle the issue of \nthe arms trade for reasons of peace, humanitarian \nprotection and social and economic development. \n In the context and spirit of successful \ninternational dialogue, we should also welcome the \nsigning of the New START treaty between the United \nStates and the Russian Federation. That signing is a \nstep forward in relations among the nuclear Powers, \nand the Holy See hopes that it will open new prospects \nand lead to substantial arms reductions in the future. \nSimilarly, during this session of the General Assembly, \na High-level Meeting was held, some days ago, on \nrevitalizing disarmament negotiations, which was very \nuseful for discussing ways to give new life to the \nConference on Disarmament and to continue to build a \nconsensus on the major obstacles to agreement on \ndisarmament, in particular, the Comprehensive \nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the Fissile Material Cut-\noff Treaty. We must do everything possible to achieve a \nworld free from nuclear weapons, and the Holy See \nsupports all efforts along these lines. \n During the previous session of the General \nAssembly, the United Nations made an unprecedented \ncontribution to international cooperation and peace in \nHaiti, where, during the earthquake of 12 January \n2010, the head of the United Nations Mission, \nAmbassador H\u00e9di Annabi, died, as did his assistant, \nMr. Luiz Carlos da Costa, along with 82 other civil \nservants and members of the peacekeeping forces. On \nbehalf of the Holy See, I would like to extend our \nsincere condolences to the Secretary-General and the \nnational authorities of the States of the persons who \ndied, as well as their families and colleagues. Their \nsacrifice should serve as an impetus for a new global \ncommitment to maintaining peace.  \n The Holy See has always recognized and \nappreciated actions carried out by United Nations \npeacekeeping forces. The important increase in \nrequests for intervention in recent years shows the \nincreased confidence in United Nations activities in \n \n \n21 10-55396 \n \ncooperation with regional organizations, but it also \nhighlights the importance of the growing role played \nby the United Nations and regional organizations in \npreventive diplomacy.  \n Likewise, the action of the Peacebuilding \nCommission remains fundamental to rebuilding the \nsocial, legal and economic fabric that was destroyed by \nwar and to avoiding the relapse into conflict. Initiatives \nto prevent conflicts, to peacefully resolve conflicts, to \nseparate warring parties and to promote reconstruction \ndeserve generous political and economic support from \nall States Members of the United Nations. Support \nfrom all would be an eloquent show of confidence in a \ndestiny based on solidarity for humankind.  \n If we think that normative developments with \nregard to disarmament and the non-proliferation of \nweapons have shown signs of progress, there are \nreasons for concern with respect to the many obstacles \nto global security and peace. Above all, military \nspending in the world continues to be excessive and \neven to increase. The problem of the exercise of the \nlegitimate right of States to the peaceful development \nof nuclear energy in accordance with effective \ninternational monitoring of non-proliferation remains \nrelevant. The Holy See encourages all parties involved \nin settling various ongoing controversies, in particular \nthose with respect to the Korean peninsula and the \nPersian Gulf region, as well as adjoining regions, to \ncarry out an honest in-depth dialogue that would be \nable to harmoniously reconcile all rights of the nations \nconcerned.  \n The recent terrible natural catastrophes in \nPakistan add to the difficulties caused by conflicts that \nhave beset that region. In addition to the humanitarian \nresponse, which must be generous, and other \nassociated measures, there must also be a broader \neffort at mutual and deeper understanding of the causes \nof the hostilities. \n Moreover, genuine dialogue, trust and generosity \nin putting aside peripheral or short-term interests are \nthe way to achieve a lasting solution to the conflict \nbetween the State of Israel and the Palestinians. \nDialogue and understanding among the various parties \ninvolved is also the only way to achieve reconciliation \nin Iraq and Myanmar, for example, as well as to \nresolve ethnic and cultural problems in Central Asia \nand the regions of the Caucasus and to calm recurring \ntensions in Africa, such as in the Sudan, just before \ndecisive elections. \n There is a significant economic component to \nmost of those conflicts. Substantially improving the \nliving conditions of the Palestinian people and other \npeoples living under civil or regional wars will no \ndoubt make a crucial contribution to transforming \nviolent opposition into patient and peaceful dialogue. \n The High-level Plenary Meeting on the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) took place \nhere several days ago. All Member States once again \nsolemnly committed themselves to make every \nnecessary effort to achieve the MDGs by 2015. The \nHoly See welcomes the reiterated will to uproot \npoverty, which it hopes will resolutely be brought to an \nend. However, it is important to underscore that we \nwill not achieve the Goals without fulfilling two great \nmoral imperatives.  \n On the one hand, it is essential that rich and \nemerging countries fully honour their development \nassistance commitments and immediately establish and \noperationalize a financial and trading framework that \non the whole favours the weakest countries. On the \nother hand, rich and poor alike should ensure an ethical \npolitical and economic change that guarantees good \ngovernance and eradicates all forms of corruption. \nOtherwise, we risk reaching the year 2015 not having \nachieved sufficient results, except \u2014 and this would be \nsad and paradoxical \u2014 in the areas of population \ncontrol and promoting minority lifestyles, as \nintroduced in certain paragraphs of the recently held \nsummit. In that case, the Millennium Goals would \nbecome a veritable fraud vis-\u00e0-vis the comprehensive \nhuman development of peoples. \n With regard to the environment, which is the \nsubject of Millennium Goal 7, the participation of more \nthan 115 heads of State and Government at the \nConference of the States Parties to the Framework \nConvention on Climate Change held in Copenhagen in \nDecember 2009 demonstrated the attention and \nimportance attached to an issue as complex as the \nclimate on the international agenda. The Holy See \nhopes that the next session of the Conference of the \nStates Parties will take a political decision that will \nmake the negotiations on a legally binding agreement \nmore concrete. \n At the heart of that debate is the establishment of \na development model based on a new energy system. \n  \n \n10-55396 22 \n \nNevertheless, it is important to recall the ethical issues \nassociated with this matter. It is not just about \nachieving a world less dependent on fossil fuels and \nmore devoted to energy efficiency and alternative \nfuels, but about changing unbridled and irresponsible \nconsumption behaviour. As my delegation has often \nobserved with regard to the Millennium Goals, it is that \nbehaviour, and not population growth and improving \nliving conditions in less developed countries, that \nplaces a growing and unsustainable burden on \nresources and on the environment. \n The positive results achieved by the international \ncommunity in the course of the Assembly\u2019s previous \nsession would not have been possible without dialogue \namong Governments, which are being joined with \ngrowing determination and effectiveness by civil \nsociety interlocutors. However, to be honest and \neffective, that dialogue must be genuinely dia-logos \u2014 \nan exchange of wisdom and wisdom shared. The \ndialogue must move quickly from an exchange of \nwords and a search for balance among opposing \ninterests towards a genuine sharing of wisdom for the \ncommon good. \n It is precisely for that reason that Article 1 of the \nCharter links the promotion of human rights with the \ndefence of peace, settlement of disputes and resolving \ninternational problems of an economic nature. Nations \nare not separate entities, independent of the peoples \nwho comprise them. The fundamental national interest \nof all Governments should be the establishment and \nmaintenance of the necessary conditions for the full \ndevelopment of the material and spiritual good of \nevery inhabitant of their countries. The promotion of \nand respect for human rights are therefore the ultimate \ngoal of dialogue and international affairs, as well as the \nindispensable conditions for genuine and fruitful \ndialogue among countries.  \n The Holy See is also attentively following the \nwork of the Assembly\u2019s Third Committee and of the \nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. \nThis statement in the general debate is also an \nopportunity for me to express our support for the \nOffice of the High Commissioner for Refugees and all \nspecialized agencies and bodies working in the broad \nfield of human and humanitarian rights. In that regard, \nthe Holy See also believes that, although slow, the \nprogress made in the discussions on the principle of the \nresponsibility to protect is cause for hope. \nNevertheless, resolute and effective attention is still \nlacking with regard to the problems of refugees, people \nwho have been forcibly expelled and large-scale \ndisplacements.  \n The history of the development of human rights \nitself illustrates that respect for religious freedom is the \ncornerstone of the entire human rights architecture. \nWhen that freedom is lacking, absent too will be the \nrecognition of the transcendent nature of every human \nperson, which entails a dignity that existed before, and \nis superior to, the political and normative awareness \nand that creates an irrepressible framework of freedom \nand responsibility. If religious freedom falters, all \nhuman rights are at risk of becoming something that \ngovernment grants \u2014 or, at best, the result of a balance \nof social forces, which are variable by nature, because \nthey will have no foundation other than balance or \nagreement itself. \n Beyond criticism of the organizational limitations \nand lack of effectiveness of the United Nations, we see \nthat there is a universally shared awareness of the need \nfor the Organization, as well as a universal feeling of \ngratitude for its efforts. All of us understand that, by \nvirtue of its numerous bodies, the Organization \nconstitutes an essential forum for dialogue and \nunderstanding between nations. The best way of \nguaranteeing that the United Nations continues to carry \nout its historic mission of coordinating and keeping all \nStates united around the common goals of peace, \nsecurity and comprehensive human development for all \nwill be to continuously focus on the dignity of all men \nand women and effectively respect it, beginning with \nthe right to life \u2014 even of the weakest, such as unborn \nchildren and the terminally ill \u2014 and religious \nfreedom.

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like \nto extend my sincere congratulations to His Excellency \nMr. Joseph Deiss on his election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I am fully \nconfident that with his vast experience he will be able \n \n \n31 10-54965 \n \nto lead this session to great success. May I also \ncommend His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdulssalam Treki, \nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session, \nfor his effective leadership. I would also like to \napplaud Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \nleadership in fulfilling effectively the various duties \nand tasks mandated to address the current emerging \nchallenges and constraints. \n The global state of affairs today has undergone \nrapid change and become more complex, offering both \nopportunities and challenges. Global and regional \npeace and security are threatened by conflicts and \narmed confrontation. Severe and unprecedented natural \ndisasters have become a regular phenomenon that we \nhave to live with. The tragedies caused by natural \ncatastrophes, such as in Haiti, China, Pakistan and \nelsewhere, have intensified and are coupled with the \neconomic crisis that we are already facing. \n No one can deny that those calamities and \nchallenges are mostly the result of our own human \naction. National challenges have gone beyond national \nboundaries and become matters of international \nconcern, matters that a single country or even a group \nof countries cannot overcome alone. Therefore it is the \nfull responsibility of the international community as a \nwhole to tackle them. \n Against that backdrop, it is time for us to fully \nrealize all the promises and commitments that we have \nmade. The United Nations reform process, which has \nbeen pending through past decades, should continue in \na more concrete manner with a view to ensuring mutual \nbenefits for all Member States. The reform should also \nseek to ensure a relevant and effective role for the \nUnited Nations as the only universal body addressing \nglobal challenges. To achieve those objectives, it is \ncritical that all Member States enhance cooperation in \na sincere and trustworthy manner and avoid taking \nadvantage of one another. \n Peace and stability are still threatened by \nweapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear \nweapons. The results of the Review Conference of the \nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons held in May this year did not by any \nmeans meet our expectations in addressing the non-\nproliferation of nuclear weapons and making our world \nfree of nuclear weapons. Consensus is far from being \nreached due to manifest suspicion and distrust. \nTherefore it is time to build trust and confidence in \norder to create an enabling international environment \nfor a nuclear-free world. \n The use and proliferation of weapons of all forms \nundoubtedly have a long-term impact on the lives of \npeople and impede national socio-economic \ndevelopment efforts. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic is still badly suffering the consequences of \nwars that ended several decades ago. \n The legacies of the Indochina war include a huge \namount of remnants and unexploded ordnance, which \nhave continued to kill and injure innocent people. That \nis a major obstacle to the possibility of an ordinary \ndaily life for the Lao people. Over 30 per cent of Lao \nsoil is heavily contaminated by unexploded ordnance, \nand that is a major constraint and challenge in the \ncountry\u2019s efforts to achieve its national socio-economic \nobjectives and to attain the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). \n The Convention on Cluster Munitions, which \nentered into force on 1 August 2010, is a result of the \nclose cooperation and shared commitment of the \ninternational community to put an end to the serious \nimpact of cluster bombs and to thus free people from \nthat danger. As the country most affected by \nunexploded ordnance, especially cluster munitions, it is \na great source of pride for the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic to have played an active part in the Oslo \nprocess, which led to the adoption of this Convention. \nWe will continue to cooperate closely with the \ninternational community to ensure that it is fully \nimplemented. \n In that context, it is a great honour for the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic to host the First Meeting \nof States Parties to the Convention on Cluster \nMunitions in Vientiane from 8 to 12 November 2010. \nThat event that will be an important milestone for the \nOslo process and provide an opportunity for the \ninternational community to reaffirm its strong \ndetermination to address the challenges caused by \ncluster munitions. The First Meeting of States Parties \nwill offer us an excellent occasion to chart a clear \nvision and adopt appropriate mechanisms to ensure the \neffective implementation of the Convention. On that \nnote, once again I would like to extend my \nGovernment\u2019s cordial invitation to all United Nations \nMember States, international organizations and \nnon-governmental organizations to participate and play \n  \n \n10-54965 32 \n \nan active part in the discussions and ensure the \nsuccessful outcome of the Meeting. \n Regional peace and security remain critical for \nensuring global peace. We share a common concern \nover the situation in the Middle East, which has caused \ngreat suffering and immense loss of lives and property \nin the region, especially for the Palestinian people. It is \nmy fervent hope that the resumption of peace talks \nbetween Israel and Palestine, with the participation of \nthe United States, will lead to a solution and the \nrealization of the vision of two States, Israel and \nPalestine, living side by side in peace and security and \nwithin internationally recognized borders, as stipulated \nin the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. \n The Republic of Cuba is a sovereign and \npolitically stable State that has enjoyed peace and \nsecurity for several decades. Nevertheless, for over \nhalf of a century, the people of Cuba have been \naffected by the economic, trade and financial embargo \nimposed on them by the United States. Indeed, such an \nembargo constitutes a clear violation of the United \nNations Charter and international law. Therefore, in \norder to respond to the legitimate interests of the two \ncountries and peoples \u2014 Cuba and the United States \u2014 \nthe embargo should now be lifted. \n The cooperation among South-East Asian \ncountries has been steadily expanding. The Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has set the \nobjective for 2015 of building our community with \nthree pillars, namely, the ASEAN Political-Security \nCommunity, the ASEAN Economic Community and \nASEAN Socio-Cultural Community. To attain that \nobjective, ASEAN has laid an important socio-\neconomic foundation, including the Free Trade Area \namong ASEAN countries as well as Free Trade Areas \nbetween ASEAN and China, ASEAN and the Republic \nof Korea, ASEAN and Japan, and ASEAN and \nAustralia-New Zealand. \n Furthermore, the ASEAN Master Plan on \nconnectivity will be adopted at the Seventeenth \nASEAN Summit, to be held in Hanoi in October 2010 \nto support the ASEAN Free Trade Area. The successful \ncooperation within ASEAN has contributed to the \neffort to narrow the development gap within ASEAN as \nwell as between ASEAN and other countries. It also \nhelps the ASEAN countries attain the MDGs. \n While the world is facing a financial and \neconomic crisis, coupled with various natural \ncalamities, the most impacted are the least developed \ncountries (LDCs), the poor and the vulnerable in the \nsociety. The international community\u2019s main objective \nin attaining the MDGs is to ensure that the lives of the \npoor and disadvantaged are improved and that the \nnumber of LDCs is reduced. That would demonstrate \nthat we can achieve the MDGs.  \n In that context, the ten-year review of the \nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action \nfor LDCs, to be held in 2011, is crucial. We will assess \nwhether the seven commitments that we endorsed \ntogether in 2001 have been fulfilled. In that \nconnection, I commend the Secretary-General for \nsetting up a group of eminent persons on least \ndeveloped countries to advise on support for LDCs. \n The year 2010 is of great significance for the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic. Our country has \ncompleted the implementation of the Sixth Five Year \nSocio-Economic Development Plan and has already \nstarted the preparation for the Seventh Plan, for 2011-\n2015. Over the past years, our socio-economic \ndevelopment has been steadily progressing. The \neconomy has grown at an average rate of seven per \ncent annually, poverty has continuously declined, and \nthe living standard of the multi-ethnic Lao people has \ngradually improved. All that success has been due to \nthe right policy and the timely measures undertaken by \nthe Government. The decisive factor in creating an \nenabling environment for socio-economic development \nin the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic is political \nstability and social order that our nation has enjoyed \nover the past three decades. \n Nevertheless, to a certain extent, the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic remains challenged by the global \nfinancial and economic crisis, and that is contributing \nto the decline of our economic growth. Against that \nbackdrop, the Government has adopted immediate \nmeasures that have helped to alleviate the impact of the \ncrisis. \n However, due to the uncertainty of the state of \ntoday\u2019s global economy, like other developing \ncountries, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic is \nstill vulnerable, and thus requires the assistance and \nsupport of the international community in addressing \nthe impact of the crisis over the long term. Such \nassistance will help the country overcome any future \nproblem resulting from the current crisis, enable us to \n \n \n33 10-54965 \n \nachieve the MDGs and, ultimately, leave the status of \nleast developed country by 2020. \n The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic reiterates \nonce again its firm commitment and willingness to \nwork closely with the international community to build \na peaceful world under a just and more democratic new \norder, based on cooperation with all countries, in \ntackling the various global challenges facing us. I am \nconvinced that only through genuine partnership will \nwe be able to ensure that the world is secure, peaceful \nand prosperous."

        "file_text": "On behalf of \nUkraine, I sincerely congratulate His Excellency \nMr. Joseph Deiss on his election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I am \nconvinced that his rich experience will contribute to \nthe achievement of significant results in our joint work. \n We have started our work in New York on a high \nnote. The Millennium Development Goals summit has \njust successfully concluded. The summit outcome \ndocument (resolution 65/1), the Millennium \nDeclaration (resolution 55/2) and the 2005 World \nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1) have become our \nroad map for sustainable development and a better \nfuture. Their rigorous and coherent implementation is a \ncommon task for all Member States. Ukraine is ready \nto work actively to this end. \n Ukraine approaches with full responsibility the \nissues of poverty eradication, providing high-quality \neducation, developing proper conditions for preserving \nthe environment, improving maternal health and \nreducing child mortality, curbing HIV/AIDS and \ntuberculosis, and ensuring gender equality. Our \nachievements as well as the problems we face are set \nout in the national report on implementation of the \nMillennium Development Goals, which we presented \nat the summit. \n Today my country is undergoing profound \ninternal changes. We have finally achieved political \nstability and have launched comprehensive economic \nand social reforms. In short, Ukraine has been given a \nnew progressive impetus, allowing us to take real \npractical steps towards transformations that are long \noverdue. I am confident that it will enable us to \nparticipate more actively in the implementation of the \nprinciples of the United Nations, to which Ukraine has \nbeen committed all along. \n The world economic crisis has become a major \nproblem that has slowed progress in Ukraine as well as \nin other countries. Global challenges require a global \nresponse. The world must develop a new financial and \neconomic system of relations. Further trade \nliberalization, prevention of protectionist measures, \nnew solutions and transparent tools for safeguarding \nglobal competition can contribute to the economic \nrecovery. \n We believe it is necessary to support further \nglobal processes that expand the free movement of \n  \n \n10-54827 40 \n \npeople, goods, services and capital. New free-trade \nareas and visa-free travel regimes are an important \ncomponent of the appropriate response to the global \nchallenges of today. \n We all know that sustainable development is \nimpossible without security and that security is \nimpossible without development. Ukraine has always \nbeen an active contributor to peace and security \nworldwide. I believe that our contribution in that \nregard is beyond doubt. \n This year Ukraine declared its non-bloc status. \nThat helped to significantly reduce tension in the \nregion and to establish a zone of stability and strategic \nbalance around Ukraine.  \n In 1994 we were the first in the world to \nvoluntarily give up our nuclear arsenal, the third most \npowerful in the world. Sixteen years have passed, but \nthat decision by Ukraine has not diminished in \nimportance. In April of this year, Ukraine took the next \nstep at the Nuclear Security Summit, held in \nWashington, D. C., by announcing its decision to get \nrid of all its stocks of highly enriched uranium.  \n The experience of recent decades shows that \nnuclear weapons do not always increase security. \nMoreover, countries that try to acquire nuclear \nweapons may be exposed to the impact of new risks \nand become more vulnerable. The best way to counter \nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons is to gradually \neliminate them completely. We welcome the signing of \na new START treaty between the United States and \nRussia and further reductions of their national nuclear \narsenals. \n Today there is also an urgent need for concrete \nsteps to reduce the risks related to the proliferation of \nnuclear materials and technology. We encourage all \nMember States to follow our example in the area of \nglobal nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. \n In view of the steps I have just mentioned, \nUkraine hopes to see our international partners \nunswervingly comply with their obligations concerning \nsecurity guarantees for my country, that is, primarily, \nthe Budapest Memorandum of 1994. Ukraine insists \nthat security guarantees for States that have disposed of \ntheir nuclear arsenals and for countries that do not \nbelong to any military alliance should be reflected in a \nlegally binding international instrument. That is the \nbest way to discourage regional nuclear ambitions. \n The principles of peaceful coexistence, respect \nfor the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member \nStates, good neighbourly relations and equality have \nalways been the cornerstone of Ukraine\u2019s foreign \npolicy. We believe that the spirit and letter of the \nUnited Nations Charter are the foundation for any \nregional agreements and arrangements in the area of \nsecurity architecture. Yet our Organization can make \ngreater use of the potential of existing regional security \nmechanisms so as to strengthen global security. \n We have never distinguished between our own \nwoes and those of others. From the very first years of \nits independence, Ukraine has actively participated in \nUnited Nations efforts to maintain international peace \nand security. We strongly support the strengthening of \nUnited Nations peacekeeping capabilities. Ukraine also \nintends to keep working to improve legal protection for \nthe Blue Helmets. We welcome support for our \ninitiatives by the Member States. \n In our opinion, we also need to develop \nmechanisms to respond to new or changing challenges \nto international peace and security. One of these is \npiracy and armed robbery at sea. I am convinced that \nthat threat can no longer be underestimated. Without \neffective and decisive intervention by the international \ncommunity, that evil will only gain force. The United \nNations should play a key role in the fight against \nmaritime piracy. Ukraine is determined to continue its \nefforts to increase international maritime security and \nthe protection of sailors\u2019 social rights, and we call upon \nall Member States to cooperate to that end. \n Today, humanity is increasingly confronted with \nso-called soft security challenges. The word \u201csoft\u201d \nshould not mislead us, though. Climate change \nconstitutes a global threat to the very future of \nmankind. The experts are saying today that some of \nthose changes are irreversible. That is why the \ninternational community should immediately make all \npossible efforts to avoid the worst-case scenario. The \npolitical will of all Member States should be \nmobilized. By signing the Copenhagen Accord, \nUkraine has taken a step in that direction. \n The Earth is our common ship, and it should not \nbecome a Titanic. We believe there should be an \neffective international mechanism to protect the \nenvironment of the Earth as our only planet. The world \nneeds a standing global environmental organization \nwith universal membership. \n \n \n41 10-54827 \n \n Against the backdrop of environmental, financial, \neconomic and energy challenges, the peaceful use of \nnuclear energy is becoming increasingly crucial. States \nthat possess nuclear technologies bear a huge \nresponsibility towards their own people, their \nneighbours and all mankind. \n Next year, the world will commemorate a sad \ndate \u2014 the twenty-fifth anniversary of the accident at \nthe Chernobyl nuclear power plant. That tragedy is still \nan open wound for us. Overcoming its consequences \nremains a serious challenge for the international \ncommunity, as the scale of the problem requires a \ncoordinated effort involving all of our international \npartners. \n Ukraine plans to host a high-level international \nconference on the theme \u201cTwenty-five years after the \nChernobyl disaster: security for the future\u201d. We intend \nto hold it in Kiev in April 2011, with United Nations \nparticipation. The forum should assess the progress \nmade in the restoration and normalization of life in the \naffected regions and discuss nuclear safety issues. I \ninvite all Members to take part in the conference. \n Today\u2019s world is changing at an ever-increasing \npace, and our Organization has to change along with it. \nThe United Nations should be not an observer but an \narchitect of events. For that to happen, it urgently \nneeds to undergo comprehensive reform. Ukraine \nwelcomes the progress we see in the organizational \nconsolidation of the United Nations, in particular in the \nareas of gender equality, protection of women\u2019s rights \nand peacebuilding.  \n However, far-reaching changes are impossible \nwithout modernization of the core of the United \nNations: the Security Council. The transformation of \nthe Security Council into an entity that is more \nrepresentative and balanced in composition, with \nimproved working methods and higher transparency, is \nan essential precondition for increasing its \neffectiveness and for adapting the United Nations to \nthe world\u2019s current practices and procedures. \n Ukraine stands ready to discuss all progressive \nconcepts relating to Security Council reform. We \nbelieve that the key to success is to take into account \nthe interests of all the underrepresented regional \ngroups, including the Eastern European States. I would \nlike to take this opportunity to confirm Ukraine\u2019s \nintention to obtain membership in the Security Council \nfor the period of 2016-2017. \n I am confident that the work of the sixty-fifth \nsession of the General Assembly session will be an \nimportant step on the road towards a peaceful, safe and \nprosperous world \u2014 a world of freedom, democracy \nand effective international cooperation. To achieve \nthose ends, we have strong political will, a clear \nunderstanding of the challenges and a common vision \nof the problems. I believe in our success. "

        "file_text": "It is my \nhonour to speak here and to participate for the first \ntime in the Assembly\u2019s general debate. The moment is \nall the more significant for us because Romania is \ncelebrating 55 years of membership in the United \nNations. My country and its people have always been \nfirm believers in the ideal of countries working \ntogether for peace, prosperity and a better life for \nhumankind.\n Nicolae Titulescu, one of the great Romanians of \nthe twentieth century, once said that hardship creates \nthe true brotherhood of nations. He said those words in \nSeptember 1931, as President of the League of Nations, \nin a time of crisis. Today we are burdened again by \nimmense challenges and have to live up to great \nresponsibilities placed upon us by present and future \ngenerations. Communities all over the planet face \nmounting threats, which are often interrelated. Climate \nchange exacerbates food and energy insecurity, health \nand population issues increase migration, while \npoverty puts pressure on regional security and stability. \n At the same time, we are heartened to see an ever \nincreasing commitment on the part of the world\u2019s \nnations to act collectively and to share vision and \nwillpower to overcome difficulties.  \n Climate change must be our next mobilizing \nissue. We must not let differences and the enormous \ncomplexity of interests define our drive. Negotiations \nin Canc\u00fan and thereafter, building upon the \nCopenhagen Accord, must pave the way for the timely \nadoption of a comprehensive and legally binding post-\nKyoto agreement. Romania, including in its capacity as \nChair of the Commission for Sustainable Development, \nwill provide its unrestrained support and attention to \ninternational efforts to alleviate our planet\u2019s \nenvironmental perils. \n While climate change will hit us ever harder, a \nglobal recession has just battered us. The crisis \nrevealed the flaws of our national and international \nfinancial and economic systems. It has become obvious \nthat the world\u2019s financial system is no longer \ncompatible with the realities of global competition, nor \n  \n \n10-54965 44 \n \ncan it handle the misuse of free market principles. \nIndeed, the system needs to be revised. \n Sometimes, with sufficient resources, \ndevelopment can be achieved quickly. But \ndevelopment without good governance is less likely to \nbe lasting. A country whose citizens do not enjoy \nequality and dignity can never be wealthy. From its \nown past Romania knows very well the negative \nimpact that the lack of genuine democracy, human \nrights and freedom has on long-term development \nprospects. That is why we must never lose track of a \nmilestone document \u2014 the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights \u2014 adopted by this very Assembly, \n62 years ago, in Paris. The principles, the values and \nthe generous ideals enshrined in that Declaration must \nremain the underlying foundation of our governance \nefforts. Romania plays an active role in promoting \nthose fundamental values in our part of Europe and \nwherever its experience can prove useful and needed. \n One must not forget that democracy starts with a \nbasic step: free and fair elections. Electoral processes \ncan be improved, including in the most advanced \ncountries. States must be ready to accept that \nimprovements are sometimes needed and be able to \nlisten to and understand the calls for change, from \nwithin our societies or from outside. \n Out-of-country voting is a sensitive and \nchallenging issue, including in my country. Romania \nworks in cooperation with the United Nations Electoral \nAssistance Division, European institutions and the \nCommunity of Democracies to develop knowledge and \ncodify best practices in the field of out-of-country \nvoting. We hope that the results of a first seminar on \nthis topic, hosted by Romania this summer, will be \nmultiplied and shared by many countries and regions. \n Conflict prevention and peacebuilding are \npriorities in today\u2019s world. Neither of them can be \nisolated from efforts to stabilize and reconstruct areas \nand societies affected by conflicts. To be successfully \nput into practice, that conceptual framework needs the \ncomplement of a consolidated United Nations \noperational instrument to which all Member States \nmust contribute to the best of their ability. For this \nreason my country has taken a keen interest in, and \noffered substantial contributions to, civilian and \nmilitary missions under the United Nations mandate \nand has started to develop dedicated capacities, of \nessentially civilian nature, in the area of stabilization \nand post-conflict reconstruction. \n Just a couple of weeks ago, Bucharest hosted an \ninternational conference to officially open the \nRomanian Training Centre for Post-Conflict \nReconstruction. The Centre will be open to \ninternational participation, and we hope to develop \nenhanced cooperation with the United Nations Office \nfor Partnerships. \n Today, Romania is honoured and proud to have \nconsistently contributed to the management, through \ninternational cooperation, of a number of conflict \nsituations and areas of instability. I pay my deepest \nrespect to the men and women of Romania who have \nlost their lives and those who are risking their lives in \nconflict areas, as well as to all the military, police, \ngendarmes and civilian personnel serving all over the \nworld to bring peace and security.  \n We must reaffirm our determination to \naccomplish the commitments made at the outset of the \nUnited Nations-mandated international mission in \nAfghanistan. While we welcome the results of the \nlatest conferences in London and Kabul and note the \nprogress in ensuring the stability, security and \ndevelopment of that sorely tried nation, we look \nforward to the moment when the Afghan authorities \nwill be ready to assume the entire spectrum of \nresponsibilities incumbent upon them. \n Romania firmly supports the continued \ninvolvement of the United Nations and the \ninternational community in the reconstruction of Iraq \nand is ready to carry on helping. The success of the \nsovereign development of Iraq depends on national \nreconciliation and the development of harmonious \nrelations with its neighbours. \n As regards the issue of Kosovo, Romania \ncontinues to uphold politically and practically the \nessential United Nations mandate there, as well as the \nroles of the European Union and NATO in ensuring the \nprogress, stability and security of the area. While \nrespecting the advisory opinion of the International \nCourt of Justice, Romania considers that the opinion \ndoes not examine the core of the issue, which is the \nlegality of the creation of an alleged new State. \nRomania maintains the view that unilateral secession is \nnot possible under international law. Accordingly, \nRomania will maintain its position of non-recognition \nof Kosovo\u2019s unilateral declaration of independence. \n \n \n45 10-54965 \n \n We continue to be concerned with the protracted \nconflicts in the extended Black Sea area and South \nCaucasus. While solutions to these conflicts continue \nto be explored in the agreed formats, they must also be \nmonitored by the larger United Nations membership, as \na way to encourage dialogue and to ensure that \ndevelopments remain within the boundaries of \ninternational law and United Nations resolutions. \n In Georgia, which is among Romania\u2019s top \npriorities, the United Nations must continue to play an \nimportant role, along with other actors such as the \nEuropean Union, which through its Monitoring \nMission contributes immensely to the stability of the \narea. \n Furthermore, we support the Middle East peace \nprocess on the basis of the principles and provisions of \nthe relevant Security Council resolutions and of the \nroad map. We express our hope that the current direct \ndiscussions will lead to the goal of two States living \nside by side in peace and security. We also hope that \nIsrael and Syria and Israel and Lebanon can identify \nthe means needed to find solutions to improve their \nrespective relations. \n Concerning the crucial role of the United Nations \nin the area of disarmament, non-proliferation and arms \ncontrol, I would like to underline the need to both \nstrengthen the relevance of international law and to \nfully implement it. \n Romania welcomes the new United States-\nRussian Federation treaty on nuclear arms reduction \nand the adoption of the Final Document of the 2010 \nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which contains \nconcrete actions to advance international cooperation \nin the field of nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation \nand peaceful use of nuclear energy. The entry into \nforce of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \nand future negotiations for a fissile material cut-off \ntreaty continue to be issues of high interest for my \ncountry. \n The efforts evoked in my address require a \nvibrant multilateralism with a strong United Nations at \nits core. That premise demands, in turn, improved \nfunctional relations between the United Nations and \nother international organizations with a global or \nregional vocation. \n The roles of the European Union, NATO, the \nAfrican Union, the International Organization of la \nFrancophonie and others in working jointly with the \nUnited Nations in the field and at Headquarters must \nbe supported and reinforced by all Member States. At \nthe same time, the wide-ranging process of realignment \nand reform of the United Nations and its bodies must \nmaintain the same pace. \n In that context, I would like to warmly welcome \nthe creation of the United Nations Entity for Gender \nEquality and the Empowerment of Women as a \nsignificant step in United Nations reform. We \ncongratulate Madame Michelle Bachelet, former \nPresident of Chile, for her appointment as head of that \nentity and wish her every success. At the same time, I \nwould like to commend Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon and the entire Organization for their \nexceptional dedication and commitment to the \nadvancement of women. \n The sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly \ngives us another year in which we must accelerate the \nAssembly\u2019s renewal and work out historic decisions on \nSecurity Council reform. Romania shares the view that \nthe overarching goal of Security Council reform must \nbe to create a more effective, transparent and \nrepresentative body, and my country will join any \npragmatic move in this direction. We strongly believe \nthat the Eastern European Group deserves better \nrepresentation on the Security Council in any \nenlargement format. \n Let me conclude by saying that our role and \nposition in the world\u2019s affairs are not defined by our \ngreatest achievements, but by how we use those \nachievements to strengthen the most vulnerable among \nus. That has been and still is the noblest mission and \nvocation of the United Nations, and of us all."

Since this is his last term as \nPresident on constitutional grounds, President de \nMenezes would have much liked to participate in this \nsixty-fifth session in order to personally express his \nsincere and heartfelt thanks for the support and \ncooperation of our Organization provided to him \nduring the period of his presidency. \n On behalf of the delegation of the Democratic \nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe, which I have the \nhonour to lead, I would like to congratulate the \nPresident of the General Assembly on his election to \nchair this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. \nHis election is proof that the Member countries of this \nOrganization recognize the contribution that he and his \ncountry, Switzerland, have made to the cause of peace \nand to upholding the noble ideals of freedom, \ndemocracy and human rights in the world. We are \ntherefore convinced that he will guide our work with \ndexterity, clarity and success. We also congratulate him \nfor the relevance of the theme \u201cReaffirming the central \nrole of the United Nations in global governance\u201d, \nwhich merits the attention of all present here on \naccount of its timeliness. \n We salute the very distinguished Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for \nthe efforts, dedication and skill with which he has \nguided our Organization, despite the enormous \npolitical, economic and social challenges that the world \nis facing, in particular with regard to the issues of \npeace, international security, underdevelopment, \nextreme poverty, climate change, food security and the \ncontinuation of some regional conflicts. It is our deep \nconviction that, in order to collectively face such \nchallenges, we must reaffirm and strengthen our \nconfidence in the role of the United Nations in \npromoting peace and justice in the world. \n The defence of multilateralism is of vital \nimportance in seeking solutions based on the principles \nof the United Nations Charter. The role of the United \nNations in preventing and resolving conflicts, \npromoting peace and supporting development should \nbe bolstered. In that regard, it is vital to strengthen the \nrole of the United Nations, including reforming the \nsystem and the Security Council, in order to provide \nresponses that are more consistent with the challenges \nfacing humanity today. \n We echo the concerns expressed in this Assembly \nHall by the President of Malawi and Chairperson of the \nAfrican Union in that regard. The consensus to date on \nthe question of Western Sahara leads us to urge the \nparties involved to continue on the path of dialogue in \npursuit of a peaceful settlement of that conflict. \n Our global security is vital to the sustainable \ndevelopment of our countries. The international \ncommunity must be cautious and aware of the risks \nthat the Palestinian conflict could spread and endanger \nthe entire Middle East region and ultimately \ninternational peace and security in the larger world. \n Sao Tome and Principe welcomes the resumption \nof the dialogue on the Palestine question and \nencourages the Government of the State of Israel and \nthe Palestinian Authority to continue on that course in \nthe hope that the peoples of Israel and Palestine will \nlive side by side in peace in the future. My country \nwould also like to acknowledge and welcome the \npersonal commitment of President Barack Obama to \nfinding a permanent solution to that conflict. \n The world faces other risks, such as transnational \ncrime, piracy and drug trafficking. For us, a small \ncountry surrounded by a vast expanse of sea, that is a \nsignificant reason for concern. Sao Tome and Principe \nwill therefore continue to pay particular attention to the \nregional integration organizations to which we belong, \nas well as to give priority to conflict-prevention, -\nmanagement and -resolution mechanisms in order to \nensure security and peace in Central Africa. \n The profound changes taking place in \ninternational politics, which are the result of structural \nchanges in the global economy and have important \ngeopolitical implications, have been affecting Sao \nTome and Principe in various ways. As a small island \n  \n \n10-55128 44 \n \nState, Sao Tome and Principe therefore calls for greater \naccess to various economic opportunities, in particular \nofficial development assistance and international \ninvestment. Moreover, we support the conclusion of a \nnew international trade agreement on a more equitable \nand fairer basis, as well as the conclusion of the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \n We welcome the appointment of Ms. Michelle \nBachelet, former President of Chile, to oversee matters \nrelating to women and gender with a view to promoting \ntheir participation in global challenges. \n At the Millennium Summit in 2000, world leaders \ncommitted themselves to creating an environment \nconducive to development and the eradication of \npoverty, both nationally and internationally. The \nadoption of the Millennium Declaration was followed \nby other international conferences, which, although \nthey reaffirmed the commitment of both the donor \ncommunity and the countries receiving aid to seek \ninnovative funding sources and alternatives, did not \nhave the desired effect of alleviating world poverty \nlevels. However, it is vital that we create a new spirit \nof partnership and a better concept of cooperation for \ndevelopment. To that end, there is a need for additional \nefforts in the area of official development assistance. \n The High-level Meeting that has just taken place \nhere in New York is proof of our concern about the \nbenchmarks to be achieved for the attainment of the \nMillennium Development Goals. For our part, the \nresults in the area of education and health are fairly \nencouraging, particularly when it comes to reducing \nchild mortality and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and \nother diseases. \n With regard to education for all, our net enrolment \nrate in the first cycle of primary education \u2014 for children \naged one to four \u2014 is estimated at 98 per cent. \nLiteracy rates in the 15 to 24 age group are high as \ncompared to most African countries, namely, 96 per \ncent for females and 95 per cent for males. \n The results in reducing child mortality have been \nequally encouraging. In 2009, we recorded 38 deaths \nper 1,000 live births. That is a significant reduction \ncompared with past years. For example, there were 61 \nper 1,000 live births in 2002. The mortality rate for \nchildren under five fell from 138 to 101 deaths per \n1,000 live births in 2002, further dropping to 63 in \n2009. The number of children immunized against \nmeasles has increased substantially, with 84 per cent \nvaccinated in 2009 as compared to 70 per cent in 2000. \n With regard to the prevalence of HIV/AIDS, it is \nstill contained but can spread rapidly. The prevalence \nrate in the 15 to 24 year age range is 0.7 per cent, but \namong the total population aged 15 to 49 it is 1.5 per \ncent. The prevalence rate of malaria has been reduced \ndramatically, from 478 cases per 1,000 inhabitants in \n2002 to about 34 cases in 2009. \n It is true that our country has made significant \nprogress in the areas I have mentioned, but we are \naware that much more remains to be done in order to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. \n Sao Tome and Principe believes that it is our \ncollective responsibility to take measures to address \nthe adverse effects of climate change, although we \nwelcome the political willingness of Member States to \ncontinue the process of building the necessary \nconsensus on the various themes discussed at the \nCopenhagen Summit. We recognize the efforts made at \nthe recent meeting held in Bonn, as well as the \nprospects for the opening meeting to be held in \nMexico.  \n Sao Tome and Principe expresses its concern at \nattempts to use nuclear energy for non-peaceful \npurposes. We hope that those who utilize nuclear \nenergy do so in accordance with existing mechanisms \nfor international regulation and supervision. \n Climate change has caused imbalances in the \nmicroclimate of our country, with dramatic impact on \nour domestic production. That poses a threat to the \nfood security of Sao Tome and Principe. The \nauthorities of my country would therefore like to \ncontinue to count on the invaluable support and \nwillingness so far expressed by the international \ncommunity, in general, and in particular by specialized \nbodies of the United Nations. \n I would be remiss if I concluded my statement \nwithout addressing the situation along the Taiwan \nStrait. We recognize the efforts made by both sides \nalong the Strait aimed at reducing political tension and \ncreating a favourable climate that is conducive to \npeace, security and development in the region. Despite \nthose positive developments \u2014 including the signing \nof an economic treaty regulating trade relations \nbetween the two sides, opening up airspace to \ncommercial traffic and promoting stronger links \n \n \n45 10-55128 \n \nbetween the two peoples \u2014 there are still some aspects \nthat must be addressed in order to allow greater \ninvolvement by Taiwan in the international community. \n We call on Members of the United Nations, and \nin particular its specialized agencies, to find ways to \nmake possible Taiwan\u2019s greater participation in \nspecialized agencies and other bodies and machinery, \nsuch as the International Civil Aviation Organization \nand the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change. We believe that Taiwan\u2019s participation \nin those two forums will strengthen both those \nmechanisms and better serve our common interests. \n In consolidating its democratic process, the \nDemocratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe has \njust conducted yet another elections process, from \nwhich a new Government and Assembly have emerged. \nThe new Government, whose programme has just been \napproved by the National Assembly, has identified four \nkey areas for attention, namely, good governance, \ncredibility and combating corruption; economic \ngrowth; national cohesion and organization; and State \nauthority. To achieve those objectives, the Government \nof Sao Tome and Principe would very much like to \ncount on the continued support of the international \ncommunity. \n We believe that the international community, and \nin particular the United Nations system, knows how to \nrespond to the new challenges of a changing world by \nseeking out mechanisms, instruments and policies \naimed at promoting international cooperation, \ninnovative partnerships and international solidarity. In \nthat collective effort, I want to reaffirm that Sao Tome \nand Principe is ready and willing to make its \ncontribution to the realization of the noble principles \nand objectives that were at the heart of the creation of \nthe United Nations.

        "file_text": "I am delighted to address \nthe sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly as \nChairman of the African Union.  \n I offer my personal congratulations and those of \nthe African Union to you, Sir, on your election as \nPresident of the United Nations General Assembly at \nits sixty-fifth session. I assure you, Sir, of Africa\u2019s \nsupport in your work. \n I pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki, President of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-fourth session for his leadership during his \ntenure of office. \n I also commend our Secretary-General, His \nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his exemplary \nleadership of our Organization and the excellent \nmanner in which he continues to discharge his \nresponsibilities. Africa is particularly grateful for his \ncontinued support of Africa\u2019s development agenda. \n I am happy to say that Africa welcomes the theme \nfor the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly that \nreaffirms the role of the United Nations in global \ngovernance. African leaders believe that the United \nNations, with its universal membership, is well placed \nto build political consensus for global governance. \nThey hold the view that the United Nations has the \npotential to bring about solutions to common \ngovernance problems that our global village continues \nto encounter, such as managing diversity and \ncombating terrorism and conflict. I believe that now, \nmore than ever before, the United Nations needs to \nstrengthen its institutions to enable it to promote peace \nand stability and facilitate balanced growth and \nprosperity between developed and developing \ncountries. \n Africa also wishes to remind the United Nations \nnot to lose sight of its commitment to fight poverty. \nPoverty reduction must remain the central focus of the \nUnited Nations. \n  \n \n10-54827 16 \n \n As we reflect on this year\u2019s theme, the central \nrole of the United Nations in global governance, I am \nfully aware that the Africa the world hears about is that \nof incessant calamities and natural disasters. \nInternational media report on the Africa of extreme \npoverty, widespread endemic diseases and human \nsuffering. They constantly portray the Africa of civil \nwars, genocide, terrorism and piracy. They glorify the \nAfrica of underdevelopment and hopelessness. \n But in their reports we do not hear about the \nsuccess stories of a number of African Governments. \nWe do not hear about the successes in participatory \ndemocracy and good governance. We do not hear about \nthe peaceful multiparty general elections. We do not \nhear about the high rates of macroeconomic growth in \nsome African countries. We do not hear about the \nsuccesses in food security in some of them. \n That is why I now want to present another Africa \nto the General Assembly. It is the Africa of new hopes \nand new possibilities, the Africa of industrial, mineral, \nand agro-processing opportunities, the Africa with new \njob creation prospects, and the Africa that can produce \nenough food for all. \n Yes, this is the Africa I want the Assembly to \nknow. This is the Africa of the new beginning. \n I want the world to know that we African leaders \nhave a clear vision of a new Africa free of hunger, \ndisease and poverty. We have the vision of a new \nAfrica that is prosperous and full of hope. We have the \nvision of African nations determined to contribute \nmore to global economic prosperity, peace and \nstability. \n I want to inform the world that the leaders of the \nAfrican Union have decided to unlock Africa\u2019s \ncombined huge natural resources and human capital to \nestablish new industries to create new wealth for our \npeople. That is why this year I have chosen to address \nthe Assembly on the subject of \u201cAfrica of the new \nbeginning\u201d. I want the United Nations to share our \nbelief that Africa is not a poor continent; rather, it is its \npeople that are poor. \n This year, I have come to inform this world body \nthat Africa has decided to shift from Afro-pessimism to \nAfro-optimism. We are going to make Africa better. \n Now, turning to global issues, I want to say that \nthe world today faces the challenge of producing \nenough food to feed the over nine billion people living \non this earth, and it must do this against the backdrop \nof rising food prices, global warming, climate change \nand environmental degradation. I am pleased to inform \nthis world body that African leaders fully recognize \nthese problems and have unanimously agreed to \ninstitute new measures to ensure that five years from \nnow, Africa will be able to produce enough food to \nfeed its people. They have also decided that, five years \nfrom now, no child in Africa will die of hunger or \nmalnutrition. \n In order to meet these targets, the African Union \ndecided to turn the continent into an African food \nbasket whose main aim is to encourage allocation of \nincreased budgetary resources and private sector \ninvestment to agriculture and food production. For that \nto happen, African leaders have agreed to redesign \ntheir policy efforts to focus on three priority areas, \nnamely, agriculture and food security, transport and \nenergy development, and climate change. It is \nenvisaged that effective transport structures and \nadequate energy supply will enhance agricultural \nproduction and food processing as well as improve \nhuman mobility and the marketing of food and \nagricultural products from surplus countries to deficit \ncountries across the African continent. \n The African food basket concept envisages full \ncooperation between Africa and Governments of the \nGroup of Eight. The United Nations, the Food and \nAgriculture Organization, the World Bank, the \nEuropean Union and other multilateral institutions will \nalso cooperate in this effort. \n I now want to briefly raise some issues of major \nconcern to Africa: the adverse effects of climate \nchange, fragile peace and security, terrorism and \npiracy, maternal, infant and child mortality, and slow \nreform of the United Nations.  \n African leaders recognize that climate change and \nenvironmental degradation are among the most serious \nglobal challenges that affect Africa negatively. All \ncountries in the world share the adverse effects of \nclimate change. All countries in the world are, to \nvarying degrees, experiencing the adverse impacts of \nclimate change such as severe cyclones, hurricanes, \nrising sea levels and water salinization, prolonged \nsevere droughts and overall global warming. \n There is enough evidence to show that most \ncountries in Africa, Asia and Latin America are the \nleast able and equipped to cope with those challenges. \n \n \n17 10-54827 \n \nThe global nature of climate change therefore calls for \nan effective, immediate and appropriate international \nresponse. We need to act, and act now. \n The international community has acknowledged \nthat climate change is a real threat to humanity, and yet \nthe performance of the major players at the United \nNations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen \ndisappointed Africa and developing nations elsewhere \nby their intransigency. The leaders of Africa therefore \nwould like to see the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol \nbe urgently implemented as essential interventions to \naddress climate change. Those conventions spell out in \ndetail what is to be done to mitigate climate change. \nOn behalf of Africa, I call for immediate \nimplementation of those decisions in order to avert \nimpending human catastrophe. \n I am glad to note that maternal, infant and child \nhealth and welfare are among the underlying issues of \nthe theme of the General Assembly this year. That calls \nfor concerted action for the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals.  \n I am pleased to say that the African Union has \nreaffirmed its commitments to the reduction of \nmaternal, infant and child mortality in Africa. African \nGovernments have undertaken to launch the four-year \nCampaign for Accelerated Reduction of Maternal \nMortality in Africa. We also agreed to call on the \nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria \nto create a new window to fund maternal, newborn and \nchild health. Let me, therefore, take advantage of the \nGeneral Assembly to appeal on behalf of Africa to our \ndevelopment partners and donors to replenish the \nGlobal Fund during next month\u2019s meeting and to \nincrease resources for maternal, newborn and child \nhealth. \n Another global governance issue of major \nconcern to Africa is the lack of movement on \ninternational trade under the Doha Round multilateral \ntrade negotiations. Members of the United Nations \nagree that trade is a conduit to development in every \ncountry. Therefore we in Africa appeal for an urgent \nconclusion of the Doha Round, for we believe that that \nis essential to revive global trade and to aid in global \neconomic recovery. Any outcome of the Doha Round \nnegotiations must lead to clear benefits for farmers, \nproducers, exporters and consumers in developing \ncountries, including in Africa. Nations of the world \nmust redouble efforts to resolve all impediments to the \nsuccessful outcome of the trade negotiations. \n The advancement of women and gender equality \ncontinues to be the cornerstone of the Africa of the new \nbeginning. Women have played and continue to play a \ndecisive role in the global, continental and national \nagendas for democracy, transition and development. I \nam happy to inform the General Assembly that African \nGovernments have intensified the fight against gender-\nbased violence, sexual abuse, discrimination and \ntrafficking in women and girls. The ultimate objective \nis to have more coherent and meaningful interventions \nthat will adequately increase the number of women in \nhigh decision-making positions in the advancement of \ngrowth and development. \n On peace and security, I wish to underscore that \nthe African Union considers that democracy, good \ngovernance and development cannot be sustainable \nwithout peace and security. African countries have \nmade significant progress in ensuring that peace and \nsecurity prevail on the African continent. Several \ncountries have conducted peaceful elections, and there \nis growing tolerance and accommodation between the \nruling and opposition parties in many countries. That is \nencouraging. \n However, Africa has of late witnessed the re-\nemergence of coups d\u2019\u00e9tat and other unconstitutional \nchanges of government. The African Union has taken a \nstrong collective decision that those negative trends \nwill not be allowed to continue. \n The African Union is also gravely concerned that \nSomalia has had no stable or functioning Government \nfor a long time. That continuing volatile situation is \nbeing compounded by increasing organized piracy in \nthe Indian Ocean. That negatively affects not only \nSomalia and her immediate neighbours, but the entire \nAfrican continent and the rest of the world. I believe \nthe situation calls for a new approach and new \nintervention. More countries should be directly \ninvolved in seeking a lasting solution to the Somalia \ncrisis. \n The situation in the Sudan presents a special \nchallenge to the African Union and to the United \nNations. Although some progress has been achieved \ntowards the implementation of the Comprehensive \nPeace Agreement, the African Union eagerly awaits the \nholding of the referendum in January 2011 and the \npost-referendum structure of relations in the Sudan. \n  \n \n10-54827 18 \n \n One of the most immediate options in the Sudan \nis to consolidate the prevailing peace and stability \nthere. The African countries are concerned that while \nefforts to secure lasting peace in the Sudan are \nongoing, the International Criminal Court seems to \npush for a pound of flesh by insisting on arresting \nPresident Omer Hassan Al-Bashir. There is general \nconsensus in Africa that that would have a negative \neffect, polarizing the different positions of the \nstakeholders and thereby driving them away from a \npeaceful settlement. The African Union therefore \nstrongly appeals to the General Assembly to amend \nArticle 16 of the Rome Statute to enable it to assume \nthe powers of the Security Council to defer the case \nagainst President Al-Bashir for one year to allow \nongoing negotiations and dialogue to succeed. \n On behalf of the African Union, I wish to express \nappreciation for the contribution of the United Nations \nto the promotion of peace, security and stability in \nAfrican countries. The United Nations has performed \nvery well in many parts of Africa, including the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan, Chad \nand West African countries. Those efforts in the search \nfor solutions to the ongoing conflicts on the continent \nare highly commendable. \n The sanctions against some members of the \nAfrican Union and the Non-Aligned Movement have \ncaused great economic hardship, especially to the poor \nand more vulnerable people in those countries. The \nAfrican Union feels that the ideological justifications, \nif there ever were any, have outlived their time. \nSanctions are also inconsistent with the emerging \ndialogue for the reform of the United Nations. \nSanctions are also inconsistent with the obligations of \nUnited Nations Member States to promote social \nprogress and better standards of life, as promulgated in \nthe Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations. \n The African Union therefore appeals for the \nimmediate lifting of sanctions against the Republic of \nZimbabwe and the Republic of Cuba. We believe that \nwould enable ordinary poor Zimbabweans and Cubans \nto begin a life of new hope and new prospects.  \n As to the development of nuclear energy for \npeaceful purposes, the African Union supports the \nposition taken by the Non-Aligned Movement calling \nfor justice and equal treatment for all nations \nconcerned.\n\n With regard to the reforms of the United Nations \nand the Security Council, the African Union believes \nthat for the Organization to be effective in fulfilling its \nmandate as an honest broker, the proposed reforms \nmust be implemented in the spirit of equity and \nfairness. In this regard I would like to reiterate the \nAfrican Union\u2019s request for two permanent seats with \nfull veto powers and five non-permanent seats. The \nAfrican Union should also have the right to determine \nthe selection of Africa\u2019s representatives on the Council. \nOnce implemented, that would enable Africa to \neffectively participate in the global governance that the \nUnited Nations is now propagating. \n In conclusion, I wish to reaffirm Africa\u2019s strong \nbelief that a reformed United Nations and specialized \nagencies are likely to play a more effective role in \nglobal governance and in a more equitable global \ntrading and financial system. I believe that the United \nNations in its new governance role should support the \nAfrica of the new beginning. A strong Africa \u2014 \nindustrially, economically and politically \u2014 is a better \ntrading partner for the G8 countries and the rest of the \nworld than a weaker one. I also believe that the Africa \nof the new beginning with its combined vast mineral, \nagricultural and human resources will provide the \nsafety valve for a boiling international monetary and \nfinancial system. Think about these things."

        "file_text": "In my address on the \naccomplishments and shortfalls of Saint Lucia towards \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals, I \nstressed that all of our gains would be useless if we \ncould not address the threatening saga of adverse \nclimate change. Many other nations highlighted that \nurgent issue, and I hope that our collective voices will \nreceive the attention of those most capable of acting. \n I will therefore focus on two of the most critical \nfactors in our development as small island developing \nStates (SIDS): first, the effects of global climate \nchange, and second, the uncertain economic and \nfinancial crisis. \n Saint Lucia notes the ongoing negotiations in \nadvance of the sixteenth Conference of the Parties to \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, to be held in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, later this year. \nFollowing the fifteenth Conference of the Parties, \nwhich failed to achieve consensus on a legally binding \nframework for addressing climate change, Saint Lucia \nrecognizes the critical importance of the current talks \nin laying a solid foundation for a more favourable \noutcome in Canc\u00fan, one that will truly fulfil the \npurpose of the Convention and help to ensure the \ncontinued existence of humankind. \n We have long since moved past the debate over \nthe existence of climate change to a discussion about \nthe severity of its impacts on the nations and regions of \nthe world. The small island developing States of the \nworld, Saint Lucia included, are recognized as being \namong the most vulnerable to climate change, with that \nphenomenon threatening the very existence of some of \nour island nations. That is so despite the fact that, \njointly, the SIDS contribute a fraction of one per cent \nof global greenhouse gas emissions. \n We began this year with news that a cataclysmic \nearthquake had hit Haiti. The United Nations came \ntogether in solidarity with our sister island and pledged \n$1.5 billion in assistance. To date, Haiti\u2019s officials \nreport that only 10 per cent of the pledges have been \nfunded. The same seems to be true for most appeals for \nhumanitarian causes. We trust that the pledging \nconference for Pakistan, the most recent country to be \nhit by a catastrophe, will be more successful.  \n Addressing the humanitarian consequences of \ntoday\u2019s disasters and emergencies remains a United \nNations priority. We thank those who have kept their \npledges, while we encourage those who have shown \ngood intentions but have not yet matched words with \naction to do so with some urgency. \n For those reasons, for the good of all humankind \nand indeed, for the good of all creation, Saint Lucia, \nlike all member States of the Caribbean Community \n(CARICOM) is committed to lending its efforts to \nachieving an ambitious, just and legally binding \nagreement that will realize our goal of timely and \nsuccessfully addressing climate change. \n Speaking of justice, climate change can be \nsuccessfully addressed only if countries most \nresponsible take the necessary steps to reduce carbon \ndioxide emissions and provide adequate financial \nresources for the development and transfer of \ntechnology for both adaptation and mitigation to those \nwho have been most seriously affected. \n Few developing countries possess sufficient \nfinancial and human resources to address adequately \nthe ongoing and anticipated impacts of global climate \nchange. According to World Bank estimates, the total \nannual impact of potential climate change on all \nCARICOM countries could be, in 2007 dollar prices, \n$9.9 billion of our total gross national product (GDP), \nor about 11.3 per cent of total GDP. That means that we \nhave no choice but to divert critical funding from our \npoverty alleviation programmes to trying to protect our \ncountries from that formidable threat.  \n There is no doubt that stable long-term funding is \nof critical importance to developing countries and \ncannot be underestimated. We urgently need to scale up \nnew and additional resources and sources of funding to \nsupport mitigation efforts. We cannot rely on \nhumanitarian assistance alone, which only addresses \nthe consequences of such events. \n \n \n47 10-54965 \n \n We know that our development partners are \nserious about implementing meaningful mitigation \naction, so we call for a firm collective commitment to \nproviding new and additional resources. Let us not \ncontinue to renege on promises made, as developing \nStates cannot go it alone and should not be penalized \nfor the actions of industrialized countries. We call for \nan understanding partnership in tackling the pressing \nissues that threaten to engulf our world. \n Despite our geographic distribution, small island \ndeveloping States (SIDs) are working diligently \ntogether on shared concerns through regional and \ninternational networks, the most notable of which is the \nAlliance of Small Island States. We recognize that \ntraditional hydrocarbon fuel usage is unsustainable and \nare therefore looking to make use of the alternate \nenergy sources that are available to us. The use of \nhydropower, wind, solar and geothermal sources and \nconverting waste into energy are means by which we \ncould reduce our energy reliance, lower trade deficits \nand generate employment. However, those require \ninvestment in research, development and infrastructure. \n The other most critical factor in our development \nis the speed of the global economy\u2019s return to sustained \ngrowth. Recent news of deteriorating economic \nconditions and a fall in house sales in the United States \nhas fanned the flame of fears of a double-dip recession. \nOver the past few weeks, the short-term growth \nprospects of the United States, Europe and Japan have \nbeen downgraded on the back of recently released \neconomic data, which is below expectations. \n The prospects for economic recovery in Europe \nwere dampened by the crisis in some countries earlier \nthis year, but renewed confidence has recently \nemerged, spurred by the stronger-than-expected \nperformance of the German economy in the second \nquarter of 2010. However, the growth prospects for \nEurope remain uncertain, given that fiscal \nretrenchment measures could pose a risk to growth and \nthe pace of recovery. The weakened growth prospects \nfor the United States and Europe could impede growth \nin emerging markets, with a slowdown in the growth of \nexports and investment flows. The uneven pace of the \nglobal economic recovery in countries and regions has \nled to differences in approach in policy responses. \n I have made these points because the economies \nof the United States, Europe and the European Union \nare our major sources of tourism, agricultural trade, \nofficial development assistance, foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI) and remittances, which constitute the \nmainstays of our economy. We therefore urge the focus \non global economic recovery to be maintained for the \nbenefit of the global community. \n As a small island developing State with a highly \nopen economy, Saint Lucia has been hard hit by the \neffects of the global financial and economic crisis. As \nwith most small developing countries, the crisis led to \na deterioration in Saint Lucia\u2019s economy, resulting in a \ncontraction in GDP, a rise in the level of \nunemployment and a weakening of the Government\u2019s \nfiscal position. \n The decline in economic activity was driven \nmainly by a fall in stay-over tourist arrivals, lower \nproduction in the agricultural sector and a sharp \ndownturn in construction. The decline in activity in the \nconstruction sector was attributable to a fall in FDI \ninflows as the freeze in international credit adversely \naffected the financing of a number of hotel \nconstruction projects in Saint Lucia. It was also \nattributable to a decline in remittances, which have \nhelped sustain the local housing sector. \n Notwithstanding the decline in revenue \ncollection, expenditure outlays increased, resulting in a \ndeteriorating fiscal position. That outcome led to a \nwidening of the central Government\u2019s overall fiscal \ndeficit to 4.8 per cent of GDP in the financial year \n2009-2010, compared to a deficit of 1.9 per cent of \nGDP in the previous year. Public debt as a percentage \nof GDP rose from 66 per cent in 2008 to 71 per cent in \n2009 as a result of increases in borrowing to finance \nthe budget deficit. \n The adverse impacts of the combination of global \nand regional shocks have prompted the Government of \nSaint Lucia to implement a number of measures \ndesigned to mitigate the social, fiscal and regulatory \nchallenges of the crisis. In order to mitigate the \nimpacts of the price shocks, the Government \nimplemented a number of measures to protect the most \nvulnerable in our population.  \n Such measures included the creation of short-\nterm employment programmes, the suspension of \nimport duties and other taxes on basic consumer items, \nthe establishment of controls on retail markups and \nprofit margins on some basic food items, and the \nprovision of limited price subsidies on basic \ncommodities to vulnerable groups. \n  \n \n10-54965 48 \n \n In its strategic response to the crisis and in laying \nthe foundation for growth, the Government of Saint \nLucia has undertaken the development of a medium-\nterm development strategy plan for the period 2011-\n2016. The plan will lay the blueprint for the \ndevelopment of emerging new sources of growth, such \nas offshore education, health and wellness tourism, and \nhigh\u2013end information and communications technology, \nand for expanding existing critical sectors, such as \ntourism, agriculture and manufacturing. \n The signing of the economic partnership \nagreement with the European Union in 2008, the \nimplementation of the CARICOM Single Market and \nEconomy and the Economic Union of the Organization \nof Eastern Caribbean States will bring new sets of \nchallenges and opportunities for Saint Lucia. The \nGovernment\u2019s strategic priority is to develop \nmeaningful partnerships with the private sector to meet \nthe challenges and take advantage of the opportunities \nprovided. The capacity of the private sector will be \nstrengthened to take advantage of the opportunities \npresented by such trading arrangements.  \n However, the Government recognizes that this \nwill require a host of general improvements in the \nbusiness environment, including strengthening the \ninvestment climate, expanding the skills base, \npromoting innovation and technology adoption, and \nimproving international transport services and other \ninfrastructure. All those will require large capital \noutlays. \n While the Government has responded to the \nchallenges by developing specific programmes and \nprojects to improve the business climate in Saint Lucia, \nthe role of international financial institutions and \nbodies like the Group of 20 in stabilizing the global \neconomy and restoring growth is crucial to small \ndeveloping countries like Saint Lucia. As the focus of \nthe global recovery efforts is aimed at laying the \nfoundation for sustainable and balanced growth, Saint \nLucia, through its new policy directives and \nprogrammes, is positioning itself to benefit from the \ngrowth prospects for the global economy. \n In that respect, we call for a review of the United \nNations delivery to SIDS, and particularly for \nstrengthened support measures to address the \nvulnerabilities of all SIDS and for support within the \nUnited Nations system for a special category. Most \nSIDS do not get our fair share of assistance because we \nfall into the middle-income country category. However, \nbeing middle-income does not reduce vulnerability. \nThere is a greater need for advocacy and a resource-\nmobilization role for SIDS under the Mauritius \nStrategy for the further implementation of the \nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable \nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. \n The support of the international community is \ntherefore necessary if Saint Lucia and all other SIDS \nare to fulfil the goal of sustainable development and \nthereby improve the standards of living of their \npopulations and meet all of the MDGs by the year \n2015. \n Let me now touch briefly on our moral \nenvironment. Among all the disasters we face today, \nwe can accept some as natural occurrences, yet others \nare of our own making. Conflicts brought about by \ndifferences in ideology, political persuasion, religion \nand economic circumstance have presented challenges \nto global peace and security, including the many mass \natrocities that the world has witnessed. Even with \nnumerous advances in technology, education and health \nand an increase in material progress, the world seems \nto suffer from mental restlessness and discontent. We \nseem not to have found the formula for peacekeeping \nand peacemaking within nations, even after 60 years of \nsearching. \n Keeping the peace and building peace are critical \ncomponents of sustainable development worldwide. \nBut peacekeeping goes far beyond civilian conflict. We \nare pleased to note that there is now acceptance of the \nrelationship between such non-traditional security \nissues as poverty and health, on the one hand, and \nconflict on the other. Maybe with that new \nunderstanding we will help find a solution. \n We understand that the United Nations is \nincapable of solving all the world\u2019s discordant issues \nand that the best solutions for conflict are home-grown. \nHowever, there are identified areas where the United \nNations can realistically make a difference. Where this \nis the case, we need to strengthen the role of the United \nNations in the promotion of peace and economic \ndevelopment. In this regard, and while keeping our \ngoals realistic, we look forward to Security Council \nreform. We need an equitable international system and \na more balanced approach to international security. \n We acknowledge that States remain the principal \nduty-bearers and cannot abrogate their responsibility to \n \n \n49 10-54965 \n \nimplement policies, enact national legislation and \nfoster an enabling environment in which human rights \ncan be enjoyed by all. When these rights go \nunexercised, economic growth is stunted and \ndevelopment is paralysed. A key role of the United \nNations is to help ensure that economic growth \ntranslates into wider enjoyment of human rights for all. \nWithout human rights, we cannot achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals; we cannot achieve the \nadvancement of humankind. When we expect the \nUnited Nations to protect human rights, we hold the \nsame expectations of ourselves. After all, we are the \nUnited Nations. \n Also integrated within the issue of human rights \nis human security. As Members of the United Nations, \nwe are concerned with human life, education, longevity \nand social inclusion. There would be no United Nations \nif there were no universal concern for the well-being of \nthe collective. Respect for human rights and the \nprotection of human security are therefore mutually \nreinforcing. \n Most people want peace, democracy and social \nequity, and we recognize the State\u2019s inherent \nresponsibility to provide these for its citizens. If \nGovernments are to be successful, people must \nparticipate in formulating and implementing strategies \nto enhance their national authorities\u2019 capacity to \nachieve these goals. However, with globalization, the \never-evolving threats that arise when one country falls \nto maintain the social order ricochet to affect the rest \nof the world. Every State requires international \ncooperation to preserve its own security. \n We Caribbean countries take the issue of security \nvery seriously. We suffer from an increasing incidence \nof crime and violence, which is compounded by \nrelatively easy access to and use of illegal firearms. \nThe number of gun-related homicides has jumped to \nunacceptable levels, and this has been aggravated by a \nworsened economic situation. \n Another great tragedy of our times is the \nuncontrolled illicit drug trade. We must find solutions \nto both problems. We are perplexed, therefore, to see \nthe closure of the Caribbean office of the United \nNations Office on Drugs and Crime. We call for a \nreassessment of that decision. We also call for a \ncomprehensive treaty on small arms and light weapons, \nalongside the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons. Small arms and light weapons are \nresponsible for more deaths than natural causes in \nsome parts of the world. \n In attempting to fulfil our commitments on the \nMDGs, we have engaged many partners, including the \nUnited States, the European Union, Canada, our Latin \nAmerican neighbours, India, Japan and South Korea, to \nname but a few. I wish, though, to make a special \nappeal to this body to support the aspirations of the \nRepublic of China on Taiwan to make its contribution \nto the world collaboration through membership and \neffective participation in the air transport and health \nbodies and climate change discussions, including the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization, the World \nHealth Organization, the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change and other organizations \nof a universal nature.  \n The contribution of Taiwan to countries that have \nsought its assistance in these areas matches that of any \nother, and it has helped without asking for much in \nreturn. No country should be prevented from making \nits contribution to humankind, for they do share the \nworld with us and their contribution to health and \nenvironmental issues know no boundaries.  \n Increased concern for air safety also remains a \nglobal priority. We therefore hope that ongoing cross-\nStrait talks will lead to a peaceful solution. This is a \nlong-standing problem that deserves an urgent \nresolution that is acceptable to all and in keeping with \nthe Charter and principles of the United Nations, as \nwell as the aspirations of peoples to self-development \nand progress. \n There are some anachronisms that still persist in \nthis world, and one is the embargo against Cuba. We \nhave moved into a world where political uncertainty \nhas been replaced by economic uncertainty. Yet a \nmechanism that was put in place to deal with a political \nissue remains today and is being used for economic \nstrangulation, even as we appeal to everyone else for \ncooperation and understanding in other areas. We must \nrespect the freely expressed wishes of the people of our \nregion as well as their right to shape and chart their \ndestiny. Our region is diverse, but our aspirations are \nshared. Only mutual respect will foster the relationship \nthat is so necessary and vital to the development of our \nregion. \n Here again, permit me to make another point \nregarding respect. When the World Trade Organization \n(WTO) ruled against our preferential regime on \n  \n \n10-54965 50 \n \nbananas, we were told that we had to comply. Now that \nthe WTO has ruled in favour of our efforts in the \nservices sector \u2014 I am speaking here of the favourable \nruling we received on the gaming dispute referred to \nthe WTO by Antigua and Barbuda \u2014 there is \nreluctance to comply. We cannot have double \nstandards. We therefore urge all parties to agree on \nmutually agreed principles that govern the conduct of \nrelations among States, large or small, in order for \neveryone to be treated fairly. \n Our world is in crisis. We face a growing, more \naggressive realm where the insatiable appetite for the \nworld\u2019s resources has led to the subversion of justice \nand humanity. The tumultuous times that we live in can \nbe weathered only through continued and increased \ncommitment to human development. Let us all work \ntowards that goal and the sustainability of biodiversity \nand humankind."

        "file_text": "I bring \na message on behalf of the President of the Republic of \nBenin, His Excellency Mr. Boni Yayi, who was not \nable to come to New York because of scheduling \nconflicts. He shares the ambition of the President of the \nGeneral Assembly at the sixty-fifth session to build a \nUnited Nations that is strong, inclusive and open as a \nguarantor of global governance. I am convinced that \nthe productive experience of the President of the \nGeneral Assembly at the head of the Swiss \nGovernment, which enabled his beautiful country to \nenter the United Nations, will be a valuable asset to us. \nFrom this perspective, Benin will make its contribution \nto the work of this session and, in so doing, will strive \nto promote the ideals of the Charter, to which my \ncountry reiterates here its full support. \n I would also like to express to Mr. Deiss my \nwarm congratulations on his election as President of \nthe General Assembly at the sixty-fifth session. His \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali Treki, who \nbrilliantly led the work of the General Assembly with \nrespect to Africa, strove to find appropriate solutions to \nthe great challenges facing humankind with skill and \ntact throughout his mandate. We pay tribute to him for \nhis good and loyal service to the international \ncommunity. \n I would also like to welcome the courageous and \ndetermined action of His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \nSecretary-General of the United Nations, and commend \nhim for having taken the measure of the grave crises \naffecting the world and for his ongoing commitment to \nthe achievement of the Millennium Development Goals \nby 2015. Thanks to his bold initiatives to promote \ninternational cooperation, he has been able to revive \nthe virtues of multilateralism as the optimum way to \nmanage world affairs in an inclusive and participatory \nframework that stresses the uniqueness of our world \nand the common responsibility of human beings to \nmaintain the fundamental balances on which human \nsurvival on Earth depends and the sustainability of the \nbiosphere. \n The trail blazed by the founding fathers of the \nUnited Nations in the areas of international peace and \nsecurity, the promotion of human rights and \ndevelopment is that of dialogue, cooperation and a \nglobal partnership to promote the common good of \nhumankind. \n The raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the United Nations is not \nonly to provide a framework of reference and universal \nconvergence to coordinate national policies, but also \nand above all to address interests with respect to the \nparameters that define areas of tension between \naspirations and the demands of our peoples and States \nin all their diversity. \n If the United Nations did not exist it would have \nto be created, because we cannot imagine a world \ntoday without the United Nations. I would therefore \nlike to express Benin\u2019s commitment to the \nirreplaceable role of the United Nations and its funds, \nagencies, programmes and various specialized \ninstitutions, which provide an invaluable service to \nhumankind as a secular extension of our collective \nconscience. \n  \n \n10-54833 50 \n \n The High-level Plenary Meeting on the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) convened by \nthe Secretary-General defined a programme of action \nto achieve the Goals by 2015. In implementing these \nmeasures, it is important to take continuously into \naccount the deadlines set for the achievement of the \nMDGs in the light of the additional difficulties related \nto the current crises of the financial and economic \nsystem and to previous crises. \n It is the duty of the international community to \nmobilize the resources necessary to address the grave \ndistortions that caused these crises. Vulnerable \ncountries must make investments to relaunch \nsustainable agricultural production and maintain \nsustained growth capable of generating long-term \nprosperity and sustainable human development, \nbecause the achievements of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals must be guaranteed in perpetuity. \n The United Nations must now, and with a sense \nof urgency, use its full influence to provide the means \nto help countries in difficulty ensure the survival of \nthreatened populations and vulnerable groups that \ncould be decimated by famine and disease if nothing is \ndone to help them. The time has come to give \nsubstance to the right to food because it is \nunacceptable that hunger should persist among the \ncauses of human suffering in the twenty-first century. \nIn the short term, priority focus should be on \nstrengthening social protection systems in low-income \ncountries and on reactivating dormant local production \ncapacity by promoting small and medium-sized \nagricultural businesses in order to avoid a drastic \nincrease in the number of people living in extreme \npoverty. \n In the medium and long terms, it is necessary to \nrethink policies to promote investments in agriculture \nin order to re-establish the balance between cash crops \nand food products and thus ensure food security in \ncountries, taking their cultural specificities into \naccount. \n The international community must begin to \nevaluate the effectiveness of its strategic monitoring \nmechanisms in order to strengthen their ability to \nforesee systemic shocks. What is predictable should be \npredicted in order to define a long-term approach and \nto build, on the basis of available scientific data, a \ndesirable future for our countries and peoples, who \nmust cooperate to that end. \n In this respect, the proposal to increase the \nagricultural share of official development assistance from \n3 per cent to 10 per cent is a strategic approach that \nshould be implemented with common political will \ncommensurate to the challenge. Here, I pay tribute to \ncountries that have already made concrete commitments \nto providing additional resources to that end. \n Benin is an agricultural country, and agriculture \nmust serve as a springboard for its development. In that \nregard, the Government of Benin is working to promote \nsynergistic growth and the fight against poverty in order \nto align democracy and new-found freedoms with shared \nprosperity by carrying out the social transformations \nnecessary to ensure the effective participation of all \nsectors in national development efforts. \n The Government of Benin is working to promote \nagricultural mechanization, but given that the latter \ncannot have the desired impact without water \nmanagement, we are also planning for rational \nmanagement of that resource in order to maximize its \nuse and ensure its sustainability. These investments \nwill allow us to make the work of farmers less difficult \nand to limit post-harvest losses in order to ensure that \nagricultural production covers national needs and \ngenerates surplus for export. \n In the framework of efforts to diversify \nagricultural production, the Government of Benin is \nalso working to promote crops for marginal farming \nland to produce biofuel. The goal is to reduce \ndependence on and the rising cost of hydrocarbons, \nwhich have been exacerbated by the drastic drop in \nhydroelectric power caused by climate change, which \nhas also seriously affected the country\u2019s economic \nactivity in recent years. \n West Africa has been deeply affected by soil \ndegradation, coastal erosion and the effects of frequent \nfloods due to climate change. Here, we express our \nappreciation for the awareness-raising undertaken by \nthe secretariat of the United Nations Convention to \nCombat Desertification. It is important to devote more \nresources to implementing the Convention in the \nframework of fighting climate change. \n Adaptation and mitigation measures should be \nimplemented with a sense of heightened urgency in \norder to help regions affected. Financial and \ndevelopment institutions should pay special attention \nto programmes to revitalize soil and to promote \nirrigation farming and reforestation, using species that \n \n \n51 10-54833 \n \ncan increase food availability. We reaffirm our \nsympathy for countries that have been struck this year \nby natural disasters, in particular earthquakes, and \nHaiti in particular, with which we share close lineage \nand cultural ties. \n My country, Benin, will hold presidential and \nlegislative elections in March 2011. After 20 years of \ndemocracy during which elections have been organized \non the basis of manually recorded lists, my country\u2019s \nGovernment, in collaboration with the United Nations \nand its development partners, has finally decided to \ncreate a computerized permanent electoral list that will \nensure transparent elections and significantly reduce \ncomplaints and other post-electoral difficulties. The \npolitical class of Benin agrees unanimously on the \nneed for such a computerized list, but differences \nremain with respect to the process, the timing of its \nimplementation and its use for the presidential and \nlegislative elections in March 2011. \n I am confident that, through dialogue and Benin\u2019s \ncreative genius, which ensured the outstanding success \nof the national conference of political stakeholders in \nFebruary 1990, Benin will be able to meet this \nchallenge and once again surprise the world. I call on \nthe United Nations and the international community to \ncontinue to support the efforts of the Government of \nBenin to work successfully to address the major \nchallenges of today and the future. \n We must maintain international peace and \nsecurity. This is the first of the major tasks assigned to \nthe United Nations. In spite of the tireless efforts of the \nOrganization alongside regional organizations, \nhumankind continues to suffer as a result of ongoing \narmed conflicts, the destructiveness of which leads to \nunimaginable suffering for affected populations. \n Terrorism, which we condemn without \nreservation in all its forms and manifestations, also \ncontinues to indiscriminately afflict innocent civilian \npopulations, including humanitarian workers and \nUnited Nations personnel despite the specific \ninternational protection they enjoy. \n We are concerned by these serious infringements \nof the humanitarian principles relevant to conflict \nsituations. We must work to strengthen the authority of \ninternational humanitarian law and the multilateral \ninternational justice institutions in order to increase \ntheir deterrence capacity with respect to serious crimes. \n Here my country reiterates the importance it \nassigns to the responsibility to protect, and we will \nspare no effort to ensure its operationalization in \naccordance with the fundamental principles of the \nCharter of the United Nations. \n We appeal to all peoples and to all citizens of the \nworld to respect the value of human life and to work in \na spirit of peaceful coexistence and good-neighbourliness \nto resolve their disputes through cooperation, exchange \nand seeking mutual understanding, promoting a culture of \npeace and dialogue among religions for the common good \nof all humankind, at peace with itself. \n To this end, we must pay greater attention to \nefforts to eradicate the underlying causes of conflict \nand in particular to put an end to the illicit trade in \nsmall arms and light weapons that leads to their \nproliferation and thus to lawlessness and insecurity in \nour towns and countryside. \n Respect for human rights and civil liberties \nmeans that human beings must be placed at the centre \nof sustainable development efforts, and it is the duty of \nthe international community to ensure this. It is \nessential that respecting human rights become a way of \nlife and the essential standard that validates human \nbehaviour on a daily basis so as to promote mutual \nrespect, equal opportunities in life and the full \nrealization of the potential of every individual. \n In this context, I would like to highlight the \nimportant role young people and women have to play \nin the development of our countries. In declaring the \nyear that began 12 August 2010 as the International \nYear of Youth, the General Assembly highlighted the \ncontribution that young people make to society. We \nurge all Member States to give concrete substance to \nthe International Year of Youth, in line with the \nsituation in their countries. \n The theme of the Year, \u201cDialogue and Mutual \nUnderstanding\u201d, aims, moreover, to foster alliances \namong the generations. The Government of Benin is \ndetermined to make its modest contribution by \nsupporting the effective holding of the United Nations \nConference on Youth, which is currently being \nprepared, to mark the Year. \n With a view to ensuring that the potential of \nwomen, who represent more than half of the population \nof my country, is fully realized, the Government has set \nup a National Institute for the Promotion of Women. A \n  \n \n10-54833 52 \n \nmicrocredit programme for the poorest women was also \nlaunched to ensure the promotion of their economic \nactivities. To date, this programme has helped to \nempower almost 600,000 women by providing income-\ngenerating activities. The programme should be \nexpanded, which will require additional financial support \nfrom the international community and, in particular, from \ntechnical and financial partners. \n Promoting the rule of law at the international \nlevel requires the effective participation of all peoples \nin the management of world affairs in the interest of \ncurrent and future generations. In particular, the \nrepresentation of developing countries should be \nstrengthened in the decision-making bodies of the \ninternational financial institutions, as should their \naccountability. Their institutional mandates should be \nredefined so that they better help to mobilize resources \nin support of the development of the least developed \ncountries, while ensuring the stability of the \ninternational financial system. \n The Security Council is an essential instrument \nfor global governance. Its long-awaited reform cannot \nbe postponed indefinitely. Reform efforts are being \nheld hostage by the inherent contradictions in today\u2019s \ninternational relations and remain hopelessly at a \nstandstill despite the crucial importance we all \nrecognize them to have for the effectiveness of the \nOrganization. The ongoing negotiations towards reform \nmust be carried out in good faith and with a keen sense \nof responsibility in order to preserve the credibility of \nthe Organization, which has been beset by heavy \nliabilities. \n Let us avoid trite formulations that evade the very \nessence of reform, which is to ensure the equitable \nrepresentation of States in both categories of membership \nand to guarantee that the Council\u2019s decisions have the \ntransparency, legitimacy and authority necessary for it \nmore effectively to uphold its primary responsibility for \nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \n In this respect, Benin reaffirms, from this \nrostrum, Africa\u2019s legitimate aspirations. The \ndemocratization of the United Nations also means a \nstronger commitment to respect for national and \ninternational law on the part of Member States. \n Here Benin renews its firm commitment to \ncontinuing to contribute to the ongoing adaptation \nefforts of the Organization, which is solidly anchored \nin its main principles of the sovereign equality of \nStates, respect for human dignity, the promotion of \ndevelopment cooperation and the search for the best \nsolutions to the world\u2019s problems. \n In this spirit, I should like to conclude by making \nan urgent appeal for the strengthening of international \ncooperation. International cooperation is neither a form \nof social assistance nor an organized hybrid system of \nbegging and deception. It should be based on \nlegitimate mutual interests \u2014 a joint effort towards a \ncontract of solidarity, which would enable us together \nto attain the means to forge conditions for humanity to \nlive in greater dignity and with ever-greater creativity. \nThis is the thought that inspires us in this year when \nwe celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the \nindependence of 17 African countries."

        "file_text": "I am honoured to \naddress this body. I do so at a time when the world \ncontinues to face multiple challenges, foremost of \nwhich for small island developing States such as \nGrenada is the fragile economic, financial and \necological situation. But despite those difficult \ncircumstances, the people of Grenada demonstrate \ntremendous resilience. Resourcefulness, patience and \nabiding faith in God keep us going forward. We will \ntherefore not relent. Our resolve is firm. Dedication, \ncreativity, renewed commitment to our fellow beings, \nunwavering commitment to multilateralism and, most \nof all, solidarity will help us survive these trying times. \n Indeed, as it did in the past, this body can again \nprove to be the perfect partner in our quest to solve our \nproblems, if only we commit ourselves to cooperate \nmore with each other. Carefully targeted technical and \nother forms of assistance to countries most in need \nwould make a vast difference in the lives of millions. \n It is in that spirit that I join the many speakers \nwho preceded me in congratulating you, Mr. President, \non your election to guide the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fifth session. You have Grenada\u2019s full support. \n We commend the outgoing President, Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki, for his dedication and able handling \nof the Assembly\u2019s work in the year just ended and wish \nhim the very best for the future. In addition, Grenada \nrecognizes the tireless stewardship and leadership of \nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, as the United \nNations tackles the very complex array of global \nissues. \n In her July address to the United Nations, Her \nMajesty Queen Elizabeth II, head of the \nCommonwealth of Nations, concluded her remarks \nwith customary clarity and insightfulness, affirming \nthat the United Nations is a real force for common \ngood (see A/64/PV.105). Grenada supports that \nstatement. \n At the very inception of the Organization, 65 \nyears ago, its objectives were to avoid future wars and \nmaintain the peace, and to partner with developing \ncountries in their social and economic development. \nGrenada is satisfied that after more than six decades of \nexistence, those goals remain worthy of continuing \npursuit. \n In times of conflict, strife, natural disasters and \nother humanitarian matters, the United Nations has \n \n \n19 10-55128 \n \nbeen the first place to turn to. Its relevance, role and \ninvolvement in global affairs remain unquestionable. \nAny weakening of its authority and effectiveness \ncannot be in our best interests. The United Nations \nmust remain the premier organization for global \ndiplomacy and negotiations. We must do nothing to \nhinder the United Nations continuing as a real force for \ngood in the world. Indeed, the United Nations must \nlead, not follow, in global governance. \n Times have changed. The world is facing new \nrealities, and the United Nations must adjust \naccordingly. For that reason, the recent advances made \nin United Nations system-wide coherence deserve \nspecial commendation. The formation of the new body, \nUN Women, aimed principally at promoting the rights \nof women and girls and equality between the sexes, is \nan early success of United Nations reform and is \nembraced by Grenada. Our desire to actively \nparticipate in the fulfilment of the noble objectives of \nUN Women has led us to seek membership on its \nExecutive Board. I am hopeful that Grenada\u2019s \ncandidacy will receive strong support and be elected. \n Similarly, the United Nations must recognize the \ninherent imperatives of democracy. Continued failure \nto meaningfully reform the Security Council will deny \nthat body the political legitimacy it needs to maintain \nand indeed enhance its leadership role. Grenada joins \nwith the Caribbean Community and calls for a Security \nCouncil seat for small island States as soon as possible. \n Climate change is rightly described as one of the \nmost urgent issues facing humanity and must remain at \nthe top of the global diplomatic and negotiating \nagenda. Left unchecked, its potential consequences \ncould be catastrophic, particularly for small island \ndeveloping States. Recent studies confirm that over the \npast five decades the planet has heated up and that 93 \nper cent of this warming has occurred in the oceans. \nThe consequential rise in sea level is already affecting \nlow-lying countries in the Caribbean and beyond and is \nundermining small economies, ruining their societies \nand threatening their very existence. \n In that connection, we continue to call for \nambitious mitigation targets and to welcome climate \nfinancing. Fast-start funding in the amount of  \n$30 billion, announced in 2009 and intended to assist \ndeveloping countries, especially the most climate-\nvulnerable nations, has reached only a small percentage \nof developing countries, and just a fraction of promised \nfunds has been released. Clearly, that situation has to \nbe corrected, for financial assistance must be \ncommensurate with the scale of the threat faced and \nshould be sustained, especially for small island \ndeveloping States. \n Grenada welcomes the empanelling of the \nSecretary-General\u2019s High-level Advisory Group on \nClimate Change Financing and the High-level Panel on \nGlobal Sustainability. We anticipate that in their \nreports the matter of appropriate and sustainable levels \nof climate-change financing will be properly addressed \nand promoted. \n What an important review year 2010 is. We \napplaud the High-level Plenary Meeting on \nbiodiversity (see  and PV.10) and support the \ncall to halt species loss. We welcome the convening of \nthe High-level Review Meeting on the implementation \nof the Mauritius Strategy for the Further \nImplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action \nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island \nDeveloping States (MSI+5) (see  and \nPV.18). In its capacity as Chair of the Alliance of Small \nIsland States, Grenada was privileged to play a \ncoordinating role in that important review process, and \nwe thank all, including our development partners and \nthe United Nations, for undertaking the process with \nus. Now that this body has endorsed the political \ndeclaration, we call for quick and full implementation \nof the MSI+5 decisions. \n Similarly, Grenada welcomes the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and remains firm in its \ndetermination to achieve them. Our report submitted in \nthe just-concluded review process indicated that while \nGrenada has made progress, there is much more to be \ndone to achieve the established Goals within the five \nyears that remain. \n It is our view that if our countries are to eliminate \npoverty and realize their true potential, there must be a \ncomprehensive review of the criteria for determining \nmiddle-income status. Many countries placed in that \ncategory, including Grenada, are highly indebted and \ndeserve special attention in order to achieve \nsustainable development. Small island developing \nStates cannot attain their full potential if they are \nprematurely set adrift in the development ocean with a \nfalse diagnosis of full preparedness. No matter what its \ngrowth pattern or level, a country with 37 per cent \npoverty and debt-to-GDP ratio of over 100 per cent \u2014 \n  \n \n10-55128 20 \n \nas is the case with Grenada \u2014 cannot be ready to sail \nthe high seas of development financing autonomy. That \nday will come, but it is not yet here. \n Grenada registers its strong support for the call for a \nUnited Nations high-level meeting on non-communicable \ndiseases \u2014 NCDs. Currently, NCDs constitute the main \ncause of morbidity and mortality in our region. Life \nexpectancy depends to a great extent on the avoidance \nof such illnesses, and thus preventative policies must \nbe aimed at promoting changes in lifestyles. Therefore, \nwe view with a great degree of satisfaction the progress \nmade by our Caribbean representatives here at the \nUnited Nations in articulating the need for such a \nmeeting in 2011. I pledge Grenada\u2019s participation at \nthe highest level. \n Grenada has confidence in the United Nations \nand in the work it can do. We unreservedly support the \npursuit of international peace and security, the rule of \nlaw, the promotion of democracy and human rights, the \nfight against terrorism, the fight against the illicit drug \ntrade and the many other issues that threaten our world. \n We also believe in justice. The economic progress \nand realization of the full potential of a fellow \nCaribbean nation continues to be stifled by a now \ninfamous economic embargo of over 45 years. As a \nresult, its people are humiliated by shortages and \ndeprived of basic necessities essential to decent human \nexistence. The vast majority of countries in the world \nhave consistently and overwhelmingly voted in this \nvery forum for its removal, but the irony persists. \n Grenada again urges the United States of America \nto do what is right and completely lift the harsh \neconomic measures against the people of Cuba, if only \non humanitarian grounds. In the spirit of fair trade and \ngood-neighbourliness, Grenada also calls on the United \nStates to honour the recent decision in favour of \nAntigua and Barbuda in the World Trade Organization, \nas that too would show respect for the decisions of \ninternational tribunals. \n Grenada reminds the world of the Caribbean \nCommunity\u2019s instant and pivotal response and \ncontinuing presence in Haiti, following the devastating \nearthquake earlier this year. The successful rebuilding \nof Haiti will benefit all, and Grenada calls for a swift \ndelivery of the pledged commitments made to that \nsister Caribbean nation. \n We are obliged to work selflessly to preserve the \nworld for future generations. The avoidance of a \nnuclear confrontation is one sure way. We therefore \ncongratulate the Government of the United States and \nall other Governments that have put much time and \neffort towards the non-proliferation of nuclear \nweapons. \n We are also encouraged by recent positive signs \nof engagement between warring parties, and we hope \nthat political and military conflicts around the world \nand, moreover, in the Middle East will soon come to an \nend. Grenada is particularly pleased that the \nPalestinians and Israelis are prepared to resume talks \nover their long-standing dispute with a view to finding \na lasting peace once and for all. \n We empathize with the many countries that have \nhad to cope with recent natural disasters: Chile, China, \nPakistan, New Zealand and Guatemala. \n Over the decades, the United Nations has played \ncritical roles in almost every facet of global affairs: \npolitical, economic and social. That is its strength, its \nenduring mission. Grenada remains ready to work with \nall who are partnering in political, economic and social \ndevelopment and seeing the United Nations as a forum \nfor working through all thorny issues. \n However, there will be no international peace and \nstability if people are unhappy, if they have no food or \nclothing, if they have no potable water or shelter from \nadverse climatic conditions. There will be no security if \ndisputes cannot be settled amicably, if nations are not free \nto determine their own destiny and if diversity among us \nis not recognized and fully respected. The world would \ncertainly be a better place if we shared our world\u2019s \nresources to assist the more vulnerable among us. \n I challenge this Organization, for another 65 years \nstarting with this sixty-fifth session, to harness our \nstrengths and continue to make the United Nations what \nwe all want it to be \u2014 a real force for good in the world.

        "file_text": "At \nthe outset, allow me to convey to Mr. Joseph Deiss, on \nbehalf of my country, our heartfelt congratulations on \nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly \nat this session. His proven experience and skill will \nensure that our deliberations are successful. I thank his \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, \nfor the excellent manner in which he discharged his \nmandate. To the Secretary-General, His Excellency \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, I reiterate the support of Gabon for \nhis tireless involvement in building a world that is \nmore free, just and united.  \n I take this opportunity to express from this \nrostrum my gratitude to all here and the entire \ninternational community for the solidarity they \nextended to the people of Gabon when my predecessor, \nthe late President Omar Bongo Ondimba, passed away. \nI am also grateful for the many forms of support \nextended to us throughout Gabon\u2019s process of \ndemocratic transition, which has highlighted the \ncredibility and reliability of our institutions and our \npeople\u2019s sense of responsibility.  \n For almost a year now, I have engaged Gabon in \nbroad-ranging economic, social and political reforms \ncentred on promoting our environmental heritage and \nindustrial sector and on making the service sector more \ndynamic. When I took office, I presented the three \nstrategic pillars of an emergent Gabon: Green Gabon, \nIndustrial Gabon and Services Gabon.  \n By putting Green Gabon at the head of that list, I \nwanted to underscore the central role that this sector \nwill play in Gabon\u2019s economy. I see Green Gabon as a \ncross-cutting approach that underlies our overall \ndevelopment strategy. Industrial Gabon draws upon \nefforts to promote our natural resources, while \nrespecting the basic principles of environmental \npreservation. Services Gabon highlights the country\u2019s \nownership of new information and communications \ntechnology, the promotion of tourism, transportation \nimprovements and the development of human \nresources. \n In the light of this vision, we have established a \nclimate council to mainstream the issues of climate \nchange into our national development policies. In the \nsame vein, we have just entered into a partnership with \nBrazil and with France to establish a satellite imaging \nfacility to monitor the forest cover of the Congo basin, \nwhich comprises more than 2 million square kilometres \nof equatorial rainforest.  \n The many initiatives in which I have engaged my \ncountry are aimed in particular at improving \ngovernance, fighting corruption, reducing State \nexpenses and preserving the environment, all of which \nrequires international support. We bear in mind, of \ncourse, that our future depends above all upon our own \n  \n \n10-54959 8 \n \nefforts to manage our resources, achieve good \ngovernance and serve the greater good.  \n Beyond our desire to mobilize further national \nand international resources, we continue to be firmly \ncommitted to the quest for peace and security, both \nregionally and globally. Through our membership in \nthe Security Council, we are fully shouldering our \nresponsibilities and making our contribution to the \nquest for a world that can look to the future with \nconfidence.  \n The theme of our debate gives us yet another \nopportunity to assess the role of the United Nations in \nglobal governance. Our world still bears the scars of \nthe terrible financial and economic crisis of 2008, \nwhich spared no country. The rapid and robust \nmobilization of the international community, and the \nUnited Nations in particular, in the face of this crisis \ndemonstrated its ability to respond when it is motivated \nand supported by genuine political will. Such \ninternational solidarity should be made systematic, and \nwe hope it will be renewed in efforts to deal with the \nemerging challenges that we face today. \n Given the complexity of the new crises we face \ntoday, we need to design a new approach to conflict \nmanagement. Peacekeeping has not had just successes; \nquite the contrary, there are many cases in which, for \nlack of resources and ambition, the United Nations has \nbeen unable to intervene and thus abandoned \ndefenceless populations to rebels and other armed \ngroups.  \n It is time for us to move beyond peacekeeping so \nthat we can adopt, when circumstances require, a \nphilosophy of imposing peace. We need to give \nourselves the capacity to deploy robust peace missions \ncommensurate with the nature of the conflicts that \ncontinue to destabilize certain States. Peacekeeping in \nand of itself will not be able to meet the challenges of \nsecurity. I reiterate my call for a culture of conflict \nprevention, which has the advantage of both averting \nmany casualties and saving the modest resources that \nare so necessary to our countries\u2019 development. \n The quest for peace and security remains a \nconstant concern in Africa and elsewhere. The \nimminent referendum on Southern Sudan appears to be \nclouded with uncertainties. Indeed, the hope of a \npolitical settlement to that thorny regional issue is \nparalleled by the fear of the balkanization of a \ncontinent that has already suffered too many divisions. \nThe stakes in the Sudan today perhaps foreshadow a \ncycle that will mark Africa\u2019s future. I appeal to the \nparties and the international community, in the interests \nof the populations involved, to take full stock of their \nresponsibility to ensure the success of a process \nleading up to the referendum.  \n Here, I commend the commitment of the United \nNations and the African Union to supporting the \nimplementation of the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement, to which my country remains committed. \nSpecifically with respect to Darfur, I call on all parties \nto be further involved in the Doha political process. I \ntake this opportunity to pay tribute to the State of Qatar \nfor its efforts to that end.  \n In Somalia, I commend the support of the United \nNations for the efforts of the African Union Mission in \nSomalia to put an end to instability in that country. \nYesterday\u2019s mini-summit on the situation in that \ncountry attested to the United Nations ongoing interest \nin reaching a settlement on the question of Somalia.  \n In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the \nreconfiguration of the mandate of the United Nations \nMission in the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 now \nthe United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission \nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2014 essentially \naimed at enhancing protection for civilian populations, \nshould be highlighted. It demonstrates the willingness \nof the United Nations to adapt to changing situations \non the ground. I call on the countries of the region and \nthe international community to support the efforts of \nthe Congolese Government in its determination to \nensure security and stability throughout its territory.  \n With respect to the situation in Western Sahara, I \nencourage the parties to restart the Manhasset talks, \nunder the auspices of the Secretary-General, in order to \nend the current stalemate and move towards a political \nsolution acceptable to all.  \n Finally, with respect to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Guinea, \nNiger and Madagascar, I urge the international \ncommunity to support them in holding free, democratic \nelections in accordance with the various arrangements \nreached to that end.  \n The search for peace in the Middle East is \nanother area of concern to the international community. \nI commend the diplomatic efforts undertaken by the \nUnited States, which have brought about the \nresumption of direct talks between Israelis and \n \n \n9 10-54959 \n \nPalestinians. I also thank the other Quartet members \nand Egypt for their involvement in that process. It is \nmy hope that these consultations will continue and lead \nto the establishment of a Palestinian State, living side \nby side with Israel within secure and internationally \nrecognized borders.  \n The terrorist threat, unfortunately, continues to \nweigh heavily on international peace and security. No \nnation large or small is spared. Defeating this scourge \nwill require effective cooperation among all Member \nStates, with the assistance of the United Nations and its \nspecialized institutions. We will also need to give \nongoing attention to other cross-cutting threats to \ninternational peace and security, such as piracy, the \nproliferation of weapons, drug trafficking and \ntransnational organized crime. We commend the efforts \nalready undertaken by the United Nations in this area, \nparticularly the strengthening of the legal regime and \nmechanisms to counter those threats.  \n With respect to the issue of climate change, \ntogether with other heads of State and Government in \nCopenhagen, I undertook the quest for a consensus on \nthe idea of a legally binding instrument. We support the \nnegotiations undertaken in Copenhagen and continued \nin Bonn and hope that they will lead, in Canc\u00fan, to the \nreaffirmation of the commitments taken, particularly in \nterms of financing for the fight against climate change \nin developing countries and the 20 per cent reduction \nof greenhouse gasses in the industrialized countries by \n2020. \n The advancement of women is undeniably one of \nthe areas in which the United Nations has made \ngenuine progress. The recent establishment of a new \ninstitution called UN Women, the primary mission of \nwhich is to better coordinate all the activities related to \ngender issues, clearly illustrates the fact that our \nOrganization is addressing this concern. I take this \nopportunity to convey my sincere congratulations to an \nextraordinary woman, Ms. Michelle Bachelet, for her \nappointment as head of this new entity. \n Given the many challenges facing humanity, we \nowe it to ourselves to work together in a coordinated \nmanner to provide a global response that matches the \naspirations of our peoples. The universality of the \nUnited Nations symbolizes the shared destiny of the \nworld\u2019s people, and the Organization thus has a central \nrole to play, both in global governance and in the \nemergence of a more just economic and social order. \nFrom that standpoint, I reaffirm the need to adapt our \nOrganization to the changing international context. \nRevitalizing the work of the General Assembly, \nreforming the Security Council and ensuring the \ncoherence of the United Nations system are areas that \nhave to be dealt with to strengthen the central role of \nour Organization.  \n At a time when we are realigning our common \nefforts with the current international environment and \nwhen democratizing global governance is emerging as \na necessity, I would like to reaffirm, from this rostrum, \nAfrica\u2019s aspiration to fully take its place among the \nfamily of nations. We fervently call for the \ndemocratization of the United Nations system in order \nto adapt it to today\u2019s realities.  \n Indeed, we believe that it is an anachronism that \nAfrica is under international pressure to reaffirm \ndemocratic values while those same laudable values \ncannot be applied within our own Organization. I \nbelieve the time has come for Africa to shoulder all its \nresponsibilities, stop its continual reliance on \nassistance from its partners and take its own destiny in \nhand. This affirmation of Africa\u2019s place on the \ninternational scene leads me to call for its permanent \npresence in the Security Council. We are prepared to \nmeet that challenge in order to treat the wounds of a \nhistory replete with injustices done to the continent.  \n Beyond the democratization of the United \nNations system, which we wholeheartedly call for, the \ncredibility of our efforts also requires that we meet the \ndevelopment promises made to humankind. \n Africa\u2019s destiny assuredly hangs on compliance \nwith the commitments undertaken in Monterrey, \nGleneagles, Doha, Paris and, more recently, in \nMuskoka and Toronto. Those commitments should not \nbe postponed indefinitely.  \n As humanity is one in its essence and varied in its \nforms, it is important that the management of the \nworld\u2019s affairs be done with the collaboration of all, in \norder to ensure that the generations to come can look to \nthe future with confidence."

        "file_text": "I would \nlike to convey to you, Sir, the warmest congratulations \nof the delegation of the Principality of Monaco on your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fifth session. I would like to reiterate to you that, \nin my capacity as a member of the Bureau, I will spare \nno effort to contribute to the success of your mandate \nin the service of the Member States and the \nOrganization. \n We are preparing to begin our work on an \noptimistic note because of the international \ncommunity\u2019s unfailing recommitment to the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) as well as of \nthe belief, reaffirmed in the general debate now \ndrawing to a close, that the United Nations is at the \nheart of global governance and remains, despite the \nmany difficulties, our best hope for ensuring peace, \ndevelopment and justice. \n Economic growth, which is indispensable to \ndevelopment and therefore to peaceful international \nrelations, cannot take off in the absence of well-defined \nand fair international rules and without respect for the \nrule of law at the national level. Our Organization has \ncontributed tirelessly in recent years to strengthening \nthe capacities of Member States to enable them to \nprovide their citizens with the institutions necessary for \nthem to flourish in their communities. The rule of law \nis also a guarantee that the fight against corruption is \nnot just a vain promise, that respect for human rights is \nuniversal and that justice is independent and impartial. \n The benefits of economic growth must be shared \nand equitable. They must take into account the needs of \nthe most deprived and contribute to social cohesion \nwith a view to attaining the MDGs and involving the \nfull participation of all partners. \n That is the thrust of Monaco\u2019s commitment \nwithin the Global Governance Group \u2014 the 3G \u2014 \n \n \n5 10-55408 \n \nwhose members are convinced of the need to involve \nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations in the \nwork of the Group of 20 (G-20), given relevance of the \nGeneral Assembly agenda to international governance. \nIn that regard, I draw attention to the ministerial \ndeclaration of the Global Governance Group adopted \non 27 September, with a view to contributing to the \nreflections of the working group on the development of \nthe next G-20 summit, in Seoul in November. \n As His Serene Highness Prince Albert II recalled \nbefore the Assembly, the Principality is determined to \nact as a responsible partner in solidarity and will \ncontinue its mobilization efforts, both through its \nofficial development assistance as well as through the \nprovision of emergency assistance to populations \nstruck by natural disasters (see A/65/PV.4). \n At a moment when the presence and activities of \nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \nfor Refugees are increasingly needed and increasingly \ndangerous, the cause of refugees and displaced persons \nmust more than ever be placed in our policies and be \nbacked unconditionally by the international \ncommunity. Here we wish to express our recognition of \nthe devotion of the thousands of people who labour \nunder the banner of the United Nations, at times \nrisking their lives, both in humanitarian emergency \nsituations and in peacekeeping operations. \n The role of women in driving development is \nnow clear to all. I wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral and the Deputy Secretary-General for having \nstrengthened the role of women within the United \nNations. Monaco welcomes the appointment of Ms. \nMichelle Bachelet to head up UN Women and assures \nher of our full support. \n The Principality has also endorsed the conviction \nthat investing in the health of women and children is \nindispensable for building societies that are more \nstable, more peaceful and more productive, for \nreducing poverty and for stimulating economic growth. \nIn that vein, we support the Global Strategy for \nWomen\u2019s and Children\u2019s Health, which represents an \nadditional step towards the full empowerment of \nwomen. \n As atrocities continue to be perpetrated against \ncivilians, especially the cowardly crimes of sexual \nviolence, we pay tribute to the courage of Special \nRepresentative Ms. Margot Wallstr\u00f6m and her \ncommitment to making the international community \naware of its responsibility and to ensuring the effective \nimplementation of resolution 1325 (2000) as we \napproach the tenth anniversary of its adoption. \n With your leadership, Mr. President, and our \ncommon will, the General Assembly has the means to \ndemonstrate its central role in the major themes for our \nfuture at a moment when we are all aware of the \nshameful damage caused to the planet by the \noverexploitation of its wealth and biodiversity. We \ntherefore attach the greatest importance to the \npreparation of the Rio+20 Conference and hope that \nthe green economy and the opportunities it affords will \nbecome a major vehicle for sustainable development. \n You can also count on the support of our \ndelegation, Sir, with regard to the upcoming summit on \nnon-communicable diseases and the consultative \nprocess on revision of the statute of the Human Rights \nCouncil and the Peacebuilding Commission, which \nmust take into account the presidential statement \nadopted at the ministerial-level meeting of the Security \nCouncil on 23 September (S/PRST/2010/18). \n At the beginning of the twenty-first century, our \ndeliberations must contribute to bringing together and \nharmonizing our actions. Only our Organization \npossesses both the means and the legitimacy to \nsuccessfully establish effective global governance, and \nwe must all show pragmatism and work in a \nconstructive spirit to achieve our goals. \n The interdependence of the global challenges \nwhich all of us are facing requires us to define together \na set of rules aimed at coordinating our policies and \nmanaging relations between Governments, the private \nsector and civil society. We share your belief,  \nMr. President, that our Organization should be at the \nheart of that new multilateralism, which should be \nfounded on integration and solidarity. "

        "file_text": " It is certainly a great opportunity for the \nPrincipality of Andorra and the Government I represent \nto address the Assembly. The United Nations is the \nforum that, true to its origins, today represents the \ngreatest source of hope for many people, countries and \nGovernments. \n In Andorra, we are aware of what being a small \nMember country of the United Nations involves \u2014 that \nis, a determination to engage in cooperation, hard work \nand honest efforts. The world is the sum of our \npossibilities and our efforts, and of the aspirations of \neach of us. \n The world in the twenty-first century is neither \nbetter nor worse; it has the same defects, contrasts and \nvirtues as in earlier centuries, but the rules of play are \nmore dynamic. Thanks to new technology and social \nnetworks, citizens now have greater weight than in \nearlier times in alerting and motivating the political \nand economic leaders and seeing that they remain \nactive. \n Despite all that, today we live in a world of \npatent contrasts, where hunger continues to be one of \nour worst evils. More than a billion people suffer from \nmalnutrition and poverty. The consequences of the \nfood, environmental and economic crises have \ncompounded the situation of the most vulnerable \npopulations. \n During the World Summit on Food Security in \nRome last November, we decided to adopt measures to \nhalve by 2015 the number of people suffering from \nmalnutrition and hunger, combining all possible efforts \nto achieve the first of the Millennium Development \nGoals. In the Group of 20 (G20) meeting in Toronto, \nthe Secretary-General defended the position of the \nmost vulnerable populations and asked the 20 leading \nworld Powers to develop new policies for combating \npoverty. \n The struggle to combat climate change, however, \nis still unresolved. The natural disasters that the people \nof Haiti and Pakistan have had to deal with show how \ndevastating the effects of climate change can be. It is a \nphenomenon that jeopardizes the poorest populations, \naffects access to water, compounds malnutrition and \nleads to violence. The economic impact on developing \nStates is terrible. \n While the threats are real, the solutions are real \ntoo. The possibility of dealing with them exists. During \nthe Copenhagen Conference, the States parties to the \nClimate Change Convention initiated negotiations for \nan agreement. We hope that at the Conference on \nClimate Change to be held in Canc\u00fan in December, an \neffective and scientifically ambitious text will be \nadopted that will make it possible to reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions. \n Andorra is engaging in activities aimed at \ncombating climate change, particularly water treatment \nand reduction of substances that deplete the ozone \nlayer. In the next few months our Government also \nplans to approve ratification of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change. \n It is clear is that the current crisis is forcing us to \nrethink the structures of the global financial system to \nmake it more equitable, more ethical and at the same \ntime more sound, in order to ensure that world leaders\u2019 \n \n \n13 10-55128 \n \naspirations can \u2014 little by little, but more each time \u2014 \nconverge and agree on what the most vulnerable \npeoples, countries and democracies truly need. \n Andorra has succeeded in moving off the Grey \nList of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment (OECD), thanks to the signing, between \nSeptember 2009 and February 2010, of 17 bilateral \nagreements on the exchange of tax information. Our \nfirm commitment to the recommendations of OECD \nand the international community as a whole, as \nexpressed at the G20 meetings, has laid the foundations \nfor our business structure and boosted confidence in \nAndorra\u2019s financial sector. \n We wish to move forward on the road to \ntransparency and international cooperation in \ncombating tax fraud. We therefore believe that a \npermanent European mechanism for financial stability \nshould be established, as well as very strict regulation \nof the products known as derivatives. It would also be \ndesirable to create a European agency to rate the \nsolvency of the financial activities and of its \nadministrations. \n We also wish to continue to work, from a \nperspective of respect, in an Organization such as the \nUnited Nations, reformed and consolidated, able to \nhelp the international community to move forward at \nthis stage of its history, avoiding any exacerbation of \nthe inequalities that fuel violence and hatred. \n We therefore need to promote an international \ndefinition of minimum social guarantees for all \nmankind. Andorra firmly believes that the United \nNations can ensure the necessary equilibrium, respect \nfor all States \u2014 regardless of their economic, political \nor military power \u2014 and the application of \ninternational law. The United Nations Charter urges \nMember States to apply tolerance and to combine their \nefforts to maintain international peace and security \u2014 \nin short, to ensure that the aspirations and needs of all \ncoincide. \n In the last 65 years, the United Nations has taken \nmany actions to promote disarmament, development \nand the rule of law and democratic practices, and it \ncontinues to do so. The Organization and its Member \nStates have been supported by non-governmental \norganizations and grass-roots movements, which have \nworked to ensure that the tragic experiences of the \ntwentieth century are not repeated. \n One of the features of my country is that we have \nno army. For more than 700 years Andorra has lived in \npeace, without a single armed conflict. Today, \ndetermined to show our international commitment to \ndisarmament, Andorra intends very soon to ratify the \nConvention on Cluster Munitions. \n Let us remember that the founding principles of \nour Organization are equality, the defence of human \nrights and the prohibition of any form of \ndiscrimination. \n The Human Rights Council is the principal forum \nfor the discussion of the defence of human rights. \nThanks to the Universal Periodic Review, all Member \nStates are subject to a unique exercise in dialogue, \nwhich encourages us to respect human rights and \nfundamental freedoms. This process is proving to be \neffective, but there are still a number of challenges to \novercome. Andorra will undergo this review for the \nfirst time in the coming month of November. \n To mark the twentieth anniversary of the \nConvention on the Rights of the Child, Andorran civil \nsociety and, in particular, the Andorra National \nCommittee for UNICEF have carried out many \nactivities jointly with Andorran institutions to raise \nawareness of that text and educate the population on \nthe importance of defending the rights of the child. \n Combating violence against women is one of the \npriorities of the Government that I represent. On  \n14 April this year, we created the Secretariat for \nEquality and Welfare, with the objective of \ncoordinating the range of actions aimed at promoting \nthe status of women and establishing new policies in \nthe area of gender. This year, we are celebrating the \nfifteenth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration \nand Platform for Action at the Fourth Conference on \nWomen, held in Beijing. \n During the March 2010 session of the \nCommission on the Status of Women, we recognized \nthat women have an essential role to play in promoting \nbroad and sustainable socio-economic development. \nProgress has been made on improving the status of \nwomen, but, unfortunately, it is not enough. We must \ncontinue promoting the rights of women and fighting \ndomestic violence. \n According to a report by the United Nations \nOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the most \nprofitable illegal activity in Europe is human \n  \n \n10-55128 14 \n \ntrafficking. Eighty-four per cent of the victims of \nhuman trafficking in Europe have been enslaved for the \npurposes of sexual exploitation. It is important to focus \non that issue from the perspective of protecting \nvictims, which will certainly be integrated into the \ndevelopment of the United Nations Plan of Action to \nCombat Trafficking in Persons, adopted on 30 July \n2010 (resolution 64/293). \n Over the coming months, Andorra will ratify the \nCouncil of Europe Convention on Action against \nTrafficking in Human Beings, which is a compelling \ndemonstration of our State\u2019s international commitment \nto this fight and of our will to support international \ninstruments aimed at protecting human rights and \npreserving the fundamental values of our democratic \nsocieties. \n The Government that I represent commends the \nrecent decision by the United Nations to create the \nUnited Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the \nEmpowerment of Women (UN Women). I wish this \nnew body the greatest success; it can count on the full \nsupport of my country, and we will work in solidarity \nwith Michelle Bachelet. \n At present, we are all experiencing a profound \nglobal economic crisis, which threatens the European \nmodel of society. This crisis is also cultural and affects \nvalues such as solidarity. \n As we celebrate 2010 as the International Year for \nthe Rapprochement of Cultures, we have the \nopportunity to remember the relevance of cultural \ndiversity. Learning about others, tolerance and respect \nfor human rights and human dignity are the ingredients \nneeded to build a harmonious and peaceful society. \n Perhaps as a result of the small size of Andorra, \nor of its geographical surroundings \u2014 abrupt and \nextremely beautiful \u2014 in the Pyrenees, we have been \nable to develop natural and strong human relationships, \nthrough which our attachment, commitment or \ndisagreement with all people is shown sincerely, \nwithout filters and without doublespeak. Therefore, \nwhen large-scale natural disasters, humanitarian crises \nor international emergencies occur, Andorra responds, \nand it does so sincerely, with voluntary contributions \ncommensurate with international norms and additional \ncontributions when called for by the situation. Andorra, \nin accordance with its national budget, is always \npresent and always does its part. Based on this \nsolidarity, we support and promote international \ndevelopment cooperation, and our country has a \nnumber of non-governmental organizations that devote \nvigorous efforts to working in this area. \n The challenges we are forced to face are \nnumerous. We have the good fortune of being able to \nwork together in order to overcome them. It is indeed a \ngreat responsibility, but it is also a great opportunity. It \nis an opportunity to come up with solutions that meet \nthe needs of those worst off. \n In conclusion, I should like to wish you, Sir, the \nbest of luck and the greatest of success over the \ncoming year. I am convinced that you will make great \nprogress towards improving the individual and \ncollective impact of our Organization."

        "file_text": "\nFirst of all, it gives me pleasure to convey to the \nAssembly the greetings of His Majesty King Hamad \nbin Issa Al Khalifa of Bahrain, and His Majesty\u2019s best \nwishes for every success. I also congratulate Mr. Deiss \non his election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly and thank His Excellency Ali Abdussalam \nTreki, President at the previous session, for his skilful \nmanagement of its deliberations. I also commend \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-Moon for his efforts and \ncontributions to international issues. \n We all know that since its inception the United \nNations has scored many successes in promoting \ncollective international action. It has undertaken a \ngreat many initiatives and conceived many ideas \nbeneficial to humanity, including the innovative \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Today, we \nview those Goals as the principal topic on which we all \nagree. \n As the representative of my country, I shall touch \non the challenges facing humanity in various fields, \nwhether they concern solutions to problems between \nnations or realization of peoples\u2019 ambitions, \nhighlighting some of the achievements that, taken \ntogether, can serve the common good. \n The most important challenge facing our world \ntoday is achieving the MDGs by 2015. We know that \nmany States have made huge and outstanding efforts to \nthat end. In this context, the Kingdom of Bahrain holds \na leading and positive position, particularly in the field \nof social welfare, free, quality basic education, health \ncare, improvement of child and maternal health, the \nempowerment of women, gender equality, the \n  \n \n10-55122 44 \n \nexpansion of the social security net for the poorest of \nthe population, our unemployment insurance scheme, \nand expansion of the scope of vocational training to \nenhance Bahrain\u2019s human resources. \n I am honoured to stand before the Assembly as \nrepresentative of a country actively pursuing its \ninternational responsibilities. When we refer to the \nnotion of a modern State as the most important \npolitical, social, cultural and economic product of the \nmodern history of the Kingdom of Bahrain, it is \nbecause whatever achievements have been realized can \nbe attributed to good governance \u2014 governance that \nhas encouraged and supported initiatives and political \nand organizational visions aimed at building the \ninstitutions and capacities that can enhance the \nprinciples of a modern, organized society. Such a \nsociety is faithful to its values in every area, based on \nState institutions that guarantee all talented citizens the \nopportunity to create and innovate and to be an active \nparticipant in our contemporary world. \n The Economic Vision 2030 for Bahrain, launched \nby His Majesty King Hamad bin Issa Al Khalifa on \n23 October 2008, is an historic turning point and a \ngateway to economic reform, and a completion of \npolitical reform. It lays down a long-term vision of the \nfuture tracks of the national economy up to 2030. It \naims to ensure the transformation of the current \neconomy from one based on oil revenues into an \ninternationally competitive and productive system, \nplanned by the Government but led by a vibrant private \nsector. The outcome will be a growing Bahraini middle \nclass enjoying a high standard of living, due to \nincreased productivity and well-paid jobs. This Vision \naims to establish a society based on the principles of \nsustainability, competitiveness and justice. \n The financial crisis that has affected the \ninternational economy since 2008 and the ensuing \nsovereign debt crisis in Europe, austerity measures, \nreform and restructuring of the banking system, \nincreased State intervention in matters of banking and \neconomy in various countries \u2014 all this has led to a \nprominent role for the Group of 20 (G-20) in \nresponding to financial and economic crises, due to the \nfact that it represents some 90 per cent of the world \neconomy. Consequently, the time has come for the \nG-20, and other blocs such as 3-G, to play a leading \nrole in developing and enhancing a common action \nfrom within the United Nations and its various \ninstitutions and organs by setting up plans for \ncollective action aimed at enhancing countries\u2019 \ncapacity to address future crises and to achieve an open \nand integrated economy. That is in line with the \nconstructive thoughts of the President of the General \nAssembly in this regard. \n The settlement of conflicts and disputes between \nStates, conflicts that we ourselves created, is a daily \nconcern for all of us. Those conflicts are either of an \nideological or ethnic nature, or are caused by people \noccupying the land of other peoples and evicting them \nfrom their homes and homelands. The conflicts divert \nour attention from more important concerns, including \naddressing poverty, ignorance, epidemics and natural \ndisasters, which take a heavy toll and impede human \ncreativity. Limited national interests of one State or \nanother that completely avoid considering the common \nglobal good are largely responsible for this state of \naffairs. \n One of the most important among these issues is \nthe Arab-Israeli conflict, which is located in our \nregion. We have been at an impasse for decades, as \nfailure has followed hopeful efforts and our optimism \nhas been clouded by frustration because of the \ncontinued backtracking of the peace process. Yet we \npersevere and cherish the hope of achieving a just, \npermanent and comprehensive peace that will restore \nrights to legitimate owners and open doors for mutual \nacceptance of others as neighbours, friends and \npartners fully sharing the respect and commitment \nrequired. \n In this connection, we value the historic \ncommitment and tireless efforts of President Barack \nObama of the United States of America and his \nAdministration to give a strong impetus to the peace \nprocess in the Middle East and to renew hope by \nrelaunching direct negotiations between Palestine and \nIsrael with a view to settling this chronic conflict. \n These precious efforts, however, require the \ncontinued support of all parties concerned and their \nunwavering commitment to take the necessary steps to \nachieve coexistence through enhanced communication \nand outreach. There should be an opportunity for each \nparty to convince the other to coexist as a neighbour \nand a partner in the region, and not an ill-intentioned or \ntreacherous enemy. Our commitment to the Arab Peace \nInitiative is one clear example. We are committed to \nthat Initiative and all its provisions aimed at achieving \na genuine peace. \n \n \n45 10-55122 \n \n One of the basic tenets of our foreign policy is \nour determination to see security, stability and \ndevelopment prevail. In that respect we look forward to \na safe and prosperous Iraq that is able to check any \nforeign intervention in its domestic affairs, an Iraq \nfaithful to its Arab-Islamic identity and inclusive of all \nits ethnic and cultural affiliations. \n As regards the Islamic Republic of Iran, we are \nkeenly interested in its stability and its people\u2019s \nprosperity. We look forward to it playing a vital role in \norder to eliminate the ghost of discord around its \nnuclear programme. We welcome its commitment to a \npeaceful nuclear programme and stress the need for \ntotal transparency and full compliance with the \nrequirements of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons. \n On the other hand, with regard to the sisterly \nUnited Arab Emirates islands occupied by Iran, \nsettlement of the question through direct negotiations \nor referral to the International Court of Justice would \nconstitute a vital step and a foundation for regional \ncohesion and understanding that would generate the \nstability necessary for development, which would be in \nthe interest of all the peoples of the region. \n As for Yemen, its stability is a pillar for the \nstability of the region as a whole. The Kingdom of \nBahrain therefore reaffirms its full support to the \nRepublic of Yemen in all its efforts to combat terrorism \nand protect its national security. Bahrain calls on the \ninternational community to provide support and \nassistance to that brotherly country, either through \nbilateral channels or through the group of Friends of \nYemen. \n Regarding the situation in the Sudan, we \nwelcome the agreement signed by the Government of \nthe Sudan and the concerned Sudanese parties, and we \ncommend the sisterly State of Qatar for its \nconsiderable efforts in that matter. We look forward to \ncompletion of the current negotiations on Darfur within \nthe framework of the agreement signed to preserve the \nunity of brotherly Sudan. \n Resolving those disputes will enable us to address \nthe real challenges to which we should devote our \ncommon attention: challenges of security and terrorism \nand challenges of devastating natural disasters, such as \nthe tragic ordeals which affected the sisterly Islamic \nRepublic of Pakistan and the Republic of Haiti \u2014 \nrespectively, the unprecedented catastrophic floods and \nthe devastating earthquake. We express our solidarity \nwith those countries and hope they will overcome their \nadversity with assistance and support from the \ninternational community commensurate with the \nenormity of the disasters. \n Terrorism is a multifaceted global phenomenon \nthat affects the entire world through criminal terrorist \nacts perpetrated against many countries. It exploits \ndiscourse to stir up violence and to divide countries \nand communities, thus contradicting its original \nmission of providing spiritual counsel and guidance. It \nutilizes mass media for the same purpose. The best way \nto combat terrorism is to monitor and expose its \nfunding sources. That requires global consensus on a \ntransparent international financial system to regulate \nthe transfer of those funds. \n For the international community to address these \nserious challenges and threats, States must be in a \nposition to play their role fully through strengthened \nconcepts of political participation, democratic \npractices, human rights, rule of law, judicial and \ninstitutional reform, including freedom of opinion and \nexpression, and involving society in sharing \nresponsibilities. \n In concluding, I would like to state that \nrestructuring international relations and forming more \ninclusive alliances requires a higher degree of respect \nfor the opinions and values of others. That is consistent \nwith our commitment to pursue the noble purposes and \nprinciples embodied in the Charter: peace, security, \nfriendly relations and international cooperation among \nnations and peoples. My country reaffirms before the \nAssembly its resolve to play its role as an effective \nmember of the international community and to actively \nparticipate and take initiatives in efforts for the good \nand prosperity of all."

        "file_text": "\nMr. President, let me first convey on my own behalf \nand on behalf of the Republic of Paraguay our wishes \nfor every success in your sensitive and important \nfunction at the helm of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fifth session. I would also like to express my \ndelegation\u2019s recognition of Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, \nPresident of the Assembly at the sixty-fourth session, \nfor the significant achievements made. \n Paraguayan democracy has completed its \ntransition, begun 21 years ago, with the transfer of \n  \n \n10-55396 14 \n \npower from one political force to another in recent \nelections held under international observation. In that \nway we have consolidated a process of strengthening \npublic freedoms, thereby affirming that those freedoms \nare fully guaranteed in my country today. \n Paraguay comes to this general debate \nreaffirming its importance and calling for progress in \nstrengthening the United Nations as the body capable \nof representing the interests of all Member States in the \nurgent quest for a fairer, more united and equitable \nworld, guaranteed by the full force of international law.  \n We are very pleased that some great Powers have \nreturned to the path of multilateralism, for some of the \nproblems that afflict mankind can be resolved only \nwith the involvement of every State. It has been \ndemonstrated again that in the search for a better \ncivilization, the solution has not, cannot and will never \nbe found by a handful of nations. Thus the recent \nfinancial crisis can be resolved satisfactorily only \nthrough measures that are universal and taken with the \nagreement of the great majority. Once again, it is the \nGeneral Assembly that will have to make its guiding \nvoice heard on this issue. \n We also applaud the Secretary-General\u2019s timely \ndecision to hold the High-level Meeting for review of \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The \nRepublic of Paraguay believes that while achievements \nhave been made with regard to the MDGs, we cannot \navoid the fact that there are still inequalities all over \nthe world and millions continue to live in abject \npoverty. The situation has been exacerbated by sudden \nincreases in food prices and the consequences of \nclimate change. \n In Paraguay we are betting on the globalization of \ndemocracy with social development. We are betting on \nthe universalization of security based on respect for \nhuman rights as an unwavering commitment and on \ndignifying human life. In that spirit we celebrate the \nrecent designation of a Paraguayan citizen as a member \nof the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of \nDiscrimination against Women. We appreciate the \nsupport she received, which further strengthens our \ncommitment to ensuring the inclusion of women in all \nareas of public life.  \n We would thus like to create a regional \ncommunity in the context of a global union that in \nsolidarity and together devotes its efforts to eradicating \nhunger and abject poverty, cooperating effectively to \npromote the participation of all in building sustainable \nprosperity through quality education and the provision \nof a social protection system that excludes no one. \n The Republic of Paraguay reiterates its \ncommitment to prioritize the implementation of \nprogrammes for economic development with social \njustice. The national Government is approaching with \ndedication the development and implementation of \nsocial policies to address needs in this area, with \nspecial emphasis on the most vulnerable and most \nneedy of our population. That effort at the national \nlevel also requires international solidarity, enhanced \nthrough the processes of regional and sovereign \nintegration of the people, as well as through a new \ninternational financial architecture whose institutions \ncontribute to job creation and to fairer, more equitable \ntrade conditions among the world\u2019s nations. \n We note with great concern that many citizens of \nour countries have had to migrate to other parts of the \nworld, particularly Europe and North America, in \nsearch of new opportunities for happiness and personal \nfulfilment. We take this occasion to show our solidarity \nwith the peoples who at this moment are suffering from \nthe consequences of mistaken discriminatory and \nviolent immigration policies, particularly as applied by \ncountries of the so-called first world.  \n Migration policy is not a domestic issue but \nrather a question that must respect international human \nrights norms and standards. Therefore we call on all \ncountries that receive migrants to deal in a spirit of \nhumanitarianism, fraternity and hospitality with all our \nfellow citizens who today seek to share in the right to \nwork and to a life of dignity far from their respective \ncountries. We propose a deepening of dialogue on the \nissue in international forums to highlight the human \ndimension of migration processes and find a just and \nequitable solution to that reality of globalization. \n Full employment and decent work are universal \ngoals, and to reach them requires focusing national \nefforts and improving international cooperation to \naddress macroeconomic and trade issues involved in \nthe solution to that problem. Bilateral and multilateral \ninstitutions for development assistance should insist on \nemployment taking a place of prominence in their \npolicy decisions and implementation.  \n Disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control \nare not only essential factors to ensure international \npeace and security, but they also guarantee sustainable \n \n \n15 10-55396 \n \neconomic and social development for the most \nvulnerable countries. Only through a sound multilateral \nsystem with strict adherence to international law and \nrespect for the sovereignty and self-determination of \npeoples can we guarantee our mutual security.  \n In that vein, we condemn coercive economic \nmeasures that prevent countries from exercising their \nsovereign right to choose their own political, economic \nand social systems. We reject the unilateral application \nof measures against the Republic of Cuba, and we \nreiterate our support for the General Assembly \nresolutions to put an end to the economic, commercial \nand financial blockade against that nation. The \nblockade against Cuba undermines the fundamental \nnorms of international law, the principles of sovereign \nequality among States, non-intervention,  \nnon-interference in domestic affairs, freedom of trade \nand international navigation and the self-determination \nof peoples, as enshrined in instruments of international \nlaw.  \n We also demand that the Government of the \nUnited States adopt necessary measures to put an end \nto the irregular situation of five Cuban citizens who are \ncurrently deprived of their liberty as they sit in United \nStates jails and who have denounced the violation of \ntheir human rights. \n The Republic of Paraguay reiterates its \ncommitment to international peace and security. In that \ncontext we reaffirm our political will to increase our \ncontribution to peacekeeping missions and to continue \nour efforts to train and equip forces in accordance with \nthe standards of this Organization, so as to \nprogressively increase our participation in those \noperations. \n My country is aware of the serious and complex \nthreats of climate change around the world. We have \nwatched with concern the growing negative effects of \nirregular climate phenomena that produce drastic \nconsequences that contribute to increased poverty and \ndisplacement of persons, among other irreparable \neffects that must be urgently and uncompromisingly \naddressed. We subscribe to the Declaration of the \nCochabamba summit on climate change and call for an \nurgent, coordinated and responsible global response to \nfind ways to mitigate, lessen and reverse the tragic, \ndevastating consequences of climate change. Likewise, \nwe proclaim the sovereign rights of peoples over their \nnatural resources, interpreted in the broadest sense.  \n A new international financial architecture is \nneeded, one that seeks a system of fair trade and \nefficient regulation mechanisms. We also need new \nparadigms for integration that attack the root causes of \nobstacles to integration, such as inequitable exchange \nrates and the unequal conditions of international \nrelations, the weight of unpayable debt and the \nimposition of structural changes that undermine the \nbases of social and political assistance. We are \nconvinced that the United Nations, as a global \ninstitution, should play a central role to guarantee the \nsuccess of our efforts to achieve better international \ncoordination and coherence in the economic and \nfinancial spheres.  \n The issue of landlocked developing countries is \nfundamental to Paraguay\u2019s foreign policy. The \nasymmetries and disadvantages created by and still \nbeing created by that geographical situation can be \noffset only to the extent that they are internationally \nrecognized and that there be special, individualized \ntreatment for such countries on the part of developed \neconomies on their integration into the globalized \nworld.  \n It is essential that the United Nations implement \nthe needed reforms with the goal of adapting its \nstructure to the current needs of global society. With \nthat desire for evolution, the Republic of Paraguay \nsupports the process of reform of the Organization so \nas to strengthen the General Assembly and recover the \nfunctions conferred on it by the Charter, as the most \nrepresentative organ of the Organization.  \n Paraguay has also been watching with great \ninterest the recent rounds of intergovernmental \nnegotiations about equitable representation on and \nincreasing the membership of the Security Council and \nother related issues. We advocate full adherence to \nmultilateralism, the sovereign equality of States and \ninviolable respect for the rule of law. Accordingly, we \nneed a Security Council that is more democratic, and \nthus its expansion cannot be put off in order to make it \nmore equitable and inclusive. \n As a contribution from Paraguay to promoting \nrespect and fraternity \u2014 values that strengthen any \norganization made up of individuals and nations \u2014 we \nhave proposed to share with the world our tradition of \ncelebrating friendship. To that end, Paraguay has \npresented to the United Nations a proposal to proclaim \n  \n \n10-55396 16 \n \n30 July as World Friendship Day, in order to renew \nappreciation and recognition among our peoples.  \n Sixty-five years ago we said, \u201cWe the peoples of \nthe United Nations\u201d, and Paraguay was among them. \nHence we reaffirm each and every precept enshrined in \nthe remarkable Preamble to our Charter. We will be at \nthe side of all, because we believe in the equality of \nnations large and small, which will allow us \nprogressively to improve the conditions under which \njustice can be maintained and thereby better the \nstandards of life in larger freedom. That is our \nmandate. We are committed to fulfil it.  "

        "file_text": "Please allow me, Sir, to \nextend to you, on behalf of the delegation of the \nKingdom of Thailand, our wholehearted congratulations \non your election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session. You can rest assured \nof my delegation\u2019s full support and cooperation. \n We live in a world of divides. Although the \npredominantly ideological divide of the Cold War has \nended, new divides have come to the fore \u2014 politico-\nsecurity, socio-economic, digital or even based on \nbeliefs. Such divides present challenges to peace, \nsecurity, prosperity and human dignity. Overcoming \nthem requires that nations work together as one; \novercoming them requires a United Nations. \n But the effectiveness of such international \ncooperation depends upon the strength and willingness \nof individual nations themselves. Thailand is such a \nnation, willing and ready to cooperate with \ninternational partners to help bridge such divides and \nhelp the world cross into a better future. \n Of course, we are under no illusions about \nThailand\u2019s own difficulties and our own current \ndivides. But history has shown that Thailand is a \nresilient country, and its people are capable of \novercoming whatever challenges are thrown before \nthem. Thailand remains a functioning democracy, but \nwe are a relatively young one. Like many other \ndemocracies, ours will develop and mature with time. \nThe Thai Government is committed to that and to the \nprinciples of democracy, the practice of good \ngovernance and respect for human rights. \n Have no doubt that our Government is resolutely \nworking to heal the political and social divisions in my \ncountry. We are working to address any legitimate \nsocio-economic grievances, with a view to bringing \nback national unity and confidence. We have launched \na national reconciliation plan and set up independent \ncommittees, led by eminent persons with the utmost \nintegrity, to propose ways to reform the country and its \ndemocratic institutions. We will bridge our country\u2019s \ndivide. \n Human rights remain the cornerstone of the \nGovernment\u2019s policy. We are looking into any \nwrongdoings in the past and will ensure that they do \nnot recur and that justice is done. To that end, we have \nset up an independent fact-finding commission to look \ninto the tragic events earlier this year. Other \nindependent organs, such as our human rights \ncommission, also play a key and active role in \nsafeguarding human rights. \n The Thai Government well recognizes that some \npolitical grievances mainly arise from the economic \ndisparities in our society. That is a serious issue, and \nthe Government is working to bridge economic and \nsocial gaps. We are creating social safety nets through \nour universal health-care schemes and by providing 15 \nyears of free education, training programmes for the \nunemployed and support for low-income earners, \nfarmers, the elderly and people with disabilities. Our \nstimulus packages will benefit not only the overall \neconomy but especially those who are economically \nand socially disadvantaged and disenfranchised. \n Despite our troubles, the Thai economy remains \nrobust, as it and our exports continue to grow steadily. \nHowever, we are not complacent, as much remains to \nbe done. We need to better spread economic and social \nwell-being and vitality throughout Thailand, which will \nalso contribute to the reconciliation, trust and stability \nof the country. To that end, we seek to strengthen \nThailand\u2019s creative economy by utilizing our rich \ncultural and historical heritage and the creativity of \nboth urban and rural Thais to add more value to Thai \nproducts and services, so that our productivity and \ncompetitiveness are enhanced and our wealth more \nwidely spread. \n I think we have proven to the world the strength \nof our national character and the resilience of our \nnation. Despite the tragic incidents, Thailand has \ncontinued to move forward, not merely for the benefit \n \n \n17 10-55396 \n \nof the country but also for that of the international \ncommunity. It is evident that we remain an active and \nresponsible Member of the United Nations, ready to \nenhance our present partnerships and build new ones to \nhelp create a better future for the world.  \n I will now expand upon how Thailand has \ncontributed, and can further contribute, internationally \nto help bridge the world\u2019s divides. \n Many a conflict, whether inter- or intra-State, \nstems from development disparities and the suffering \ncaused by economic injustice. The world is divided, \nnot simply into have and have-not countries but, rather, \ninto have-more and have-less ones, and into North and \nSouth. Thailand therefore believes that in bridging the \ndevelopment gap, global economic growth should be \nbalanced and inclusive, regional economic cooperation \nand integration should be enhanced and the \ndisadvantaged and dispossessed should not be left \nbehind. \n The recent global financial crisis served as a \nvaluable wake-up call for all, reminding us to live \nwithin our means. Thailand believes that people-\ncentred development, moderation in economic \nbehaviour and the optimal use of limited resources \u2014 \nas stipulated in His Majesty the King of Thailand\u2019s \n\u201csufficiency economy\u201d philosophy \u2014 are essential if \nwe are to have sustainable economic development and \ngrowth. Thailand has embarked upon that path, and we \nurge others to follow. \n The financial crisis has also alerted us to the \nnecessity of better global governance and the need for \nreform of international financial institutions, with due \nconsideration for the interests of developing nations, as \nthey are the ones affected the most. Countries must \nwork more closely together to better coordinate fiscal \nand monetary policies and to improve the regulation of \nfinancial institutions. \n On our part, Thailand has engaged actively in \nregional and international forums such as the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the \nASEAN+3 process, the Group of 20 (G-20) and the \nUnited Nations. As ASEAN Chair, Thailand was \ninvited to the G-20 Summits in London and Pittsburgh \nlast year to share ASEAN\u2019s experiences and lessons \nlearned from the 1997 financial crisis.  \n Thailand believes that regional initiatives like the \nChiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization, the Asian \nBond Markets Initiative and the ASEAN Economic \nCommunity would all help to complement ongoing \nglobal cooperation to achieve balanced and sustainable \ngrowth, as well as to promote a resilient international \nfinancial system that also addresses the concerns of \ndeveloping countries. We believe that ASEAN, through \nthe ASEAN Chair, will continue to contribute to the \nforum its relevant experiences in achieving those goals. \n As a developing country itself, Thailand stands \nready to help others in need. We believe in greater \nSouth-South cooperation, for it is fellow developing \ncountries that best understand what is required to help \npush development forward. We are also active in \nbuilding partnerships between the developed and \ndeveloping world, providing a bridge between them \nthrough triangular cooperation by adapting technology \nfrom developed countries to match the needs of \ndeveloping ones. We have achieved most of the \nMillennium Development Goals, and we stand ready to \nshare our knowledge and experience, especially in \nalleviating poverty and improving well-being in other \ncountries. \n We have already done so in our region by \ncooperating with our neighbours to improve social \nwelfare and build essential infrastructure. Through the \nThailand-initiated Master Plan on ASEAN \nConnectivity, the initiative for an ASEAN Integration \nStrategic Framework, the East-West Economic \nCorridor, the Greater Mekong subregion projects and \nbilateral cooperation, we have striven to promote \ngreater technical cooperation in the region and to \ncreate and upgrade transport and telecommunication \nnetworks to facilitate greater economic activity. Such \ninitiatives ultimately help narrow the developmental \ndivide within the region. \n Of the problems of development, food security \nranks as one of the most important. For people to live, \nmouths must be fed. As a major food exporter, \nThailand can contribute to ensuring greater food \nsecurity. We also believe in greater regional \ncooperation. The ASEAN Plus Three emergency rice \nreserve stands as a model for other regions to emulate. \n Climate change is undeniable. It is happening \nnow. We are all experiencing its effects, which have \nexacerbated the world\u2019s woes, including food scarcity \nand natural disasters. Thailand is a developing country \nactively pursuing voluntary climate-change mitigation \nefforts. We plan to increase our forest area through \n  \n \n10-55396 18 \n \nreforestation and afforestation, as well as our \nrenewable energy usage. Indeed, our eleventh national \nsocial and economic development plan, for the years \n2012 to 2016, now being drafted, aims to move \nThailand towards becoming a low-carbon society. \n We are also aiming for green economic growth, \nwith energy used more efficiently and wisely. But the \ndeveloped world must also play its part in helping \nothers become better equipped to fight climate change. \nGreater technology transfer is thus a must. We \nsincerely hope that the sixteenth Conference of the \nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change, to be held in Canc\u00fan, will lead to \nmore concrete and comprehensive results in our fight \nagainst climate change. \n Development is linked to human security, which \nis linked to human rights. People must have freedom \nfrom want as well as from fear. But while fundamental \nhuman rights are universal, how they are guaranteed \nand promoted differs from country to country in \naccordance with different belief systems and cultures. \nThailand believes that we should bridge such \ndifferences by working together towards a more \ncommon understanding of human rights and how they \nmust be protected. To this end, forums such as the \ninterfaith dialogues and the Alliance of Civilizations \nare invaluable contributions to greater common \nunderstanding. \n I stress again that human rights are a core \nprinciple of the Government of Thailand and its foreign \npolicy. Thailand\u2019s election to the Human Rights \nCouncil for the years 2010 to 2013, and its election by \nacclamation to the presidency of the Council in June, is \nclear testament to the faith of the international \ncommunity in Thailand\u2019s active and positive role in \npromoting and protecting human rights. As a member \nof the Human Rights Council, Thailand aims to \nreinvigorate the Council to address more effectively \nhuman rights problems worldwide. To this end, as \nPresident of the Council, we hope to see the review \nprocess through to completion by next year. We believe \nthe Council should adopt a more even-handed approach \nthrough greater cooperation and engagement with the \nconcerned countries themselves, to establish greater \ndialogue between States as well as regions and to try to \nforge consensus among them. \n Instead of offering mere criticism and the \nimposition of values seen as foreign, we must reach out \nto persuade the countries concerned to understand that \nhuman rights are shared values and common to all. \nOnly through true engagement can the Council have a \nreal impact on the betterment of people\u2019s lives and \nultimately help pave the way towards peace. Only then \ncan we ensure that the rights of man do not again fall \nhostage to the wrongs of humankind. \n Thailand has striven for this regionally as well. \nUnder Thailand\u2019s chairmanship of ASEAN from July \n2008 to the end of 2009, the ASEAN \nIntergovernmental Commission on Human Rights was \ncreated to protect and promote human rights and to \nuphold human dignity. We have also contributed to \nsetting international human rights norms in the area of \nimproving the lives of female inmates, through Her \nRoyal Highness Princess Bajrakitiyabha Mahidol\u2019s, the \ndraft United Nations rules for the treatment of women \nprisoners and non-custodial measures for women \noffenders, which have been submitted for the \nAssembly\u2019s consideration (see A/C.3/65/L.5). \n Thailand has also rendered humanitarian \nassistance to preserve human well-being and dignity \ninjured by natural disasters, not only in nearby places \nsuch as Myanmar, China and Pakistan, but also as far \nafield as Haiti and, most recently, Chad. We remain \nready to offer our facilities as a staging centre for \nhumanitarian assistance in our region. \n The flames of war can be sparked for many \nreasons, but none are as combustible as the security \ndivides and power imbalances, real or perceived, that \nexist between nations as well as within them. Thailand \nbelieves that global disarmament and non-proliferation \nare essential in order to level the security playing field, \nto dispel that sense of an imbalance of power and \nsecurity. The United Nations must continue its active \nrole to that end, but major Powers and regional entities \nmust also do their fair share: the Southeast Asian \nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty is a good case in \npoint. \n Thailand supports international efforts towards \nthe disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction. We have consistently abided by the \nrelevant Security Council resolutions and are gravely \nconcerned about the threat of the spread of such \nweapons to terrorists. That is why Thailand has \nrecently joined the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear \nTerrorism. \n \n \n19 10-55396 \n \n The maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity is a serious and costly endeavour, and history \nhas shown that the international community has often \nacted too late, enforcing and keeping the peace rather \nthan making it. We believe that more should be \ninvested in peacemaking and preventive diplomacy, \nwhich are much less expensive than peace enforcement \nand peacekeeping. It is much better to hold talks than \nto wage war. It is also far less likely for a community \nof nations to wage war within itself. That is why \nASEAN is steadfastly becoming a community: \neconomically, socially, culturally and politically. \n But in cases where peacekeeping has been and is \nnecessary, Thailand has also done its part. In the past \ntwo decades, we have contributed nearly 20,000 troops, \npolice officers and civilian staff to United Nations \npeacekeeping operations worldwide: from Cambodia \nand Timor-Leste to Haiti and very soon Darfur in the \nSudan. Thailand has also recently sent a counter-piracy \ntask force to assist international efforts in patrolling \nand protecting ships from pirate attacks in the Gulf of \nAden area. These are our contributions to the \nmaintenance of peace and security worldwide, and we \nare prepared to do more. Rest assured that as long as \nthere is peace to be kept, the Thais will be ready to \nhelp keep it. \n However, peacekeeping alone is not enough. The \nconditions for sustainable peace must be built in post-\nconflict societies to ensure that blood is not shed again. \nWe believe that sustainable development is crucial to \nperpetual peace. This is what Thailand is working for, \nby helping lay the foundations for peace through \ndevelopment during the peacekeeping phase \u2014 from \nthe transfer of agricultural know-how in Timor-Leste to \nthe building of essential infrastructure in Burundi. We \nhave also striven for this goal through our membership \nof the Peacebuilding Commission. Thailand envisages \nthat body playing a greater role in ensuring sustainable \npeace worldwide. \n Thailand itself is poised to play a greater role in \nensuring international peace and security. We have \npresented our candidature for a non-permanent seat on \nthe Security Council for the term 2017-2018, for which \nwe ask members\u2019 invaluable support. Thailand aspires \nto work closely with our international partners to \nensure that the path towards war is never trodden \nagain, but is rerouted towards peace. \n While we believe that the Security Council has so \nfar played an indispensable role in maintaining \ninternational peace and security, we also believe that \nthe Council should be adjusted to better reflect world \nrealities in order to tackle today\u2019s global challenges \nmore effectively. Thailand envisions a Security Council \nworking with greater efficiency, transparency and \nengagement with concerned parties, be they countries, \nregional organizations or other United Nations bodies. \nWe believe that, through such reforms, the Council \nwould become more effective in maintaining peace and \nsecurity worldwide. \n Thailand is wholly committed to the United \nNations and its lofty ideals. Since the birth of the \nOrganization over six decades ago, Thailand has \nworked closely with the United Nations to advance \npeace and security, development and human rights \naround the world. And we will continue to do so. In \nspite of our problems, our commitment and \ndetermination have never wavered. \n As a medium-sized and middle-income \ndeveloping country, Thailand is ready to engage  \nwith \u2014 and serve as a connection between \u2014 North \nand South, East and West. As a country with substantial \nexperience in addressing today\u2019s problems, we are \nready to help narrow the international gaps in \ndevelopment, human rights and security. Thailand \nbelieves that the time to act is now, and we stand ready \nwith our partners to act as a bridge between worlds and \nto help bridge the world\u2019s divides. "

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like \nto congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President \nof the General Assembly, and to stress that you can \ncount on the full support of the Croatian delegation in \nthe coming year. At the same time, I would like to \nthank Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his successful \nwork as President of the General Assembly over the \npast year and for the results achieved under his \nleadership. \n The consequences of the serious threats facing \nthe modern world \u2014 from terrorism and the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction to \nhumanitarian crises and climate change, to mention \njust a few \u2014 reach far beyond the original framework \nwithin which they began. Without exception, they are \nacquiring global proportions. In the same way, \ncontemporary social and economic relationships have \ngrown far beyond narrow national frameworks and, \nthrough the flow of people, goods, services and capital, \nare creating a global network of mutual relations and \ninfluence. Does the recent eruption of the volcano on \nIceland not testify to this in as vivid a manner as the \n \n \n25 10-55128 \n \njoint humanitarian actions undertaken in response to \nrecent terrifying natural disasters? \n This accelerated development of the \ncontemporary world, and especially the challenges and \nthreats to which it is exposed, call on all of us to take \nswift action, shoulder joint responsibility and foment \nnew solidarity. There is no alternative to working \ntogether in today\u2019s world. \n In that vein, the theme you have chosen, Sir, for \nthe opening of the sixty-fifth session of the General \nAssembly reminds us, in focusing on the concept of \nglobal governance, of the role of the Assembly in \nformulating the global response to the challenges we \nface in today\u2019s world. At the same time, your proposal \ncalls for an examination of our own contribution to the \nformulation of responses to these challenges. \n During its membership of the Security Council, \nCroatia promoted the ideas that are the backbone of all \ncivilized governance and therefore also of global \ngovernance: the importance of the rule of law and the \nprotection and promotion of international law, \nespecially human rights and minority rights, \ninternational humanitarian law and transparency in the \nwork of the main bodies of the United Nations. \n Within the rich legal heritage of the United \nNations, the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) \nhas particular significance. That document confirms \nthe global strategy of the United Nations in areas \ncrucial to the life and well-being of a large proportion \nof humankind, and unites the activities of the relevant \ninstitutions in this sphere. For Croatia, implementing \nthe Millennium Development Goals is of additional \nimportance because of their strong link with the \npriorities related to the process of our accession to the \nEuropean Union, which has entered its final phase. \n Croatia has decided to confirm its readiness to \nparticipate in the international activities aimed at \nachieving these goals by increasing its financial \ncontribution to the programmes and activities of the \nUnited Nations. In that context, allow me to mention \nthe Republic of Croatia\u2019s successful shift from \nrecipient to provider of international aid. Croatia has \naimed its support at the neighbouring region of South-\nEast Europe, where our knowledge and experience may \nbe most useful to the recipient countries. \n Along with its contribution of peacekeeping \ntroops, police and military experts to 14 international \nmissions led by the United Nations, NATO and the \nEuropean Union, Croatia is also ready to share its \nexperience with States emerging from armed conflict \nby offering expert advice and other services in the field \nof security and defence sector reform and in \nreintegrating demobilized persons into civilian society. \n I would particularly like to emphasize that \npeacebuilding support for countries emerging from \narmed conflict is one of the most important and \ncomplex challenges confronting the United Nations. In \nthat light, Croatia strongly supports the work of the \nPeacebuilding Commission and the report (A/64/868, \nannex) drawn up by the co-facilitators of the process of \nreviewing the United Nations peacebuilding \narchitecture and the work of the Commission. Croatia \nwas a founding member of the Peacebuilding \nCommission, and, wishing to continue contributing to \nthe significant efforts being made in this area, has \nannounced that it will be a candidate for membership \nof the Commission for the period 2012-2013. \n However important our joint action at the global \nlevel may be to finding responses to the many \nchallenges that confront us, it is imperative when it \ncomes to attempting to find a deterrent to the use of \nnuclear weapons. In recent years, we have witnessed a \nrenewed desire within the international community for \na world without nuclear weapons, which Croatia also \nrecognized in the historic Security Council summit of \nSeptember last year on the prevention of the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, with \nPresident Barack Obama presiding (see S/PV.6191). \n Making its own contribution to the significant \nefforts aimed at preventing the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons, in June the Republic of Croatia successfully \norganized a regional workshop on the implementation \nof Security Council resolution 1540 (2004). Of course, \nin Croatia we are aware that mere words and adopted \ndocuments are not enough, especially to preventing the \ndirect threat posed by the possibility of terrorists \ngetting hold of weapons of mass destruction. We \ntherefore welcome the concrete steps being taken by \nthe nuclear States to reduce their nuclear capacities and \nto increase the transparency and security of nuclear \nreserves. \n At the same time, we must not forget that, in \nparallel with the existence of a nuclear threat, the \nillegal trade in small arms and light weapons has taken \nmany human lives. Croatia most strongly condemns \n  \n \n10-55128 26 \n \nterrorism and is wholly dedicated to preventing this \nthreat in all its various forms at the national, regional \nand global levels. In an attempt to make a contribution \nto these efforts, during its time as a member of the \nSecurity Council Croatia chaired the Counter-\nTerrorism Committee for two years. During its \npresidency of the Security Council in December 2008, \nCroatia organized a debate on the subject of threats to \ninternational peace and security caused by terrorist acts \n(see S/PV.6034). The Council then adopted a \npresidential statement (S/PRST/2008/45) calling on all \nMembers of the United Nations to show the same level \nof solidarity they displayed immediately after the \ntragic events of 11 September 2001. \n As a member of NATO and a future member of \nthe European Union, Croatia is strongly engaged in \nsecuring peace and stability in South-East Europe. This \nis also precisely the reason why we advocate a clear \nEuro-Atlantic perspective for all the States in the \nregion. To realize that perspective, it is first necessary \nto accept and fully apply the principles on which \nEuropean integration was initiated 60 years ago: \ncooperation, dialogue and mutual respect. \n In that spirit, Croatia and Slovenia last year \nagreed on a solution to their long-running border \ndispute through international arbitration. By my \nagreement with Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor, \na new page was turned in Croatian-Slovenian relations, \nand at the same time a way was opened for all the other \ncountries of South-East Europe to realize their right to \na European future through dialogue and cooperation. \n In that sense, I would like here to welcome the \ndecision by the General Assembly to adopt by \nconsensus a resolution on Kosovo (64/298) sponsored \nby Serbia and the European Union. In this way, a \ncompletely new European paradigm of cooperation, \npeace and progress is being created in South-East \nEurope. Croatia will lead the way in supporting and \npromoting these values throughout the region, and \nespecially in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which also has \nthe right to a Euro-Atlantic perspective as a united \nState of three constitutive and equal peoples. There is \nno real alternative to the Euro-Atlantic future, and any \nattempt to go back to the old and failed ways of the \npast would be extremely harmful. This is the only \nsphere of peace and security ensuring prosperity in the \nEuro-Atlantic zone whose doors will be open to the \ncountries of South-East Europe that meet the \nconditions for membership of NATO and the European \nUnion. \n With this in mind, the Republic of Croatia \nadvocates the accepted concept of responsibility for the \nprotection of civilians against genocide, ethnic \ncleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity. We \nwelcome, support and follow with special attention the \nwork of the International Criminal Court. In the same \nvein, allow me to point out here that the Republic of \nCroatia supports the work of the International Criminal \nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and welcomes the \nTribunal\u2019s exit strategy. \n Finally, this is an opportunity for me to say that \nthe Republic of Croatia, in line with its focus to date \non human rights, will continue its activities to protect \nand promote them. I especially welcome the \nestablishment of UN Women as an important and \nwelcome new body within the Organization, aimed at \nsupporting gender equality and strengthening the \nposition of women. \n In closing, allow me to end this address by \nasserting that lasting and civilized governance, \nespecially insofar as it includes the United Nations, \nmust arise from the individual and return to the \nindividual. The protection of the dignity of human life, \nand the dignity and identity of each nation, is the firm \nfoundation on which the United Nations can fulfil its \ntask to promote peace and security in today\u2019s \nglobalized world."

        "file_text": "Allow me \nat the outset to congratulate the President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session, and the \nfriendly people of Switzerland, on his election. Our \ndelegation will cooperate with him to its fullest extent \nin the performance of his task. We are confident that \nhis experience and wisdom will be important factors in \nthe success of the Assembly\u2019s work and in the \nachievement of the purposes of the United Nations. I \nalso thank his predecessor, my close friend Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki, for presiding over the Assembly at \nits last session. \n The political process in Iraq since the collapse of \nthe dictatorial regime in 2003 has resulted in radical \npolitical change, as well as in the building of a federal, \ndemocratic, independent and united Iraq with respected \nconstitutional institutions and a Government elected in \naccordance with the Constitution. Achieving that goal \n \n \n41 10-54833 \n \nwas neither easy nor simple. Iraq faced many \nchallenges, foremost of which was confronting \nextremist, sectarian and factional forces and countering \nterrorist groups and groups of the former dictatorial \nregime that are attempting to take Iraq back to the dark \nera of mass graves and fruitless wars. \n Those groups have used various means, including \nthe most heinous crimes, and have allied themselves \nwith organized crime and transnational terrorist \nnetworks in order to destabilize the security situation \nin Iraq. The main task of the Government of Iraq was \nto provide security throughout the country and to \nstrengthen national unity and the rule of law. \n There have been significant developments in Iraq \nsince I stood before the Assembly last year. This year \nand last have witnessed a significant decrease in \nviolence and a marked improvement in security in Iraq. \nAlthough there were some terrorist acts targeting \ninnocent civilians in different places in the country, the \noverall security situation has improved, and that paved \nthe way for the withdrawal of United States combat \nforces operating in Iraq. The complete pullout of those \nforces on 31 August 2010 was based on the Agreement \nBetween the United States of America and the \nRepublic of Iraq On the Withdrawal of United States \nForces from Iraq and the Organization of Their \nActivities during Their Temporary Presence in Iraq, \nsigned by both parties on 17 November 2008. \n This year has also seen successful legislative \nelections, which were held on 7 March with \nconsiderable Arab, regional and international interest. \nThe United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq and the \nobservers from the Organization of the Islamic \nConference, the League of Arab States, the \ninternational community and civil society organizations \nall expressed their belief that the elections were \ntransparent, free and fair. \n The principal political parties have been in \ncontinuous communication with the aim of holding a \nfruitful session of the newly elected Iraqi Council of \nRepresentatives to elect a Speaker for the new \nparliament and the President of the Republic of Iraq, \nafter which, according to the provisions of the Iraqi \nConstitution, the elected President will ask a new \nPrime Minister to form a Government. It is our hope \nthat that new Government will be formed as soon as \npossible, as any delay will negatively affect the \nsecurity situation, reconstruction and prosperity. \n The improved security situation in Iraq has \nencouraged many Arab and other countries to reopen \ntheir diplomatic missions and has helped to develop \nIraqi relations regionally and internationally. The \nappointment of new Iraqi ambassadors to various \ncountries around the world has also helped to promote \nand broaden the horizons of those relations. Iraq\u2019s \nassuming the presidency of the current session of the \nArab League and of the Arab Summit Conference in \nMarch of next year will promote Iraq\u2019s regional role \nand will be considered an important step in its efforts \nto regain its global standing as an effective and \nresponsible member of the international community. \nThe Government of Iraq will continue to move in that \ndirection through strengthening its friendships, \ncooperation and good-neighbourly efforts, thus creating \ngreater opportunity for stability and security in the region. \n In the development arena, on 4 April 2010 the \nGovernment of Iraq initiated a national development \nplan for the five-year period from 2010 to 2014. It \ncontains around 2,700 strategic projects in various \nsectors at a total cost of $186 billion. That plan will \nhelp to develop the Iraqi economy and enhance the \nquality of services provided to Iraqis. It will also create \n4 million jobs, thus helping the unemployment problem \nin Iraq. \n The national development plan will also help \nIraqi refugees return to their homes. The Government \nof Iraq believes that the real solution for the problem \nof Iraqi refugees and displaced persons lies in their \nreturn to their homeland and their residences. Iraq \nneeds the experience of all its citizens to help build the \ncountry\u2019s future. We therefore call upon countries \nhosting Iraqi refugees, international organizations and \ncivil society organizations to promote awareness of the \nculture of voluntary return. \n Iraqi women enjoy important status in the new \nfederal and united Iraq and enjoy political rights equal \nto those of men. Women have been granted 25 per cent \nof the seats in the Iraqi Council of Representatives. \nAdditionally, for the first time in many decades, the \nwomen of Iraq have assumed many important \nministerial positions and have represented their country \nas ambassadors, this after having been deprived of \nthose rights for more than 30 years. The Constitution \nalso guarantees that women grant their nationality to \ntheir children. \n  \n \n10-54833 42 \n \n The Constitution formulated the basic principles \nof Iraq\u2019s foreign policy, which focuses on observing \ngood-neighbourliness and non-interference in the \ninternal affairs of other States, the resolution of \ndisputes by peaceful means and the establishment of \ninternational relations based on shared interests and \nrespect for Iraq\u2019s international obligations. On that \nbasis, we seek to establish the best relations with \nsisterly Arab and Islamic countries and are committed \nto the resolutions of the Arab League and the \nOrganization of the Islamic Conference. \n In this spirit we support the Palestinian people\u2019s \njust struggle to secure their inalienable rights, \nincluding the establishment of a Palestinian State on \nthe land of Palestine, as we work to implement the \ninternationally legitimate resolutions aimed at \nreturning the occupied Arab territories. We consider the \nArab Peace Initiative to be a practical step towards \nresolving the Arab-Israeli conflict and achieving \nsecurity, peace and stability in the Middle East. \n We also call for making the Middle East a zone \nfree of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass \ndestruction, which would enhance the prospects for \npeace and security in the region. We call on all States \nthat have not yet done so to accede to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and \ncomply with its provisions. \n With regard to the Iranian nuclear issue, Iraq \nbelieves in the legitimate right of States to use nuclear \nenergy for peaceful purposes. That is a right \nguaranteed by international conventions, including the \nNPT. We stress the importance of reaching a peaceful \nsolution to that issue, and that dialogue and quiet \ndiplomacy are the most effective ways to achieve that \ngoal. Any escalation would harm the interests of all \nparties and would endanger regional security. \n The most important issue Iraq continues to face is \nthe removal of the burden created by Security Council \nresolutions adopted against it under Chapter VII of the \nUnited Nations Charter. By reviewing those \nresolutions, in accordance with Council resolution \n1859 (2008) and in response to the report of the \nSecretary-General in document S/2009/385, we have \nbeen working diligently with our friends and members \nof the Council to settle all the outstanding issues \nconcerning the situation in Iraq. \n At the forefront of those issues are the remaining \nrestrictions on Iraq in the field of disarmament, the \nconclusion of the remaining contracts under the Oil-\nfor-Food programme and finding the right mechanism \nfor guaranteeing Iraqi funds following the replacement \nof the Development Fund for Iraq and the International \nAdvisory and Monitoring Board for Iraq. Iraq would \nlike to see those dossiers closed by the end of this year. \n The newly elected Iraqi Government will also \ndeal with the situation between Iraq and sisterly \nKuwait and related issues, such as the maintenance of \nborder pillars, compensation and missing Kuwaiti \npersons and properties. We will work seriously with \nour Kuwaiti brothers, other stakeholders and United \nNations organs to reach a settlement that satisfies all \nparties without prejudice to our obligations under \nSecurity Council resolutions, concerning which we \nemphasize our respect and commitment. \n The situation in Iraq has changed as a result of \nthe important positive developments since the collapse \nof the former regime and the end of the dictatorship. It \nis drastically different from the situation at the time the \nSecurity Council adopted resolution 661 (1990). For \nthat reason, and following the adoption of resolution \n1859 (2008) and the publication of the report of the \nSecretary-General pursuant to paragraph 5 of that \nresolution (S/2009/385), we believe that the time is \nripe for the Council to act in accordance with the \nSecretary-General\u2019s report and the mandate set out in \nresolution 1859 (2008). Also, in keeping with its \nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \npeace and security, it is time for the Council to review \nresolutions pertaining specifically to Iraq, beginning \nwith resolution 661 (1990), with a view to helping Iraq \nachieve the international standing it enjoyed before \nthose resolutions were adopted. \n The current political process in Iraq aims at \nbuilding a federal, democratic, independent and united \nIraq, where citizens work within a constitutional \nframework that guarantees the rule of law, where \nhuman rights are protected and where all segments of \nthe Iraqi people are treated with full respect. We have \ngreat faith in our ability and potential, as a country rich \nin natural and human resources, to achieve those \nobjectives. \n However, at this important stage in the life of the \nIraqi people, we continue to need the political and \neconomic support of and cooperation from the \ninternational community in order to stand on a firm \nfoundation \u2014 one that will enable us to advance \n \n \n43 10-54833 \n \ntowards a future in which not only can we promote our \ncountry\u2019s and our people\u2019s stability, progress and \nprosperity, but also contribute fully as a member of the \ninternational community to the achievement of peace, \nsecurity and sustainable development for all nations."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I would like to \njoin other delegations that have preceded me in \noffering my congratulations and those of my delegation \non your election as President of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-fifth session. I am convinced that your \npolitical experience and diplomatic skill will assist and \nguide this Assembly in its deliberations, especially in \naddressing important and critical issues on the \ninternational agenda. \n I also congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki, for the excellent manner in which \nhe presided over the sixty-fourth session of the \nAssembly. Through his commitment and leadership \nrole, Mr. Treki successfully guided the Assembly in \ndealing effectively with a number of priority issues \nfacing our Organization. \n I also take this opportunity to express our sincere \nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \ndedication and untiring efforts to ensure that our \nOrganization lives up to the purposes and principles of \nthe Charter of the United Nations. His comprehensive \nreport on the work of the Organization (A/65/1) \nindicates in no uncertain terms the progress the United \nNations has made under his leadership and guidance, \nfor which Malta is extremely grateful. \n During the past 12 months, the international \ncommunity has been overwhelmed by the global and \nfinancial crises. The crises have been exacerbated by \nmany humanitarian tragedies around the world. Natural \ndisasters, terrorist attacks, armed violence and internal \nconflicts have continued to produce havoc, destruction, \nloss of life and the increased forced displacement of \npeople worldwide. In the face of these negative \nrealities, our Organization has continued to be the \nrefuge of the most vulnerable and deprived of our \nsocieties, to address increasing inequalities, to respond \ncohesively and rapidly to disasters and calamities, and \nto seek to improve the very nature of the existence and \nsurvival of humankind. It is an accepted norm that \nthere is no development without security, no security \nwithout development, and neither without respect for \nhuman rights. \n Important achievements have been registered in \nrecent months in the area of disarmament and \nnon-proliferation. The new Treaty on Measures for the \nFurther Reduction and Limitation of Strategic \nOffensive Arms, designed to replace the 1991 START I \nagreement and signed in Prague in April by the \nPresidents of the United States and the Russian \nFederation, created the appropriate political momentum \nfor preparing the way for a successful outcome to the \n2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). \n  \n \n10-55264 2 \n \n Malta is particularly pleased that among the \nagreed actions taken by the Conference was the \nendorsement by the NPT States parties of the \nconvening by the Secretary-General, the Russian \nFederation, the United Kingdom and the United States, \nin consultation with the countries of the region, of a \nconference in 2012 to address the establishment in the \nMiddle East of a zone free of nuclear and all other \nweapons of mass destruction. \n The General Assembly\u2019s resolutions recognize \nthat positive developments worldwide, but particularly \nin Europe, the Maghreb and the Middle East, can be \nenhanced by closer Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in \nall spheres. Thirty-five years ago, on 1 August 1975, \nthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in \nEurope \u2014 now the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) \u2014 meeting in Helsinki, \nFinland, adopted the Final Act, incorporating an \nimportant chapter dedicated exclusively to the \nMediterranean that affirmed, among other things, that \nsecurity in the Mediterranean is closely linked to \nEuropean security, as well as to international peace and \nsecurity. \n Malta, a European country but nonetheless \nMediterranean, has worked for many years, and even \nsince becoming a Member of this Organization, \ntowards a Euro Mediterranean foreign policy that \nembraces confidence- and security-building initiatives \nthat further enhance dialogue and understanding in our \nregion. Indeed, my country has been present at the \ncreation of all the Mediterranean forums in existence \ntoday. Through its membership of the European Union, \nMalta has solidified these efforts in a manner that \npromotes the ever-increasing connectedness of the \nEuropean-Mediterranean partnership. \n Today, Malta is the host of the European \nCommission-League of Arab States Liaison Office, \nwhich has formalized relations between the European \nCommission and the Arab world in a way that has \nnever been done before. Indeed, Malta has translated \nits character as an interlocutor with a European identity \nand Mediterranean characteristics into the role of a \npolitical and cultural bridge to our neighbours to the \nNorth and South, and even beyond. \n But our commitment to the Mediterranean \ndimension does not stop there. Malta continues to seize \nevery opportunity to contribute further to this dialogue \nof partners. This has certainly been the case within the \nUnion for the Mediterranean, where Malta has played \nan active part in ensuring that the requisite momentum \nis maintained despite occasional political hurdles. In \nthe institutional domain, Malta has nominated a Deputy \nSecretary-General, an honour accorded to six Union \nmembers. The Maltese Deputy Secretary-General has \nbeen entrusted with the portfolio covering social and \ncivil affairs, an area undoubtedly of vital interest to all \nUnion partners. \n Next month, Malta will host the Mediterranean \nConference of the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe, which will address, from a \nMediterranean perspective, issues currently being \ndebated within the OSCE in the dialogue on the future \nof European security. On 8 and 9 November, Malta will \nbe the venue for the first regional conference for the \nMediterranean of the United Nations Alliance of \nCivilizations. The regional conference is expected to \nadopt a strategy document and an action plan \nexpressing the commitment of the Group of Friends of \nthe Alliance to advancing goals in concrete terms in a \nregion where intercultural dialogue and cooperation \nhave great potential for success in overcoming the big \nchallenges the region faces. \n In the first half of 2011 Malta, a member of the \nWestern Mediterranean Forum since 1991, intends to \nhost the second Summit of Heads of State and \nGovernment of the Forum, known as the 5+5. The \nconvening of the Summit, the second of its kind in \nseven years, should, among other purposes, serve to \nreaffirm the relevance of the 5+5 dialogue in the \ncurrent context. Malta continues to attach great value \nto this informal mechanism as a platform for open and \nfrank discussion between North and South. \n It is also of satisfaction to record the successful \nfirst joint International Meeting in Support of Israeli-\nPalestinian Peace, held in Malta last February, and \norganized by the United Nations Committee on the \nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \nPeople and the Parliamentary Assembly of the \nMediterranean. In this context I would like to \nrecognize the importance of resolution 64/124, adopted \nby the General Assembly in December 2009, whereby \nthe Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean, \nwhose seat is in Malta, was granted observer status and \ninvited to participate in the sessions and work of the \nGeneral Assembly. \n \n \n3 10-55264 \n \n That brings me to an issue that closely involves \nthe Mediterranean region. I am referring to the \nsituation in the Middle East, with the Palestinian \nquestion at its core. Malta joins other Member States in \nwelcoming the decision reached last month between \nthe Israelis and the Palestinians to resume direct \nnegotiations to resolve all permanent status issues. The \nlaunching of direct negotiations on 2 September in \nWashington, D.C., followed by the Sharm el-Sheikh \nand Jerusalem meetings, has renewed the sense of \nurgency and expectation for the resolution of an issue \nthat has been on the international agenda for these last \n62 years. The intense and unstinting efforts made \nduring these past few months by the Quartet, the \nSecretary-General and the Arab League, as well as the \nIsraelis and Palestinians themselves, in addition to the \nvaluable contribution of the United States \nAdministration, have opened new possibilities for the \nemergence of an independent, democratic and viable \nPalestinian State living side by side in peace and \nsecurity with Israel. As a member of the international \ncommunity, Malta will continue to play its part within \nthe United Nations, the European Union and other \ninternational, regional and subregional forums to \nsupport the creation of the right conditions for all \npeoples of the Mediterranean and the Middle East to \nlive in peace and prosperity. \n This year has brought us stark reminders of the \ndevastation and loss of life that we can expect from \nclimate change if it continues unabated. Yet, despite \nsuch warnings, the international community has yet to \nadopt a sufficiently ambitious response strategy that \nwould bind us all to contributing fairly to mitigating \nclimate change, keeping it within manageable limits. \nImportant steps have indeed been taken over the past \ntwo decades, but the great expectations of a decisive \npush forward in Copenhagen last year were not \nrealized. Nevertheless, we must persevere on the road \nahead \u2014 perhaps more pragmatically than \ndramatically. Copenhagen did produce several seeds of \nagreement that can be harvested in Canc\u00fan in \nDecember, where operational decisions could advance \naction on several fronts of broad interest to Member \nStates. \n Integrating the expected climatic impacts into our \nvision of the future is in fact a requirement for all of \nus, large and small. Yet the topic often lingers on the \nsidelines of policymaking. We must give adaptation the \npolitical and economic attention it deserves and ensure \nwell-targeted financial support to vulnerable countries \nor communities most in need of it. I would also like to \nunderline the potential of cooperative action on \nadaptation at regional levels, and it is in this context \nthat Malta is supporting the Mediterranean Climate \nChange Initiative announced by the Prime Minister of \nGreece. \n The protection of the human being continues to \nconstitute a top priority for my country. In this regard, \nwe have witnessed during the past year important \ndevelopments within the United Nations that will \nsignificantly contribute to delivering results for a more \njust world and to putting system-wide coherence into \npractice. We note the progress, small but most \nwelcome, on the discussion on the responsibility to \nprotect. It will be recalled that five years ago, the 2005 \nWorld Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) called for an \nexpansion of the United Nations capabilities for early \nwarning and assessment of possible genocide, war \ncrimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, \nin addition to supporting the establishment of an early \nwarning capability. Malta therefore highly commends \nthe interactive dialogue that took place in July and \ncommends the initiative of the Secretary-General to set \nup a United Nations joint office to deal with the \nprevention of genocide and the wider range of crimes \nand violations covered by the responsibility to protect. \n Another important development has been the \nUnited Nations Global Plan of Action against \nTrafficking in Persons (see resolution 64/293, annex). \nStill another aspect of human trafficking is the \nsmuggling of human beings. The phenomenon of \nillegal immigration, stoked by the greed and callous \noperations of organized criminal groups in the \nMediterranean, is putting at risk the lives of hundreds \nof immigrants on the threshold of Europe. Malta has \nfor some years now been a country of destination, \nattracting a disproportionate influx of illegal \nimmigrants and asylum-seekers. Malta\u2019s need for \nassistance in providing beneficiaries of international \nprotection with a durable solution has been recognized \nby many. While Malta affirms its commitment to \nabiding by its international obligations, at the same \ntime we reiterate our calls on the international \ncommunity to continue to assist us in the process of \nresettling these unfortunate people. \n While not new phenomena, piracy and armed \nrobbery at sea against vessels continue to be an issue of \ngrave concern for international navigation and the \n  \n \n10-55264 4 \n \nsafety of commercial maritime routes. Malta, as one of \nthe leading flag States in the world, is very much \nconcerned about the increase in the frequency and \nferocity of pirate attacks on merchant ships off the \ncoast of Somalia. It is to address that concern that we \nintend to promote a debate within the international \ncommunity on new issues, such as piracy, in the sphere \nof the law of the sea which have cropped up since the \nadoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law \nof the Sea in 1982. \n We intend to launch a fresh and constructive \ndebate among like-minded States on the question of \nhuman responsibilities. Even though we are here \ntreading on ground that may prove to be difficult, we \nbelieve that while the fundamental rights and freedoms \nof the individual form the cornerstone of a free and \ndemocratic society, so do human responsibilities. \nRights and duties are two sides of the same coin. Our \ncommitment to duties should be as firm as that to \nrights. Stressing the rights of society and our duties \ntowards others \u2014 which in no case should overshadow \nour attention to the rights of the individual \u2014 puts \nemphasis on that which keeps society together. Malta \nshall take up this matter to achieve a measure of \nprogress in this field in the international community. \n Before concluding, allow me to pay a tribute in \nmemory to President Guido de Marco, one of my \npredecessors, who as Deputy Prime Minister and \nMinister for Foreign Affairs, and as President of Malta, \nbestowed honour on his country and the people of \nMalta, which he loved dearly. His passing away last \nmonth left a great void not only among the Maltese \npopulation, but also for the many who worked with \nhim for the betterment of those in the international \ncommunity who are oppressed, weak and vulnerable. \n Twenty years ago, this Assembly elected him to \nserve as President at the forty-fifth session. His strong \nbelief in and steadfast support of the United Nations \ncan be encapsulated in his own words at the opening \nplenary of the session on 18 September 1990 when, in \nreferring to the enormous challenges that lay ahead, he \nstated that \n \u201cequally enormous is the political will to \nguarantee that mankind\u2019s destiny is safeguarded \nnot only by individual countries, but by a strong \nUnited Nations\u201d (A/45/PV.1, p. 22). \n His election as President ushered in, among other \nthings, new initiatives for the revitalization of our \nGeneral Assembly \u2014 a legacy that has continued and \ncontinues today. By following Guido de Marco\u2019s vision \nfor and love of the United Nations, my country shall \ncontinue supporting this Organization and its \nSecretary-General to make our world a better place for \npresent and future generations."

        "file_text": "\nMr. President, on behalf of the Government of Yemen, \nI am pleased to express to you our warm \ncongratulations on your assumption of the presidency \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. We \nare confident that your abilities and wisdom, Sir, will \nlead to the success of this session in fulfilment of its \ndesired goal. \n I also wish to refer with appreciation and pride to \nthe good work of Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, the \nprevious President of the General Assembly, and \ncongratulate him for his tireless efforts that led the \nprevious session to a successful conclusion, not the \nleast of which was his participation in the High-level \nPlenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n We also wish to thank His Excellency Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for \nhis continuous efforts to reform our Organization and \nincrease its role in the humanitarian and development \nfields and in the achievement of international peace \nand security. \n The Republic of Yemen is witnessing complex \ndevelopment and political, social and environmental \nchallenges. A number of factors and circumstances \nhave led to their formation, including the international \nfinancial crisis, with its negative effect on the Yemeni \neconomy, and a decline in our progress towards the \nachievement of the MDGs. There is a severe shortage \nof available resources owing to the low production and \nlow price of oil, on which the Government depends as \na main source of income, representing 75 per cent of its \ngeneral income. There has also been a decline in \nremittances from expatriates and in tourism, in addition \n \n \n5 10-55264 \n \nto overpopulation, paucity of water resources, and \nlimited contributions from development partners for \nfunding anti-poverty programmes and providing decent \nstandards of living for our citizens. \n Yemen\u2019s pro rata share of official development \nassistance (ODA) is the lowest of the least developed \ncountries in the world. With a view to achieving \neconomic development and conducting financial and \neconomic reforms, my country has recently concluded \nan agreement with the International Monetary Fund to \nimplement a programme that will lead to financial \nstraightening out of the budget deficit and stem the \nprogressive decline in Government level of support for \nfuel in a manner that would contribute to alleviating \nthe general budgetary burden falling on the State. \n A number of administrative, financial and \njudiciary reforms have been adopted, as have efforts to \ncombat corruption and to apply decentralization of \npower. My Government is now trying to develop its \nfourth five-year development plan for the years 2011-\n2015. We have started a political dialogue with \nopposition parties in order to find agreement on how to \naddress all the challenges faced by Yemen. We have set \nup election laws and introduced a number of \nconstitutional reforms, called for the formation of a \nNational Unity Government, in preparation for \nconducting parliamentary elections next April. \n Last week, there were a number of meetings in \nNew York on a new initiative regarding cooperation \nwith Yemen, under the name of Friends of Yemen. \nParticipants included representatives of the Gulf \nCooperation Council, the European Union, the five \npermanent members of the Security Council, along \nwith Turkey, Jordan and Egypt, as well as international \ndonor funds and institutions. The purpose of the \nmeeting was to garner support for our efforts to \nachieve development and combat extremism, terrorism \nand piracy. We are confident that this cooperation will \nstrengthen our security capabilities to carry out our \ndevelopment plans, reinforce our ability to combat \nterrorism and protect sea lanes in the Gulf of Aden and \nthe southern part of the Red Sea from piracy and \nprotect our borders. \n Among the challenges Yemen has faced are the \ndifficult political developments following a rebellion in \nthe Governorate of Sa\u2019dah, which has complicated the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts at achieving national peace and \nreconstruction. This rebellion, in addition to six wars \nimposed on Yemen, have caused the displacement of \ntens of thousands of citizens and forced the \nestablishment of refugee camps in coordination with \ninternational relief organizations. The conflict came to \nan end once the rebel group accepted the six conditions \nthat the Government posed, including the release of a \ngreat number of prisoners and agreeing to the Doha \nAccords, the time frame and implementation of which, \nas sponsored by sisterly Qatar, we are in the process of \ncarrying out. The Government has responded by \npeacefully reaching out to the rebels, while upholding \nthe principle of sovereignty and the rule of law \nthroughout the country. The country upheld the right to \nconfront any groups that violate the Constitution and \nthe rule of law, or that practise terrorism, violence or \nsabotage. \n My country is also suffering from the terrorist \nactivities of Al-Qaida, which has been carrying out \nnew operations, such as assassinating leaders in our \nsecurity sector. It is trying to entrench its position on \nthe Arabian Peninsula by cooperating with opponents \nto Yemeni unity, such as the southern secessionists, \nwho call for secession in defiance of the will of the \nmajority of the Yemeni people. They also support \nsubversive elements in Sa\u2019dah, in service of the \ninterests of Al-Qaida, and seek to spread instability and \nanarchy in the country through their terrorist activities \ntargeting Yemen, the region and the rest of the world. \n Our security apparatus has managed to make \nheadway in arresting many terrorists and aborting their \noperations. These terrorists now live in a state of fear \nand are unable to carry out their terrorist plans. As a \ncomplement to the efforts to liquidate Al Qaida, there \nremains a pressing and important need to build and \nfoster national abilities and coordinate intelligence and \nsecurity activities. \n Experience has proven that outside interference \ndesigned to combat terrorism further compounds the \nsituation and paves the way for local sympathy for \nterrorist groups. Yemen is an effective partner with the \ninternational community in combating terrorism. Our \nsuccess today in waging pre-emptive strikes against \nAl-Qaida requires that the international community \ntake a strong stand by providing us with its full \nbacking and support. \n Since its assumption of the chairmanship of the \nGroup of 77 and China, the Republic of Yemen has \nenthusiastically and willingly tried to reach consensus \n  \n \n10-55264 6 \n \non a number of issues of interest to the Group and that \nwill maintain the unity and solidarity of the Group and \nfurther its relations with the developed countries. \nRecently, Yemen led the difficult negotiations to arrive \nat the outcome document of the High-level Plenary \nMeeting of the sixty-fifth session of the General \nAssembly on the Millennium Development Goals \n(resolution 65/1), which contains a work programme \nfor the coming five years. Yemen\u2019s leadership of the \nGroup enabled it to achieve much of the South\u2019s \nagenda, which serves the interests of all developing \ncountries. It is leading other, highly complex \nnegotiations on conventions having to do with the \nenvironment and climate change. \n We are proud to have chaired the meetings of the \nGroup of 77 and China on the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change. Our \neffective participation in the work of the relevant \ncommittees has led to a compromise and middle \nground that we hope will lead to the success that has \nthus far remained out of reach. \n We must focus on the suffering of more than \n20 million Pakistanis caused by the recent floods, \ncalling on the international community, particularly the \nsuper-Powers, to shoulder their responsibilities towards \nthe Pakistani people as well as their responsibility \nvis-\u00e0-vis the impact of climate change in the future and \nits potential destructive effects. We call upon all \nMember States to responsibly stand by the sisterly \nGovernment of Pakistan with a view to alleviating the \nsuffering of its internally displaced persons. \n I would like to take this opportunity to extend our \nwarmest condolences to the Governments and peoples \nof States that have recently been affected by natural \ndisasters, particularly Pakistan, China, the Russian \nFederation and Haiti. \n It is, of course, a fact that the Arab-Israeli \nconflict threatens international stability and security. \nThe history of efforts to solve this conflict shows \nclearly that Israeli recalcitrance and the Israeli \nGovernment\u2019s settlement policies, as well as its refusal \nto abide by the internationally legitimate resolutions \nand the Arab Peace Initiative or ensure the legitimate \nrights of the Palestinians are the main barriers to the \nachievement of peace. \n The international community, in particular the \nmain sponsors of the peace talks and especially the \nUnited States, should give Israel one last chance to \nabide by all of the resolutions, previous agreements \nand calls relating to the promulgation of peace in \naddition to the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian \nState on its soil and the cessation of settlement-\nbuilding. Furthermore, if Israel continues to reject \npeace, the Security Council should impose a solution to \nthe conflict in accordance with relevant resolutions of \ninternational legitimacy and under Chapter VII of the \nCharter. Israel must also accede to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and enter into \nserious talks with the International Atomic Energy \nAgency aimed at making the Middle East a region free \nfrom weapons of mass destruction and to assert the \nright of States in the region to the peaceful use of \nnuclear technology. \n Despite the numerous meetings of the Security \nCouncil and the International Contact Group on \nSomalia, the situation in Somalia remains dangerous \nand threatening to the security and stability of the \nregion. It is regrettable that, given the growing piracy \nphenomenon, its expansion and its threat to \ninternational navigation, the international community \nhas not taken effective steps to support the temporary \nSomali Government, enable it to build its State and \ninstitutions, support its security capacity and army and \nsupport the African peacekeeping force. This has made \nthe Somali Government and people feel embittered, \nhaving witnessed the non fulfilment by the \ninternational community of its commitments and \nobligations to the Somali Government. \n Yemen bears the burden of the outflow of \nthousands of refugees from the Horn of Africa, most of \nwhom are from Somalia. We are well aware of the \neffects of the security, political and humanitarian \nsituation in Somalia on Yemen and the region. The \nUnited Nations and the Security Council in particular \nshould shoulder their responsibility to restore security \nand stability to Somalia. \n Here, we acknowledge the efforts of the Sudanese \nGovernment to bring about the success of dialogue \nwith the opposition forces, and we commend the Qatari \nmediation efforts to achieve peace in Darfur and the \nComprehensive Peace Agreement with the South. \nDialogue is the only means to maintain the unity of the \nSudan and achieve security and stability there. We call \nupon all Sudanese parties to shoulder their \nresponsibilities and to effectively participate in the \ndialogue in a manner that fulfils the high national \n \n \n7 10-55264 \n \ninterests of the Sudanese people and retains their social \nintegrity and unity. \n We call for the revocation of the International \nCriminal Court warrant against his Excellency \nPresident Omer Al Bashir, since this does not respect \nthe sovereignty of the State and impedes efforts to \nachieve peace in the Sudan. \n The parliamentary elections in Iraq reflected the \nIraqi people\u2019s support for the democratic option and \nthe Iraqi Constitution. We are confident that they will \nemploy dialogue to solve all of their differences and \navoid all sectarian and factional conflicts and disputes. \nWe are hopeful that the Iraqi national leadership will \nagree to the formation of the Government and put Iraq \non the road towards development, construction and \nstability. \n The Republic of Yemen hosted a ministerial \nmeeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nat the beginning of last month. At that meeting, it was \nreiterated that it was necessary to strengthen \ncooperation among its member States in the fields of \ntrade, investment, tourism, culture and education, \nfisheries; and efforts to combat epidemics, natural \ndisasters, the challenges of climate change and piracy \non the high seas. \n We also hosted the extraordinary ministerial \nmeeting of the Sana\u2019a Forum for Cooperation, \nemphasizing the need to achieve security and stability \nin the Horn of Africa and the south of the Red Sea, and \nto combat extremism, piracy and terrorism in the Horn \nof Africa and the Arabian Sea. \n We have hosted these and other ministerial and \nregional meetings based on our desire to achieve \ncollective cooperation in order to maintain peace and \nsecurity among the peoples of the region and the \nworld, in accordance with the lofty goals of the United \nNations. \n Despite all the appeals to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and the humanitarian \nthemes included in the Goals, the international \nsituation, which has been affected by the financial \ncrisis, the fluctuation of energy prices and natural \ndisasters leading to increases in the price of crops and \nother foodstuffs, has dissuaded developed countries \nfrom fulfilling their obligations to assist and support \nthe least developed countries. There is fear that the \nspecified time frame for achieving the MDGs will pass \nand the developed countries will not fulfil their \nobligations towards the developing and least developed \ncountries. \n In Yemen, we have positively dealt with these \nGoals in accordance with our limited capacity. Our \nGovernment has adopted a national strategy to \neradicate poverty. This has been reflected in our \nnational development plans. We are trying our best, \nwith the cooperation of the international community, to \nimplement this strategy. Our Government has taken a \nnumber of measures to increase the allocation of \nbudgetary funds for education and to build more \nschools as well as to enhance the educational cadres, \ndeveloping primary education, encouraging education \nfor girls and widening the scope of adult illiteracy \nreduction. We are trying to improve gender equality \nand the empowerment of women to participate in \npolitical life. We have provided health care for mothers \nand children, spreading cultural and health awareness. \nThis has led to low infant mortality rates. We have \nconducted health campaigns to eliminate epidemics \nand the spread of AIDS. \n Yemen suffers from scarce water resources and \noverpopulation, which adversely affect the \nsustainability and soundness of the environment. We \nhave therefore made national plans to study the \nsituation, better understand the problems, and protect \nthe environment as part of our national plans for \ndevelopment. \n We have spent a great deal on imposing the rule \nof law and on combating terrorism and other \nsubversive elements. We have taken in more than \n700,000 refugees from the Horn of Africa, which has \nlimited our expenditure on development and poverty \nreduction, on improving the standards of living of our \ncitizens, on providing employment for our youth, on \nimproving education and health care and on the \nachievement of the MDGs. We therefore call on our \nfriends, partners, international donors and international \norganizations and financial institutions to help us \ncombat terrorism. They must fulfil their obligations \nand extend the necessary support to Yemen to help us \nachieve sustainable development and the \nsocio-economic and political stability to which we \naspire. \n"

        "file_text": "On the \ngrand occasion of the general debate of the sixty-fifth \nsession of the General Assembly, I congratulate the \nnew President of the Assembly, Mr. Joseph Deiss, who \nis known for his political skills and wise leadership. I \nwould also like to extend my appreciation to his \npredecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session, for \nthe able manner in which he led our work. I hope this \nsession will end successfully and produce \nrecommendations and resolutions that will serve \nhumanity and the world at large. \n I further thank the Secretary-General for his \nstrong and genuine interest in and commitment to \naddressing the critical international issues facing the \nworld, and Somalia in particular. \n This annual gathering brings together world \nleaders and their representatives in order to highlight \npositive and praiseworthy accomplishments and \ndevelopments, and to identify common global \nchallenges, emerging problems and their causes, and \nconsequently to discuss and seek appropriate solutions \nfor them. \n This meeting comes at a critical moment, when \nour contemporary world faces a series of challenges \nranging from economic crises to natural disasters and \nbloody wars that threaten international peace and \nstability, as well as other international issues that \nrequire timely resolutions and serious work from the \n  \n \n10-55103 18 \n \nGeneral Assembly to design strategies to avoid them in \nthe future. \n In our world today, known for its technological \nadvancement and modern science, we are confronted \nby many challenges resulting from climate change, \nglobal warming and their effects, such as devastating \nfloods, drought, forest fires, landslides, desertification, \nearthquakes, snow storms and so on. Such \nenvironmental problems have occurred recently in \nmany countries, including the violent floods in \nPakistan and China and the destructive forest fires in \nRussia, alongside other problems worldwide. We feel \ngreat compassion for the countries affected by these \nnatural disasters, and we must cooperate with and \nprovide them the assistance they need while we express \nour grief and condolences for their suffering. \n A few centuries ago, the peoples of the world \nsuffered from the horror of colonial slavery, injustice \nand oppressive cultures in which the strong preyed on \nthe weak, as well as from horrific wars that spared \nnothing. It was through the collective will of victorious \nnations around the world that this fine institution was \nestablished in 1945 in order to ensure lasting peace and \nsecurity and to protect human rights, the sovereignty of \nnations and the rights of people to self-determination, \nas well as justice, freedom of thought and expression. \n However, 65 years since its inception, we must \nask ourselves whether the world is more secure or \nnations are more at peace with one another. Has \nhumankind attained its ambition of a good life, \ndevelopment and sustainable prosperity? The answer, \nclearly, is no. We see destructive wars being fought \nthroughout the world, causing the suffering of millions, \nas well as the horrors of global terrorism, especially in \nthe developing world. \n Somalia is the weaker link in this scenario and \ntherefore suffers from the worst kinds of international \nterrorism perpetrated, inter alia, by Al-Shabaab, \nAl-Qaida and the foreign criminal elements supporting \nthem. Al-Qaida boasted of its responsibility for the \nhorrible acts that occurred in Mogadishu on \n3 December 2009 at the Benadir University graduation \nceremony, where many graduating doctors died at a \ntime when the country needed them most. Professors, \nministers, families and guests also died at that \nceremony. \n Other heinous acts include the explosion at the \nMuna Hotel, the African Union headquarters in \nMogadishu, as well as the explosion in Kampala, \nUganda, which killed over 70 innocent people who had \ncome to watch the World Cup match that was then \ntaking place in South Africa. \n These beastly massacres carried out by \nAl-Shabaab and Al-Qaida terrorists turn the stomach of \nany person with a conscience. This movement carries \nout such acts in Mogadishu and other Somali cities on \na daily basis, in plain public sight and in places of \nworship, killing Somali civilians, hacking off their \nlimbs, hands and ears and cutting their throats. It has \nalso carried out unspeakable crimes against humanity, \nsuch as cutting off the heads of victims and disposing \nof them somewhere else. It has also committed rape \nand theft and caused great damage to property. \n This movement does not believe in Somalia as a \nnation and does not support the creation of a national \nGovernment in Somalia; rather, it seeks to establish the \nHorn of Africa as a terrorist hub that is managed by its \nAl-Qaida partners and whose intention is to wreak \nhavoc on the entire region and the world beyond. \n Besides terrorism on land, another type of \nterrorism \u2014 piracy, perpetrated by pirates and \nextremist movements in the Red Sea and the Indian \nOcean \u2014 threatens navigation and sea trade. Maritime \nterrorism is no less dangerous than land-based \nterrorism; many United Nations Member States have \nhad their ships hijacked by pirates who attack merchant \nor passenger vessels and then blackmail them and \ndemand millions in ransom. While military convoys \nattempt to protect shipping in the Indian Ocean, they \nare unable to uproot this ongoing threat or eliminate its \nroot causes. \n There is a close connection between those pirates \nand armed extremist elements in Somalia. Such ships \ncan be destroyed at any time and their crews killed \nrather than be held for ransom. All of this, again, \nrequires a solution to the problems in Somalia, because \nthe root causes of these problems lie not at sea but on \nland. No partial solution to the problems of Somalia \ncan succeed no matter how strong and effective it is; \nonly a comprehensive solution of these problems will \nwork.\n \n19 10-55103 \n \n I would also like to draw attention to a \nphenomenon even more dangerous to the Somalis in \nthe long term than piracy. This is illegal fishing and the \ndumping of toxic waste along the Somali coast, which \nharm the health of Somalia\u2019s citizens and its \nenvironment. We have already begun to see symptoms \nand illnesses that did not previously exist in Somalia. \n One function of the General Assembly is to deal \nwith hotbeds of tension and threats to international \npeace and security. I therefore appeal to world leaders \nto stand together in confronting the threat of \ninternational terrorism, including Al-Qaida and \nAl-Shabaab, as well as organized crime. We must \neliminate this scourge so that it will not expand and \nworsen, and bear in mind that any delay or compromise \nwill provide further opportunities for terrorism, \nprolong its life and allow it to spread. Beyond this, we \nneed to solve the political, economic and social root \ncauses of terrorism locally, regionally and \ninternationally. \n After many years of dispute and conflict, the \nSomali parties met in Djibouti and reached an \nagreement, endorsed by the international community, \nthat led to the creation of a broad-based national \nGovernment that included all the conflicting parties \nwho participated in the Djibouti peace conference. This \nGovernment has inherited a heavy burden and many \nchallenges and obstacles, but it has managed to \nshoulder those responsibilities. However, it continues \nto wage a bitter struggle against such hostile elements \nas Al-Qaida and its allies, Al-Shabaab and Hizbul \nIslam. \n Here, we should note that the Transitional Federal \nGovernment (TFG), while only in its second year, has \nmanaged to counter and repel these enemy attacks and \nto achieve reconciliation and several agreements with \nmembers of Hizbul Islam and Ahlu Sunna Wal Jama\u2019a. \nThus the TFG has achieved some success in its goals, \nespecially following its recent ministerial change, \nwhich brought in members of Ahlu Sunna Wal Jama\u2019a, \nwho have been assigned important ministerial positions \nin the new Government. I note that the national \nreconciliation achieved in Djibouti remains a strategic \nchoice for us, and we reach out to all those who desire \npeace and security in Somalia. \n We have also formed strategic plans in the areas \nof politics, security and social reform. We must \nproduce a public budget for 2010 that covers \neconomic, political and social affairs and State \nmanagement expenses, as well as reconstruction. We \nmust rehabilitate Government ministries and \ninstitutions and economic structures, such as the \ncentral bank, and encourage a free-market economy. \nWe must provide food and humanitarian assistance to \nthe needy and those displaced by river floodings, \ndrought or desertification. This plan has been \nparticularly difficult to implement because the \nAl-Shabaab movement has blocked the distribution of \nhumanitarian aid and food to the areas it controls, and \nhas raided and stolen from aid organizations and \nhijacked vehicles carrying food intended for the \nhungry. \n We must further create opportunities to empower \nyoung people to play leadership roles, and furnish them \nwith the skills necessary to manage Government \ninstitutions. We need to increase the skills and abilities \nof Government employees and foster a spirit of \nsacrifice for the homeland and devotion to work and \ntransparency in conducting the country\u2019s business. We \nmust build capacity in the security sector and train \npolice and security forces to protect the Somali people \nand their independence and territorial integrity. We \nneed to prepare a permanent constitution that can serve \nas the foundation for law, democracy and the guarantee \nof basic human freedoms. The constitution will be \nsubmitted for a referendum so that it can be applied as \nsoon as possible. We must revitalize our judicial \ninstitutions and train judges and legal assistants, as \nwell as reconstruct and rehabilitate support centres \nsuch as police stations, criminal courts and prisons. We \nshould create an environment conducive to dialogue, \nreconciliation, negotiation and collective work, and \nhalt the continuing violence in Somalia, which has \nlasted more than two decades now, so that peace and \nsecurity can be restored. Finally, we must end the \ninternal disputes that continue to erupt within our \nnational institutions \u2014 for instance, among members \nof Parliament \u2014 and resolve them peacefully. \n These are but a few of the issues that we have \nselected from among the many on which our strategic \nplans are focused. However, a shortage of funds, \nresources and expertise hinders the TFG from \nimplementing many of them. From this rostrum, I \nappeal to the world\u2019s leaders and the international \ncommunity to continue to come forward to help us stop \nthe bloodshed in Somalia and to provide us with the \n  \n \n10-55103 20 \n \nemergency assistance necessary to save our citizens \nand Government, especially in the following areas. \n First, in the field of security, the Somali security \nforces need to be armed and trained in an effective way \nso that they are capable of taking the security initiative \nin their country, and provided with the salaries and \nhealth care they need if they are to protect citizens and \nestablish Government authority throughout the country. \n Second, the African Union forces in Somalia \nmust be strengthened and reinforced by the addition of \nnew forces. \n Third, a military strategy must be designed and \nimplemented by the United Nations, including the \ndispatch of an international force to Somalia with the \npurpose of restoring security and stability throughout \nthe country. \n Fourth, the Security Council should adopt \nresolutions aimed at saving Somalia and liberating it \nfrom Al-Qaida and any other terrorist movements that \nconspire against the restoration of peace and security \nthere. On the political front, we would also ask for \ncontinued United Nations support for the TFG, \nallowing it to remain a focal point for reconciliation \nbetween the various parties in Somalia and the \ninternational community. The TFG should also be \ngiven the support it needs to discharge its duties and \nmanage its budget, so that it can stand on its own two \nfeet and carry out its economic projects and extend its \nauthority throughout the country. \n Fifth, the Somali Government should be assisted \nin rebuilding the infrastructure that was destroyed in \nthe civil wars. \n Sixth, the international community should \nparticipate and assist in the reconstruction and \nrehabilitation of Somali State institutions, such as \nschools, hospitals and educational centres. \n Seventh, the Somali economy must be promoted \nand its faltering institutions developed. \n Finally, I would like to extend my gratitude to the \ninternational community for its assiduous efforts to \nrestore peace and stability in Somalia. Nevertheless, I \nwould like to point out that all that has been offered to \ndate is still not commensurate with what Somalia \ndeserves. Somalia is a country that has lost everything, \nincluding its State infrastructure. We hope that the \ninternational community will assume its humanitarian \nresponsibility towards our country and assist in ending \nits suffering, which has now entered its twenty-first \nyear. It is also our hope that the international \ncommunity will fulfil its promises and turn its \nresolutions and recommendations \u2014 past and \npresent \u2014 into actual, implementable deeds. \n I would especially like to thank the Governments \nof Uganda and Burundi, which have sent their troops to \nSomalia to bring peace to the situation there. I would \nalso like to thank the Governments of the United States \nof America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain \nand Northern Ireland, the European Union and the \nbrotherly Arab States, as well as the African Union, all \nof which have contributed to security and stability in \nmy country. Our thanks also go to the international and \nregional organizations, including the United Nations, \nfor their support. We hope that we will all succeed in \nrestoring security and stability very soon because the \ncontinued suffering of the Somali people is \nunacceptable. \n In conclusion, I pray to God that the efforts of \nthis session of the General Assembly will be crowned \nwith success and that Somalia will attend the next \nsession having resolved its chronic crisis."

        "file_text": "I would like to \ncongratulate Mr. Deiss again on his assumption of the \npresidency of the General Assembly at the sixty-fifth \nsession and, on behalf of the Jamaican delegation, to \nassure him of our full cooperation in the ambitious \nundertaking on which he has embarked. I extend \nJamaica\u2019s appreciation to his predecessor, His \nExcellency Mr. Ali Treki, for so ably guiding the \nproceedings of the sixty-fourth session of the \nAssembly. \n We come to the Hall of this great institution as \npartners. It is the only organization of its kind, where \ncountries of the world, no matter how rich or poor, big \nor small, powerful or weak, sit at the same table, joined \ntogether by the principle of the sovereign equality of \nall its Members. \n As leaders, we are privileged to be the custodians \nof the world, mandated to secure for its people a just \nand peaceful existence and to enable them to achieve \nhappiness and prosperity. We come with differing \nperspectives, shaped by our own experiences and the \npeculiar challenges we face. But we have long \nrecognized that however unique our individual \ncircumstances may appear, they are all affected by our \ninterdependence. \n The impact of climate change shows that we all \nlive under the same canopy. Diseases that can devastate \nwhole populations know no boundaries and require no \n  \n \n10-55122 16 \n \nentry permit. Natural disasters are indiscriminate in the \nselection of their targets. The financial crisis on Wall \nStreet did not disrupt just the American economy; it \nricocheted across the world, affecting millions of \npeople who do not even know where Wall Street is. \nCommunications technology has rendered us \nneighbours in the same village, for no matter how vast \nthe oceans that separate us or the continents over which \nwe are scattered, we are affected or influenced for good \nor bad by each other. \n It is in that in mutuality, that interconnectedness \nand interdependency, with all our commonality and \ndiversity, that we find both our strengths and our \nweaknesses. We have seen those strengths at work and \nwhat they can accomplish, the positive difference we \ncan make when we surmount our differences and find \ncommon purpose in preventing wars and securing \npeace, in safeguarding human rights and promoting \nhuman development. And we recognize our \nweaknesses, our failure so often to raise our lowest \ncommon denominator to a level where consensus can \nmore readily be found and action galvanized. \n We cannot afford to ignore the cynics who feel \nthat we should have done more, for there is more that \nneeds to be done. Some age-old problems still remain, \nand new challenges have emerged that threaten to \nundermine the achievements we have already made. \nWe refuse to accept that after 65 years of our existence, \n1.5 billion people \u2014 1.5 billion \u2014 should have to live \nin poverty and more than 1 billion suffer the pangs of \nhunger. \n The playing field of the world is still not level, \nbecause the equality of our sovereignty has not been \nmatched by the equality of opportunity. Now global \nwarming, terrorism and transnational organized crime \npose new threats to the peace, security and progress of \nthe world. \n The heavy agenda set for the sixty-fifth session \nreflects the scope and complexity of the issues that \nconfront us. Each of us approaches that agenda with a \ndifferent set of priorities. Yet there are some issues that \nare so broad in their implications that they demand \nfrom us special and urgent attention. They manifest \nthemselves in the stark reality of our existence: 20 per \ncent of the world\u2019s population enjoys 75 per cent of the \nworld\u2019s income, and 15 per cent of the world\u2019s \npopulation lives on less than 1 per cent of the world\u2019s \nincome. We come here as equals, but when we go back \nhome some are vastly more equal than others. \n It is easy to blame that on the injustices of the \ndistant past, the neo-colonialism of the more recent \npast or the Washington consensus of the present. That \nis only part of the story. \n Developing countries struggling with poverty and \nunderdevelopment must accept our share of the blame. \nWe must recognize that there is a lot that we can and \nmust do for ourselves. Each of us must adopt and \npursue with fixity of purpose the appropriate economic \nand social policies and good governance practices. We \nmust be prepared to take the tough decisions that are so \noften necessary to secure the advancement of our \npeople, and we must never squander the sacrifices we \ncall on them to make. President Obama was right when \nhe declared at the High-level Plenary Meeting last \nWednesday (see ) that each of us must \nassume leadership of our own transformation even \nwhile requiring the support of the international \ncommunity. \n The existing international financial system and \nmultilateral trading arrangements will not enable us to \nredress those imbalances. They have not done so up to \nnow, and they are unlikely to do so in the future. \nMarket forces and competitiveness are indispensable \nfor economic development, but the new millennium \ncannot be defined by the survival of the fittest. We \nmust make it our business to assist the weak to become \nfit in order not just to survive but to prosper. \n For almost a decade we have been trying to \nconclude the Doha Round in order to put in place a \nregime that facilitates the expansion of trade, which is \nso vital to increasing global prosperity. Redressing the \nlopsidedness in international trade is necessary if we \nare to restore and sustain global economic growth. It is \njust common sense that if one part of the world is not \nable to export more to the rest of the world, it will not \nbe able to import more from that other part of the \nworld. It may do so for a time by borrowing from that \nother part of the world in order to pay for its imports, \nbut that is a bubble that will eventually burst. Many \ncountries have seen that bubble burst in the recent \nglobal crisis. \n We insist that Doha must include a development \ndimension to build competitiveness and capacity in \nweak exporting countries, as well as special and \ndifferential treatment calibrated to our differing levels \n \n \n17 10-55122 \n \nof development, economic size and vulnerabilities. \nThat offers a win-win situation: more exports from \ndeveloping countries mean that there will be more jobs \nfor their people and more demand for imports from \nother countries. \n We urge that every effort be made to conclude the \nDoha Round in that spirit, and we urge, further, that the \ngains already accrued to developing countries in earlier \nnegotiations not be unravelled. The global financial \ncrisis exposed weaknesses in governance of the \ninternational financial system, weaknesses that have \nbecome more acute with changes in the global \nlandscape and shifts in the centre of gravity of the \nworld\u2019s economy. \n We endorse the need for reform of the \ninternational financial institutions, in order to improve \nstandards of efficiency and accountability, and the \ncreation of a more democratic structure, one that will \nallow developing countries a greater voice. \n In the same vein, while we welcome the \nestablishment of the Group of 20 as the locus of global \neconomic policymaking, we urge that it institute a \nmechanism to engage the views of the wider, \ndeveloping world. It is also important to establish a \nclose working relationship with the United Nations to \nensure complementarity with the role of the United \nNations in economic development as mandated under \nits Charter. \n We urge also that the multilateral agencies move \nbeyond what is now the paramount objective: to ensure \nthat the international payments system is secure. The \nfinancial assistance provided to many countries during \nthis time of stress, necessary and welcome though it is, \nis rooted in policies that are contractionary, designed to \nconsolidate and stabilize even at the cost of increasing \npoverty and social dislocation. \n We have hardly learned from the experiences of \nthe past. The gains made towards achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals are being eroded and \nour ability to recover from the global shocks is being \nstymied. Bold new thinking is required, thinking that \nplaces development as the primary focus of multilateral \nintervention. We know we must make sacrifices, but let \nthose sacrifices be an investment for our future, not \njust a tourniquet for our immediate dilemma. \n We too are disappointed that the climate change \nsummit in Copenhagen failed to reach consensus on \nmitigation and adaptation strategies. While the \nCopenhagen Accord did not deliver the comprehensive \nagreement we had hoped for, it nonetheless provided \npolitical impetus for negotiations towards a binding \nagreement for the second commitment period under the \nKyoto Protocol. We are hopeful that the Canc\u00fan \nmeeting in November and December will further \nadvance the process that will eventually lead to a \nlegally binding and comprehensive agreement under \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange and the Bali Road Map. \n With member countries that are among the most \nvulnerable to global warming, the Caribbean \nCommunity (CARICOM) and its partners in the \nAlliance of Small Island States will continue to defend \nthe long-term stabilization of greenhouse gas \nconcentrations with a cap of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial \nlevels. The 2\u00b0C threshold being advanced by some \nwould be catastrophic for countries in our region and \nlow-lying small island States in general, and we appeal \nto all our partners to coalesce around a temperature \nthreshold that would preserve the viability of the most \nvulnerable countries \u2014 as was underscored a few days \nago during the high-level five-year review of the \nMauritius Strategy. The commitment by developed \ncountries to provide $30 billion in new funding to \nassist developing countries to improve mitigation and \nadaptation strategies over the next two years offers an \nopportunity to prove the cynics wrong, to demonstrate \nthat when we speak, we say what we mean and mean \nwhat we say. \n The catastrophic earthquake in Haiti in January of \nthis year and the recent disastrous floods in Pakistan \nare stark reminders of the increasing vulnerability of \nmany countries and regions to natural disasters. We \nwere shocked by the immensity of the impact of those \ndisasters and saddened by the loss of life, the suffering \nand the destruction of property and infrastructure. We \nexpress our solidarity with the Governments and \npeople of both Haiti and Pakistan. \n The reconstruction of Haiti is CARICOM\u2019s most \nurgent priority. We commend the international \ncommunity for committing almost $10 billion from 57 \ndonor countries and organizations. However, we \nimpress upon them the urgency with which actions \nmust follow those commitments, especially in \nstrengthening the institutional capacity of Haiti to \nundertake the mammoth task at hand. The Haitian \npeople have suffered too much for too long. We have a \n  \n \n10-55122 18 \n \nduty to help them to make a fresh start and to embark \non the journey of lasting progress and development. \nWe underscore the important role of the United Nations \nStabilization Mission in Haiti in helping to foster the \nenvironment necessary to ensure a sustainable future \nfor the Haitian people. \n The danger to international peace and security of \nnuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism must remain \nat the top of the international security agenda. We are \nencouraged by the 2010 Review Conference of the \nNon-Proliferation Treaty in June, which elaborated on \nmeasures toward a nuclear-weapon-free world and the \nstrengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. \nWe have no doubt that the new START treaty, signed \nbetween Russia and the United States of America in \nApril of this year, was a contributing factor. We look \nforward to the ratification and entry into force of that \ntreaty between those two States, which together \npossess more than 90 per cent of the world\u2019s nuclear \narsenal. Their faithful compliance with the treaty and \ntheir commitment to greater transparency in achieving \nfurther reductions will secure our hope for eventual \nnuclear disarmament. \n We are also encouraged by the resumption of \ntalks between Israel and Palestine. It offers renewed \nhope for a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the \nMiddle East, one that guarantees the security of Israel \nand the unquestioned recognition of a Palestinian State. \nWe urge both sides to ensure that this renewed hope \ndoes not turn into despair. \n Latin America and the Caribbean are faced with \nthe twin menace of the illicit trade in narcotic drugs \nand small arms. The open borders in the Caribbean \nmake us an easy conduit for trans-shipment between \nthe major sources and destinations of illicit drugs. The \nattendant crime and violence constitute a major threat \nto national development because they create instability \nand compel us to divert scarce resources to tackle this \nscourge. \n Jamaica has adopted a multifaceted approach to \ntackle crime and violence, relying not only on law \nenforcement but on strategic social intervention and \nsocial transformation initiatives to create new \nopportunities and inspire hope, especially among our \nyoung people, who are vulnerable to being recruited or \nconscripted into criminal enterprises. \n However, we cannot do it alone. The \ntransnational nature of organized crime requires cross-\nborder collaboration at the bilateral, regional and \ninternational levels if we are to combat the illegal trade \nand to tackle with equal vigour the supply, transit and \ndemand sides of the international drug trade. The \nrecent high-level meeting on transnational organized \ncrime and the Fourth Biennial Meeting of States on \nSmall Arms and Light Weapons were instrumental in \nreinforcing the need for the implementation of \nmeasures to curtail the growing threat. Those efforts \nwould be strengthened by the conclusion of a legally \nbinding instrument to curtail the illicit trade in small \narms and light weapons and ammunition, and we urge \nthe United Nations to approach this troubling issue \nwith the urgency that it deserves. \n International institutions cannot retain their \nlegitimacy if they do not adapt to changing times and \nthe new configuration of the international community. \nThe United Nations Security Council cannot be exempt \nfrom that process. Fundamental reform is required to \naddress the existing imbalances in the current power \nstructure of the Council and to secure expansion in \nboth categories of membership in order to correctly \nreflect the contemporary global realities. \n In advancing the discussions on system-wide \ncoherence, we support the need to improve the \noperations of the United Nations at the country level to \nensure that the system can appropriately respond to the \nneeds of recipient countries and to prevent the \nunnecessary imposition of undue conditionalities. In \nthis context, we laud the establishment of the United \nNations Entity for Gender Equality and the \nEmpowerment of Women (UN Women), and we \ncongratulate former President of Chile Mrs. Michelle \nBachelet on her appointment as head of UN Women. I \nam confident that under her leadership significant \nprogress will be made to achieve the goals of gender \nequality and to meet the special needs of women and \ngirls worldwide. \n We must not allow ourselves to be imprisoned by \nour past but even as we look to the future we dare not \nignore the experiences that have shaped our present \ncondition. The transatlantic slave trade to which \nmillions of Africans fell victim was one such epoch. \nCARICOM States are therefore pleased that our \ninitiative to have erected a permanent memorial to \nhonour the victims of slavery has won the support of \nthe United Nations community, in keeping with the \nmandate of the 2001 World Conference against \nRacism. We commend UNESCO for its decision to \n \n \n19 10-55122 \n \nlaunch an international competition for the design of \nthis monument. \n Jamaica reaffirms its confidence in the United \nNations as the indispensable forum for our collective \ndeliberations aimed at addressing the major challenges \nconfronting our world. We must take pride in our \nachievements, but we must always be mindful that our \nmission is not yet accomplished. We must never tire, \neven when burdened with frustration. Our impatience \nmust be turned into renewed energy. Into our hands has \nbeen entrusted the responsibility to make this world a \nbetter place for all of mankind to live, prosper and \nenjoy happiness. That is what they expect of us. That is \nwhat they deserve, and that is what we must do \neverything in our power to deliver. \n"

        "file_text": "The \ndelegation of Senegal welcomes the election of \nMr. Joseph Deiss to lead the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fifth session. We are aware of his personal \nqualities and are confident that his presidency will bear \nthe hallmark of his country\u2019s traditional neutrality. I \nwarmly congratulate him and wish him every success. \n I would also like to pay homage to Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki for his outstanding work in guiding \nthe work of the Assembly\u2019s sixty-fourth session. I also \nexpress our great gratitude to our Secretary-General, \nBan Ki-moon, for his tireless devotion to his delicate \ntask in the service of our common ideals. \n The state of the world has improved little since \nthe Assembly\u2019s last session. We continue to face the \nsame urgent issues: the ongoing economic crisis and \ncontinued environmental degradation. Unfortunately, \nwith regard to the latter, the Copenhagen Conference \nwas unable to provide a satisfactory response \u2014 not \nbecause of a lack of will, but rather because the \nquestion has been inappropriately framed, as I said at \nthat meeting. To that list we must add persistent issues \nsuch as transnational organized crime, international \nterrorism and illicit drug trafficking. \n As we meet here to consider and act together on \nthose major challenges, we are giving hope to our \npeople with regard to finding concerted answers to \nthose many and complex problems, which no country \ncan face alone. It is therefore altogether fitting that we \nturn to the world Organization to find a collective \nresponse, or at least to exchange experiences.  \n The theme of the Assembly\u2019s sixty-fifth \nsession \u2014 \u201cReaffirming the central role of the United \nNations in global governance\u201d \u2014 is therefore quite \ntimely. Perhaps we ourselves have been tardy in \nlaunching this debate. In my view, it is not a matter of \ndetermining whether the Organization has contributed \nto improving global governance, but rather a question \nof how to make its efforts more useful and effective in \nthe face of the unprecedented upheavals that the world \nhas experienced in recent years.  \n International relations have accelerated \nconsiderably in a very short time. Much of what was \ntaken as certain is no longer true and accepted notions \nhave been shaken. What we call the established order \nhas been turned on its head by the emergence of new \nforces arising from globalization and economic \ncompetition.  \n The changes that have taken place call for a new \nstate of mind and another way of perceiving and \nmanaging world affairs by adapting the system to the \nnew realities of the twenty-first century. Are we \nprepared to define a new world order in which Africa \nand emerging Powers fully play the role that the \nongoing changes are conferring upon them? The \nanswers we provide on those issues will depend, at \nleast in part, on the role of the Organization in global \ngovernance. \n \n \n13 10-54959 \n \n After 65 years of existence, the United Nations \nsystem continues to bear the legacy of a bygone \nhistorical era, with the Charter of the United Nations \nitself bearing post-war stigmas and colonial prejudices. \nFor instance, the Charter still refers to the idea of an \nenemy State, in the sense of a Power defeated in war. \nAlso, Article 38 of the Statute of the International \nCourt of Justice refers to general principles of law \nrecognized by civilized nations \u2014 as if uncivilized \nnations still existed. In themselves, such anachronisms \nfrom another time demonstrate the need to reform the \nsystem. \n Moreover, the nature of the issues now addressed \nby the Organization has become quite diverse, just as \nits composition and the volume of is work have \nincreased considerably, while some of its mechanisms, \nincluding that for collective security, have remained \nnearly unchanged.  \n In 1945 the Organization had 51 Members; today \nit has 192. The composition of the Security Council, a \nbody which is supposed to reflect the will of Member \nStates, has been altered only once, in 1965, when the \nnumber of seats increased from 11 to 15 with the \ninclusion of additional non-permanent seats. And \n17 years since we began negotiations on the Council\u2019s \nreform, there are still no prospects for consensus.  \n Maintaining the status quo at all costs means \nignoring the radical changes that have taken place in \nthe world, thereby making the Council susceptible to \ngreater mistrust, defiance and criticism. That inertia \nmay prove to be dangerous owing to the lack of \nrepresentation, legitimacy and credibility that could \nresult. If today many of the Council\u2019s decisions are \nbeing called into question and not properly \nimplemented, it is because they are perceived by the \ngreat majority of Member States as being more \nexpressions of national interest than the carrying out of \na mandate on behalf of the community of nations.  \n I am not personally in agreement with the \neminent observer of the United Nations who has \nwritten that \u201cthe organization of the Security Council \nbelongs to the nineteenth century\u201d. I believe that it \nbears the hallmark of our times, but it needs to be \nimproved and delivered of its shortcomings.  \n How can we preserve a credible role in global \ngovernance for the Organization if Africa \u2014 which \nmakes up more than a fourth of its Members and \naccounts for more than 70 per cent of the issues on the \nagenda \u2014 does not have a permanent seat on the \nSecurity Council? Several years ago in this Hall, in \norder to put an end to that anomaly and to right an \nhistoric injustice, Senegal proposed that \u2014 \nindependent of the ongoing reform, which will take \ntime, given that it began 17 years ago \u2014 Africa be \ngiven a permanent seat with veto power.   \n Meanwhile, the same grievances that have been \nlevelled against the Security Council have also been \nraised with regard to international criminal justice. \nTwelve years ago, the common need for international \ncriminal justice that was universal, permanent and \nneutral led to the establishment of the International \nCriminal Court (ICC) to complement national \njurisdictions in punishing and preventing the most \nserious crimes.  \n Because Senegal has faith in the ideals of peace \nand justice for all, it reiterates its commitment to the \nCourt. It was the first country to ratify its Statute, on \n2 February 1999. Nevertheless, the Court will never be \ncredible if the President of the Sudan is the only one to \nbe pursued, with suspect eagerness.  \n While the setting up of the ICC represents a \nsignificant advance in the fight against impunity, it is \nin its practice that the Court itself will be judged. And \nfor that practice to be free of suspicion and \nquestioning, we must ensure that it reflects the \nprinciples agreed by the United Nations with regard to \nhuman rights: universality, objectivity, non-selectivity \nand impartiality. On the basis of those principles, the \nCourt should deal with all situations within its \njurisdiction in the same way, whoever the perpetrators \nand whatever their nationality. \n Given the deep and multifaceted crisis, global \neconomic governance remains a pertinent issue. \nConsultative frameworks such as the Group of Eight \n(G-8) and the Group of Twenty (G-20) are trying to \naddress it in order to lay the foundations for a new \nworld order. Those efforts are praiseworthy.  \n Today, there are a number of us who would like \nto establish an independent circle of very high-level \nspecialists so as to put ourselves upstream of the G-8 \nand the G-20 and to provide heads of State and \nGovernment with our thinking on the topics that they \nare considering. We would even like to go beyond the \ntechnical nature and address more fundamental issues. \nThe job of setting all that up has been entrusted to me, \nand I am dedicating myself to the task. \n  \n \n10-54959 14 \n \n With regard to the unchecked increase in the \nprice of oil, which penalizes non-producing countries, I \nhave already proposed a mechanism that would make it \npossible to bring together the corporate superprofits, \nthe income of producing countries and the surcharges \non non-producing countries, to serve as the basis for a \npolicy which I call \u201coil against poverty\u201d, using a fund \nfinanced by the contributions of the first two \ncategories, which share the oil revenues. \n In order to parry the fierce rise in agricultural \nprices, I suggest that we consider that issue again at a \nconference in Dakar \u2014 the second Dakar Agricultural \nFair. We propose a mechanism that fully integrates \nproducers in order to establish world governance of \nagricultural prices, taking into account the interests of \nproducers and consumers. That will be the aim of the \nconference, which will be held in our capital in January \nand February 2011. \n In the same spirit, we continue to contribute to \nefforts to protect the environment, in particular in the \ncontext of the project to build the Great Green Wall. It \nis a barrier of trees the length of the Sahel-Saharan \nregion, from Dakar to Djibouti, 7,000 kilometres long \nby 15 kilometres wide, and that project is already being \nimplemented. It has earned us the support of the Global \nEnvironment Facility, which has granted the countries \ninvolved the sum of $119 million. \n With regard to the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs), the assessment that the Assembly\u2019s \nHigh-level Plenary Meeting has just made clearly \nshows that, despite our progress, we must remain \nmobilized in order to meet the agreed commitments by \nthe 2015 deadline.  \n In Senegal, thanks to the national assessment that \nwe carried out last May, we have gauged the work to \nbe done by 2015. Our main conclusion is that a \nquantitative approach that sees development only in \nterms of money is insufficient. We must show more \ncreativity and more imagination in our own country. \nFor its part, Senegal has implemented the following \ninnovations.  \n First is the GOANA Strategy \u2014 the Great \nAgricultural Offensive for Food and Abundance, which \nenabled us to go from an importer of food products in \n2008 to self-sufficiency and even net exporter in 2010.  \n We have introduced the Neighbourhood \nGodmother initiative, which empowers women in the \nfight against maternal and child mortality so as to \nspeed up implementation of the MDGs related to \nhealth. It is based on the sociology of our African \nsocieties. In every neighbourhood or village, there is \nalways a woman who is the focus of all the others, and, \nby giving her a role, we empower her to watch over the \npregnant women and attend to them, even at the child\u2019s \nbirth. That requires only very little equipment, such as \na mobile phone. That supervision, we believe, will \nmake it possible to reduce maternal and child mortality.  \n Next is the Modern Daras initiative \u2014 daras \nmeans studying in Arabic \u2014 which introduces the \nteaching of Arabic, French and English and vocational \ntraining in madrasas in order to progress towards the \ncomplete disappearance of those students who graduate \nfrom madrasas very learned and able to recite the \nKoran, but who are jobless. That initiative is supported \nby Senegal\u2019s religious leaders. And we simply think \nthat it is possible to provide children with spiritual \ntraining and further education at the same time. We \nhave introduced Christian and Muslim religious \neducation into schools. \n Another initiative is the scheme to allocate 40 per \ncent of the national budget to education and training in \norder to ensure sufficient quality human resources, able \nto take up the challenge of development. If I am not \nmistaken, Senegal is the only country to have agreed to \nthat sacrifice \u2014 to put 40 per cent of the budget into \neducation.  \n The Bac Minus One initiative means that we take \nthe young people who have failed the baccalaureate \nexamination and have them help school teachers \npromote primary education, in order to address the \ncriterion of universal primary education.  \n Naturally, we have launched a policy to promote \nrural women. Today there are facilities that enable \nthem to retain the added value that was previously in \nthe hands of factories and producers, that is to say, \nthose who control the money.  \n We have also proposed a new definition of \npoverty, which is not the fact of having less than $1 a \nday. Poverty is a combination of deficiencies, such as \nin housing, decent food, access to school and health \ncare. We are dealing with that by creating villages in \nwhich all those fundamental needs can be met.  \n The Assembly knows about the Digital Solidarity \nFund initiative, which we launched a few years ago to \n \n \n15 10-54959 \n \nhelp bridge the digital divide between developed \ncountries and underdeveloped countries. \n I would also like to report that we have launched \nthe Eco-villages Strategy, which involves converting \ntraditional villages to energy self-sufficiency by using \nclean energy such as solar or wind in order to lessen \nthe degradation of our environment. \n Lastly, the initiative for complete equality \nbetween men and women in Senegal in all fully or \npartially elected bodies is a way for us to marshal \nwomen\u2019s abilities, which are fully acknowledged. The \nlaw of March 2010 fully assimilates women into the \nnation\u2019s decision-making circles. I think that we should \nperhaps stop talking about the advancement of women. \nWe must raise women to the decision-making level, \nwhich will happen at the same time and on the basis of \nequality with men.  \n I could continue, but those examples are enough \nto demonstrate the pressing need for innovation. \n In my capacity as current Chair of the \nOrganization of the Islamic Conference I must once \nagain draw the attention of the international \ncommunity to the resurgence of Islamophobia in \ncertain sectors. In recent years outbursts of \nIslamophobia, as if in a process of escalation and \nprovocation, have multiplied: profanations of tombs \nand of the Holy Koran, hate speech and blasphemous \ncaricatures. All these incidents in fact give expansive \nproof of the small-mindedness, ignorance and \nintellectual and moral bankruptcy of their authors. On \nbehalf of the Islamic umma, I strongly denounce and \ncondemn these irresponsible and absurd acts. In any \ncase, with regard to the Holy Koran, God himself has \nmade himself infallible protector of his holy word, as it \nis said, \u201cSurely We have revealed the Reminder and We \nwill most surely be its guardian\u201d (The Holy Koran, \nXV:9). \n I would like everyone to understand that Islam \nand Muslims are no one\u2019s enemy. Islam is a religion of \nthe golden mean, which teaches moderation, which \nexhorts us to do good, which preaches respect for \ndiversity and peaceful coexistence among peoples, \nwhatever their religion. Still today it is in strict \nobservance of these rules that nearly 2.5 billion \nMuslims throughout the world practice their faith. If \nthere is a tiny minority that descends to violence in the \nname of the Koran, we say: No, that is in keeping \nneither with the letter nor the spirit of the Koran. \n I reaffirm the openness of the Islamic umma to \ndialogue and joint effort. In the face of extremists of all \nsides, who want to take religions and believers hostage, \nI invite world leaders, opinion-makers, men, women \nand young people to join us to converse, explain, \ninform and educate, to promote the choice of wisdom, \nknowledge, reason, logic and doing good against \nobscurantism and confrontation. I hope that from that \nchoice will come mutual understanding and peaceful \ncoexistence between peoples, civilizations and \ncultures, respecting each other\u2019s beliefs and diversity.  \n At Dakar, we have organized the Conference of \nAfrican Ulema, a group of Islamic scholars who are \nresponding to those who want to use our religion for \npolitical ends. That African conference will culminate \nin a conference of all the countries of the umma, to be \nheld in Medina, Saudi Arabia. \n Right now I direct my hope towards the \nestablishment of a Palestinian State with \ninternationally recognized borders. That is why I \nsupport President Obama\u2019s initiative on Palestinian-\nIsraeli dialogue and renew my long-standing support \nfor the legitimate demand of the Palestinian people for \na sovereign, independent and viable State. We support \nthe vision of a Palestinian State that will be a full \nmember of the United Nations, which has been \npromised here by President Obama.  \n Faced with the tragedy that has struck the Haitian \npeople, Senegal has joined its efforts with those of the \ninternational community to provide emergency \nassistance. In October we will be receiving some \n160 Haitian students who wish to study in Senegal, and \nnext year we expect to be hosting Haitian families. \nFrom this rostrum I appeal to all, and in particular to \nAfrican heads of State, to help Haiti. Those who want \nto host students should speak to us: I have sent \ncommission to Haiti, and I have tasked a minister to be \nin charge of Haitian affairs. We have a roster of 3,000 \nyoung people who have been chosen by university \nteachers, about whom we have all the necessary \ninformation, including health information.  \n In Africa, Senegal notes with satisfaction the \nprogress of our brother people of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire towards \nnational reconciliation and the upcoming holding of \nelections in peace and calm. In Guinea, another \nneighbour of Senegal, where I have visited many times \nto help normalize the situation, I salute the efforts of \nthe facilitator, President Blaise Compaor\u00e9. I invite once \n  \n \n10-54959 16 \n \nagain all Guinean stakeholders, in particular the two \ncandidates in the second round, to complete the \nelectoral process, so that there can be a permanent \nreturn to constitutional order, in national peace and \nharmony \u2014 which are essential conditions for \ndevelopment. \n Senegal is also pleased with the progress made by \nthe Niger to re-establish the country\u2019s political \ninstitutions. Guinea-Bissau, another neighbour of ours, \nhas made significant progress since its election last \nyear of President Malam Bacai Sanh\u00e1. But its \ndemocratic institutions remain fragile and therefore \nneed more resolute support from the international \ncommunity. In line with the conclusions of the \nextraordinary summit of the Economic Community of \nWest African States held on 17 September, Senegal is \nprepared to take part in the efforts of our regional \norganization for the establishment of a programme for \nsecurity and defence sector reform in Guinea-Bissau. \n In the Sudan, Senegal remains committed to the \nAfrican Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in \nDarfur. We hope that the referendum on self-\ndetermination of the south will be held in the best \nconditions possible in order to prevent a domino effect \nthat would be harmful to the whole of Africa. Perhaps a \ngroup of heads of State could help to work towards that \ngoal. \n I would like to conclude by recalling that Senegal \nwill host, from 10 to 31 December, the third World \nFestival of Black Arts, after the first two, which were \nheld in Dakar in 1966 and Lagos in 1977. This \ngathering is a reaffirmation of the artistic, cultural and \nintellectual identity of the black world, and it carries a \nmessage of openness, dialogue and fraternity from \nAfrica and its diaspora to the whole of humanity, for \nthe respect of all cultures and civilizations. All are \ncordially invited."

        "file_text": "I welcome this opportunity \nto address this Assembly for the first time since I was \nsworn in as President of my country, Nigeria, on 6 May \nthis year. \n I extend sincere congratulations to Mr. Joseph \nDeiss on his well-deserved election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. Allow me \nalso to congratulate his predecessor on the skilful way \nin which he conducted the affairs of the Assembly \nduring its sixty-fourth session. I also commend the \nSecretary-General for the quality of his leadership. I \nassure the President of the General Assembly of the \nsupport and cooperation of the Nigerian delegation \nthroughout his tenure. \n This session coincides with the fiftieth \nanniversary of the independence of 17 African \ncountries, including my country, Nigeria. It is true that \nthe United Nations played an important role in the \nacceleration of decolonization, in part through the \nadoption of many resolutions supporting the right of \nnations to self-determination. The independence and \nsubsequent admission of many of these countries into \nthe United Nations has greatly enhanced the \nOrganization\u2019s legitimacy, thereby advancing the noble \ngoals of its Charter. \n Nigeria was one of the countries to emerge from \ncolonialism in 1960 into a whole new world of \nindependence and sovereignty to take on the task of \nnation-building and to play the international role that \ndestiny had conferred on us. Our participation in the \nUnited Nations peacekeeping mission in the Congo \nseven days after gaining our independence was the \ndirect and deliberate fulfilment of the international role \nthat we had set for ourselves as a people. Since then, \nwe have participated in numerous United Nations \npeacekeeping missions, as well as in similar regional \nendeavours. Nigeria has been and will continue to be \nan active participant in the work of the United Nations, \nstriving therein to promote national, regional and \nglobal objectives. \n Despite many years of independence, many \ncountries still face the daunting challenges of nation-\nbuilding. It is in this connection that the Millennium \nSummit of 2000 adopted a set of goals to be realized \nby 2015. The outcome of the events related to the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) that took \nplace recently here in New York inspires a real \nappreciation of the enormous scope of the task ahead \nfor many countries, including ours. The urgency of the \naction needed to address the situation has been clearly \n  \n \n10-54959 24 \n \nand unambiguously underscored in the intervening \ndiscussions. \n Even though we have achieved significant \nimprovements in the eradication of polio and other \nchild-related diseases, Nigeria still has its own fair \nshare of challenges to overcome. Progress on MDGs 4 \nand 5, which relate to the reduction of maternal and \nchild mortality, has been relatively slow. The weakness \nof the primary health care system and limited referral \ninstitutions remain crucial challenges in the health care \nsector. \n On the positive side, Nigeria has recorded \nremarkable progress in the provision of universal basic \neducation, and we are also in the process of \nharmonizing baseline data that will assist us in the \nproper monitoring and evaluation of all MDG projects. \n The Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, \nTuberculosis and Malaria continues to be a prime \nmechanism for addressing Millennium Development \nGoal 6. Accordingly, Nigeria will remain both a donor \nnation to and a recipient of the Fund. Having actively \nparticipated during the first and second replenishments \nwith total contributions of $20 million, Nigeria will \nmake further contributions of $10 million during the \nthird replenishment. We will also call for the Muskoka \ncommitment to be met now, and the Global Fund to be \nexpanded to include MDGs 4 and 5 in support of the \nSecretary-General\u2019s Every Woman, Every Child \ninitiative. \n Good governance, strict adherence to the rule of \nlaw and respect for human rights remain fundamental \ntenets of my administration. The consolidation and \nsafeguarding of our democracy are a task on which we \nare beginning to see positive results. The smooth \nsuccession of power since Nigeria\u2019s return to \ndemocratic rule in 1999, including my own ascension \nto the presidency of our country after the demise of my \npredecessor, is evidence of the commitment of all \nstakeholders to democratic governance in the \nknowledge that political stability is imperative to the \neconomic development of any nation. \n As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of our \nindependence in a few days, we remember the \nsacrifices of the founding fathers of our nation, as well \nas our own responsibility to present and future \ngenerations. In fulfilment of these aspirations, we are \nfirmly committed to holding free, fair and credible \nelections during the 2011 general elections. In this \nregard, we have taken the steps necessary to ensure the \nsuccess of the process. I assure the Assembly that \nevery vote will count in Nigeria. \n We are also working to strengthen our \ninstitutional structures for combating corruption, \nfinancial crimes, and other vices, such as human and \ndrug trafficking. We are reforming the financial sector \nto make it more accountable and transparent. This will \nensure that our country enjoys political stability, social \nharmony and economic growth. \n In support of our commitment to the global effort \nto combat terrorism, we continue to strengthen and \nexpand our institutional capacities to tackle all forms \nof extremism. In fact, we currently have two bills \u2014 a \ncounter-terrorism bill and an anti-money laundering \nbill \u2014 before our National Assembly, and I am \nconfident they will be enacted into law before the end \nof the current legislative year. \n Soon after I assumed the leadership of my \ncountry as acting President, I was invited by the \nPresident of the United States of America to a mini-\nsummit on nuclear disarmament in Washington, D.C., \nin April this year. Like all previous Nigerian leaders, I \nshare the American President\u2019s vision of a world free \nof nuclear weapons, and I will continue to collaborate \nwith him and all humankind for the realization of this \nlaudable goal. Our support for and active participation \nin the adoption of the Pelindaba Treaty is evidence of \nour commitment to the total elimination of nuclear \nweapons. This conforms with our status as a signatory \nto the major treaties on nuclear disarmament. \n At the same time, small arms and light weapons \nhave destabilized the African continent, fuelled and \nprolonged conflicts, and obstructed relief programmes. \nThey have also undermined peace initiatives, increased \nhuman rights abuses, hampered development and, \nperhaps more worrisome, fostered a culture of \norganized crime and violence. We note, however, that \nthe illicit trade in and proliferation of small arms and \nlight weapons do not receive adequate attention. \nNigeria calls on the United Nations to take firm action \nto control the proliferation of small arms and light \nweapons by adopting an arms trade treaty. \n It is estimated that there are approximately 100 \nmillion of these weapons in sub-Saharan Africa alone. \nThese weapons have been identified as having killed \nmore people in the African continent than any other \ntype of weapon. However, unlike for nuclear, chemical \n \n \n25 10-54959 \n \nand biological weapons, there are no global treaties or \nlegally binding instruments for dealing with the \nchallenges posed by small arms and light weapons. It \nmust be underscored that the dumping of these \nweapons in Africa and their free use are among the \ngreatest challenges facing African leaders today. These \nweapons encourage impunity, transborder crime, armed \nrobbery, piracy, kidnapping and the rape of innocent \nwomen. In general, their presence hampers economic \ngrowth because no one wants to invest in a nation or \nregion that is prone to crisis. We know of \napproximately 300 companies that produce and trade \nsuch small arms and light weapons in approximately 50 \ncountries around the world. And we believe that it is \ntime for the United Nations to come on strong if it \ntruly wants to help Africa get out of the woods. \n In my capacity as Chairman of the Economic \nCommunity of West African States, I am pleased to \nreport that we have made substantial progress in \nbringing peace and stability to countries in the \nCommunity that were until recently embroiled in \npolitical crises. This has greatly improved the situation \nacross the subregion, which in turn has enhanced the \npeace and security that are critical to development. We \nwill continue to build on these achievements to \nconsolidate stability and engender prosperity in the \nsubregion. \n Nigeria chose the theme of preventive diplomacy \nfor an open debate it convened during its presidency of \nthe Security Council in July 2010 (see S/PV.6360) to \nhighlight the importance that it attaches to conflict \nprevention. It is obvious that preventing conflicts is a \ncheaper option for maintaining peace and security than \npeacekeeping. I urge the United Nations to devote \nrenewed attention to preventive diplomacy. The \nincreasing financial burden of peacekeeping and the \nhigh human cost of conflict are good reasons for the \nUnited Nations to pursue with vigour the adoption of \npreventive diplomacy in the spirit of the provisions of \nChapters VI and VII of the Charter of the United \nNations. \n For Nigeria, a major contributor of troops to \npeacekeeping operations around the world, it is \nessential that the rules of engagement be reviewed to \nprevent high casualty rates among contingents. It \ndeeply saddens us to see troops wearing the United \nNations colours being waylaid and murdered because \nof the rules of engagement. \n The theme for the sixty-fifth session of the \nGeneral Assembly \u2014 \u201cReaffirming the central role of \nthe United Nations in global governance\u201d \u2014 is timely \nand appropriate. The need for the United Nations to \nprovide leadership in addressing problems and \nchallenges of a global nature is imperative. We urge the \nOrganization to quicken the pace of reform, not only to \nbetter reflect current global realities, but also to ensure \nthat it enjoys genuine legitimacy. Good governance \nrequires participation by all nations and all peoples of \nthe world. \n The early reform and, in particular, expansion of \nthe Security Council will accord the United Nations \ngreater effectiveness in global good governance. The \nexclusion of the African States from the Council\u2019s \npermanent membership category can no longer be \njustified. \n I would like to reaffirm Nigeria\u2019s abiding faith in \nthe role of the United Nations in the pursuit of our \ncommon goals for the benefit of all humankind. We \ntherefore pledge our continued support for the \nOrganization, in order to strengthen it, as a way of \nidentifying with the ideals for which it stands. \n In conclusion, I wish to thank all Member States \nfor their kind words of condolence and sympathy in \nhonour of the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua at \nan Assembly meeting last May (see A/64/PV.86). Even \nthough he is gone, his legacy lives on, as my \nAdministration continues to implement the \nprogrammes we had jointly designed during his time as \nPresident of our country and while I was second-in-\ncommand. May his soul rest in peace."

        "file_text": "I begin by congratulating \nyou, Sir, on your well-deserved election to preside over \nthe sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. \nAdditionally, I take this opportunity to thank Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki of Libya for his effective, strong and \ndynamic leadership during the sixty-fourth session and \nto salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \ntremendous efforts in promoting global peace, security \nand development. \n I address the Assembly as we confront the second \ndecade of this millennium, which brings such \ntremendous opportunities for mankind. Scientific and \ntechnological innovations have made the world a truly \nglobal village characterized by continuing connectivity \nand unimagined possibilities for facilitating global \ndevelopment. These technologies, integrating as they \ndo even the smallest and traditionally most distant \ncountries into the day-to-day activities of the world \ncommunity, have the potential to combat hunger, \neradicate poverty, generate employment, and elevate \nthe standard of living of people throughout the world, \nwithout compromising the integrity of our ecosystem \nand planet Earth. \n However, in order to realize the full potential of \nthese opportunities, the community of nations now \nneeds to muster the courage to pursue with \ndetermination reforms in international and multilateral \ninstitutions such as the United Nations which will \nensure equality of treatment, and bring the benefits of \ndevelopment to those countries which, in consequence \nof small size, are often the least endowed, and most \nvulnerable in today\u2019s world community. \n The formulation and pursuit of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) has brought the world\u2019s \nattention to the main issues of development, especially \nthe challenges faced by developing countries. It also \nbrought to the fore the nexus which exists between \nfinancial, social and economic development on the one \nhand and the sustainable use of natural resources on the \nother. \n By and large, we in the developing world have \nlived up to the commitments which we made, by \nmobilizing domestic financial resources for \ndevelopment and making major structural changes, \neven in the face of an increasingly hostile economic, \nfinancial and trading system. Those efforts have been \n  \n \n10-55103 4 \n \ncoupled with international resources for development \nin the form of foreign direct investment and official \ndevelopment assistance. The results to date have been \nencouraging when one considers where we were at the \nbeginning of the millennium. There still remain, \nhowever, a number of unresolved global issues which \nhave stymied the efforts to attain the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \n We suggest, therefore, that the next five years \nbefore the target date of the MDGs must see a \nreconfiguration and acceleration of efforts by all \nMember States. This should begin with the fulfilment \nof commitments already given by developed countries, \nand South-South cooperation must be strengthened in \nkeeping with the kind of solidarity now being \ndemonstrated by Venezuela, Cuba, China, Brazil and \nother such developing countries. \n Negotiation of the Doha Development Round \nmust be concluded within a reasonable time, and in \nthat regard the very small States of the developing \nworld must continue to insist, even as others resist it, \non meaningful recognition by the global community of \nthe principle of special and differential treatment, \nrather than a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach, as a central \nprinciple permitting beneficial economic adjustment \nfor countries like my own. This will provide \ndeveloping countries with an opportunity to compete in \nthe global trading system and place greater emphasis \non trade rather than aid. \n The phenomenon of climate change has been well \ndocumented by the United Nations and other \ninstitutions over the past decade. In fact, we in the \nCaribbean and other small island developing States can \nspeak of our experience with the increasing intensity of \nhurricanes, droughts, floods, destruction to coastal \nareas and rising sea levels. These have had severe \nimpacts on our agriculture, tourism, and physical \ninfrastructure, especially along our coasts, leading to \nan increasingly high cost for adaptation and mitigation, \nresulting in the diversion of funds which otherwise \nwould have been used for social and economic \ndevelopment. Climate change, therefore, has become a \nmajor threat to the ability of most developing countries \nto achieve the MDGs. \n For almost two decades the United Nations has \nrecognized the special economic, social and \nenvironmental vulnerabilities of small island \ndeveloping States. Since the Mauritius meeting in \n2005, their situation has become even more precarious. \nThe impacts of the world food and fuel crises in 2007 \nand the financial and economic crisis in 2008 have \nclearly demonstrated the open and vulnerable nature of \nour economies. This, coupled with the impact of \nclimate change, strengthens the case for a unique \nposition for small island developing States and hence a \nmore prominent place within the United Nations \nsystem as a recognized category, with all the attendant \nbenefits and obligations. \n Despite our many challenges, small island \ndeveloping States continue to demonstrate strong \nleadership, particularly in the area of climate change \nand in the work of the United Nations in general. \nSignificant progress has been made in the areas of the \nprotection of biodiversity, strategies for promoting \nrenewable energy, and the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals. These efforts need to \nbe complemented both by the United Nations system \nand by other Member States, especially the developed \ncountries. \n It is regrettable that to date no consensus has \nbeen reached on the best way to deal with what we \nconsider a clear and present danger to our planet. The \nfailure at Copenhagen should be further motivation for \nall countries to work assiduously towards an agreement \nin Mexico. \n We commend the efforts being made towards a \nconsensus on climate change; however, we maintain \nthat the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change should be the primary forum for \nnegotiating the global response to climate change. We \ntherefore call upon all Member States to work within \nthis framework in order to arrive expeditiously at a \nbinding agreement which will recognize the shared but \ndifferentiated responsibilities of Member States. \n Since its establishment, the United Nations has \nplayed, as it continues to play, a critical role in \nfostering greater understanding among nations and \nmaintaining peace and security throughout the world. \nThe United Nations has also been able to reduce \nconflict and minimize tensions between countries and \npeoples. These efforts have been buttressed by other \nsignificant efforts, such as the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the \nProgramme of Action to Prevent, Combat and \nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light \nWeapons in All Its Aspects. \n \n \n5 10-55103 \n \n In May this year the United Nations held the \nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Dominica \nsupports the outcome of the Conference, and calls upon \nall Member States to adhere to the obligations of the \nTreaty. We call for a world free of nuclear weapons, \nand join the calls for total disarmament. \n Small arms and light weapons continue to pose a \nmajor threat to peace and security throughout the \nworld. Dominica is very concerned over the increase in \nthat illicit trade in the Caribbean region. We are not \nconvinced that the larger nations of the world \ncomprehend the extent of the inability of smaller \nnations like my own, which bridge the producers and \nconsumers of narcotic substances, to cope with this \nnew horror. \n The continued demand in the North for drugs \nproduced in the South, and the growth of the related \ntrade in small arms and light weapons, have placed us \nin the crossfire of these illicit activities. Yet it appears \nto us that the larger nations of the world only take \ndecisive steps to cope with this situation when it has \nbecome untenable for themselves. In that context, we \ndo not believe that sufficient consultation now exists to \nensure that the smaller States are provided, on a \ncontinuous basis, with the capabilities needed for \npersistent attention to the problems that arise in our \njurisdictions. This is yet another aspect of the case for \nspecial and differential treatment in the security and \nsocial development spheres. \n The threat of terrorism is of concern throughout \nthe world. Radical extremism has created an \nenvironment in which cultural and religious \nmisunderstandings and misplaced anger have claimed \nthe lives of thousands. We extend our sympathy to all \nthe Member States which have lost citizens at the \nhands of those who have sought to destabilize \nGovernments and to instil fear in the rest of humanity. \nBy its very nature, the fight against terrorism requires \nglobal action. This must involve the efforts of the \nUnited Nations in fostering a culture of peace, \ntolerance and understanding among the peoples of the \nworld. \n During last year\u2019s general debate (see A/64/PV.7), \nDominica recognized the important role of the United \nNations in the rebuilding process of our sister nation of \nHaiti. We also called upon those Member States that \nhad pledged assistance to make good on their promises \nin order to foster Haiti\u2019s social and economic \ndevelopment. Today, the challenges facing Haiti have \nbeen magnified to a degree which requires further \ncommitments from all Member States of the United \nNations. The destruction wrought in Haiti by the \nearthquake in January has made the need for resource \nmobilization a matter of extreme urgency. \n In March the United Nations hosted the \nInternational Donors\u2019 Conference towards a New \nFuture for Haiti. Dominica wishes to commend the \norganizers and the contributors to this initiative. \nDuring the Conference several Member States pledged \ntheir support for the reconstruction efforts. \nCommitments of several billion dollars were made. \nSadly, to date the Government and people of Haiti have \nbeen able to access only a fraction of those pledges. \nWe call on all Member States to make good their \npromises so as to ensure that the rebuilding process can \ncontinue and to avoid further deterioration of the \npolitical, social and economic situation of that country. \n The focus in rebuilding Haiti should be not solely \non physical infrastructure, but also on the building and \nrebuilding of institutions to strengthen the governance \nof Haiti and to empower its people through technology \ntransfer and capacity-building. It should also include \ndevelopment of the productive sectors to place Haiti on \na path to economic independence. \n Most important, the international community \nmust recognize and accept that the Government and \npeople of Haiti must be placed at the centre of the \nreconstruction process so as to engender a spirit of \nunity of purpose, ownership and meaningful \npartnership, even at these most challenging times. \n The crisis in Haiti presents both a challenge and \nan opportunity, not only to the international \ncommunity, but also to the Governments and financial \ninstitutions to which that country remains heavily \nindebted. We call on those international financial \ninstitutions and Governments to cancel the remaining \ndebt owed by Haiti in order to provide more latitude \nfor that country to fully realize its recovery efforts. As \nregards trade, we urge all Member States to liberalize \ntrading regimes so as to allow greater access of Haitian \nproducts into their markets without barriers. \n Earlier I spoke of the threats which plague \nmankind in the era of globalization. I also highlighted \nthe need for multilateralism and the need for \ncooperation between States. Those challenges can be \n  \n \n10-55103 6 \n \novercome only in a global environment where there \nexist respect for each other\u2019s territorial integrity; non-\ninterference in each other\u2019s domestic affairs; and \nrespect for sovereignty and the right to self-\ndetermination. It is in this context that Dominica again \ncalls on the United States of America to discontinue its \neconomic blockade against the people of the Republic \nof Cuba. \n The rule of law is an important aspect of \ninternational law. Adherence to our international \nobligations is important to the maintenance of peace \nand security and to ensuring that all persons, regardless \nof race, nationality, creed or gender, continue to \nbelieve in the international system and to recognize \nthat this system is for the benefit of all peoples and \nnations, whether large or small. That is why the \nsituation in which our sister nation of Antigua and \nBarbuda has been placed vis-\u00e0-vis its dispute with the \nUnited States of America is extremely unfortunate and \nmust be remedied as quickly as possible. We urge the \nparties involved to quickly seek to resolve the situation \nand arrive at a negotiated settlement that is fair and \njust. \n The citizens of this planet have come to \nrecognize that new developments in technology have \nbrought an interdependence among peoples and States \nas they vigorously pursue the development of their \nseparate countries. They have also come to realize that \nthere must be increasing cooperation between nations \nin order to ensure a deliberate and planned approach to \nthe maintenance and development of the resources of \nthis planet. In that connection, regional processes of \ncooperation have increasingly come to characterize the \nconduct of nations. \n But as the technology of communication has \nincreased international connectiveness, it has also \nbecome apparent that regionalism often proves \ninsufficient, and that a global approach must be taken \nto new issues which arise. Therefore, my country \nstrongly supports the principle that it is the United \nNations, to which all countries turn in times of crises, \nthat must play the fundamental role in the surveillance \nof all developments affecting our planet. Consequently, \nwe hereby reaffirm our commitment to the central role \nthat the United Nations should play in global \ngovernance. "

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate \nMr. Deiss on his election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session. We are confident \nthat he will discharge the responsibilities of his high \noffice with wisdom. I assure him of Namibia\u2019s \ncooperation and support. I would also like to commend \nhis predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam  \nTreki, for the able manner in which he presided over \nthe sixty-fourth session. \n The Secretary-General of the Organization, His \nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and his staff have done a \ncommendable job in overseeing the ongoing efforts to \nimprove the working methods of the Organization and \nfor better interaction with Member States. We \ncommend them for their dedication and hard work. \n The theme for this year\u2019s session, \u201cReaffirming \nthe central role of the United Nations in global \ngovernance\u201d, is both timely and appropriate. In that \nspirit, Member States should reaffirm the central role \nof the United Nations in global governance. Namibia \nshares the views expressed in the outcome document of \nthe Conference on the World Financial and Economic \nCrisis and Its Impact on Development (resolution \n63/303, annex). \n We believe that because of its universal \nmembership and legitimacy, the United Nations is well \npositioned to participate in the reform processes to \nimprove and strengthen the effective functioning of the \ninternational financial system. In that regard, we must \nreaffirm our commitment to a universal, rules-based, \nopen, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral \ntrading system and also work together for a speedy and \nequitable conclusion to the Doha Round. \n Although Namibia is currently classified as a \nhigh middle-income country, it still bears the scars of \nsocial and economic inequalities inherited from its \ncolonial past. As a result, we carry the unenviable \ndistinction as the country with the most unequal \ndistribution of income and economic resources in the \nworld. Ironically, our country also faces declining \ninternational development assistance due to that very \nclassification, which has negatively impacted our \nability to mobilize resources for national development \nefforts. \n In that light, I appeal to the international financial \ninstitutions to create special mechanisms to enable \nmiddle-income countries to access financial resources \nfor development on concessional terms, as called for \nby the 2008 Windhoek Declaration on Development \nCooperation with Middle-Income Countries. \n Our recently concluded High-level Plenary \nMeeting on the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) gave world leaders and other stakeholders a \nunique opportunity to review progress made towards \n  \n \n10-54965 14 \n \nthe achievement of the MDGs and to share valuable \nexperiences. It is also evident that more work remains \nto be done. The challenges encountered should \nencourage us, and the successes recorded should \ninspire us all to work relentlessly for the noble and \ncommon objectives of achieving all of the MDGs. \n At the global level, climate change is one of the \nmajor challenges facing humanity today. The \ndevastating impact of natural disasters around the \nworld has affected most of our countries. Although \nNamibia does not significantly contribute to the \nemission of greenhouse gases, it is one of the countries \nmost vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In \nrecent years, we have experienced increasingly severe \nfloods and droughts that have destroyed crops, \nlivestock and wild animals. We thus call upon \nindustrialized countries to take practical steps and \ndemonstrate greater political will to bring about drastic \nreductions in greenhouse gas emissions. We also urge \nthem to give meaningful support to the efforts of \ndeveloping countries to mitigate and adapt to the \nadverse effects of climate change. \n It is our hope that the industrialized countries will \nmeet their commitments to provide adequate resources, \nin line with the undertakings made at Copenhagen in \n2009. Namibia looks forward to a successful outcome \nof the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \nin Mexico later this year. \n In 2000, while serving as a member of the \nSecurity Council, Namibia initiated and introduced a \ntheme on women, peace and security, which resulted in \nthe adoption of the  resolution 1325 (2000). Our \nobjective was to highlight the plight of women in \nconflict situations and to recognize the vital role that \nthey can play in peacemaking efforts for the effective \nresolution of conflicts. As we commemorate the first \ndecade of that resolution, let us recommit ourselves to \nthe protection of women and girls in conflict situations \nin all parts of the world. \n We welcome the Assembly resolution on system-\nwide coherence and the establishment of UN Women as \nan entity dedicated to dealing with gender-related \nissues (resolution 64/289). We hope that that new \nentity will strengthen the institutional capacity of the \nUnited Nations for the support of gender equality and \nthe empowerment of women. My delegation wishes to \ncongratulate Ms. Michelle Bachelet on her appointment \nas UN Women\u2019s first head. \n In August, Namibia assumed the chairmanship of \nthe Southern African Development Community \n(SADC). In that capacity, we will work to promote \ncooperation with other regional economic communities \nin Africa, as the building blocks for intracontinental \nintegration. SADC strives for political stability in the \nregion as a prerequisite for sustainable development. In \nthat connection, we have taken proactive steps to \nresolve the political crisis in Madagascar, through the \nfacilitation efforts of former President Joachim \nChissano of Mozambique. \n The recent African Union (AU) summit, held in \nKampala in July, focused on maternal, infant and child \nhealth and development in Africa. African leaders \nreaffirmed their commitment to mobilize and direct \nresources to check the deaths of women and children \nfrom preventable diseases. \n Namibia has consistently urged the international \ncommunity to fulfil its obligation to help the people of \nWestern Sahara in their quest for self-determination. \nWe therefore call for immediate and unconditional \nimplementation of the United Nations Settlement Plan \nfor Western Sahara and for the holding of a free and \nfair referendum, based on the terms of the relevant \nresolutions of the Security Council and the General \nAssembly. \n Namibia is deeply concerned about the ongoing \nsuffering and humiliation of the Palestinian people \nunder Israeli occupation and the denial of their \nfundamental right to self-determination. It is \nencouraging, however, that direct negotiations have \nbeen resumed between the parties. We hope that a \ndurable solution will be found without further delay \nand on the basis of the relevant United Nations \nresolutions. \n Namibia is also concerned about the prolonged \nand extraterritorial economic embargo imposed on the \npeople of Cuba. We fully support the decision of the \nAU summit in Kampala calling for the embargo\u2019s \nremoval. We believe that the economic blockade is \nunjustifiable and unfair and should therefore be lifted.  \n Similarly, Namibia calls for lifting the economic \nsanctions imposed, directly or indirectly, on the \nRepublic of Zimbabwe by some Western countries. \nThose sanctions have caused enormous suffering, not \n \n \n15 10-54965 \n \nonly to the people of Zimbabwe, but also to other \ncountries in the SADC region. \n For many years now, we have been calling for \ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations system, \nparticularly the Security Council. The process must be \nfinalized to render the Council more representative, \ndemocratic and accountable. It is unjust that Africa \nremains the only region of the world without \npermanent representation on the Security Council. In \nthat connection, we reiterate our support for the \nAfrican common position on Security Council reform, \nas articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte \nDeclaration. \n The maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity is our collective responsibility. Namibia \nbelieves that peace, security and stability are the \ncornerstones of sustainable development, and thus we \nwill continue to participate in United Nations and AU \npeacekeeping missions. We urge the international \ncommunity to support conflict prevention and \npeacebuilding efforts around the world.  \n Recently, States parties to the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty reaffirmed their commitment to \nnuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and the \npeaceful use of nuclear energy. We welcome that \npositive step, in the belief that multilateralism is the \nmost viable option for achieving a world free from the \ndanger of nuclear weapons. \n Namibia believes in the effectiveness of \ncollective action under the auspices of the United \nNations to resolve conflicts by peaceful means and to \naddress the challenges facing the world. My delegation \nis optimistic that together we can successfully work for \nthe common good of all humanity. Let us join hands to \nachieve our common objective of building a better \nworld for present and future generations."

        "file_text": "I am \ngrateful to the Almighty God who has granted me the \nopportunity to appear before this world Assembly once \nagain. \n I wish to begin by commemorating those who lost \ntheir lives in the horrible flood in Pakistan and \nexpressing my heartfelt sympathy with the families \nwho lost their loved ones, as well as with the people \n \n \n7 10-54833 \n \nand the Government of Pakistan. I urge everyone to \nassist their fellow men and women as a humane duty. \n Let me thank Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, who \npresided over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \nsession, for all his efforts during his tenure. I also \ncongratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on being elected to \npreside over the current session, and wish him every \nsuccess. \n In past years, I have spoken to the Assembly \nabout some hopes and concerns; some concerns \ninvolve family crises, the security challenge, disrespect \nfor human dignity, the deterioration of the world \neconomy, climate change and disregard for human \naspirations to achieve justice and lasting peace. \n After about a hundred years of domination, the \ncapitalist system and the existing world order have \nproved to be unable to provide appropriate solutions to \nthe problems of societies; thus their demise has come \nabout. I shall try to examine several causes of this \nfailure and picture features of an ideal order. \n The first cause of failure relates to our attitudes \nand beliefs. As the Assembly is well aware, the divine \nprophets had the mission to call everyone to \nmonotheism, love and justice and to show mankind the \npath to prosperity. They invite men to contemplation \nand to seek knowledge in order to better appreciate the \ntruth and to refrain from atheism and egoism. \n The essence of the message of all prophets is one \nand the same. Every messenger endorsed the \nmessenger before him, and gave glad tidings about the \nprophet to come, who presented a more complete \nversion of the religion in accordance with man\u2019s \ncapacity at the time. This trend continued until the last \nmessenger of God, who presented the perfection of an \nall-inclusive religion. \n In opposition to the call by the prophets, the \negoist and the greedy stood up against their clear call, \nrevolting against their messages. Nimrod countered \nHazrat Abraham, Pharaoh countered Hazrat Moses, and \nthe greedy countered Hazrat Jesus Christ and Hazrat \nMuhammad \u2014 may peace be upon all our prophets. \n In recent centuries, human ethics and values have \nbeen rejected as a cause of backwardness. They were \neven portrayed as opposing wisdom and science, \nbecause the proclaimers of religion in the dark ages of \nthe West inflicted man with backwardness. Therefore, \nman\u2019s disconnection from heaven has detached him \nfrom his true self. \n Man \u2014 with his potential to understand the \nsecrets of the universe, his instinct to seek truth, his \naspirations for justice and perfection, his quest for \nbeauty and purity, and his capacity to represent God on \nEarth \u2014 has been reduced to a creature restricted by \nthe materialistic world with a mission to maximize \nindividualistic pleasures. Human instinct, then, \nreplaced true human nature. \n Human beings and nations are considered rivals, \nand the happiness of an individual or a nation is upheld \nat the cost of others, to the point of even eliminating or \nsuppressing others; rather than developing a \nconstructive and evolutionary method of cooperation, it \nwas replaced by a destructive struggle for survival. The \nlust for capital and domination replaced monotheism, \nwhich is the gateway to love and unity. \n This widespread clash of the egoist with the \ndivine values gave way to slavery and colonialism. A \nlarge part of the world came under the domination of a \nfew Western States. Tens of millions of people were \ntaken into slavery, and tens of millions of families were \nshattered as a result. All the resources, the rights and \nthe cultures of the colonized nations were plundered. \nLands were occupied and the indigenous people were \nhumiliated and mass-murdered. \n Yet, nations rose up, colonialism was alienated, \nand the independence of nations was recognized. Thus, \nthe hope for respect, prosperity and security was \nrevived among nations. In the beginning of the past \ncentury beautiful motives of freedom, human rights \nand democracy created hopes for healing the deep \nwounds of the past. Today, however, not only are those \ndreams not realized, but memories, even at times more \nbitter than before, have been recorded in our history. \n As a result of the two World Wars, the occupation \nof Palestine, the Korean and Viet Nam wars, the Iraq \nwar against Iran, the occupation of Afghanistan and \nIraq, as well as many wars in Africa, hundreds of \nmillions of people were killed, wounded or displaced. \nTerrorism, illicit drug production, poverty and social \ngaps have increased. The dictatorial and coups d\u2019\u00e9tat \nGovernments in Latin America committed \nunprecedented crimes, with the support of the West. \n Instead of disarmament, the proliferation and \nstockpiling of nuclear, biological and chemical \n  \n \n10-54833 8 \n \nweapons expanded, putting the world under a bigger \nthreat. As a result, the very same old goals of \ncolonialists and the slave masters were pursued, but \nthis time around with a new fa\u00e7ade. \n The second cause of the failure of the existing \nworld order and capitalism has to do with the current \nglobal management and its ruling structures. The \nLeague of Nations and then the United Nations were \nestablished with the promise of bringing about peace, \nsecurity and the realization of human rights, which in \nfact meant a global management. \n One can analyse the current system for \ngovernance of world affairs by examining three events. \n The first event is that of 11 September 2001, \nwhich has affected the whole world for almost a \ndecade. We recall that at the time suddenly the news of \nan attack on the Twin Towers was broadcast using \nnumerous footages of the incident. Almost all \nGovernments and important figures strongly \ncondemned this incident. But then a propaganda \nmachine came into full force; it was implied that the \nwhole world was now exposed to a huge danger \u2014 \nterrorism \u2014 and that the only way to save the world \nwas to deploy forces into Afghanistan. Eventually \nAfghanistan and shortly thereafter Iraq were occupied. \n I ask the Assembly please to take note: It was \nsaid that some 3,000 people were killed on \n11 September, for which we are all very saddened. Yet \nso far in Afghanistan and Iraq hundreds of thousands of \npeople have been killed, while millions have been \nwounded and displaced, and the conflict is still going \non and expanding. \n In identifying those responsible for the \n11 September attack, there were three viewpoints. The \nfirst was that a very powerful and complex terrorist \ngroup, able to successfully cross all layers of American \nintelligence and security, carried out the attack. That is \nthe prevalent viewpoint advocated by American \nstatesmen. \n The second viewpoint was that some segments \nwithin the United States Government orchestrated the \nattack to reverse the declining American economy and \nits grip on the Middle East in order also to save the \nZionist regime. The majority of the American people as \nwell as other nations and politicians around the world \nagree with this view. \n The third viewpoint was that the attack was \ncarried out by a terrorist group, but that the American \nGovernment supported and took advantage of the \nsituation. Apparently, this viewpoint has fewer \nproponents. \n The main evidence for that viewpoint links the \nincident to a few passports found in the huge volume \nof rubble and a video of an individual whose place of \ndomicile was unknown, but it was announced that he \nhad been involved in oil deals with some American \nofficials. It was also covered up and said that due to the \nexplosion and fire no trace of suicide attackers was \nfound. \n Regardless of each of those three viewpoints, \nthere remain a few questions to be answered. \n First, would it not have been sensible that first a \nthorough investigation should have been conducted by \nindependent groups to conclusively identify the \nelements involved in the attack and then map out a \nrational plan to take measures against them? \n Secondly, assuming the viewpoint of the \nAmerican Government, is it rational to launch a classic \nwar through widespread deployment of troops that led \nto the death of hundreds of thousands of people to \ncounter a terrorist group? \n Thirdly, was it not possible to act in the way in \nwhich Iran conducted the operations fighting the Riggi \nterrorist group, who killed and wounded 400 innocent \npeople? In the Iranian operation no innocent person \nwas harmed. \n It is proposed that the United Nations set up an \nindependent fact-finding group in regard to the event \nof 11 September to ensure that the different views \nabout it are not banned from future discussions. \n I wish to announce here that next year the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran will host a conference to study \nterrorism and the means to confront it. I invite \nofficials, scholars, thinkers, researchers and research \ninstitutes of all countries to attend the conference. \n The second cause of the demise of the existing \nworld order is the occupation of the Palestinian \nterritories. The oppressed people of Palestine have \nlived under the rule of an occupying regime for \n60 years, and have been deprived of freedom, security \nand the right to self-determination, while the occupiers \nare given recognition. On a daily basis, houses are \n \n \n9 10-54833 \n \nbeing destroyed over the heads of innocent women and \nchildren. People are deprived of water, food and \nmedicine in their own homeland. \n The Zionists have imposed five all-out wars on \nthe neighbouring countries and on the Palestinian \npeople. The Zionists committed the most horrible \ncrimes against defenceless people in the wars against \nLebanon and Gaza. The Zionist regime attacked a \nhumanitarian flotilla in a blatant defiance of all \ninternational norms and killed civilians. This regime, \nwhich enjoys the absolute support of some Western \ncountries, regularly threatens the countries in the \nregion and continues publicly to announce the \nassassination of Palestinian figures, while Palestinian \ndefenders and those opposing the regime are pressured, \nlabelled as terrorists and called anti-Semites. All \nvalues, even the freedom of expression, which seem to \nmatter so much in Europe and in the United States, and \nto be so important, have been sacrificed at the altar of \nZionism. \n Solutions are doomed to fail because the right of \nthe Palestinian people is not taken into account. Would \nwe have witnessed such horrendous crimes if instead of \nthe occupation being recognized, the sovereign right of \nthe Palestinian people had been recognized? \n Our unambiguous proposition favours the return \nof the Palestinian refugees to their home land and a \nvote by the people of Palestine, all Palestinians, to \nexercise their sovereignty and decide on their type of \ngovernance. \n The third cause of the demise of the existing \norder has to do with the outlook on nuclear energy. \nNuclear energy is clean and cheap and a heavenly gift \nwhich is among the most suitable alternatives to cut \npollution emanating from fossil fuels. The \nNon-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) allows all States \nparties to use nuclear energy without limits, and the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is \nmandated to provide such States with technical and \nlegal support. \n The nuclear bomb is the worst inhumane weapon, \nand must be totally eliminated. The NPT prohibits its \ndevelopment and stockpiling, and calls for nuclear \ndisarmament. Nonetheless, some permanent members \nof the Security Council and other nuclear Powers \u2014 \nthose that possess the nuclear bomb \u2014 have resorted to \nthe following measure. They have equated nuclear \nenergy with the nuclear bomb, and have removed such \nenergy from the reach of most nations by establishing \nmonopolies and pressuring IAEA. At the same time, \nthey have continued to maintain, expand and upgrade \ntheir own nuclear arsenals. The Assembly may have \nheard that in the current year the United States \nAdministration has asked for $80 billion to maintain its \nnuclear bombs. \n The situation that I have described has entailed \nthe following: Not only has nuclear disarmament not \nbeen realized, but also nuclear bombs have proliferated \nin some regions, including by the occupying and \nintimidating Zionist regime. Here I would like to \npropose that 2011 be proclaimed the year of nuclear \ndisarmament and nuclear energy for all, nuclear \nweapons for none. \n In all the cases to which I have referred, I admit, \nthe United Nations has been unable to take any \neffective, viable course of action. Unfortunately, in the \ndecade proclaimed as the \u201cInternational Decade for the \nCulture of Peace\u201d hundreds of thousands have been \nkilled and injured as a result of war, aggression and \noccupation, and hostilities and antagonism have \nincreased. \n Very recently the world witnessed an abhorrent \nand inhumane act of burning the Holy Koran. The Holy \nKoran is the Divine Book and the eternal miracle of the \nProphet of Islam. It calls for worshipping the One God, \njustice, compassion towards people, development and \nprogress, reflection and thought, defence of the \noppressed and resistance against oppressors; and it \nnames with respect the previous Messengers of God, \nsuch as Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Joseph, Moses and \nJesus Christ \u2014 may peace be upon all the prophets \u2014 \nand endorses them. The Koran was burned to burn all \nthose truths and good judgements. \n However, the truth cannot be burned. The Koran \nis eternal, because God and truth are everlasting. This \nact and any other act that widens the gap and distances \nbetween nations is evil. We should wisely avoid \nplaying into the hands of Satan. On behalf of the \nIranian nation, I pay respect to all divine books and \ntheir followers. In one hand I hold up the Koran and in \nthe other the Bible. We pay respect to both books, as \nboth are dear to us. \n For years the inefficiency of capitalism and the \nexisting world management structures have been \nexposed enough for us to understand what they mean. \nThe majority of States and peoples have begun a quest \n  \n \n10-54833 10 \n \nfor fundamental changes and to allow justice in global \nrelations to prevail. \n The cause of the United Nations ineptitude is its \nunjust structure. Major Powers have monopolized the \nSecurity Council, due to their veto privilege, and \nsidelined the General Assembly, which is the main \npillar of the Organization. \n In the past several decades, at least one \npermanent member of the Security Council has always \nbeen a party to a conflict. When both the judge and the \nprosecutor are on the same side of a conflict, how can \none expect justice? They feel immune in aggression \nowing to the structure of the United Nations. For \nexample, if Iran enjoyed the veto privilege, would the \nSecurity Council and the IAEA Director General have \ntaken the same position on the nuclear issue? \n The United Nations is the key centre for \ncoordinating common global management. Its structure \nneeds to be reformed in such a manner that all \nindependent States and nations may participate actively \nand constructively in global governance. \n The veto privilege should be revoked. The \nGeneral Assembly should be the highest body, and the \nSecretary-General should be the most independent \nofficial and all his positions and activities should be \ntaken with the approval of the General Assembly and \nshould be directed towards promoting justice and \neliminating discrimination in the world order. \n The Secretary-General should not come under \npressure from Powers and/or the country hosting the \nOrganization for stating the truth and administering \njustice. It is proposed that the General Assembly \nshould, within a year and in the framework of an \nextraordinary session, finalize the reformation of the \nOrganization\u2019s structure. The Islamic Republic of Iran \nhas clear suggestions in this regard and stands ready to \nparticipate actively and constructively in the process. \n I announce clearly that the occupation of other \ncountries under the pretext of freedom and democracy \nis an unforgivable crime. The world needs the logic of \ncompassion and justice and inclusive participation \ninstead of the logic of force, domination, unilateralism, \nwar and humiliation. The world needs to be governed \nby virtuous people like the Divine Prophets. \n The two vast geographical spheres of Africa and \nLatin America have experienced historic developments \nduring past decades, developments that have changed \ntheir face. The new approaches in these two continents, \nbased on an increasing level of integration and unity, as \nwell as on localizing the growth and development \nmodels, have borne considerable fruits for the peoples \nof those regions. The awareness and wisdom of the \nleaders of the two continents have overcome the \nregional problems and crises, free of the domineering \ninterference of non-regional Powers. \n The Islamic Republic of Iran has expanded its \nrelations with Latin America and Africa in all aspects \nin recent years. \n And now I speak about the glorious Iran. The \nTehran Declaration was a hugely constructive step in \nconfidence-building efforts, a step made possible \nthrough the admirable good will of the Governments of \nBrazil and Turkey, along with the close, sincere and \nhonest cooperation of the Iranian Government. \nAlthough there was an inappropriate reaction to the \nDeclaration by some Western Powers, and it was \nfollowed by an unlawful resolution, it is still valid. \n We have observed the IAEA regulations beyond \nthe requirements of our commitments, yet we have \nnever submitted to illegally imposed pressures, nor will \nwe ever do so. \n It has been said that there is a desire to pressure \nIran into a dialogue. Well, first, Iran has always been \nready for a dialogue based on respect and justice. \nSecondly, methods based on disrespecting nations have \nlong been ineffective. Those who have used \nintimidation and sanctions in response to the clear \nlogic of the Iranian nation are in real terms destroying \nthe remaining credibility of the Security Council and \nthe trust of nations in it, proving once again how unjust \nis the Council\u2019s function. \n When those concerned threaten a great nation, a \ngreat people, such as Iran, which has been known \nthroughout history for its scientists, poets, artists and \nphilosophers, and whose culture and civilization are \nsynonymous with purity, submission to God and \nseeking justice, how can they ever expect other nations \nto have confidence in them? \n It goes without saying that domineering \nmethods \u2014 and mainly capitalism \u2014 in managing the \nworld have failed. Not only has the era of slavery and \ncolonialism and dominating the world passed, the path \nto reviving old Empires is blocked, too. \n \n \n11 10-54833 \n \n We have announced that we stand ready for a \nserious and free debate with the American statesmen in \nthis very venue to express our transparent views on \nissues of importance to the world. It is proposed here \nthat in order to have a constructive dialogue, an annual \nfree debate be organized within the General Assembly. \n In conclusion, the Iranian nation and the majority \nof the world\u2019s nations and Governments are opposed to \nthe current discriminatory management of the world. \nThe inhumane nature of that management has led it to a \ndead end, and it requires a major overhaul. \n Reforming the world\u2019s affairs and bringing about \ntranquillity and prosperity requires the participation of \nall, pure thoughts and the divine and humane \nmanagement that we have been given. We are all of the \nview that justice is the basic element for peace, durable \nsecurity and the spread of love among peoples and \nnations. It is in justice that mankind seeks the \nrealization of his aspirations, rights and dignity, since \nhe is wary of oppression, humiliation and ill-treatment. \n The true nature of mankind is manifested in love \nfor fellow humans and love for all the good in the \nworld. Love is the best foundation for establishing \nrelations among people and among nations. As Vahshi \nBafgi, the great Iranian poet, says, \u201cFrom the fountain \nof youth, drink a thousand sips/You\u2019ll still die if you \ndon\u2019t have love\u2019s grip\u201d. In making a world full of \npurity, safety and prosperity, people are not rivals, but \ncompanions. Those who see their happiness only in the \nsorrow of others and their welfare and safety only in \nothers\u2019 insecurity, those who see themselves as superior \nto others, are out of the path of humanity and are in \nevil\u2019s course. \n Economy and materialistic means are only some \ntools to serve others, to create friendship and \nstrengthen human connections for spiritual perfection. \nThey are not tools for showing off or means of \ndominating others. \n Men and women complement each other, and the \nfamily unit, with pure, loving and long-lasting relations \nof the spouses, becomes the centre and the guarantee of \nthe continuity and bringing up of generations, for true \npleasures, for spreading true love and for reforming \nsociety. \n Woman is a reflection of God\u2019s beauty and the \nsource of love and care. She is the guardian of purity \nand exquisiteness of society. The tendency to toughen \nthe souls and behaviours of women deprives them of \ntheir very basic right of being a loving mother and a \ncaring wife. It will result in a more violent society with \nirreversible defects. \n Freedom is a divine right that should serve peace \nand human perfection. Pure thoughts and the will of \nthe righteous are keys to the gates of a pure life full of \nhope, liveliness and beauty. This is the promise of \nGod \u2014 that the Earth will be inherited by the pure and \nthe righteous. And the people free from selfishness will \ntake up the management of the world. Then there will \nbe no trace of sorrow, discrimination, poverty, \ninsecurity and aggression. The time for true happiness \nand the blossoming of the true nature of humankind, \nthe way God has intended, will arrive. \n All those seeking justice and all the free spirits \nhave been waiting for this moment and have been \npromised such a glorious time. The complete human, \nthe true servant of God and the true friend of mankind, \nwhose father was from the generation of the beloved \nProphet of Islam and whose mother was from the true \nbelievers of Jesus Christ, shall wait along with Jesus, \nthe son of Mary, and the other righteous to appear on \nthose brilliant days and assist humanity. In welcoming \nthem, we should join ranks and seek justice, as would \nbe befitting of man. \n Praise to love and worship, praise to justice and \nfreedom, praise to true humanity, the complete human, \nthe true companion of humankind. I say to all those \nlistening: \u201cPeace be upon you and all the righteous and \nthe pure.\u201d \n"

This meeting also confirms the \nirreplaceable role of the United Nations in the \ninternational community and the respect in which it is \nheld. \n Following the valuable contribution made by the \nprevious President of the General Assembly, Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki, I would like to welcome the \nelection of Joseph Deiss as the President of the \nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session, and to wish him \nevery success. I also pay special tribute to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his consistent reaffirmation \nof the United Nations as an indispensable player in \nsolving crucial issues that have long been on the \ninternational agenda, which has become more complex \nand demanding than ever. \n As the youngest Member of the United Nations, \nMontenegro has proved itself a reliable partner in the \nUnited Nations mission to strive for a world of peace, \nsecurity and prosperity for everyone. At the same time, \nthanks to United Nations support, Montenegro has \nsignificantly enhanced its standing in international \norganizations, while ensuring the quality of reforms in \nits own State and society. The current improvement in \nglobal finances, albeit slight, shows that, in addition to \nthe crucial role of the largest and richest countries, \nespecially the Group of Eight and the Group of 20, the \nUnited Nations is essential to actions undertaken for \nthe stabilization of the global economy. \n Montenegro supports the pragmatic reform of the \nUnited Nations. We also welcome the recent adoption \nof General Assembly resolution 64/289 on system-wide \n  \n \n10-54965 28 \n \ncoherence and the timely initiative of Assembly \nPresident Joseph Deiss to make the theme of this year\u2019s \ngeneral debate the reaffirmation of the central role of \nthe United Nations in global governance. \n The protection of international peace and stability \ncontinues to be a focus of the General Assembly \nagenda. Convinced that no progress or stability can be \nensured without peace and security, Montenegro \nsupports and contributes to the efforts of the United \nNations in this regard, affirming the basic principles of \nthe United Nations Charter relating to the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes through diplomatic channels. \n Mindful of our foreign policy priorities of \nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic integration, when \nconsidering and taking any concrete action concerning \nconflict zones in the framework of the United Nations, \nMontenegro harmonizes its policy with European \nUnion foreign policy, taking due account of specific \nnational interests. We are best able to contribute by \ncontinuing to play a constructive role as a stabilizing \nfactor in the international community, especially in the \nWestern Balkans and South-East Europe. \n We strongly support United Nations efforts in \nimplementation of the Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy, and we welcome the idea of more intensive \nactivities in the preparation and drafting of a United \nNations convention on international terrorism. \nMontenegro is of the opinion that only through the \ncoordinated efforts of the international community can \nglobal terrorism be defeated. We support the various \nUnited Nations documents on the fight against \ncorruption, organized crime, illicit traffic in narcotic \ndrugs and trafficking in human beings. \n Montenegro has fully committed itself to \nimplementing all international legal instruments \nfostering disarmament and arms control. We support \nany new constructive initiative aimed at strengthening \ninternational cooperation for the reduction and \nelimination of all types of arms and lethal weapons. \n Montenegro deeply appreciates the importance \nand role of the United Nations peacekeeping mission as \na unique instrument for the creation and maintenance \nof peace and peacebuilding in conflict zones. Decades-\nlong experience in peacekeeping operations confirms \nthe validity of this concept and the strategic policy of \nthe United Nations. Peacekeeping operations have been \nsuccessful in reducing the negative effects of conflicts \nand preventing their further escalation and disruption \nof regional and international peace, stability and \nsecurity. \n Although a small country \u2014 and the youngest \nMember of the United Nations \u2014 Montenegro fully \nassumes its responsibility to contribute to the \nmaintenance of peace and stability, as is demonstrated \nby our continuously enhanced participation. We will \nmake further contributions in line with international \nefforts and in keeping with our tradition, the \nPrincipality of Montenegro having, as a sovereign \nState, participated in the international peacekeeping \nmission back in 1897. \n Montenegro believes in the crucial importance of \nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and of \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). We are sure that this aim will be furthered by \nthe exchange of views and recommendations at the \nrecent High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, and Montenegro supports the \nimplementation of all relevant strategies, programmes \nand initiatives of the United Nations in this regard. The \ncrisis has also brought home to us the necessity of \nfurther realizing the sustainable development concept, \nwhich requires a balance between economic and social \ndevelopment and environmental protection. To this \nend, we remain committed to the resolutions of the \nUnited Nations and the Commission on Sustainable \nDevelopment, which have also been fully reflected in \nthe Millennium Declaration of 2000. \n Montenegro supports the ongoing efforts and \nattention of the United Nations to the current \nchallenges in Africa. To this end, the fulfilment of the \nMDGs and the implementation of all United Nations \ndocuments, including the Millennium summit \ndecisions, is of crucial importance.  \n As a country engaged in the process of European \nintegration, Montenegro supports partnership \nrelationships between the European Union and Africa, \nas well as efforts undertaken to solve development \nchallenges and eradicate poverty on the African \ncontinent. \n In the context of climate change and its adverse \neffects, we are fully committed to finding a common \nresponse in accordance with the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change. We are \ndeeply committed to this end, in view of the effects of \nthe natural disasters that occurred in the past year \ncausing heavy loss of life and enormous material \n \n \n29 10-54965 \n \ndamage, in particular the earthquake in Haiti and the \nfloods in Pakistan. Therefore, a global response and \naction is required, and not only at the humanitarian \nlevel. Efforts aimed at reducing the effects of natural \ndisasters and at the rebuilding and further development \nof affected regions and countries are also necessary. \n In order to act responsibly with respect to the \ncomplex issue of climate change, we have established, \ntogether with neighbouring countries and countries \nfrom the region, a regional forum in Montenegro which \ndeals with the prevention of climate change and related \nchallenges at the national and regional levels. \n Montenegro is fully dedicated to the promotion \nand universal protection of human rights and \nfundamental freedoms for everyone. We strongly \nsupport the activities of the Human Rights Council and \nthe Office of the High Commissioner for Human \nRights, including their more intensive functional \ninteraction with the General Assembly and relevant \nCommittees. \n We believe in the potential and capacities of the \nUnited Nations, especially when strengthened by the \nactive participation and robust contributions of each \nMember State, to find adequate responses and take \nactions aimed at resolving the ever-increasing global \nchallenges. As an institution dedicated to individuals \nand humankind collectively, which continues to affirm \npeace and prosperity, the United Nations remains of \nirreplaceable global value, and Montenegro is proud to \nbelong to it.  \n I assure the Assembly that Montenegro will \ncontinue to give its strong support to strengthening and \nupholding the United Nations, so that the latter may \nimprove its efficiency, responsibility and readiness to \nmeet the needs of each Member State."

        "file_text": "It is an honour to address the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. Allow me \nto express my gratitude to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki \nfor having ably presided over this body during the past \nyear and to congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on being \nelected the new President of the General Assembly. \n Fifteen years ago, the Dayton Peace Agreement \nended the aggression in and brought peace to Bosnia \nand Herzegovina. My country has come a long way \nsince then, and I feel obliged to thank the \nGovernments, organizations and individuals who \nassisted us in travelling down this road. \n When we asked the General Assembly to support \nus in becoming a member of the Security Council, it \nhonoured us with almost unanimous support, for which \nwe offer our thanks. That support demonstrated that the \nAssembly holds Bosnia and Herzegovina in high \nesteem, and we are proud of that. As a member of the \nSecurity Council, we are doing our best to meet the \nAssembly\u2019s expectations and honour its trust. \n Thanks to the generous assistance of many \nGovernments represented here, Bosnia and \nHerzegovina completed the main process of \nreconstruction relatively quickly, particularly in the \nlight of the level of devastation. But the rebuilding of \nour devastated society has proved to be much more \ndifficult. From 1992 to 1995, an age-old, genuinely \nmulticultural society in Bosnia and Herzegovina was \nbrutally and intentionally torn apart by force. Half of \nthe population of Bosnia and Herzegovina had to leave \ntheir homes in order to save their lives. Some \n1,300,000 of them remain outside Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. Systematic obstructions were the cause \nof failure of return programmes, and they are still an \nobstacle to those who want to return. Those who made \nit back to their homes are often confronted with \nblockade walls or with outright violations of basic \nrights. That makes the restoration of our pluralist \nsociety the single most difficult task ahead of us. \n But hope remains that the upcoming \nconstitutional changes will lay a foundation for the \nnew generation to be able to bridge the divides. No \nmatter what, we will continue to revive the pluralist \ncharacter and tolerant spirit of our society because we \nstrongly believe that cultural pluralism is humankind\u2019s \nmost precious treasure.  \n A healthy economy can be a powerful tool for \nachieving that goal. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a \ncountry rich in water and other energy-generating \nresources. We have undertaken studies and invited \ninternational investors to participate in developing \nthese resources. Once completed, these projects will be \nthe driving engine of our economy, enabling us to \nmake progress in other areas, such as health care and \nsocial services. \n We continue to develop our infrastructure and \nagricultural resources, but not at a desirable pace. \nAlthough generally improved, our education system \nremains in some aspects hostage to divisive political \ninfluences. On the other hand, our rising trade \nactivities have resulted in improving our relations with \nthe countries in the region, and great opportunities can \nbe unlocked through more intensive and more \nconfident regional cooperation. \n As is the case in other societies, our greatest \nresource is our youth, educated in our country and \nabroad, and ready to take over once our economy is \nable to absorb their skills and talents. I am confident \nthat, in the coming years, employment opportunities \nwill grow in proportion to the development of the vast \nuntapped resources of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \n Defence reform is commonly seen as one of our \ngreatest post-Dayton successes because it resulted in \nunified, modern armed forces. Here again, we have to \nexpress our appreciation to our friends and allies \nwhose assistance made this achievement possible. In a \nshort amount of time, our armed forces have managed \nto earn the trust and respect of the United Nations \nthrough their participation in peacekeeping missions. \n Like everywhere else, the citizens of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina desire peace, stability and prosperity, as \nwell as a better future for themselves and their \nchildren. There is great potential for development, and \nopportunities are there to be seized. Yes, there are \nreasons for optimism, but there are reasons for concern \ntoo. \n Our progress is hindered by the remnants of those \nwho still believe in the completion of the political \nproject that brought catastrophe not only to Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, but to the whole region. In short, they \nthink that the world has forgotten the atrocities \ncommitted against the civilian population, the \nconcentration camps, the rape camps and the genocide. \nAfter hundreds of thousands of non-Serb civilians were \nkilled and expelled from one part of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, they are now publicly calling for the \n  \n \n10-55103 22 \n \nsecession of that part. They hope and dream, as they \nsay, that the world will somehow recognize that entity \nas an independent State. Instead of feeling shame, \nthese disciples of Milo\u0161evic, Karad\u017eic and Ratko \nMladic are now ready to come and ask the international \ncommunity to reward the genocide in Srebrenica, \nPrijedor, Zvornik, Sarajevo, Mostar and other sites of \nhorrific crimes for which Karad\u017eic is now being tried \nat the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \nYugoslavia in the Hague. What a monument to \ninhumanity that would be! \n Of course, they will not succeed. They can no \nlonger count on the mighty armies of Slobodan \nMilo\u0161evic because those armies were defeated through \nour heroic struggle. They do count on, as they say, \nfavourable geopolitical circumstances. But they fail to \ntake one thing into account, as Milo\u0161evic did. Bosnia \nwill be defended. \n They will, however, continue obstructing \nprogress in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and they will \ncontinue destabilizing the region. They found \ninspiration in the inadequate response of the \ninternational community, whose patience they have \nbeen testing for the past 15 years. So, our collective \nresolve to prevent the escalation and opening of fresh \nwounds in Bosnia and Herzegovina is being tested \nagain. We must not fail this time. \n This dangerous adventurism aside, I believe and I \nknow that the train of progress cannot and will not be \nstopped. There is no doubt in my mind that Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and our entire region will maintain \nstability and achieve prosperity in the coming years, \nthus fulfilling the dreams and desires of every one of \nour citizens."

        "file_text": "It is \nmy pleasure at the outset to congratulate Mr. Joseph \nDeiss sincerely on his election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. As he \nrepresents the friendly Swiss Confederation, I shall \nnow say a few words on behalf of the people of Kuwait \nin one of the official languages of his country. \nAllow me, on behalf of the people of Kuwait and \nmyself, to congratulate Mr. Deiss on his election. We \nare certain that, thanks to his wisdom and experience, \ncoupled with the prestigious standing of his friendly \ncountry, the Swiss Confederation, with which we enjoy \na very solid relationship on the international stage, our \ndeliberations will be crowned with success. Also, I cannot but commend the sincere efforts of \nhis predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam \nTreki, and express our utmost thanks and appreciation \nto him for the successful and distinguished way in \nwhich he conducted the work of the previous session. \n I also wish to express our great pride in the \nsincere efforts of His Excellency the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to achieve the international \npurposes and principles we are all pursuing in order to \nstrengthen the concepts of international cooperation \nand respect for international legitimacy, as well as to \nfoster the principles of the United Nations Charter. \n Soon we shall be celebrating the sixty-fifth \nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations. It is \nour hope that the success story of the United Nations \nwill continue for many years to come, not only because \nit is considered the best multilateral international \nmechanism there is, but also because it is the most \nlegitimate, neutral and credible institution. Over the \nspan of six decades it has demonstrated its ability to \nprevent destructive wars and maintain international \npeace and security.  \n However, since the challenges and threats facing \nthe international community are increasing rather than \ndecreasing and are becoming more tangled and \ncomplex, the role of the Organization has had to be \nexpanded and strengthened in importance and vitality \nin order to deal with social crises and problems. Those \ninclude poverty and hunger, the spread of diseases and \nepidemics, the scourge of drug trafficking and \norganized crime and violations of human rights. \nEconomic problems must be confronted, including the \nincrease in food prices and the global economic and \nfinancial crisis, and security challenges \u2014 such as \nterrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nand ongoing armed conflicts in a number of regions of \nthe world \u2014 must be addressed.  \n Together, over the past two years all those \ndifferent challenges have contributed to wiping out \nmuch of the progress and gains that a great number of \ndeveloping countries had made towards achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n Natural disasters have also had a destructive \neffect on the economies of many developing countries, \ncausing tremendous loss of life and of property. The \nmost striking examples were the earthquake that hit \nHaiti last January and the floods that swept Pakistan \nlast month.  \n There is no doubt that plenty of work remains to \nbe done to limit the dangers of the climate change \nphenomenon. We hope the conference in Canc\u00fan, \nMexico in November will provide us with the \nopportunity to reach a binding agreement that will \ndetermine the required goals, the time frame for their \nfulfilment, the responsibilities of Member States, and \nthe joint action mechanisms for guaranteeing the \nfinancing and technology transfer commitments from \ndeveloped to developing countries to help them adapt \nto climate change and cope with its impact. \n Without doubt, those challenges require \ncontinued reform and improvement of the organs, \nagencies and programmes of the United Nations, so as \nto keep pace with the changes in international relations \nand to improve their performance. \n In that regard, we welcome the adoption of \nGeneral Assembly resolution 64/289, entitled \u201cSystem-\nwide coherence\u201d. It established a new composite \nentity \u2014 UN Women \u2014 to foster international efforts \nto accelerate gender equality and women\u2019s \n  \n \n10-54959 30 \n \nempowerment and created a Deputy Secretary-General \nposition for this purpose. \n On another topic, we believe that after 17 years \nof negotiations to reform the Security Council, it is \nhigh time to take the necessary steps to improve and \ndevelop the work of the Council and make it more \ntransparent. Its membership must be expanded in \naccordance with standards and controls that would \nachieve a fair balance in representation and efficiency \nin the discharge of its duties and responsibilities. Such \nmeasures should also guarantee the right of the Arab \nand Muslim States to be represented in a manner that \nreflects their size, their contributions and their role in \ndefending the purposes and principles of the Charter. \n In affirmation of its steadfast support for the \nefforts and activities of the United Nations in various \nfields, the State of Kuwait has continued to extend a \nhelping hand to the needy in different parts of the \nworld. Furthermore, in consolidating the principles of \nKuwait\u2019s foreign policy, the Kuwait Fund for Arab \nEconomic Development has continued to provide \u2014 as \nit has for the past five decades \u2014 assistance and \ngrants, which to date have benefited more than \n100 countries all over the world with concessionary \nloans totalling $14.5 billion. That is equivalent to \n1.31 per cent of Kuwait\u2019s gross national product \u2014 \ntwice the level of official development assistance \nagreed upon internationally. \n Based on Kuwait\u2019s firm belief in the vitally \nimportant role of the United Nations in easing the \nhuman suffering resulting from natural disasters or \nconflicts, Kuwait has decided to increase almost five-\nfold its voluntary contributions to a number of United \nNations agencies, funds and programmes. Kuwait will \ndo so out of its desire to support those humanitarian \nactivities and to deepen its joint cooperation with the \nUnited Nations. \n As we celebrate the golden jubilee of our \nindependence, and in implementation of the desire of \nHis Highness the Emir of the State of Kuwait to \ntransform the country into a regional financial and \ntrade centre, a development plan has been approved for \nthe period 2010 to 2014. A budget of almost \n$115 billion has been allocated to develop \ninfrastructure, build ports and railways and construct \nnew cities, as well as to continue to work to improve \nthe level of basic services provided to citizens and \nresidents alike.  \n In that context, the State of Kuwait is proud to be \na leader, in the Arab world and internationally, in terms \nof the quality of education, living standards and health \ncare services, as well as in the fields of gender \nequality, economic achievement and political \nfreedoms, according to rankings issued by international \norganizations, specialized agencies and non-\ngovernmental organizations. \n Twenty years have now passed since the invasion \nand occupation of the State of Kuwait by the former \nIraqi regime. It is a painful anniversary that we and our \nbrothers in Iraq are determined to overcome by laying \nthe foundations for stable relations based on the \nprinciples of the mutual respect for sovereignty, \nindependence, good neighbourliness and non-\nintervention in the internal affairs of other States. We \nwill seek to resolve all differences by peaceful means, \nto respect all resolutions of international legitimacy \nand to implement remaining commitments stipulated \nby relevant Security Council resolutions.  \n The State of Kuwait is optimistic regarding future \nrelations between the two countries and is totally ready \nto provide all sorts of support to assist the Iraqi \nGovernment in its efforts to enforce security and \nstability and to preserve the sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of Iraq, as well as to rebuild the various State \nsectors that have suffered as a result of the adventures \nof the former regime and its hostile expansionist \npolicies. \n In that regard, we hope that the ongoing \nnegotiations between the different parties and political \nforces in Iraq will lead to the formation of a \nGovernment of national unity that represents the entire \nspectrum of Iraqi society and all its political \ncomponents. Such a Government should be able to \naddress the country\u2019s security, political and economic \nchallenges and fulfil the needs and aspirations of the \nIraqi people to build a free, democratic and unified Iraq \nliving in peace with itself and its neighbours and \ncontributing to the consolidation of the pillars of \nsecurity and stability in the region. \n The State of Kuwait, in its capacity as Chair of \nthe current session of the Gulf Cooperation Council \n(GCC), hopes that communication at all levels will \ncontinue between the sisterly United Arab Emirates \nand the friendly Islamic Republic of Iran to seek a \nresolution to the conflict over the occupied Emarati \nIslands, in line with the principles and norms of \n \n \n31 10-54959 \n \ninternational law and on the basis of good-neighbourly \nrelations, as set out in the resolutions issued by GCC \nsummits and ministerial meetings. \n While the State of Kuwait affirms the right of \nStates to utilize nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, \nwe call on all States with such programmes to \ncooperate with the International Atomic Energy \nAgency and to take whatever steps are necessary to \nbuild confidence so as to reassure the international \ncommunity about the nature of their nuclear \nprogrammes, in line with resolutions of international \nlegitimacy. We also emphasize the need to resolve \nthose issues peacefully through diplomatic means and \ndirect negotiations between the parties concerned. That \nwill pave the way to the establishment of a zone free of \nnuclear weapons in the Middle East, in implementation \nof the resolution adopted at the Non-Proliferation \nTreaty Review Conference held at the United Nations \nHeadquarters last May. \n The Arab-Israeli conflict is considered the gravest \nthreat to peace and security in the Middle East region. \nThe failure of the United Nations over the past six \ndecades to find a solution to that pivotal issue has \ncontributed to the complication of the Palestine \nquestion and has prompted Israel, the occupying \nPower, to persist in its disrespect of international \nlegitimacy. Israel has also persisted in its settlement \npolicy, imposed a siege on Gaza and destroyed the \nlandmarks of Jerusalem in order to Judaize it.  \n Moreover, instead of welcoming the Arab Peace \nInitiative as a strategic choice and the nucleus of the \npeace process in the Middle East, Israel has continued \nto confiscate territory and to torture and detain \nunarmed Palestinian civilians. It has used the rockets \nlaunched against it as a pretext to launch savage wars \nand to use excessive force. All of that is in addition to \nits arrogant attack on the Turkish freedom flotilla in \ninternational waters.  \n Israel is confident of its impunity and thus \ncommits crimes continuously and systematically, \nwithout any adequate response from the international \ncommunity to its arrogance. We therefore reaffirm the \nresponsibility of the international community and of \nthe Security Council for the maintenance of peace and \nsecurity, as well as to deal seriously and sternly with \nIsrael and force it to comply with the international will. \n We hope that the direct negotiations that began at \nthe start of this month between the Palestinian \nAuthority and Israel will lead to the restoration of the \nlegitimate rights of the Palestinian people, the \nachievement of a just and comprehensive peace in the \nMiddle East and the establishment of a Palestinian \nState, with Jerusalem as its capital, in line with \nrelevant Security Council resolutions, the principle of \nland for peace, the Road Map and the Arab Peace \nInitiative. \n We also renew our full support to the Syrian Arab \nRepublic in regaining its occupied lands in the Golan \nand the return to the line of 4 June 1967. We also stress \nthe need for implementing Security Council resolution \n1701 (2006) and putting an end to repeated Israeli \nviolations of Lebanese airspace and of the Blue Line of \nseparation. We also emphasize the need for Israel to \nwithdrawal from all occupied Lebanese territories. \n The peoples of the world want to live in a clean, \nsafe and stable environment. In recent decades, we \nhave been able to enact numerous international \nagreements and conventions under the umbrella of the \nUnited Nations to ensure dignified lives for our \npeoples in a world where justice and equality prevail. \nWe must therefore shoulder our responsibilities and \nadhere to our commitments in order to fulfil the hopes \nand aspirations of all the peoples of the world."

        "file_text": "His \nMajesty Mohammed VI, the King of Morocco, has \nhonoured me by asking me to deliver his statement to \nthe General Assembly. \n  \u201cAllow me, at the outset, to congratulate \nyou, Mr. President, on being elected to preside \nover the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \nsession, and to commend your predecessor, \nMr. Ali Treki, on having given fresh dynamism to \nthe proceedings of the Assembly. I would also \nlike to express my deep appreciation to His \nExcellency the Secretary-General, who spares no \neffort to enhance the role of the United Nations. \n  \u201cThis session, which is being held 10 years \nafter the Millennium Summit, is a great \nopportunity for us to agree on a consensual vision \nto steer our joint action for the years to come and \nto reiterate our commitment to the three basic \naxes underlying that vision, namely, security and \nstability, development and prosperity, and \nadvancement of human rights and human dignity. \nThose priorities form the bedrock of the new \ninternational agenda. This important meeting \ntherefore provides us a good opportunity to \nreassert our commitment to tackling those \npriorities and to reiterate our determination to \npromote international cooperation and lay solid \ngroundwork for a new world where safety and \nsolidarity prevail. \n  \u201cMorocco, which firmly believes in the \nimportant position of the United Nations as the \nsymbol of universal values and international \nlegitimacy, has worked tirelessly to give the \nOrganization active and concrete support, to \npromote its principles and to contribute to the \nachievement of its objectives. Indeed, my country \nhas also actively sought to ensure that its national \npriorities are in line with issues on the \ninternational agenda. \n  \u201cPeacekeeping was the main objective \nbehind the creation of the United Nations, which \nis playing a key role for all mankind. From this \nrostrum, the Kingdom of Morocco calls on the \ninternational community to increase its \ninvolvement and work for the settlement of all \ndisputes \u2014 whether overt or covert \u2014 that strain \n  \n \n10-55122 32 \n \nrelations between neighbouring States and \nhamper the indispensable integration of their \neconomies, particularly in Africa. \n  \u201cTo foster healthier relations in our \nMaghreb region, we submitted an autonomy \ninitiative to the United Nations in 2007 with a \nview to bringing an end to the artificial dispute \nover the recovery by Morocco of its southern \nprovinces. That bold, innovative initiative has \nreceived the support of the international \ncommunity and the Security Council, which have \nrepeatedly described the efforts underlying it as \nserious and credible. They have also commended \nMorocco\u2019s active steps to facilitate the settlement \nof this dispute, which seriously jeopardizes the \nintegration of the Arab Maghreb and the \nprosperity of the peoples of its five countries. \n  \u201cIn that context, the Kingdom of Morocco \ncalls on the other partners to seize this historic \nopportunity and engage in substantive and serious \nnegotiations under the auspices of the Secretary-\nGeneral and his Personal Envoy, to whom we \nreiterate our sincere willingness to cooperate. \n  \u201cThe need to free our region from the yoke \nof this dispute, which hampers our joint action, \nhas never been greater, not only for us, but also \nfor our strategic partners. We must therefore \nsettle this dispute, given the numerous pressing \nchallenges facing us, especially with respect to \nsecurity in the Sahara and Sahel regions and in \nthe Mediterranean basin. \n  \u201cAchieving peace in the Middle East is not \nan impossible goal, nor is the persistence of the \nconflict inevitable. The only solution to the \nconflict remains that of two States, living side by \nside in peace and security. \n  \u201cThe international community is therefore \ncalled upon to support the direct negotiation \nprocess taking place under the commendable \nauspices of the United States Administration. \nThis is a good opportunity to strive to achieve a \nfinal settlement, in compliance with international \nlegitimacy and the relevant United Nations \nresolutions and on the basis of a clear frame of \nreference, a comprehensive agenda and a specific \ntimetable. \n  \u201cAs an active player in the peace process, \nMorocco is aware that such negotiations must \naddress the issue of establishing a fully sovereign \nPalestinian State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its \ncapital, as well as the related and complex issues, \nand that for negotiations to succeed, unilateral \nactions must be avoided and settlement building \nmust end, especially in Al-Quds Al-Sharif. \n  \u201cAs Chair of the Al-Quds Committee, I \nhave consistently drawn the attention of the \nUnited Nations and of the international \ncommunity to the sensitive nature of the issue of \nAl-Quds Al-Sharif and to attempts to Judaize that \nHoly City and obliterate its character. Al-Quds \nmust remain a symbol of coexistence and concord \nbetween the monotheistic religions, a city of \npeace and of coexistence between the Palestinian \nand the Israeli peoples. \n \u201cTwo days ago, we took stock of the \nprogress that has thus far been made in achieving \nthe Millennium Development Goals. We agreed \nthat a combination of crises, including the \nadverse effects of climate change, has clearly \ndelayed the attainment of most of these Goals in \nmany developing countries, particularly on our \nAfrican continent. \n \u201cWith a population of more than 900 \nmillion people and natural resources abundant \nenough to ensure the continent\u2019s self-sufficiency, \nAfrica is indeed capable of enjoying steady \ngrowth and development. This potential \nnotwithstanding, Africa largely remains on the \nsidelines when it comes to foreign direct \ninvestment flows, a trend which has been \ncompounded further by the global economic and \nfinancial crisis. The Kingdom of Morocco \ntherefore proposes that the General Assembly \nhold a high-level dialogue on investment in \nAfrica. \n \u201cSimilarly, the magnitude of the challenges \nposed by globalization requires from the \ninternational community urgent, substantial \nreforms of the existing international economic \ngovernance institutions as well as further \nmobilization to lay the foundations for a new, \nequitable, balanced and efficient international \nenvironmental order that will enable us to \n \n \n33 10-55122 \n \nsafeguard our planet for the sake of current and \nfuture generations. \n \u201cThe Kingdom of Morocco has committed \nitself irreversibly to protect and promote human \nrights. To this end, it will implement a \ncomprehensive strategy based on a participatory \napproach which places special emphasis on \nhuman resources development and the promise of \na dignified life, these being the key elements in \nour endeavour to build a democratic society \ndedicated to development. \n \u201cAccordingly, Morocco has launched a \nprogramme of major workshops and reforms. \nSubstantial progress has been made towards \nexpanding the scope of individual and collective \nfreedoms, safeguarding human dignity and \npromoting and protecting the rights of its citizens, \nespecially those of women, children and people \nwith special needs. \n \u201cInternationally, Morocco has manifested a \ndeep commitment to protecting human rights \nsince the establishment of the Human Rights \nCouncil and its operational mechanisms. This \ncommitment was recognized in March 2010, \nwhen Morocco was chosen by the General \nAssembly to be a co-facilitator of the review \nprocess aimed at charting a renewed vision for \nthe Council by putting human capital at the heart \nof human resources development and sustainable \ndevelopment. \n \u201cMorocco will spare no effort to achieve \nthis goal and to help develop a shared, \nresponsible vision of the true values of human \nrights, a vision which excludes empty slogans and \nthe tendentious manipulation of lofty objectives. \n \u201cThe world still has a long way to go before \nStates and peoples learn to accept diversity and \nmake it a genuine source of spiritual, social and \ncultural enrichment. More than a necessity, \ndialogue among civilizations has become an \nurgent priority. \n \u201cIndeed, it is of the utmost importance that \nthe United Nations become the standard-bearer of \na culture of peace, tolerance and mutual \nunderstanding and that it serve as a catalyst for a \nnew form of cooperation based on solidarity and \ndedicated to achieving dignity, prosperity, well-\nbeing and peace for all people everywhere.\u201d \n "

        "file_text": "It has \nnow been more than 65 years since the nations of the \nworld, exhausted, and in some cases devastated, by \nyears of war, established the United Nations. Canada \nwas one of those nations \u2014 one of the many, in fact, \nwhose fresh experience of conflict had persuaded their \npeoples that the possibility of a better world, one in \nwhich nations resolved their differences peacefully, \nwas an objective worthy of their every effort. \n Today, the Canadian people continue to believe in \nthat purpose and will continue to strive to live by the \nprinciples that would make it possible. Such principles are enshrined in the Charter of \nthis Organization; that same United Nations Charter \nendorsed with happiness and hope by a former \nCanadian Government on that auspicious June day in \nSan Francisco in 1945. \n Those foundational beliefs recognize the \nsovereign equality of countries. They remind us of the \nobligation to settle disputes peacefully, and they \ndemand we seek justice and uphold the human rights of \nall people. Those are values that Canadians hold dear, \nand, as the universal membership of this body implies, \nso do peoples the world over. That widespread \nconsensus continues to convince the idealist in all of us \nthat so much more is possible in this world of ours. \n At the same time, it makes the gap between \naspiration and achievement so disappointing. It calls us \nonward to do more, as successive Canadian \nGovernments have worked diligently to do for almost a \nlifetime. \n Those ideals, as well as an acute awareness of the \nbroad concerns of the international community, \nespecially those of the developing countries, continue \nto animate the Government of Canada, the Government \nthat I lead today.\n Those ideals have the enthusiastic support of the \nCanadian people, and I do not foresee any day or \nmotivation that would lead us to cease in our \nendeavours in this regard.  \n The question, as always, is how this is to be done. \nOur preference is to take meaningful action, action that \nproduces real results, action that helps people in their \nstruggle with oppression, disaster and poverty.\n Let me just run through some of those actions. As \na founding member of the United Nations and the \nseventh-largest contributor to its finances, Canada has \nbeen a consistently reliable and responsible participant \nin United Nations initiatives around the world. This \nwas so in the earliest days of the United Nations. It was \nso during the difficult days of the cold war, \ndecolonization and the struggle against apartheid, and \nit remains so today. Canada continues to pay, for \ninstance, a heavy price to fulfil our United Nations \nobligation to support the lawful Government of \nAfghanistan. We pay it with the resources of Canadian \ntaxpayers, but more profoundly in sorrow for the \npriceless lives of our young men and women who serve \nthere in the Canadian forces, as well as, sadly, civilians \nwho have also given their sweat and their lives in the \nservice of both our country and the people of \nAfghanistan. \n In Afghanistan, our military efforts have gone \nhand in hand with our reconstruction and development \nprogrammes. In particular, Canada supports those such \nas the Dahla Dam, which will have enduring economic \nbenefit. \nWe have also invested heavily in other programmes \nwhich will improve the lives of that country\u2019s most \nvulnerable citizens, and we will continue to do so. \n Our international engagement is by no means \nrestricted to Afghanistan. In fact, elsewhere in the \nworld, we have also expanded our efforts. We pledge to \n \n \n45 10-54827 \n \ndouble our aid to Africa,thereby making Canada a \nleader in the Group of Eight (G-8). \nAnd we are on track to double our overall development \nassistance by March of next year. Furthermore, we \nhave untied food aid, and all Canadian aid will be \nuntied by 2013. Such measures significantly extend the \npurchasing power of Canadian aid funds. \n Canada was also among the first last year at the \nG-8 Summit at L\u2019Aquila to double support for \nagricultural development. During the economic crisis \nas well, we acted, in concert with our Group of Twenty \n(G-20) partners, to increase the lending capacity of \ndevelopment organizations like the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank and the African Development \nBank. In particular, we have made a significant \ncontribution to peace and security in Africa, including \nto peace initiatives, humanitarian assistance and \nreconstruction in the Sudan, since taking office in \nJanuary 2006. \nWe have also provided leadership in peacebuilding in \nSierra Leone.  \n Canada welcomes the resumption of direct talks \nbetween Israel and the Palestinian Authority. We \nsincerely hope that the discussions will be successful, \nand we will continue to assist the Palestinian Authority \nin building its institutions.  \n As members know, we have also engaged very \nextensively in Haiti, both before and since the terrible \nearthquake earlier this year. Canada was among the \nfirst nations to provide tangible relief in various forms, \nand it has made a long-term commitment to assist the \npeople of Haiti in rebuilding their severely damaged \ncountry. \n Most recently, Pakistan has faced devastating \nfloods, and Canada has again responded swiftly. All \nthese actions are born from Canadian ideals. \n So allow me to say one thing. This Assembly \nshould know that Canada is eligible to serve on the \nSecurity Council. And if we are elected, we will be \nready to serve. \nAnd if called upon to serve on the Security Council, we \nshall be informed by these ideals and strive to further \nthem, just as we have striven to implement Security \nCouncil resolutions. \n I should also mention Canada\u2019s role this year as \nChair of the G-8 and host of the most recent meeting of \nthe G-20. We have tried to ensure that these gatherings \nserve the broader interests of the entire global \ncommunity. In preparation for the G-20, we conducted \nwide-ranging outreach sessions, including with the \nSecretaries-General of the Commonwealth, la \nFrancophonie and, of course, this Organization. We \nused our chairmanship of the G-8 to reach out to \nleaders from Africa and the Americas and to secure an \nagreement to enact the Muskoka Initiative for \nmaternal, newborn and child health.  \nSuch progress is literally vital in meeting the most \nachievable of the United Nations Millennium \nDevelopment Goals \u2014 to reduce the appalling \nmortality among mothers and children in developing \ncountries. \n We are mobilizing support from donor nations \nand private foundations. Together, we should be able to \nmobilize more than $10 billion over five years. This \nwill contribute in a major way to the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Global Strategy for Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s \nHealth. Likewise, we announced here two day ago that \nCanadian taxpayers would make an enhanced \nreplenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \nTuberculosis and Malaria.\n We did these things for one simple reason: to \nalleviate the suffering and, indeed, save the lives of \npeople all over the world who are among the millions \nafflicted with these grave and debilitating diseases. \nActions such as these are a moral imperative. It is \nessential that we strive to make a significant, actual \ndifference in the lives of the world\u2019s most \ndisadvantaged people. Who, seeing his neighbour \ndistressed, will pass by on the other side of the road? \n That is why we have also used our chairmanship \nof the G-8 to further the essential ethic of \naccountability. We published the first accountability \nreport to ensure that, as donor countries, we fulfil the \npledges that we make. Our words must be translated \ninto action and we must make a real difference to those \nwho need our help. And to that end, as many of you \nalso know, Canadian taxpayers have forgiven debts \n  \n \n10-54827 46 \n \ntotalling $1 billion owed by the world\u2019s poorest \ncountries. \n However, let us not limit our horizons by looking \njust at the least we can do. Much higher goals are \nwithin our capacity if we will but reach for them. In the \nshort time that I have here today, there is one thought \nabove all others that I wish to share.\n It is the pressing need in the twenty-first century \nfor all the States of the world to adopt an enlightened \nview of sovereignty. As I said earlier, respect for \nsovereignty is a fundamental principle of the United \nNations. However, the global recession of the past two \nyears has taught us, we hope, a painful lesson. We have \nbeen forcefully reminded that, in this shrinking world, \nwe all travel together in a single boat, not as solo \nvoyagers, and that how we travel together matters. This \nis because our interests are all interconnected: from \nclimate change to health and pandemic threats and to, \nof course, the economy.\n For example, nations that do not consider the \neffects of their economic choices on others may hurt \nnot only their trading partners, but themselves as well. \nThose who succumb to the lure of protectionism soon \nfind that trading partners denied a market also lack the \nmeans to be a customer. To recognize that is to \nunderstand the need for enlightened sovereignty, the \nidea that what is good for others may well be the best \nway to pursue one\u2019s own interests. In business, it is \ncalled win-win, and it is good for business. In \ninternational affairs, it is good for development and for \njustice, and it is in the spirit of the United Nations \nCharter. It is therefore of the highest importance, in a \npassionate world of competing interests and principles, \nwhere every person left to himself does what is right in \nhis own sight. In such a world, the need for an \nenlightened, expansive view of sovereignty is as great \nnow as it ever was. \n At the outset of these remarks, I referred to the \norigins of the United Nations. It was founded at the end \nof the greatest and most destructive war that had ever \ndisturbed the ocean of humanity. That war was \ncertainly attributable in part to an extreme and \npernicious nationalism. But we should never forget that \nappeasement and expediency also allowed fascism to \ngather such strength that it required the whole and \nundivided effort of the world\u2019s free peoples to subdue \nit. \n The United Nations mission has grown over time, \nbut its core job remains the same: through peace and \ndevelopment, to build a better world, to prevent war \nand conflict, yet at the same time, to uphold what is \nright and to protect the weak and the poor from those \nwho prey upon them.\n The Government of Canada has always been \ndeeply committed to these objectives and to the \nOrganization that nurtures them. It remains so today.\n As we attend to our own affairs, in, for example, \nthe protection of Canada\u2019s Arctic or the promotion of \nour trade or the pursuit of our values, Canada will be \nguided by the same advice we prescribe for others. We \nwill listen to their concerns, we will speak the truth, \nand we will act with vigour. We will do all these things \never mindful that peace and opportunity for all remain, \nalways, our ultimate purpose.  \n I know it has been a long meeting this morning, \nand I thank members for their attention."

        "file_text": "I bring the warm greetings of \n\u201cYokwe\u201d from the Republic of the Marshall Islands. \n Every September since the country became a \nmember of the United Nations in 1991, leaders of the \nlow-lying Republic of the Marshall Islands have been \nreminding the international community of the need for \nfull global action on climate change. \n We have no mountains or high ground; we have \nonly our narrow archipelago resting a metre above the \nocean. There has been enough talk, and too much \nrepetition. It is now time for meaningful action, \ncreative cooperation and visible results to address \nclimate change. If we fail in the short-term, the \neconomic and moral costs for our low-lying islands \u2014 \nand eventually the whole world \u2014 will be beyond \ncalculation. \n The global commitment at Copenhagen to \nsafeguard the most vulnerable faces a true litmus test: \nwill our local communities see visible results leading \ntowards a climate-resilient future? I urge that by the \ntime of the climate change talks in Canc\u00fan nations \nbuild political trust through \u201cfast start\u201d finance, by \nproviding transparent information and actively turning \ncommitments into results. \n We cannot wait for the uncertain path to achieve \na full multilateral climate agreement, and we cannot \nallow laggards to set us back. Those most vulnerable \nand those willing to confront the challenges facing us \nmust take leadership in this process by putting forward \nour own agreement spelling out real and ambitious \ncommitments and actions to address climate change. \nAnd we urge others to follow. \n To work in true partnership we must first show \nour own commitment. The Marshall Islands \nGovernment has endorsed a new climate change road \nmap, spelling out specific actions to cut our own \nemissions by 40 per cent by 2020, and concrete \nstrategies to ensure that the growth of our local \ncommunities is safeguarded from climate impacts. \n The Marshall Islands has made important \nprogress towards achieving several Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, but much remains to be \naccomplished. With our international partners, we must \nalso better address climate change risks in the context \nof our core development. \n  \n \n10-55103 2 \n \n Practical and \u201cshovel ready\u201d adaptation actions \ntaken now \u2014 water security, resource conservation and \ninfrastructure protection \u2014 will sharply reduce the \nlong-term risks to our security and sovereignty. But we \ncannot ignore such threats. It should be a matter of \nserious concern to the Secretary-General that we are \nactively contemplating risks to our territorial integrity \nand United Nations membership, that we are \nconsidering options to safeguard our population\u2019s \npolitical rights if our land \u2014and our thin water table \u2014 \nbecomes unusable in the face of rising seas. \n The Republic of the Marshall Islands is known to \nthe United Nations as a small island developing State, \nbut we are first and foremost a large ocean nation. Our \nthin atolls may appear tiny on a map, but our exclusive \neconomic zone is over 2 million square kilometres. As \nChair of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement, I address \nthe United Nations on behalf of a unified political bloc \nvested in ensuring the future of the Western and \nCentral Pacific, the world\u2019s largest viable tuna fishery. \n The development pathways of the Parties to the \nNauru Agreement are narrow and limited, and at the \nhighest levels we have committed to putting a firm stop \nto the unrestricted global harvest of our resources. The \nstatus quo of overfishing is unacceptable; it has \nstrangled our development and threatened the viability \nof our resources. We have closed off surrounding \npockets of international waters, and if our development \nand ecosystem needs so demand, we will close off \nmore. \n We currently realize only a tiny fraction of a \nmultibillion-dollar industry \u2014 only one penny from \neach can of Pacific tuna \u2014 and we are seeking global \nsupport and economic partnership to grow our benefit. \nWithout political and economic cooperation in regional \nfisheries decision-making, and unless fishing targets \nare in line with science, the collective economic \ndevelopment of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement \nwill remain at a standstill as our coastal resources \ndecline. We have already driven our partners to achieve \npositive action. However, far greater efforts are \nneeded, from both United Nations agencies and \nregional fisheries management organizations, to \nidentify time-bound strategies which assist us in \nrealizing a greater share of benefits from our own \nresources. \n The United Nations must make faster progress \ntowards reflecting modern twenty-first-century \ndynamics. The Security Council should be restructured \nto accommodate those nations whose size, leadership \nand responsibility \u2014 in particular, the Group of Four \nof Japan, Germany, India and Brazil \u2014 indicate a \ndeserved role as permanent members. Further efforts \nshould also ensure that Africa and small nations, \nincluding island States, have an improved voice. \n The Republic of the Marshall Islands welcomes \nthe progress achieved on both sides of the Taiwan \nStraits. The pragmatic and moderate actions of Taiwan \nshould not be overlooked by the United Nations, and \ndeserve further encouragement. I call upon the United \nNations system and Member States to be open-minded \nand identify appropriate means to accept Taiwan\u2019s \nparticipation within specialized agencies, including the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization, and in the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange. In particular, recognizing the commitment to \nreduce emissions by the 23 million people of \nTaiwan \u2014 a fellow island nation \u2014 in addressing \nclimate change is in the common interest of us all. \n The Republic of the Marshall Islands welcomes \nthe leadership of the United Arab Emirates as host of \nthe International Renewable Energy Agency. We look \nforward to pursuing increased partnership with the \nUnited Arab Emirates and to establishing a dialogue \nwith the Arab League on investment and development \nassistance in the Pacific region. \n Finally, I must address one of this year\u2019s most \nimportant issues within the United Nations. Member \nStates and leaders must improve progress towards \nachieving the goal of stopping the spread of nuclear \nweapons and pursue the peace and security of a world \nwithout them. \n The Marshall Islands has a unique reason for \nseeking the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. \nDuring our time as a United Nations Trust Territory, \n67 large-scale surface tests of nuclear weapons were \nconducted on our homeland, explicitly authorized \nunder two United Nations resolutions, in 1954 and \n1956. No people should ever bear such a burden. For \ndecades, we have told the United Nations about our \ncommunities who are still displaced, about the \ndeliberate use of our people in scientific experiments \nand of ongoing health impacts inherited through \ngenerations. We continue to face the challenges of a \n \n \n3 10-55103 \n \nUnited Nations-era nuclear waste storage site, \nsurrounded by rising waters, towards dealing with \nwhich we lack resources or technical capacity. \n We acknowledge important and positive actions \nalready taken by partners, including our former \nadministrator, the United States, but we need, and \ndeserve, improved attention and assistance from the \nUnited States, as well as from the United Nations \nsystem and multilateral bodies. \n I also acknowledge the support of the Pacific \nIslands Forum, including the leadership of the outgoing \nchair, Australia, as well as of the Non-Aligned \nMovement, in ensuring that this year\u2019s Review \nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons acknowledged \nthe need to address sites contaminated by testing. I \nfully expect that Member States of the United Nations \nwill be willing to further recognize that a special \nresponsibility exists towards former United Nations \nTrust Territories adversely affected by nuclear testing. \nAs the United Nations maps a global future of \nnon-proliferation, the past legacy of nuclear activities \ncan no longer be ignored. \n The message is the same for nuclear weapons, \nglobal security and freedom from terrorism, or climate \nchange: international law is not an empty promise."

        "file_text": "First, I would like to \ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the very \nresponsible post of President of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-fifth session. \n I have the privilege of representing the Czech \nRepublic, a country in the very heart of Europe that has \nbeen actively involved in United Nations activities \nfrom the very beginning and will continue to be so. We \nare actively involved in a number of United Nations \nbodies, and Czech soldiers and experts have \nparticipated in United Nations peacekeeping missions \nfor many decades. It is in our interests for this \nOrganization to remain a respected high-level forum, \ncontributing to prosperity, stability and peaceful \nsolutions to conflicts around the world. \n It has been said here many times in the past few \ndays that today\u2019s world is very different from that of \n1945, when this Organization was founded by \n51 States. It now consists of 192. That is not merely a \nquantitative change; it is much more. My country is \ntherefore deeply convinced that the structure of the \nUnited Nations also needs to be different, especially \nthat of the Security Council, which should be reformed \nto reflect the geopolitical, economic and demographic \nreality of the twenty-first century. It is frustrating that \ndiscussions of such reform have gone on for the past \n \n \n5 10-55109 \n \n16 years without results. It is time to come up with \nconcrete results, and my country is ready to support \nthem. \n Changes of this kind are necessary; on the other \nhand, some things must continue unchanged. I do not \nbelieve that the United Nations needs to search for a \nnew mission. Its goals should remain those defined in \nthe original Charter: to maintain international peace \nand security, to develop friendly relations among \nnations, and to achieve international cooperation in \nsolving international problems. The United Nations \nshould not diverge from these principles. It should not \nsearch for alternative or substitute projects to replace \nthose that enhance peace, freedom and democracy. It \nshould remain an intergovernmental platform, based on \nthe plurality of views of its Member States and on \nmutual respect for their sometimes differing positions. \n Let me briefly touch on two issues that form part \nof the current United Nations agenda. The first is the \nworldwide economic crisis and the methods used to \novercome it. I am afraid that we are moving in the \nwrong direction. The anti-crisis measures that have \nbeen proposed and already partly implemented follow \nfrom the assumption that the crisis was a failure of \nmarkets and that the right way out is more regulation \nof markets. This is a mistaken assumption. It will not \nbe possible to prevent any future crises by implementing \nsubstantial, market-damaging macroeconomic and regulatory \nGovernment interventions, as is being done now. That \nwill only destroy markets, and with them the chances \nfor economic growth and prosperity in developed and \ndeveloping countries alike. \n The solution to this or any other crisis does not \nlie in increasing protectionism, and it is a positive \nfactor that most Governments have behaved quite \nrationally in this respect. Nor does the solution lie in \nmore bureaucracy, in creating new governmental or \nsupranational agencies, or in aiming at global \ngovernance of the world\u2019s economy. On the contrary, \nthis is the time for international organizations, \nincluding the United Nations, to reduce their spending, \nslim down their administrations and leave the solutions \nto the Governments of the Member States, which are \ndirectly accountable to the citizens of their countries. \n Developing countries should not be prevented \nfrom growing economically. They need access to \nforeign markets and they need free trade. It was in this \nforum last year that I emphasized that we must pay \nattention to the costs and benefits of our decisions. \nDeveloping countries must not be forced into \nagreements on ever more ambitious targets in the fight \nagainst climate change, particularly at a time when the \ndeveloped countries themselves are far from meeting \nthose targets. The United Nations should not have an \nall-encompassing agenda. It should not turn away from \npolitical topics towards scientific ones. It is here not to \ndetermine what science is, but to engage its Member \nStates in rational and reasoned debate about political \nissues. The most harmful political debate we have \nwitnessed in the past couple of years is about the \nclimate and global warming. \n We should not give up on elemental values and \nprinciples that most of us share, and this brings me to \nthe second issue I wish to mention here today \u2014 \nnuclear non proliferation. In April, my country hosted \nan important event during which the President of \nRussia and the President of the United States signed \nthe Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and \nLimitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. We see the \nTreaty as an important step forward and as a visible \nsign of our efforts to make our complicated world \nsafer. Let us hope that it will be taken further in the \nforeseeable future. \n We do not dispute the right of any country to use \natomic energy for peaceful purposes, but it must do so \nin a responsible way. It is not possible for some \ncountries to ignore agreed and respected international \nstandards, to threaten stability in their regions and to \nincrease the dangers of proliferation. \n The United Nations is a unique forum at which \nsmall and big countries alike are represented. They are \ncountries with different political, economic and social \nsystems; different neighbours; different historical \nexperiences and geopolitical positions; and, more \nimportantly, different levels of income, wealth and \ndevelopment. This is precisely what makes the United \nNations unique and irreplaceable. Instead of \nincreasingly becoming a source of funds for various, \nsometimes very dubious non-governmental \norganizations that \u2014 without any accountability or \ncontrol \u2014 seek to profit from United Nations activities, \nthe United Nations should strive to be an efficient body \nin which States and their peoples are represented. Its \ntask is not to push for global governance and play the \ncentral role in it. The United Nations exists primarily \nto enhance friendly relations among its Members and \n  \n \n10-55109 6 \n \nto look for solutions to problems that cannot be \nconfined to national boundaries. \n I wish you every success in your office, \nMr. President, and I would like to assure you that the \nCzech Republic will continue to be an active Member \nof the United Nations."

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to \ncongratulate, on behalf of Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel \nAziz, President of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, \nand on my own behalf, His Excellency Mr. Joseph \nDeiss on his election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session and to wish him \nevery success in his new duties. I have great \nconfidence that his diligent efforts will have a positive \nimpact on our Organization, as did those of his \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, \nwhose praiseworthy labours strengthened the ties of \ncooperation, the bonds of brotherhood, and the \nuniversal principles of peace and dialogue within the \nGeneral Assembly. \n It also gives me great pleasure to express my \nthanks and appreciation to His Excellency Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his serious efforts to achieve \n \n \n33 10-55103 \n \nthe objectives of the Organization and to strengthen the \npillars of peace, security and prosperity in the world. \n Mauritania fulfilled its constitutional obligation \nby selecting Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz as \nPresident of the Republic through elections in which \nthe Mauritanian people expressed their will freely, \nimpartially and maturely. Today, for the first time in its \nhistory, my country has taken a comprehensive \nqualitative leap forward into a new era \u2014 which we \ncall \u201cthe era of serious work\u201d \u2014 to improve the living \nconditions of Mauritanian citizens, consolidate \ndemocracy and build a State that is on good terms with \nits citizens and its neighbours on the basis of justice, \nequality and the values of the Republic. \n In this new era, there are no political prisoners in \nMauritania and the pluralistic Parliament plays its full \nrole in legislating and in supervising the Government. \nThe press exercises its freedom without censorship or \nconstraint, as do political parties, unions and civil \nsociety institutions. \n Inspired by the electoral platform of President \nMohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, the Government of \nMauritania has devoted itself to implementing an \nambitious development policy with clearly visible \ngoals, including the elimination of corruption and its \nconsequences; the promotion and use of the country\u2019s \nresources in a rational, responsible and transparent \nmanner; ensuring respect for the rule of law and the \ncountry\u2019s prestige; providing security throughout \nsociety; offering basic services, and constructing \nessential infrastructure needed for the country\u2019s \ndevelopment. \n This policy has earned the confidence and \nsupport of Mauritania\u2019s brothers, friends and \ndevelopment partners, who, at their round table \nmeeting in Brussels in June, blessed our ambitious \ndevelopment programme and pledged financial support \ntotalling $3.2 billion over three years. In this regard, \nwe thank them sincerely for having made every effort \nto ensure the success of the round table and for all their \nsupport for our development programmes. \n In the course of implementing these programmes, \nMauritania became a hub of activity as roads and \nhealth and education facilities were built and integrated \nprojects established for the purpose of empowering \nwomen and youth in order to contribute to the socio-\neconomic development of the country and to improve \nconditions for the poor and the marginalized, who \nrejoiced at the election of our President and have \ngranted him the nickname \u201cPresident of the poor\u201d for \nhis great devotion to and care for the people. \n Mauritania, like other countries, is confronted \nwith terrorism and transnational organized crime. \nTerrorism is a global phenomenon that is not tied to a \nparticular country, continent, religion or society. Any \nattempt to conflate Islam with this phenomenon is \nrejected, unacceptable and illogical. Those most \naffected by terrorism are, after all, the Muslims and the \nIslamic world. \n We believe that the fight against terrorism \nrequires progress in social justice, the training of \nyoung people and their integration into an active life. \nThis will give them hope so that they do not become \neasy recruiting targets for terrorists and extremist \norganizations. \n My country is making diligent efforts on all these \nfronts and promoting the role of our prominent \nscholars to debate in the best possible manner and to \nprovide the correct image of Islam, which is a religion \nof tolerance, virtue and acceptance of others and one \nthat rejects excess and extremism. Moreover, \nMauritania, far from being at war with anyone, as His \nExcellency the President of the Republic has \nrepeatedly said, will spare no effort to maintain peace \nand security for its citizens and ensure the necessary \nconditions for the development of the country in \nsecurity and stability. \n The establishment of a united Arab Maghreb is a \nstrategic option for the peoples of the region, and \nfailure to maintain such unity will reflect negatively on \nthe future of that vital region of the world. There is no \ndoubt that finding a timely solution to the issue of \nWestern Sahara and obtaining the consent of the parties \nconcerned would contribute to accelerating the pace of \nintegration of the united Maghreb and enable it to play \nits full role as an indispensable and effective regional \npartner. \n On the other hand, conscious of the importance of \nthe United Nations as an irreplaceable forum for the \nvoices of Member States and other members of the \ninternational community, big and small, powerful and \nweak, as well as for resolving difficult international \nissues and coordinating and supporting development \nefforts, Mauritania supports efforts to reform the \nOrganization and its organs, especially the Security \nCouncil. \n  \n \n10-55103 34 \n \n We call for the expansion of the Council to \ninclude permanent representation for the African \ncontinent and the Arab Group, because democracy is an \ninternational requirement and not only a national \npractice or objective. Given their cultural, human and \nstrategic significance, it is neither logical nor \nacceptable not to grant permanent seats on the Security \nCouncil to the African continent and the Arab world. \n The Arab-Israeli conflict remains a source of \ntension and a threat to international peace and security \nin an extremely sensitive and vital area of the world. \nThat region will know no stability until a definitive \nsolution to the conflict is found. Such a solution must \nbe just and permanent and in accordance with \nresolutions of international legitimacy. It must allow \nthe brotherly Palestinian people to exercise their full \nright to establish their independent and viable State in \nPalestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital. It must \nalso ensure the restoration of all occupied Arab \nterritories, including the Syrian Golan Heights and the \nLebanese Shab\u2019a farms. \n Mauritania hopes that the direct negotiations \nbetween the Palestinians and the Israelis, sponsored by \nthe United States, will conclude in tangible results and \nan acceptable time frame. There is no people in the \nMiddle East that needs peace more than the Palestinian \npeople. My country has called for the lifting of the \nunjust siege on Gaza and for an end to its collective \nand inhumane punishment. Restoring rights and justice \nto their owners and between nations and cultures is the \nbest means to achieve peace and security in the world. \n Before concluding, allow me to reiterate what I \nstated a few days ago \u2014 the development challenges \nbefore us all will be exacerbated unless we all assume \nour responsibilities and fulfil our commitments. \nDeveloping countries require the urgent attention of the \ninternational community if they are to achieve the \nstability, development and progress that will enable \nthem to integrate into the global economic system."

        "file_text": "May my first words be to congratulate the \nnewly appointed President of the Assembly, Mr. Joseph \nDeiss, to whom I wish great success in his conduct of \nthe sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. \n September is an important month in the agenda of \ninternational politics since the middle of the last \ncentury because it marks the beginning of the new \nsession of the United Nations General Assembly, which \nhas the city of New York as its backdrop. \n Far removed is the San Francisco Conference, \nwhich turned the page on global conflicts and opened \nthe way for international cooperation by establishing a \nnew Organization, the United Nations, an Organization \ngeared towards promoting peace, justice and a better \n  \n \n10-55109 20 \n \nlife for all humankind. Far removed, as well, are the \ntimes of the Bretton Woods Agreements, which \nestablished free trade rules for commercial and \nfinancial relations among the most industrialized \nnations of the world in order to achieve peace. \n In the first decade of this century we witnessed \nevents that have shaped the future of international \nrelations and caused a new world to emerge, as we saw \nin New York in the month of September. On \n11 September 2001, the cities of New York and \nWashington suffered terrorist attacks that stunned the \nworld and were among the most traumatic in the \nhistory of the West. In September 2008, New York was \nthe centre and focus of a panic created by the \nbankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, while just a few \nweeks ago, our host city experienced tensions related \nto intercultural coexistence and saw the relaunching of \nthe most ambitious programme of international \ncooperation in history, the Millennium Development \nGoals. \n These events mark the true beginning of the \ntwenty-first century, which is unfolding in an \nenvironment of accelerated global and interdependent \ntransformation. We are at a historic crossroads where \nwe must promote awareness of the reform of the \nUnited Nations system and the establishment of new \nmechanisms for global governance that modernize the \nsystem of international relations, consolidate \nmultilateralism and security, and strengthen global \neconomic recovery, while providing accountable \nmanagement of growing interculturalism. \n Effective multilateralism is the method that will \nenable us to tackle the challenges of the twenty-first \ncentury. It is a method that stems from the efforts of \nthe General Assembly and from the commitment and \nwork of the leaders of the States represented here. It is \na method based on respect and understanding in order \nto build new alliances and common strategies and \npolicies. \n On many occasions, we hear speeches that \nemphasize the incapacities and weaknesses of the \nUnited Nations system. But I prefer not to preach \nclassic doom and gloom here; rather, I would \nacknowledge the work and success of the United \nNations as well as its capacity to respond, as seen in its \nresponse to the natural disasters suffered by Haiti and \nPakistan. The capacity to take action and effectively \ncoordinate the efforts of all countries through a \nmultilateral approach is a path that the international \nsystem should continue to follow at this time of great \nchallenges before us. \n On 11 September, the concept of security was \ntransformed and expanded. In September 2006, the \nMember States approved the United Nations Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy, a resolution and annexed \nPlan of Action (resolution 60/288) which presumed for \nthe first time to define a common strategic approach \nagreed by all States Members of the United Nations. \nThis strategy was presented by Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan one year after the brutal and traumatic attacks \nof 11 March 2004 in Madrid. Since that time, the \nintensity and number of terrorist attacks have \ndecreased, and we have improved security, although we \nare far from having won the war against international \nterrorism. \n This year we have also seen very significant \nadvances in the area of security, disarmament and \nnuclear non proliferation. The new Strategic Arms \nReduction Treaty makes it possible to reduce by 30 per \ncent of the nuclear warheads in the United States and \nRussia and represents the greatest nuclear agreement in \n20 years. Last May, 189 countries signatories of the \nTreaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \napproved the convening of a conference in 2012 to \ntransform the Middle East into a zone free of weapons \nof mass destruction. \n We are beginning to come out of the worst \nfinancial and economic crisis since the 1930s. The \nnegative fallout of this crisis will be felt through time \nby millions of people, especially in terms of decent \nemployment. Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers on \n15 September 2008, the international financial system \nhas required States and international institutions, such \nas the International Monetary Fund and the World \nBank, to intervene at an unprecedented level in order to \nmaintain worldwide demand and financial markets. \n The lack of international regulation helped to \nbring about the crisis of the financial entities and has \nrequired strengthened coordination, making the Group \nof 20 a new forum for economic governance. The \nlesson of the crisis is that, for their development, \ninternational markets need not only the invisible hand, \nbut also a global regulatory system. That is what we \nhave understood in Europe, where we have adopted \nmeasures to harmonize the legislation of member \nStates, so that regulatory authorities would be able to \n \n \n21 10-55109 \n \nexercise both executive and disciplinary powers. Since \nthe adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, Europe is now on a \npath to cohesiveness in the area of foreign policy and \nshould be seen as a single interlocutor with its own \nvoice in the international community. It should \ntherefore enjoy an appropriate status in the General \nAssembly. \n My Government, the Government of Spain, is in \nthe vanguard of the fight against hunger and poverty. It \nhas proposed in the United Nations, together with other \nMember States, the creation of a tax on international \ncurrency transactions whose proceeds would be used \nfor the achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoals. While the Food and Agriculture Organization \nhas provided us with encouraging data \u2014 we have seen \nhunger decrease in the world for the first time \u2014 the \nfigure of 925 million hungry people in the world is \nmorally and politically unacceptable. \n Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon knows that he \ncan count on Spain for the mobilization of efforts to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. Indeed, \nfighting poverty cannot be a casualty of the economic \nrecession because, despite the crisis, it is not material \nconditions but political will that will be the key to the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals by \n2015. \n The time has come to take responsibility for \ncombating climate change. To face this challenge, we \nneed to change the way in which we perceive \ndevelopment and economic growth. A greater effort is \nrequired to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nand dependency on fossil fuels, and to commit to \nrenewable energy and efficient and responsible \nconsumption. The United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change has created a point of \nreference to provide us with a regime that defines \nrealistic solutions and responds to our concerns and \npriorities. \n In a few months, we will attend the Climate \nChange Conference and should be aware of the effort \nnecessary to pave the way to the meeting in Canc\u00fan, \nwhere the very credibility of the multilateral system \nwill be at stake. The Conference will be successful if \nwe take a realistic approach demonstrating solidarity \nand generosity towards the most vulnerable States. It \nshould lead us to an ambitious agreement by which \nStates represented in the General Assembly can take \nownership of the objectives and verifiable \ncommitments contained therein. \n To bring these objectives to fruition, we need the \nequitable integration of almost half the world\u2019s \npopulation \u2014 women. The tenth anniversary of the \nadoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), \non women and peace and security, should provide us \nwith an opportunity to enhance gender equality in the \npublic arena, in institutions and in the economic, social \nand cultural spheres. We can and should move ahead \nwith these reforms because there are positive \nindications that this mandate is dynamic, such as the \nrecent creation of UN Women, led by former President \nof Chile Michelle Bachelet, whom I congratulate on \nher appointment as Director of the new entity. \n With regard to human rights, Spain is firmly \ncommitted to abolishing the death penalty and \nintroduced an initiative to the General Assembly two \nyears ago to that end. The International Commission \nagainst the Death Penalty, proposed by Spanish Prime \nMinister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, will soon be \nestablished and begin its work. We believe that capital \npunishment is an absolute violation of human rights \ndue to its irreversibility, which also makes it the most \nextreme case of cruel, inhuman and degrading \ntreatment. \n My country unequivocally supports peaceful and \nnegotiated solutions to all international conflicts, in \naccordance with United Nations resolutions. Achieving \npeace in the Middle East remains a strategic priority \nfor Spain. That is why, on the eve of the twentieth \nanniversary of the Madrid Conference, we continue to \nwork resolutely to ensure that the process of direct \ntalks between Israelis and Palestinians will finally lead \nto the two-State solution. The Israeli and Palestinian \npeoples know they can count on all our support at this \ntime, when various thorny issues related to the conflict \nare being addressed. \n In this regard, I add my voice to the appeal made \nfrom this very rostrum by the President of the United \nStates for the moratorium on building in the \nsettlements to be maintained. In order to achieve a \nlasting, fair and comprehensive peace, it is vital to \nresolve the issues that relate to Syria and Lebanon and \nto work within a multilateral framework that creates a \ngenuine global coalition for peace in the Middle East. \n We all know that stability in the Western Balkans \nand the full integration of its countries into the \n  \n \n10-55109 22 \n \nEuropean Union is a basic priority for Europe. In 2010, \nwe commemorated the tenth anniversary of the Zagreb \nConference. Spain, which held the European Union \npresidency at the time, convened a high-level meeting \nin Sarajevo in May that was attended by all actors \ninvolved and at which the European Union reaffirmed \nits commitment to the region\u2019s stability and European \nfuture. Recently, the consensus adoption by the \nGeneral Assembly of resolution 64/298, sponsored by \nthe 27 members of the European Union and Serbia on \none of the region\u2019s pending issues showed the \nwillingness of all actors in the international community \nto achieve the aforementioned objectives. \n Spain reiterates its support for the mediation \nefforts undertaken by the Personal Envoy of the \nSecretary-General for Western Sahara, Mr. Christopher \nRoss. The conflict in that territory must be resolved by \nmutual agreement among the parties and pursuant to \nthe United Nations resolutions calling for the self-\ndetermination of the Saharans. \n In our view, Ibero-America is undergoing \nunprecedented social and political change. At the start \nof the bicentennial commemorations of the \nindependence of these republics, Spain wishes to join \nthe celebrations by attending the Ibero-American \nsummits and by strengthening its bilateral relations and \nrelations between the European Union and Latin \nAmerica. \n Cuba deserves special mention following the \nrecent decisions taken by Cuban authorities. Embargos \nand unilateral attitudes that only disappoint new \nexpectations are useless and make no sense. \n Africa is clearly one of the most important future \nchallenges to the international community and the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \nProgress achieved in the areas of good governance and \ndemocratization on the continent are cause for \noptimism and should allow it, with international \ncooperation, to overcome the crises in the Sahel, \nSomalia or the Great Lakes region. Spain reiterates its \nfirm commitment to Africa. \n Coexistence in a globalized world should \nmotivate us to strengthen the instruments for good \ngovernance and promote cultural and intercultural \ndiversity, which are among the most pressing \nchallenges of the twenty-first century. International \nconsolidation of the Alliance of Civilizations, as a tool \nof preventive diplomacy, is now a fact and a resource \nwe must use. More than 100 States, along with \n23 international organizations, now belong to the \nGroup of Friends of the Alliance of Civilizations. I take \nthis opportunity to invite those countries that have not \nyet joined to do so. \n In a landscape of international economic crisis, \nintercultural tensions run the risk of exacerbation. This \nshould impel us to continue working for the respect \nand understanding of cultures and civilizations in order \nto counter expressions of hatred, fanaticism, division \nand confrontation. \n The new world requires us to adapt and enlarge \nthe international institutional architecture. As the \nSpanish philosopher, Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset said, \u201cmen \ndo not live together just because; they do so for the \npurpose of great undertakings\u201d. Today the United \nNations has a great undertaking: to complete the \nreform of our institutions and lay the foundations for \nglobal governance. Together, we can face the \nchallenges and global crises of the twenty-first century \nand construct an international system that is fairer, \nmore balanced and more sustainable. \n Bretton Woods in 1944 and the San Francisco \nConference in 1945 were the results of half a century \nof crises and two world wars. Believe me, we are not \ndoomed to wait another half century to reform and \nestablish new institutions for the twenty-first century. \nWe have already waited a decade, but we cannot \ncontinue to wait much longer, because we can feel \nhistory breathing down our necks."

        "file_text": "My first \nwords will be to pay tribute to the memory of hundreds \nof thousands of Haitians and those who came to \nhelp \u2014 including about 100 United Nations staff, in \nparticular Mr. H\u00e9di Annabi, Special Representative of \nthe Secretary-General \u2014 who all lost their lives during \nthe earthquake that struck Haiti on 12 January.  \n But every tragedy offers some solace in terms of \nhuman solidarity. Therefore once again on behalf of the \nHaitian people and on my personal behalf I would like \nto thank all the people and Governments across the \nworld, ranging from the Dominican Republic, our \nclosely attached neighbour, to those at the far corners \nof the globe, that rushed to our assistance. That \nassistance was crucially important to us, in particular \nduring the first few weeks when the need was so \nurgent. \n Allow me to also thank those Haitians living \nabroad, in New York, Miami, Chicago, Montreal, Paris, \nSanto Domingo, the French West Indies and many \nother parts of the world, who joined the great \ninternational solidarity movement and, in their \ncommitment, endeavoured for the most part to \nestablish structures that would help our country \nrebuild.  \n I would be remiss were I not to pay special \ntribute here, publicly, to the people of Haiti \n  \n \n10-54965 10 \n \nthemselves, a people who have been deprived of \neverything and yet who have demonstrated the \nimmeasurable wealth of their humanity. Towns that had \nbeen destroyed did not become the scenes of \nwidespread looting. The people showed such dignity \nand kindness, such exemplary stamina in their \nsuffering, such boldness,  devotion and courage, such \nsolidarity, spirit of self-sacrifice and love for others. \nThose are the words that come to mind and I think that \nis how we must describe the acts of heroism of the \nHaitian people. Let us show our respect for them. \n My country has lived a unique history since its \nbirth immediately after a war of independence that \ntook the lives of one third of its people and caused \nunimaginable destruction. And in the wake of the \nAmerican and French revolutions of the eighteenth \ncentury, that war of independence challenged the \nhuman race to  recognize the universal character of the \nproclamation of humankind\u2019s right to freedom, dignity \nand equality by making the men and women of Haiti \nfree. \n Our nation was born in 1804 and, although poor \nand  since then deprived of resources, it has never \nhesitated to extend material support to peoples \nstruggling for freedom, including in greater Colombia, \nwhich is today Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia and \nPanama, under the leadership of Francisco Miranda \nand then Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. \n Despite our limited resources, Haiti has always \ndemonstrated its firm belief in one human race. And \ntherefore we fully appreciate that immense movement \nof solidarity and compassion of the international \ncommunity for our country, from the moments \nimmediately after the earthquake right up to the \ncommitment on 31 March at the New York conference \nby which it agreed to participate in rebuilding Haiti on \nthe basis of the plan of action prepared by the Haitian \nGovernment. \n Since then, with the assistance of the \ninternational community and support from the United \nNations, we have set up a commission to coordinate \nresources for rebuilding. This commission is an \nimportant strategic mechanism for helping the country \nmanage transparently and with discipline the resources \nmobilized within the international community to \nsupport our country as it rebuilds. The commission has \nalready adopted over 30 projects, on education, health, \ninfrastructure and so forth, costing over $1 billion. \n May I extend my thanks to those countries and \nagencies that have followed up on their commitments \nto make financial contributions. I trust that a similar \neffort will be made by others as well so as to help us \nrespond quickly to the over one million Haitians who \nare still living in tent cities and temporary shelter.  \n We have just held an important high-level \nmeeting on the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). Ten years ago, when 189 countries met here \nto make the collective commitment to achieving the \neight Millennium Development Goals by the year \n2015, the international community was actually in \nagreement on what the world should look like in \n2015 \u2014 a world well on the way to reducing extreme \npoverty, where children and mothers would not have to \ndie because of lack of health care, where all children \nwould be able to go to school, where millions of people \nwould no longer die of hunger every year, where \nwomen would be able to fulfil their potential in a \nsociety without any gender-based discrimination.  \n That vision was the right one, because it placed \nhuman dignity at the very heart of all development \nprogrammes and the international cooperation agenda. \nAnd that vision also had the advantage of providing \ncountries and their partners in the international \ncommunity with a clear, straightforward structure for \nplanning development and organizing cooperation with \nthe countries that were committed to help achieve the \nGoals.  \n While significant progress has been made in the \nright direction, five years from 2015 there is still a long \nroad to travel because the developed countries have not \nfully lived up to the commitments made with respect to \nthe Millennium Development Goals, particularly their \nfinancial commitments. \n What shall I say about the trillions of dollars that \nhave been swallowed up over the last 10 years in wars \nthat have been as bloody as they were unjustified? \n What shall I say about the defence budgets which \nevery year exceed by far what would be needed to \nattain the Millennium Development Goals? \n And what shall I say about the incalculable \nwealth that has simply evaporated in speculation, in the \narrogant supremacy of the virtual economy over the \nreal economy? \n \n \n11 10-54965 \n \n Are we going to continue sacrificing the well-\nbeing and lives of millions of human beings, the future \nof planet Earth, to this culture of fear and greed? \n What shall I say about the fact that official \ndevelopment assistance continues to fall, when in 2005 \nthe developed countries committed to doubling the \namount by 2010? \n What happened to the decision to encourage a \nmore open trading system, when assistance to farmers \nin developed countries is over three times the amount \nof official development assistance? \n In truth, the globalization that began centuries \nago, with the colonization and the importation of \nAfrican captives to work as slaves on sugar-cane and \ncoffee plantations, whose products would then be \nexported to the West or the North, needs to be \nreinvented.  \n The time has come for us to invent a new kind of \nglobalization, one that is based on the simple concept \nof our common humanity, on trust, cooperation and \nmutual respect, on respect for our environment and all \nforms of life in it. We must, as a matter of urgency, do \naway with a vision that sees profit as a veritable god, \nreduces citizens to the level of simple consumers, and \nregards planet Earth as a colony that we can destroy. \nThe global village will not be able to maintain forever \nits fashionable neighbourhoods side by side with \nwretched slums where humanity is dissolving: a socio-\neconomic North and South \u2014 not a geographic one.  \n In Haiti, living on an island in a part of the world \nthat has always been swept by hurricanes, we are \nparticularly worried about global warming and the \nclimatic disturbances that come with it: more frequent \nand more devastating cyclones and a rising sea-level.  \n Must the poor continue to pay for the waste, the \nunbridled appetite for energy of their wealthier \nbrethren? Must they renounce their efforts to improve \ntheir standard of living in order to feed the consumer \nfrenzy of the industrialized countries? \n The so-called war against drugs consists of a few \nlittle skirmishes in the consumer countries but full-\nscale bloody battles in the production and transit \ncountries, whose very existence is sometimes \njeopardized. \n Are the countries of the South still to be pilloried \nas responsible for the production and transit of illegal \ndrugs even though the engine for this lucrative \ntrafficking is demand for drugs in countries of the \nNorth? \n What shall I say about the arms trafficking, which \nflows from the North to the South and supports the \ndrug trafficking? \n It is for us to provide the answer to those \nquestions, and we cannot sidestep them much longer \nwithout rushing to our common doom. The only hope \nlies in a renewed humanism, clear-sighted, embracing \nof all life and the environment, on which we are \ndependent and for which we are responsible. In that \nsense, South-South cooperation affords new promise, \nand I invite the leaders of the countries of the South to \nstrengthen those channels for the well-being of our \nrespective peoples.  \n Some of the statements I have heard in this \nsession of the General Assembly seem to presage a new \nand different consciousness, which may be what is \nrequired for our vision of a new humanity. Still, as \nalways, we must be mindful to that commitments and \naction match the expansive rhetoric.  \n This is the moment for Haiti to renew its call for \nthe lifting of the embargo against Cuba. Besides having \nbeen condemned in many Assembly resolutions, an \nembargo of this kind is absolutely contrary to the \nvalues we advocate in matters of international \ncommerce.  \n I would be remiss if I were not to convey, on \nbehalf of the Haitian people, our condolences to the \nmany peoples who have suffered lately from natural \ndisasters in Chile, China, Pakistan, Guatemala and \nMexico. \n I shall conclude by referring to the presidential \nand legislative elections that will mark the end of my \nterm and the end of a particularly difficult year for the \npeople of Haiti. It is important that that difficult \nprocess be conducted with rigour, fairness and \ntransparency, so as to consolidate our young \ndemocracy. Therefore I appeal to all national actors \nand our international friends, so that together we can \nmake our way through that electoral crossroads \nsuccessfully."

        "file_text": "It is my singular \nhonour to extend my congratulations to you, Sir, on \nyour assumption of the presidency of the General \nAssembly. I wish to assure you of the full support and \ncooperation of my delegation in the discharge of your \nonerous responsibilities. My commendation also goes \nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and his \n  \n \n10-55122 4 \n \nstaff for their commitment to the advancement of the \nwork of this noble Organization. \n As Member States, we continue to find refuge in \nthe provisions of the United Nations Charter and the \nfull assurance that, when we are individually faced \nwith insurmountable challenges and difficulties, we \ndraw from the collective strength of the international \ncommunity. \n Working together for a common purpose, for the \ncommon good is actually the sacredness of this, our \ngrand institution. In this regard, we must all remain \nsteadfast in our partnership on the agenda for poverty \neradication, the pursuit of international peace and \nsecurity, the combating of disease, the promotion of \nyouth empowerment and gender equality, the \npromotion and protection of democracy, the rule of law \nand human rights, personal advancement through \neducation, better health for all and harnessing \ntechnology for sustainable development. It is on \naccount of this abiding faith and belief in the viability \nand primacy of the United Nations that, in spite of our \nresource limitations, we have over the years faithfully \nfulfilled our obligations to this Organization. \n The deliberations of the recently concluded High-\nlevel Plenary Meeting on the review of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), our global blueprint for \nmonitoring universal progress towards shared \ndevelopment goals, clearly cast light on our strengths, \nweaknesses and vulnerabilities, individually and \ncollectively. For this reason we need to redouble our \nefforts to accelerate the implementation of the MDGs \nin the remaining five years. \n Botswana is classified as an upper-middle-income \ncountry. However, despite having enjoyed stability and \nsteady economic growth over a sustained period of \ntime, the country still has to contend with a plethora of \ndevelopment challenges \u2014 ironically, in an \nenvironment of diminished international development \nassistance and support. The vulnerability of economies \nsuch as that of my country became evident during the \ntriple global crises of food, energy and, most recently, \nthe world economic and financial meltdown. To this \nend, we call for continued development assistance for \nmiddle-income countries, lest their hard-earned gains \nbe reversed. \n In this era of growing and complex global \nchallenges, the need for a more dynamic and proactive \nglobal financial, economic and political architecture is \nfar more apparent than ever before. More specifically, \nthe recent crises point to an international monetary and \nfinancial architecture that needs profound reform in \norder to enhance its early-warning capabilities and \nresistance to external shocks, as well as to facilitate the \nintegration of poorer countries into the global \neconomy. \n Botswana welcomes the important milestones \nachieved in strengthening United Nations operational \nactivities for development and improvements in \nfunding for development-related activities, as well as \nin strengthening the institutional framework for the \ngender architecture through the creation of the United \nNations Entity for Gender Equality and the \nEmpowerment of Women \u2014 UN Women. The creation \nof the Entity constitutes an important step in fulfilling \nthe commitments undertaken at the 1995 Beijing World \nConference on Women, whose main objective was the \npromotion of gender equality and the empowerment of \nwomen. \n Botswana fully supports the strengthening of the \ninstitutional capacity of the Peacebuilding \nCommission. We believe that the role of the \nCommission should be properly defined by a robust \nmandate, through the amendment of the founding \nresolutions and the provision of adequate resources in \norder to enable it to effectively discharge its mandate. \n On a related subject, we fully concur that \ndisarmament and non-proliferation are essential for the \npromotion of international peace and security. To this \nend, my delegation welcomes the progress made in \nsome areas but remains deeply concerned that the \nConference on Disarmament continues to be \ndeadlocked. \n I wish to seize this opportunity to reaffirm \nBotswana\u2019s commitment to the objectives of the Treaty \non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which \nwe continue to demonstrate through effective \nimplementation of its provisions as well as compliance \nwith the decisions of the successive Review \nConferences. Consequently, Botswana associates itself \nwith the outcome of the 2010 Review Conference of \nthe States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \nof Nuclear Weapons. We fully support the call by \ndeveloping countries for the peaceful use of nuclear \ntechnology in areas such as agriculture, the \nenvironment, water management and medicine. \nHowever, countries that intend to embark on such use \n \n \n5 10-55122 \n \nof nuclear technology should do so in a transparent \nfashion and in full cooperation with the International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We therefore call for \nincreased financial support for the IAEA Technical \nCooperation Programme as well as for the Agency\u2019s \ncapacity-building, in order to share technology \nutilization in the relevant areas. \n Botswana continues to be deeply concerned about \nincreasing threats to international peace and security. \nAs a peace-loving nation, we believe in the peaceful \nresolution of conflicts. It is because of this strong \nbelief that we condemn, without reservation, all acts of \nterrorism, including the 9/11 terrorist attacks, on which \nour well-known position remains unchanged. My \ndelegation does not believe that the 9/11 attack was \norchestrated by the United States of America. \n One issue of deep concern to my delegation is the \nerosion of democracy, respect for human rights and the \nrule of law in some parts of the world. There is \ntherefore an urgent need for us to reverse this trend, \nespecially because it undermines all the efforts we \nhave made to date to launch our countries on a path of \npeace, stability and sustainable development. To this \nend, we commend the various civil society \norganizations that have consistently sounded alarm \nbells regarding incidents of human rights violations \nwhenever and wherever they occur. \n My country is of the view that the International \nCriminal Court needs to be supported in its efforts to \nresolve outstanding cases of arrest warrants that have \nbeen issued against persons indicted for the \ncommission of serious crimes. It is in this context that \nBotswana remains resolute and steadfast in its support \nfor the work of the International Criminal Court. We \nwelcome the landmark decision of the Rome Statute \nReview Conference held recently in Kampala, Uganda, \nto extend the jurisdiction of the Court to cover the \ncrime of aggression. \n Nowhere is our shared responsibility as members \nof the international community more critical than in \nprotecting and nurturing our shared environment and \nour planet, Earth. To this end, it is pertinent to point \nout that climate change has increasingly become one of \nhumanity\u2019s most daunting challenges. The devastating \nnatural disasters recently experienced in certain \nquarters of our globe amply demonstrate our \nvulnerability as inhabitants of the Earth. \n I wish to seize this opportunity, on behalf of the \nGovernment and the people of Botswana, and indeed \non my own account, to express our sympathy and \nsolidarity with all the countries that have been victims \nof such disasters. We would like to extend our \ncondolences to all the families who lost their loved \nones and those whose property and livelihoods were \ndestroyed. We extend our profound appreciation to the \nGovernments as well as private sector and civil society \norganizations that responded positively to the \ninternational humanitarian appeal launched by the \nUnited Nations on behalf of the affected countries. In \nparticular, we would like to recognize the countries \nthat led humanitarian interventions. We remain \noptimistic that the next Conference of Parties to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange will achieve a successful outcome, one that \nfully addresses the interests and concerns of both \ndeveloping and developed countries. \n In conclusion, we pray that this sixty-fifth session \nof the General Assembly will go down in history as \nmarking a milestone in efforts aimed at addressing the \nmost pressing global challenges of our time, as well as \nbringing hope and inspiration to the billions in despair \nthroughout the world.

        "file_text": "\nFirst, I offer my congratulations on your election,  \nMr. President. I also take this opportunity to recognize \nthe leadership of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, \nwhose influence brought to this sixty-fifth session of \nthe General Assembly 139 heads of State or \nGovernment to rededicate efforts to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. \n It is with a sense of hope for a better world that I \naddress this Assembly of leaders and decision makers. \nI join the Assembly and the international community in \nechoing the call for a world where people are again \nplaced at the centre of our actions, where the care of \nchildren is given greater priority, where poverty is seen \nas an enemy of human dignity, where peace can be \nachieved without bloodshed, where conversations \nresulting in greater tolerance, mutual respect and \nunderstanding would motivate cooperation and unity, \nand where selflessly sacrificing one\u2019s best skills and \nresources for the benefit of fellow human beings would \nbe the primary purpose of our actions. I believe that all \nof this is possible if we recommit ourselves to the \nfounding principles upon which the United Nations \nwas built. \n The United Nations must continue to provide a \nvoice to all States whether small or large, developed or \ndeveloping, industrialized or agrarian. The Charter of \nthe United Nations provides for the sovereign equality \nof all States. It must be at the centre of all discussions \nand decisions geared towards meeting the demands of \nits membership in this third millennium. For that \nreason, we welcome the theme of this year\u2019s debate: \n\u201cReaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \nglobal governance\u201d. \n We are of the view, as are many of you, that no \nnation will be safe and no democracy will prevail if \nthere is no mutual cooperation towards global stability, \nfashioned by opportunity for all, equity and the ability \nto feed, provide health care, clothing, housing and \neducation for people everywhere. We are all in this \ntogether. We shall rise or fall together. \n Let us not take for granted the significance of our \npresence here. That we can sit in one Hall means that \nwe can also work together to achieve those noble \nobjectives, which foster and promote global peace and \nstability. \n To realize those goals, our debate of this topic \nmust not be reduced to empty rhetoric and nice \nlanguage. We must reaffirm the essential role of the \nUnited Nations in resolving global issues and make the \nUnited Nations more accountable. So we must look at a \nwider definition of global governance. \n It is our respectful view that global governance \nmust not only mean agreement on a body of rules, laws \nor practices that place the United Nations at the centre \nof all matters which confront the international \ncommunity; it must also mean that we hold our leaders \nand institutions more accountable for their actions, \ndelivering a better quality of life for all our peoples. \nNo nation large or small must be exempted. \n Global governance cannot be limited to the \ncrafting of instruments related to the promotion of \ndemocracy. A key component must be the creation of \nfair and equitable rules to enhance the development \nprospects of developing countries as well. We \nrecognize the rules governing membership of groups \nsuch as the Group of 20 (G20), but a mechanism must, \nwe believe, be established to insert the voice of the \nUnited Nations in the activities of those groups, such \nthat the concerns and needs of all Members are actively \nconsidered. Trinidad and Tobago therefore calls for the \nestablishment of predictable and regular channels to \nfacilitate dialogue between the G20 nations and \nMembers of the United Nations, which constitute the \n\u201cGroup of 192\u201d or the \u201cG192\u201d. It is our hope that some \nof those issues will be examined at the next G20 \nSummit, scheduled in November of this year. \n At the same time, Trinidad and Tobago, as Chair-\nin-Office of the Commonwealth, calls on the General \n  \n \n10-55128 22 \n \nAssembly to recognize the important work being done \nby the Commonwealth, especially as it relates to small \nand vulnerable economies. The international \ncommunity must do more to deal with the economic \nplight of its most vulnerable Members, which depend \nheavily on the flow of international capital and trade to \nensure that their development needs are met. Trinidad \nand Tobago intends to use its position as Chair of the \nCommonwealth to promote enhanced cooperation \nbetween the United Nations and the Commonwealth so \nas to facilitate measures aimed at providing \ndevelopment financing in a predictable manner to \ndeveloping countries. This would mean a willingness \non the part of international financial institutions to \nre-examine whether some of their policies have been \ncreating a perpetual cycle of poverty for small nations. \nSuch a cycle must not be allowed to continue. \n A few days ago I participated here in the High-\nlevel Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development \nGoals. Since then, the question that keeps lingering in \nmy mind is whether we would have to convene another \nmeeting in the future \u2014 shortly \u2014 to restate the urgent \nneed to provide the necessary assistance to developing \ncountries, so that they can meet the MDGs. While I \napplaud the noble efforts of the United Nations in \nproviding an enabling environment for leaders to \nexchange ideas and to formulate solutions on the \nsubject, I must confess that over the years we have had \nample rhetoric but insufficient action on this matter. \n In my country we have put in place a Ministry of \nthe People to deal with poverty eradication and hunger \nas a priority. This is just one vehicle aimed at placing \nus in a position to honour our commitments to reduce \npoverty. However, we are of the firm view that \ninternational cooperation is also essential. Good \ngovernance requires that developed countries fulfil \ntheir commitments made at the Millennium Summit to \nprovide assistance to developing countries, so that \nthose countries can achieve the MDGs by the deadline \nset. The deficit in commitment has to be addressed if \nreal advances are to be made. We all have a duty to the \nfuture. It will be measured by how we fulfil our \nresponsibilities today. \n My Government has created the Children\u2019s Life \nFund to provide funding and critical support for children \nneeding life-saving surgery. It is our belief that children \nmust not die in our country \u2014 or in any other country \u2014 \nbecause they cannot afford health care \u2014 not in the year \n2010. There must be new arrangements and \nrelationships between countries that have advanced \nmedical technology and those without, so that children \nof the poorest nations can grow as healthy human \nbeings and achieve their full potential. It is only when \nthis is done that the world will progress. \n My colleague from Grenada spoke about  \nnon-communicable diseases. Trinidad and Tobago, \njoined by other members of the Caribbean Community \n(CARICOM), has reiterated that call for international \nattention on the issue of the prevention and control of \nnon-communicable diseases. We have agreed that in \nSeptember 2011 a high-level meeting of the General \nAssembly on non-communicable diseases will be \nconvened (resolution 64/265). Much work remains to \nbe done, if we are to have a successful meeting next \nyear. In order to achieve the desired results, the United \nNations will have put in place a common set of \nprinciples to tackle this important concern of global \npublic health. \n On the issue of climate change, we say that \nTrinidad and Tobago, as a small island developing \nState, seeks to promote and safeguard the welfare of \nour planet from the harmful effects of climate change \nand supports measures aimed at mitigating the effects \nof climate change, which threaten our environment, \neconomic livelihood, territorial integrity and the very \nsurvival of many States. Although the United Nations \ncontinues to be at the forefront of discussions to \nconfront this formidable challenge, progress has been \nmuch too slow. In making our contribution to the \nprocess, we wish to reiterate the position of the \nAlliance of Small Island States, namely, that there \nshould be deep and ambitious cuts in greenhouse gas \nemissions by developed countries amounting to about \n40 to 50 per cent by the year 2020 and 85 to 90 per \ncent by 2050. \n In order for there to be meaningful advancement \nat the sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties \nto the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change, to be held in Mexico, we must utilize \nthe coming United Nations Climate Change \nConference, to be held in China, to agree on the \nidentification of additional and predictable sources of \nfinance, institutional issues related to finance and the \nform of the final agreement. It is our respectful view \nthat urgent and concerted action is the only viable \noption to bring about results at the upcoming \nnegotiations. \n \n \n23 10-55128 \n \n I turn now to the issue of natural disasters. One of \nthe first problems I encountered, almost immediately \nafter taking the oath of office four months ago, was the \nissue of unprecedented and widespread flooding that \nresulted in tremendous financial and other losses to \nvictims and placed a strain on the resources of the local \nemergency management services. My Government \ncontinues to provide assistance to the affected \ncommunities, while we devise long-term strategies to \nreduce the incidence of this type of flooding. \nNevertheless, I recognize that we are not alone to have \nbeen faced with this grave problem. Recent events in \nHaiti, Pakistan and Russia have demonstrated that \ngreater international action is needed to provide relief \nto those affected by flooding and other natural \ndisasters. \n In the Caribbean the case of a devastated Haiti \nprovides the international community with the \nopportunity not only to be compassionate, but to also \nlearn major lessons on disaster preparedness and \nmanagement. Respectfully I say that \u2014 \nnotwithstanding the valuable work being done by the \nCentral Emergency Response Fund (CERF), to which \nTrinidad and Tobago has made annual contributions \u2014 \nmore action is required to provide the agency with the \nrequisite resources in the face of ever increasing \nnatural disasters. In this regard, I respectfully call upon \nthose States that are in a position to do so to make \nfinancial contributions to CERF, so that it can respond \nmore efficiently and effectively to humanitarian crises \ndue to floods and other natural disasters. \n There is another persistent matter receiving the \nattention of my Government and others of the \nCARICOM region, which is the illegal proliferation of \nsmall arms and light weapons and their ammunition. In \nour attempts to address this problem, we have had to \ndivert financial resources that we could have used \notherwise for economic and social development. We \nhave observed an increase in gang-related violence, \nhomicides, the illegal narcotics trade and organized \ncrime. The origin of the illicit trade in those weapons is \nbeyond our national borders. It is of international \ndimension and therefore requires a global response. We \nare encouraged by the attempts of the United Nations \nto conclude a legally binding agreement to regulate the \ntrade in conventional weapons. It is our view that this \ninstrument must also make provision for regulating the \ntrade in small arms and light weapons, thereby \npreventing their illegal diversion. \n Trinidad and Tobago also calls for a strong and \neffective implementation regime to ensure proper \ncompliance with the provisions of the treaty to be \ndrafted. It must also include a proper verification \nmechanism and a sanctions regime for breach of its \nterms. Such safeguards would assist in preserving the \nobject and purpose of the agreement. \n We have partnered with other members of the \ninternational community to establish rules governing \nthe non-proliferation of nuclear, chemical and other \ntypes of weapons, which could create untold suffering \nfor humanity. However, in the Caribbean, our weapons \nof mass destruction, are, ironically, small arms and \nlight weapons. Therefore I implore all those States that \nhave been reticent about the need for an arms trade \ntreaty to join us in this undertaking. I pledge the \ncommitment of my Government to work with other \nlike-minded States to ensure a successful outcome of \nthe Preparatory Committee for the United Nations \nConference on the Arms Trade Treaty and ultimately \nthe Conference itself, scheduled to take place in 2012. \n Tied together with the issue of small arms and \nammunition is drug trafficking. Regulating the trade in \nsmall arms and light weapons is not an end in itself. \nUrgent international action must also be taken to deal \nwith the issue of international drug trafficking. We \ncannot allow our young people to continue to fall \nvictim to this monster, which has fuelled transnational \norganized crime and resulted in cross-border armed \nviolence, threatening the political and social stability \nof many nations. National Governments alone cannot \nsolve this problem because of its global dimension. \nGovernments are forced to divert scarce resources, \nwhich should be used for social programmes, in order \nto confront the challenge posed by narco-trafficking. \nWe need urgent action to address this problem. \n In 1989, the Honourable Arthur Robinson, former \nPrime Minister of the Republic of Trinidad and \nTobago, took the political initiative to reintroduce on \nthe agenda of the General Assembly the need for the \nestablishment of a permanent International Criminal \nCourt (ICC). The Court has since been established. \nHowever, his call for international drug trafficking to \nbe included as a crime within the jurisdiction of the \nICC has not yet been realized. Today, I say that it is \neven more critical for this to be done. I therefore \nrespectfully call upon States Members of the United \nNations which are States parties to the Rome Statute of \nthe ICC to include international drug trafficking as a \n  \n \n10-55128 24 \n \ncrime within the jurisdiction of the ICC. The ICC is the \nonly credible international judicial organ with the \ncompetence to prosecute those who perpetrate this \ncrime. \n In closing, I wish to raise one area of reform that \nI hold very dearly. That is the establishment of  \nUN Women, an entity which consolidates four previous \nagencies. I am confident that this venture, which will \nbecome fully operational by January 2011, will provide \na coherent approach in attending to issues affecting \nwomen internationally. It is my hope that UN Women \nwill receive the support of all States. \n Finally, 10 years ago the Security Council \nadopted resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace \nand security, acknowledging that there can be no \nsustainable peace and security without the involvement \nand contribution of women. Trinidad and Tobago is \ncommitted to advancing the peace and security agenda \nof the United Nations, and my country\u2019s attachment to \nthe promotion of women is equally strong. That is why \nI wish to state that Trinidad and Tobago will introduce \nin the First Committee of the General Assembly, \ndevoted to disarmament, international peace and \nsecurity, a resolution on women, disarmament, arms \ncontrol and non-proliferation. I pledge the support of \nthe Government of Trinidad and Tobago for this \ninitiative. \n We have spent a decade in this third millennium. \nIn retrospect, have we advanced as a world community \nin ways that will create a sustainable environment and \nsecure the lives of people everywhere? Yes, we have \nmade tremendous strides in communications \ntechnology; yes, we are a global village as a result of \nimprovements; but, regrettably, we cannot say that we \nare our neighbours\u2019 keepers. There are still too many \nfences between us \u2014 fences of politics, ideology, \nreligion, ethnicity, culture and traditions. As human \nbeings, we have the unique capacity to reason and on \nthe basis of that reasoning to develop deeper \nunderstandings. Today, I respectfully say: Let us \npledge to use this understanding gained from reasoning \nto promote conversations between nations and peoples; \nconversations to replace aggression and threats; \nconversations geared towards finding peaceful ways to \ndeal with differences; conversations borne out of \nmutual respect for each other as people and nations; \nconversations founded upon respect for diversity; \nconversations that ensure the survival of the human \nrace and the planet as their purpose. \n As I end my contribution to this debate, I wish to \ncompliment the United Nations for all of the work \ndesigned to revitalize this unique global body. I also \naffirm our support for efforts and policies aimed at \nrevitalizing the central role of the United Nations in \nglobal governance."

        "file_text": "When I \nstood on this platform in September last year, I \naddressed the issue of the threats that beset our world. \nUnfortunately, these threats are still present and have \neven increased and diversified, and we are not any \ncloser to achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals, which we set for ourselves ten years ago during \nthe Millennium Summit. We believe that the \nmalfunction that our world suffers from is due, not to a \nlack of resources, but to mismanagement and lack of \njustice and equity. \n The global economic, financial and food crisis \nand the persistence of hunger, poverty and other \nchallenges facing humanity today prompt us to rebuild \nour institutions and formulate our strategies to better \nrespond to the challenges and crises facing the \ninternational community. The time has come to \nreformulate the global economic system in order for it \nto achieve justice and equal opportunities for all. \nAmong the important international conferences and \nforums that Doha hosted this year was the World \nEconomic Forum Global Redesign Summit, which \nresulted in many proposals for improving the existing \ninternational structures and cooperative arrangements, \nin order to create an international system conducive to \nmeeting the challenges of the twenty-first century. I \ncall on decision makers to discuss the proposals and \nadopt those that are appropriate. \n You may all know that our region is still \nexperiencing the highest degree of tension in the world. \nThe question of Palestine has been awaiting a just \nsolution for decades, the situation remains precarious \nin Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq, and the Iranian \nnuclear crisis requires a solution. We have repeatedly \n  \n \n10-54827 28 \n \nstressed the importance of reaching a solution through \npeaceful and diplomatic means, and, in our view, a \nfruitful, direct dialogue between the United States of \nAmerica and the Islamic Republic of Iran would \ncontribute to the resolution of this crisis. \n The strategic importance of the Arabian Gulf \nregion stems from its geostrategic position and the fact \nthat it is sitting on half of the world\u2019s oil and natural \ngas reserves and is the source of one quarter of the \nworld\u2019s production of these two primary driving forces \nof the global economy. Let this be yet another \nconsideration that prompts the international community \nto recognize the importance of achieving political \nstability and security in the Middle East. This is a \ndifficult goal that can only be achieved by renouncing \nthe use of force, freeing the region of weapons of mass \ndestruction, without exception, and settling bilateral \ndisputes and regional conflicts on the basis of \ninternational law, the United Nations Charter, the \nresolutions of international legitimacy and the \nprinciples of justice and equity. \n Israel\u2019s persistence in violating international law \nand humanitarian values was reflected in the acts of \npiracy committed against peace activists who tried to \nbreak the unjust and inhuman siege imposed on the \nPalestinian people in the Gaza Strip. This prompts us \nagain to call upon the international community to stand \nas one in demanding that Israel lift the blockade \nimmediately and fully. \n We are now at a historic juncture in the process \nof the settlement of the question of Palestine. For \neveryone should realize that the Arab countries will not \naccept the peace that Israel wants to impose as it \npleases and outside international legitimacy. A lasting, \nacceptable and secure peace must guarantee the rights \nof the Palestinian people, especially the establishment \nof a Palestinian State, with Jerusalem as its capital. \n For reasons some of which we can understand \nand some of which we fail to understand, this first \ndecade of the twenty-first century has been blighted by \nthe blind attack that has come to be known as the war \non terrorism. Thus the fresh start of a new century has \nbeen hamstrung by a quagmire of distortions and \ndamage, some, if not all, of which could have been \navoided. We recognize the existence of certain \npractices that clearly fall within the scope of terrorism, \nbut in this regard we emphasize two premises. \n First, we disagree with the attribution of this so-\ncalled terrorism to the Islamic religion, because \u2014 in \naddition to being incorrect \u2014 that ascription is \nhistorically unjust and is refuted by evidence from \nrecent history. In the twentieth century, including the \nsecond half thereof, unjustifiably violent actions \noccurred in the United States of America, Europe and \nAsia, but no one has characterized those acts of \nterrorism as American, European or Asian. Rather, \nthose acts of violence are attributed to their underlying \npolitical, economic, social and even ideological causes, \nwithout reference to any religion, country or idea. By \ncontrast, what we have seen and suffered in the first \ndecade of this century \u2014 what is called the war on \nterror \u2014 is a phenomenon unprecedented in \ninternational politics. It has plunged us into a kind of \nwar with no limits, end, logic or legal or moral \nconditions. Some of this is still happening and, \nalthough we note that the current United States \nAdministration has discontinued the use of the term \n\u201cwar on terror\u201d, we are still looking forward to clearer \nand bolder initiatives. \n The other premise that we disagree with is that \nwe believe that even though the phenomenon of \nterrorism does exist it should not be addressed by \nwaging wars. That approach has not achieved security, \npeace or prosperity. On the contrary, it has spread \ndestruction everywhere, deprived millions of people of \ntheir livelihoods, spread fear, caused the displacing and \nkilling of millions of people as well as economic and \nfinancial crises that have shaken the stability of the \nworld, and undermined efforts aimed at dialogue \namong cultures. \n I do not want to take up too much of the \nAssembly\u2019s time, but we believe that the situation in \nwhich we find ourselves after the first decade of this \nintriguing century should not be allowed to continue, \nand its corrosive ramifications should not go \nunchecked. What we fear is that the war on terrorism \nmay turn into a series of financial transactions \nconcluded with armies of mercenaries who are given \nfree rein to kill outside of any international or human \nlegitimacy. That is a very dangerous prospect. \n In this first decade, we have faced major \nchallenges. We should resolve that war is not the way \nto deal with such challenges. Rather, we should come \nto terms with ourselves, with this era and with its \nconcomitant progress, and determine to turn the new \ndecade and the decades that follow into an era in which \n \n \n29 10-54827 \n \nmajor challenges are addressed with more in-depth \nunderstanding and knowledge. \n Proceeding from our belief that dialogue is the \nmost effective way to resolve conflicts, we have set out \nto seek a resolution to several political crises in our \nregion by promoting dialogue between the concerned \nparties, whether in Lebanon, Yemen, the Horn of Africa \nor the Sudan. \n At the national level in the State of Qatar, we \npursue human-centred development policies based on a \nholistic approach in dealing with human development. \nWe have set ourselves the goals of modernization, \nreform and development in order to build a modern \nconstitutional State of law-based institutions that \nguarantee citizens their freedoms, rights and \nresponsibilities. We have taken concrete steps towards \nenhancing our development capabilities, including our \nhealth, educational and cultural institutions, which we \nhope will reach international standards, as well as \nenhancing national industrial enterprises to utilize \nnatural resources in our country. God has granted our country an abundance of \nhydrocarbon fuel reserves. We have endeavoured to \nmake the best use of this wealth, employ its revenues \nin the service of Qatari citizens and improve our \nvarious human development indicators because we, \nlike other inhabitants of planet Earth, are anxious to \naddress the impact of climate change. Our interest in \nclean energy, particularly natural gas, is on our list of \npriorities. And to contribute to the reduction of carbon \nemissions, we have developed policies that aim to \nbenefit from clean and renewable energy sources. \n Through this approach, we hope to contribute \nnationally, regionally and internationally to the \nestablishment of peace, stability and security, as well \nas to the development that comes with them. Thus, we \nhope to assume our part of the collective responsibility \nfor the common good."

        "file_text": "My \ndelegation joins previous speakers in expressing our \ncongratulations to Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \nsession. We want to take this opportunity to assure him \nof our full cooperation and to wish him a very \nsuccessful and rewarding term. I also take this \nopportunity to thank Mr. Ali Treki for the excellent \nwork he did in steering this Assembly during his tenure \nas President during its sixty-fourth session. \n The theme of the sixty-fifth session of the \nGeneral Assembly \u2014 \u201cReaffirming the central role of \nthe United Nations in global governance\u201d \u2014 resonates \nwith what our global citizen, Nelson Rolihlahla \nMandela, said about this body on the occasion of its \nfiftieth anniversary: \n \u201cThe United Nations has to reassess its role, \nredefine its profile and reshape its structures. It \nshould truly reflect the diversity of our universe \nand ensure equity among the nations in the \n  \n \n10-55109 26 \n \nexercise of power within the system of \ninternational relations, in general, and the \nSecurity Council, in particular.\u201d (A/50/PV.37, \np. 6) \nMy delegation supports the choice of this theme, and \nwe wish to reiterate our belief in the centrality of the \nUnited Nations and the system of multilateralism. \n Despite the challenges that face humanity in the \ntwenty-first century, the relevance of the United \nNations as a multilateral mechanism through which a \nmyriad of complex world affairs can be administered \nand resolved cannot be overemphasized. Those \nchallenges compel us more than ever before to \nstrengthen the United Nations. South Africa is \ncommitted to working with other Member States to \nachieve the full potential of the United Nations to \naddress the urgent challenges facing the international \ncommunity by making it more relevant, more \nresponsive to the diversity of humankind and more \nrepresentative. \n The creation of the United Nations was one of the \nnotable successes of the twentieth century, and thanks \nto its existence the world has been spared another war \non the scale and magnitude of the First and Second \nWorld Wars. The exponential growth in the \nmembership of the Organization over the years, from \n51 Members in 1945 to 192 today, clearly demonstrates \nthe confidence that the peoples of the world have \nplaced in the United Nations and the ideals contained \nin its Charter. \n The universal membership of the United Nations \ngives it the legitimacy to be at the centre of efforts to \naddress global challenges. However, the question is \nwhether the United Nations has leveraged that diversity \nof its membership as a source of strength and acted \ndecisively against any tendency that runs contrary to its \nfundamental values and founding principles. \n The answer to this is yes because, in the past, the \nUnited Nations played an invaluable role in the \nworldwide process of decolonization, transforming the \npolitical landscape of the world and bringing much-\ncherished freedom and independence to the peoples of \nAfrica, Asia and Latin America. The Organization was \ninstrumental in bringing about the demise of the \nuniversally despised apartheid system in our own \ncountry, South Africa. \n When the Organization recognized the right to \ndevelopment as a human right, it gave voice and hope \nto those who know the face of poverty. When the \nOrganization has sent its troops to far-flung places to \nkeep peace among neighbours who should be living \ntogether, it has again underscored the reason for which \nit was established. Amid all the challenges, the United \nNations has been relevant and responsive to our \ndiverse interests. \n Five years ago, at the World Summit, we agreed \nthat, if the Organization were to continue to play its \ncentral role in global governance effectively, there was \na need to strengthen and reposition it to deal with the \nchallenges of the twenty-first century.  We believe that \nthe revitalization of the General Assembly remains one \nof the cornerstones of the United Nations reform \nagenda. The General Assembly is the chief \ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ of \nthe United Nations and plays a critical role in the \nprocess of standard-setting and the codification of \ninternational law. Its decisions are taken by a collective \namong equals for the common good. \n We will support measures that are aimed at \nenhancing the effectiveness of the General Assembly, \nespecially regarding its role in the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. Indeed, we witnessed \nwith satisfaction how, on several occasions, the \nGeneral Assembly acted promptly when the Security \nCouncil was unwilling or unable to respond to grave \ndevelopments in the aftermath of the conflict in Gaza \nin 2009. \n Indeed, no transformation of the United Nations \ncould be complete without the fundamental reform of \nthe Security Council. South Africa believes that the \nobjective of the reform should be to create a Security \nCouncil that is truly representative of the membership \nand effectively responsive to international crises, as \nmandated by the Charter of the United Nations. Indeed, \nit remains a travesty of justice that Africa, which \naccounts for a large portion of the work of the Council, \nis not represented in the permanent category. Thus, \ndeliberations about us carry on without us. \n The world should be free of weapons of mass \ndestruction, in accordance with our undertakings on \ntotal disarmament. In that regard, South Africa \nwelcomes the recently agreed programme of work of \nthe Conference on Disarmament. \n \n \n27 10-55109 \n \n While the right to development and freedom from \nwant are central to the work of the United Nations, we \nhave just ended the High-level Plenary Meeting to \nreview our performance in achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and agreed that more needs to be \ndone to act on commitments already made by the \ninternational community in that regard. \n The people of Haiti have a story to tell about how \nbest the international community can respond in unison \nand effectively to a nation in distress. \n A speedy and satisfactory conclusion of the Doha \nRound of the World Trade Organization, which \npromised so much for the developing South, \nunfortunately remains a dream yet to be fulfilled. At \nthe same time, the global economic crisis has \nhighlighted the point that many of us have always \nmade about the need to work for an international \nfinancial architecture that is sensitive to the \ndevelopment needs of the South. \n The contribution of the Group of 20 (G-20) is a \nwelcome development in that regard, and we believe \nthat the Group should complement and reinforce the \ngood work of the United Nations and not act as an \nalternative. In its composition, the G-20 will also need \nto mirror the rich diversity of humankind by making \nsure that all regions of the world, in particular Africa, \nare well represented. We look forward to the full \nimplementation of the undertakings made to transform \nthe international financial architecture, including the \nreform of the Bretton Woods institutions, as a step \ntowards building a world system founded on equity and \nsocial justice. \n Environmental issues, including climate change, \nhave also become high on the priorities of the \ninternational agenda. South Africa is fully committed \nto a multilateral outcome on the basis of the Bali Plan \nof Action, with a two-track negotiated and legally \nbinding outcome. We are convinced that the \nCopenhagen Accord provides political guidance for \nfuture negotiations. \n Accordingly, we should work together to ensure \nthat the forthcoming meeting of the sixteenth session \nof the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change in Mexico \ntakes bold and concrete steps to address climate change \nand its effects. For our part, South Africa will have the \nopportunity to host the seventeenth session of the \nConference of the Parties in December 2011, on the \neve of the end of the first commitment period of the \nKyoto Protocol. \n Peace and stability are one of the preconditions \nfor bringing about an Africa of the new beginning that \nthe Chairperson of the African Union, His Excellency \nPresident Wa Mutharika of Malawi, spoke of on the \nfirst day of the general debate (see ). The \nUnited Nations has been an important partner to Africa, \nworking with us through the African Union, whether in \nSomalia, the Sudan or the Democratic Republic of \nCongo. South Africa is encouraged by the commitment \nshown by the international community in trying to \nassist the both the Government of the Sudan and \nSouthern Sudan as they prepare for the upcoming \nreferendum in January 2011. \n The people of Zimbabwe also need the helping \nhand of the international community in implementing \ntheir Global Political Agreement. The African Union \nand the Southern African Development Community \nspeak for us, too, in calling for the lifting of sanctions \nagainst Zimbabwe. We will continue to work with the \npeoples of Zimbabwe, Madagascar and Burundi, \namong others, in their efforts to build and consolidate \npeace and democracy in their respective countries. \n In the case of Western Sahara, South Africa \nremains concerned about the continuing impasse, \nwhich stands in the way of a solution that will result in \nthe people of Western Sahara exercising their \ninalienable right to self-determination. We count on the \nUnited Nations, especially the Security Council, to \ncontinue to make decisions that enable us to decisively \ndeal with the challenges of peace and security on our \ncontinent. \n The United Nations should see Africa as a partner \nin the maintenance of international peace and the \nmanagement of conflicts, and accordingly do more to \nstrengthen the working relationship between the \nSecurity Council and the African Union Peace and \nSecurity Council. In this respect, South Africa will \ncontinue to support all international efforts to help the \npeople of Palestine and Israel in their endeavour to find \nlasting peace, leading to the establishment of a viable \nPalestinian State, on the basis of the 1967 borders and \nwith East Jerusalem as its capital, existing side by side \nin peace and security with Israel. \n We are at one with the call made by several \ndelegations for the lifting of the embargo on the \nRepublic of Cuba. \n  \n \n10-55109 28 \n \n We have converged here year after year to make \nstrong statements on Palestine, the embargo on Cuba \nand the independence of the Western Sahara. The \nultimate test of the relevance of the United Nations \nwill therefore be in bringing closure to all these long \noutstanding issues in a manner that is consistent with \nour decisions and the collective will of nations \nrepresented in this Organization. \nIn conclusion, we were also privileged recently to \nbe the stage, and Africa the theatre, of the 2010 \nF\u00e9d\u00e9ration internationale de football association World \nCup tournament. Our people spoke for us during that \nsoccer event in how they embraced each other and in \ntheir diversity of many nations, consistent with the \nspirit of ubuntu, which simply means \u201cI am because \nyou are\u201d. They gave us hope and confirmed the faith \nwe have in our belief that a better world is possible. \nThe role of sport in development and in advancing \npeace can never be underestimated. As States, we can \nbest respond to this message from our people by \nmaking sure that the United Nations, in playing its role \nin the global system, is more relevant, more inclusive \nand more representative. \n Looking ahead, South Africa is honoured to have \nbeen endorsed by the African Union as a candidate for \nthe Security Council non-permanent membership for \nthe period 2011-2012. We stand ready to continue to \ncontribute to the achievement of peace and security in \nthe world."

        "file_text": "It is a great honour to address \nthis Assembly for the second time, nearly two years \nafter my election as President of the United States. We \nknow this is no ordinary time for our people. We each \ncome here with our own problems and priorities. But \nthere are also challenges that we share in common as \nleaders and as nations. \n We meet within an institution built from the \nrubble of war, designed to unite the world in pursuit of \npeace. And we meet within a city that for centuries has \nwelcomed people from across the globe, demonstrating \nthat individuals of every colour, faith and station can \ncome together to pursue opportunity, build a \ncommunity and live with the blessing of human liberty. \n Outside the doors of this Hall, the blocks and \nneighbourhoods of this great city tell the story of a \ndifficult decade. Nine years ago, the destruction of the \nWorld Trade Center signalled a threat that respected no \nboundary of dignity or decency. Two years ago this \nmonth, a financial crisis on Wall Street devastated \nAmerican families on Main Street. These separate \nchallenges have affected people around the world. Men \nand women and children have been murdered by \nextremists from Casablanca to London, from Jalalabad \nto Jakarta. The global economy suffered an enormous \nblow during the financial crisis, crippling markets and \ndeferring the dreams of millions on every continent. \nUnderneath these challenges to our security and \nprosperity lie deeper fears: that ancient hatreds and \nreligious divides are once again ascendant; that a world \nwhich has grown more interconnected has somehow \nslipped beyond our control. \n These are some of the challenges that my \nAdministration has confronted since we came into \noffice. And today, I would like to talk to the Assembly \nabout what we have done over the last 20 months to \nmeet these challenges; what our responsibility is to \npursue peace in the Middle East; and what kind of \nworld we are trying to build in this twenty-first \ncentury. \n Let me begin with what we have done. I have had \nno greater focus as President than rescuing our \neconomy from potential catastrophe. And in an age \nwhen prosperity is shared, we could not do this alone. \nSo America has joined with nations around the world \nto spur growth and the renewed demand that could \nrestart job creation. \n We are reforming our system of global finance, \nbeginning with Wall Street reform here at home, so that \na crisis like this never happens again. And we made the \nGroup of 20 the focal point for international \ncoordination, because in a world where prosperity is \nmore diffuse, we must broaden our circle of \ncooperation to include emerging economies \u2014\neconomies from every corner of the globe. \n There is much to show for our efforts, even as \nthere is much work to be done. The global economy \nhas been pulled back from the brink of a depression \nand is growing once more. We have resisted \nprotectionism and are exploring ways to expand trade \nand commerce among nations. But we cannot \u2014 and \nwill not \u2014 rest until these seeds of progress grow into \na broader prosperity, not only for all Americans but for \npeoples around the world. \n As for our common security, America is waging a \nmore effective fight against Al-Qaida\u2019 while winding \ndown the war in Iraq. Since I took office, the United \nStates has removed nearly 100,000 troops from Iraq. \nWe have done so responsibly as Iraqis have \ntransitioned to lead responsibility for the security of \ntheir country. We are now focused on building a lasting \npartnership with the Iraqi people while keeping our \ncommitment to remove the rest of our troops by the \nend of next year. \n \n \n11 10-54827 \n \n While drawing down in Iraq, we have refocused \non defeating Al-Qaida and denying its affiliates safe \nhaven. In Afghanistan, the United States and our allies \nare pursuing a strategy to break the Taliban\u2019s \nmomentum and build the capacity of Afghanistan\u2019s \nGovernment and security forces so that a transition to \nAfghan responsibility can begin next July. And from \nSouth Asia to the Horn of Africa, we are moving \ntowards a more targeted approach \u2014 one that \nstrengthens our partners and dismantles terrorist \nnetworks without deploying large American armies. \n As we pursue the world\u2019s most dangerous \nextremists, we are also denying them the world\u2019s most \ndangerous weapons and pursuing the peace and \nsecurity of a world without nuclear weapons. \n Earlier this year, 47 nations embraced a work \nplan to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials within \nfour years. We have joined with Russia to sign the most \ncomprehensive arms control treaty in decades. We have \nreduced the role of nuclear weapons in our security \nstrategy. And here, at the United Nations, we came \ntogether to strengthen the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). \n As part of our effort on non-proliferation, I \noffered the Islamic Republic of Iran an extended hand \nlast year and underscored that it has both rights and \nresponsibilities as a member of the international \ncommunity. I also said \u2014 in this Hall \u2014 that Iran must \nbe held accountable if it failed to meet those \nresponsibilities. And that is what we have done. \n Iran is the only party to the NPT that cannot \ndemonstrate the peaceful intentions of its nuclear \nprogramme, and those actions have consequences. \nThrough Security Council resolution 1929 (2010), we \nmade it clear that international law is not an empty \npromise. \n Now let me be clear once more: the United States \nand the international community seek a resolution to \nour differences with Iran, and the door remains open to \ndiplomacy should Iran choose to walk through it. But \nthe Iranian Government must demonstrate a clear and \ncredible commitment and confirm to the world the \npeaceful intent of its nuclear programme.  \n As we combat the spread of deadly weapons, we \nare also confronting the spectre of climate change. \nAfter making historic investments in clean energy and \nefficiency at home, we helped forge an accord in \nCopenhagen that \u2014 for the first time \u2014 commits all \nmajor economies to reduce their emissions. We are \nkeenly aware this is just a first step. And going \nforward, we will support a process in which all major \neconomies meet our responsibilities to protect the \nplanet while unleashing the power of clean energy to \nserve as an engine of growth and development. \n America has also embraced unique \nresponsibilities that come with our power. Since the \nrains came and the floodwaters rose in Pakistan, we \nhave pledged our assistance, and we should all support \nthe Pakistani people as they recover and rebuild. And \nwhen the earth shook and Haiti was devastated by loss, \nwe joined a coalition of nations in response. Today, we \nhonour those from the United Nations family who lost \ntheir lives in the earthquake and commit ourselves to \nstand with the people of Haiti until they can stand on \ntheir own two feet. \n Amidst this upheaval, we have also been \npersistent in our pursuit of peace. Last year, I pledged \nmy best efforts to support the goal of two States, Israel \nand Palestine, living side by side in peace and security, \nas part of a comprehensive peace between Israel and all \nof its neighbours. We have travelled a winding road \nover the last 12 months, with few peaks and many \nvalleys. But this month I am pleased that we have \npursued direct negotiations between Israelis and \nPalestinians in Washington, Sharm el-Sheikh and \nJerusalem.  \n Now I recognize that many are pessimistic about \nthis process. The cynics say that Israelis and \nPalestinians are too distrustful of each other, and too \ndivided internally, to forge lasting peace. Rejectionists \non both sides will try to disrupt the process with bitter \nwords and with bombs and gunfire. Some say that the \ngaps between the parties are too big; the potential for \ntalks to break down is too great; and that after decades \nof failure peace is simply not possible.  \n I hear those voices of scepticism. But I ask the \nAssembly to consider the alternative. If an agreement \nis not reached, Palestinians will never know the pride \nand dignity that comes with their own State. Israelis \nwill never know the certainty and security that comes \nwith sovereign and stable neighbours who are \ncommitted to coexistence. The hard realities of \ndemography will take over. More blood will be shed. \nThis Holy Land will remain a symbol of our \ndifferences, instead of our common humanity.  \n  \n \n10-54827 12 \n \n I refuse to accept that future. We all have a choice \nto make. Each of us must choose the path of peace. Of \ncourse, that responsibility begins with the parties \nthemselves, who must answer the call of history. \nEarlier this month, at the White House, I was struck by \nthe words of both the Israeli and Palestinian leaders. \nPrime Minister Netanyahu said, \u201cI came here today to \nfind an historic compromise that will enable both \npeoples to live in peace, security and dignity\u201d. \nPresident Abbas said, \u201cWe will spare no effort and we \nwill work diligently and tirelessly to ensure these \nnegotiations achieve their cause\u201d. \n These words must now be followed by action, \nand I believe that both leaders have the courage to do \nso. But the road that they have to travel is exceedingly \ndifficult, which is why I call upon Israelis and \nPalestinians \u2014 and the world \u2014 to rally behind the \ngoal that these leaders now share.  \n We know that there will be tests along the way, \nand that one test is fast approaching. Israel\u2019s settlement \nmoratorium has made a difference on the ground and \nimproved the atmosphere for talks. \n And our position on this issue is well known. We \nbelieve that the moratorium should be extended. We \nalso believe that talks should press on until completed. \nNow is the time for the parties to help each other \novercome this obstacle. Now is the time to build the \ntrust \u2014 and provide the time \u2014 for substantial \nprogress to be made. Now is the time for this \nopportunity to be seized, so that it does not slip away.  \n Now, peace must be made by Israelis and \nPalestinians, but we each have a responsibility to do \nour part as well. Those of us who are friends of Israel \nmust understand that true security for the Jewish State \nrequires an independent Palestine \u2014 one that allows \nthe Palestinian people to live with dignity and \nopportunity. And those of us who are friends of the \nPalestinians must understand that the rights of the \nPalestinian people will be won only through peaceful \nmeans \u2014 including genuine reconciliation with a \nsecure Israel. \n I know many in this Hall count themselves as \nfriends of the Palestinians. These pledges of friendship \nmust now be supported by deeds. Those who have \nsigned on to the Arab Peace Initiative should seize this \nopportunity to make it real by taking tangible steps \ntowards the normalization that it promises Israel. \n And those who speak on behalf of Palestinian \nself-government should help the Palestinian Authority \npolitically and financially, and in doing so help the \nPalestinians build the institutions of their State. \n Those who long to see an independent Palestine \nmust also stop trying to tear down Israel. After \nthousands of years, Jews and Arabs are not strangers in \na strange land. After 60 years in the community of \nnations, Israel\u2019s existence must not be a subject for \ndebate. \n Israel is a sovereign State, and the historic \nhomeland of the Jewish people. It should be clear to all \nthat efforts to chip away at Israel\u2019s legitimacy will be \nmet by the unshakeable opposition of the United \nStates. Efforts to threaten or kill Israelis will do \nnothing to help the Palestinian people. The slaughter of \ninnocent Israelis is not resistance; it is injustice. And \nmake no mistake: the courage of a man like President \nAbbas, who stands up for his people in front of the \nworld under very difficult circumstances, is far greater \nthan those who fire rockets at innocent women and \nchildren. \n The conflict between Israelis and Arabs is as old \nas the United Nations. And we can come back here \nnext year, as we have for the last 60 years, and make \nlong speeches about it. We can read familiar lists of \ngrievances. We can table the same resolutions. We can \nfurther empower the forces of rejectionism and hate. \nAnd we can waste more time by carrying forward an \nargument that will not help a single Israeli or \nPalestinian child achieve a better life. We can do that. \n Or we can say that this time will be different \u2014 \nthat this time we will not let terror or turbulence or \nposturing or petty politics stand in the way. This time \nwe will think, not of ourselves, but of the young girl in \nGaza who wants to have no ceiling on her dreams or \nthe young boy in Sderot who wants to sleep without the \nnightmare of rocket fire. \n This time we should draw upon the teachings of \ntolerance that lie at the heart of the three great religions \nthat see Jerusalem\u2019s soil as sacred. This time we should \nreach for what is best within ourselves. If we do, when \nwe come back here next year, we can have an \nagreement that will lead to a new State Member of the \nUnited Nations \u2014 an independent, sovereign State of \nPalestine living in peace with Israel. \n \n \n13 10-54827 \n \n It is our destiny to bear the burdens of the \nchallenges that I have addressed \u2014 recession and war \nand conflict. And there is always a sense of urgency, \neven emergency, that drives most of our foreign \npolicies. Indeed, after millennia marked by wars, this \nvery institution reflects the desire of human beings to \ncreate a forum to deal with emergencies that will \ninevitably come. \n But even as we confront immediate challenges, \nwe must also summon the foresight to look beyond \nthem and consider what we are trying to build over the \nlong term. What is the world that awaits us when \ntoday\u2019s battles are brought to an end? And, that is what \nI would like to talk about with the remainder of my \ntime today. \n One of the first actions of the General Assembly \nwas to adopt the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights in 1948. This Declaration begins by stating that, \n\u201crecognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal \nand inalienable rights of all members of the human \nfamily is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace \nin the world\u201d.  \n The idea is a simple one \u2014 that freedom, justice \nand peace for the world must begin with freedom, \njustice and peace in the lives of individual human \nbeings. For the United States, this is a matter of moral \nand pragmatic assessment. As Robert Kennedy said, \n\u201cthe individual man, the child of God, is the touchstone \nof value, and all society, groups, the state exist for his \nbenefit\u201d.  \n So we stand up for universal values because it is \nthe right thing to do. But we also know from \nexperience that those who defend these values for their \npeople have been our closest friends and allies, while \nthose who have denied those rights \u2014 whether terrorist \ngroups or tyrannical Governments \u2014 have chosen to be \nour adversaries. \n Human rights have never gone unchallenged \u2014 \nnot in any of our nations, not in our world. Tyranny is \nstill with us \u2014 whether it manifests itself in the \nTaliban killing girls who try to go to school, a North \nKorean regime that enslaves its own people, or an \narmed group in Congo-Kinshasa that use rape as a \nweapon of war. \n In times of economic unease, there can also be an \nanxiety about human rights. Today, as in past times of \neconomic downturn, some put human rights aside for \nthe promise of short-term stability or the false notion \nthat economic growth can come at the expense of \nfreedom. We see leaders abolishing term limits, we see \ncrackdowns on civil society, we see corruption \nsmothering entrepreneurship and good governance, we \nsee democratic reforms deferred indefinitely. \n As I said last year, each country will pursue a \npath rooted in the culture of its own people. Yet \nexperience shows us that history is on the side of \nliberty; that the strongest foundation lies in open \neconomies, open societies, and open Governments. To \nput it simply, democracy, more than any other form of \ngovernment, delivers for our citizens. And I believe \nthat truth will only grow stronger in a world where the \nborders between nations are blurred. \n America is working to shape a world that fosters \nthis openness. For the rot of a closed or corrupt \neconomy must never eclipse the energy and innovation \nof human beings.All of us want the right to educate our \nchildren, to make a decent wage, to care for the sick, \nand to be carried as far as our dreams and deeds will \ntake us. But that depends upon economies that tap the \npower of our people, including the potential of women \nand girls. That means letting entrepreneurs start a \nbusiness without paying a bribe and Governments that \nsupport opportunity instead of stealing from their \npeople. And that means rewarding hard work, instead \nof reckless risk-taking. \n Yesterday, I put forward a new development \npolicy that will pursue these goals, recognizing that \ndignity is a human right and global development is in \nour common interest. America will partner with nations \nthat offer their people a path out of poverty. And \ntogether, we must unleash growth that powers by \nindividuals and merging markets in all parts of the \nglobe. \n There is no reason why Africa should not be an \nexporter of agriculture, which is why our food security \ninitiative is empowering farmers. There is no reason \nwhy entrepreneurs should not be able to build new \nmarkets in every society, which is why I hosted a \nsummit on entrepreneurship earlier this spring, because \nthe obligation of Government is to empower \nindividuals, not to impede them. \n The same holds true for civil society. The arc of \nhuman progress has been shaped by individuals with \nthe freedom to assemble and by organizations outside \nof government that insisted upon democratic change \n  \n \n10-54827 14 \n \nand by free media that held the powerful accountable. \nWe have seen that from the South Africans who stood \nup to apartheid, to the Poles of Solidarity, to the \nmothers of the disappeared who spoke out against the \nDirty War, to Americans who marched for the rights of \nall races, including my own. \n Civil society is the conscience of our \ncommunities and America will always extend our \nengagement abroad with citizens beyond the halls of \nGovernment. And we will call out those who suppress \nideas and serve as a voice for those who are voiceless. \nWe will promote new tools of communication so \npeople are empowered to connect with one another \nand, in repressive societies, to do so with security. We \nwill support a free and open Internet, so individuals \nhave the information to make up their own minds. And \nit is time to embrace and effectively monitor norms \nthat advance the rights of civil society and guarantee \nits expansion within and across borders. \n Open society supports open government, but it \ncannot substitute for it. There is no right more \nfundamental than the right to choose your leaders and \ndetermine your destiny. Now, make no mistake: the \nultimate success of democracy in the world will not \ncome because the United States dictates it; it will come \nbecause individual citizens demand a say in how they \nare governed. \n There is no soil where this cannot take root, just \nas every democracy reflects the uniqueness of a nation. \nLater this fall, I will travel to Asia. And I will visit \nIndia, which peacefully threw off colonialism and \nestablished a thriving democracy of over a billion \npeople. \n I will continue to Indonesia, the world\u2019s largest \nMuslim-majority country, which binds together \nthousands of islands through the glue of representative \ngovernment and civil society. I will join the Group-of-\n20 meeting on the Korean peninsula, which provides \nthe world\u2019s clearest contrast between a society that is \ndynamic and open and free, and one that is imprisoned \nand closed. And I will conclude my trip in Japan, an \nancient culture that found peace and extraordinary \ndevelopment through democracy. \n Each of these countries gives life to democratic \nprinciples in its own way. And even as some \nGovernments roll back reform, we also celebrate the \ncourage of a President in Colombia who willingly \nstepped aside, or the promise of a new constitution in \nKenya.  \n The common thread of progress is the principle \nthat government is accountable to its citizens. And the \ndiversity in this Hall makes clear \u2014 no one country \nhas all the answers, but all of us must answer to our \nown people. \n In all parts of the world, we see the promise of \ninnovation to make government more open and \naccountable. And now we must build on that progress. \nAnd when we gather back here next year, we should \nbring specific commitments to promote transparency; \nto fight corruption; to energize civic engagement; to \nleverage new technology so that we strengthen the \nfoundations of freedom in our own countries, while \nliving up to the ideals that can light the world. \n This institution can still play an indispensable \nrole in the advance of human rights. It is time to \nwelcome the efforts of UN Women to protect the rights \nof women around the world. \n It is time for every Member State to open its \nelections to international monitors and increase the \nUnited Nations Democracy Fund. It is time to \ninvigorate United Nations peacekeeping, so that \nmissions have the resources necessary to succeed, and \nso atrocities like sexual violence are prevented and \njustice is enforced \u2014 because neither dignity nor \ndemocracy can thrive without basic security.  \n It is time to make this institution more \naccountable as well, because the challenges of the new \ncentury demand new ways of serving our common \ninterests. \n The world that America seeks is not one we can \nbuild on our own. For human rights to reach those who \nsuffer the boot of oppression, we need your voices to \nspeak out. In particular, I appeal to those nations that \nemerged from tyranny and inspired the world in the \nsecond half of the last century \u2014 from South Africa to \nSouth Asia; from Eastern Europe to South America. Do \nnot stand idly by, do not be silent, when dissidents \nelsewhere are imprisoned and protesters are beaten, \nrecall your own history. Because part of the price of \nour own freedom is standing up for the freedom of \nothers.  \n That belief will guide America\u2019s leadership in \nthis twenty-first century. It is a belief that has seen us \nthrough more than two centuries of trial, and it will see \n \n \n15 10-54827 \n \nus through the challenges we face today \u2014 be they war \nor recession; conflict or division. \n So even as we have come through a difficult \ndecade, I stand here before you confident in the \nfuture \u2014 a future where Iraq is governed by neither a \ntyrant nor a foreign Power, and Afghanistan is freed \nfrom the turmoil of war; a future where the children of \nIsrael and Palestine can build the peace that was not \npossible for their parents; a world where the promise of \ndevelopment reaches into the prisons of poverty and \ndisease; a future where the cloud of recession gives \nway to the light of renewal, and the dream of \nopportunity is available to all.  \n This future will not be easy to reach. It will not \ncome without setbacks, nor will it be quickly claimed. \nBut the founding of the United Nations itself is a \ntestament to human progress. Remember, in times that \nwere far more trying than our own, our predecessors \nchose the hope of unity over the ease of division and \nmade a promise to future generations that the dignity \nand equality of human beings would be our common \ncause. \n It falls to us to fulfil that promise. And though we \nwill be met by dark forces that will test our resolve, \nAmericans have always had cause to believe that we \ncan choose a better history; that we need only to look \noutside the walls around us. For through the citizens of \nevery conceivable ancestry who make this city their \nown, we see living proof that opportunity can be \naccessed by all, that what unites us as human beings is \nfar greater than what divides us, and that people from \nevery part of this world can live together in peace."

        "file_text": "\nOur President, Mr. \u00c1lvaro Colom Caballeros, \nparticipated in the High-level Plenary Meeting on the \nMillennium Development Goals (see A/65/PV.3) but \nhad to return to Guatemala owing to commitments \nrelated to his high office. Similarly, our Minister for \nForeign Affairs, who unexpectedly had to leave New \nYork yesterday. It is for this reason that I have the high \nhonour of presenting this message, which was prepared \nto be presented today by the Minister. \n  \n \n10-55276 40 \n \n Before proceeding, I should like to express our \nprofound gratitude to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his \noutstanding performance in heading the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. Likewise, Mr. Deiss, \nwe wish you every success as President for the current \nsession. We have no doubt that with your vast \nexperience you will guide our deliberations and \nenhance the work of the General Assembly as the main \npolicymaking organ of the United Nations. \n We have just concluded our review of the \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals, \nadopted 10 years ago in an international environment \nthat was perhaps more encouraging than today\u2019s. As \nhas been highlighted in recent days, the results reflect \nboth light and shadow, with some countries showing \nimpressive gains, and others even suffering setbacks. \nThe majority have made progress on some of the Goals \nbut not in others, or have made advances whose \nbenefits have been distributed very unequally among \ndifferent segments of the population.  \n In addition, today\u2019s international environment is \nfar less encouraging than that of 10 years ago. The \nprevious decade began with the attack on the twin \ntowers in this very city, placing counter-terrorism \nsquarely as a priority on the international agenda. It \ncontinued with a military confrontation that was not \nsanctioned by the Security Council, with all its \nconsequences, and concluded with three simultaneous \ncrises \u2014 food, energy and, especially, financial and \neconomic \u2014 from whose effects we have yet to recover.  \n Further, after building up a cumulative body of \nscientific evidence that no longer allows any room for \ndoubt, we have confirmed that the very effects of \ntechnological progress have brought with them \ndevastating consequences for our common habitat \u2014 \nthis planet \u2014 and that the destruction wrought by \nclimate change is palpable and dramatic. On another \nmatter, in the current decade we have witnessed very \nclearly that organized crime does not recognize borders \nand tends to spread to those countries with the least \ncapacity to confront its considerable resources. \n My own country has been a victim of some of \nthese phenomena, which nullify or at least mitigate the \nconsiderable efforts we have deployed, especially since \nthe Administration of President Colom took office \nearly in 2008, to stimulate development, achieve higher \nlevels of well-being for the disadvantaged sectors of our \npopulation, and strengthen our democratic institutions. \nHere again we see both light and shadow: in spite of an \nunfavourable international environment and as President \nColom noted in this very Hall on 20 September, we have \nachieved progress is addressing some of the pressing \nproblems faced by the our country\u2019s most vulnerable.  \n But the shadow is still present. Its origin lies in \nphenomena that are totally or partially out of our \ncontrol. I highlight three of them. First, the financial \nand economic crisis had a sharp adverse impact on our \neconomic performance. Gross national product grew \nless than 1 per cent in 2009, with declining exports, \nshrinking family remittances and collapsing foreign \ndirect investment. This had an extremely negative \nimpact on our tax revenues, in spite of the many \nGovernment initiatives to raise tax rates to deal with \nincreasing demands for social services and public \nsecurity. Although we have seen a modest recovery this \nyear, its strength will depend to a large degree on \nuncertain developments in the international economy. \nIn other words, the international economic environment \nhas not been very conducive to meeting our economic \ngrowth goals, in spite of the official cooperation that \nwe have received, which we sincerely appreciate. \n Secondly, in the last decade a array of unlawful \nactivities related to organized crime have taken root in \nour country. Trafficking in persons, arms and narcotics, \nand money laundering have expanded to a worrisome \nextent, given the dual abilities of organized criminal \ngroups to co-opt and intimidate. Above all, drug \ntrafficking has undermined our democratic institutions. \nIn response, we have associated ourselves with the \nUnited Nations and friendly countries, through both \nbilateral and multilateral cooperation. This can be seen \nmostly clearly in the International Commission against \nImpunity in Guatemala (CICIG), to which I will return \nlater. Furthermore, recognizing that the struggle against \nillegal activities and organized crime \u2014 a basic \nresponsibility of all States \u2014 has today assumed a \nclearly transnational character, we have joined our \nneighbours in Central America and Mexico in \ncombating regional criminal networks. \n Thirdly, as if what I have already said were not \nenough, we have also fallen victim to natural disasters \nwith an unusual frequency, which highlights the \nextreme vulnerability of Guatemala to the effects of \nclimate change, given its location in a tropical area. We \nhad not even begun to recover from the effects of \ntropical storm Stan of late 2005 when we were hit by a \nserious drought in 2009 and, over the past few months, \n \n \n41 10-55276 \n \nthe eruption of the Pacaya Volcano, which caused \nextensive damage to agriculture, followed by tropical \nstorm Agatha in June, which affected some 330,000 \npersons, killed approximately 100 and caused material \ndamage totalling an estimated $1 billion. These \nestimates in human suffering and material losses have \ncontinued to grow with the unprecedented levels of \nrainfall during the past month, which has contributed \neven more human victims and material damage. \n The Government has done all within its power to \naddress the situation and has appealed for international \nassistance. I commend the fact that the United Nations \nwas among the first to respond to our call, and I \ntherefore express our appreciation to the Office for the \nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the \nAdministrator of the United Nations Development \nProgramme. \n To date, we have been focused on the emergency \nphase, but it is imperative that we move on to \nreconstruction and recovery as soon as possible. The \nGovernment has drawn up a detailed plan to address \nthose goals, and we will convene an international \nconference to present the plan to our partners in \nAntigua in Guatemala on 11 and 12 October. \n I shall now make some brief remarks on our \nOrganization and its agenda in the immediate future. I \nbegin by reiterating our support for multilateralism in \ngeneral and for the United Nations in particular. We \nhave enjoyed strong, continuous support from the \nOrganization, in supporting our peace process, \nfacilitating development cooperation and providing \nassistance when we have faced emergencies, as at the \npresent time. \n The latest example of that fruitful and innovative \ncooperation is the International Commission against \nImpunity in Guatemala. In only three years, the \nCommission has shown that it is indeed possible to \ncombat impunity and strengthen the rule of law. We \nvalue this cooperative effort between the Government \nof Guatemala and the United Nations, and we will \ncontinue to support it. \n We also value the work of our Organization in the \narea of peacekeeping. We have participated in several \noperations, principally in Haiti and the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo. We support the work of the \nUnited Nations in the area of peacebuilding, and we \nhope to participate in the Peacebuilding Commission as \na full member as of next January. \n We welcome the decision of the General \nAssembly to establish the United Nations Entity for \nGender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, and \nwe are pleased that its first leader will be Ms. Michelle \nBachelet. We also commit ourselves to continue \nsupporting initiatives aimed at achieving greater \nsystem-wide coherence. \n At the same time, we harbour the hope that, in the \ncoming year, some tangible progress will be made in \nthe long-delayed reform of the Security Council. We \nbelieve that it is crucial to provide greater legitimacy to \nthat body, which would benefit all of the main bodies \nand the Organization overall. In the meantime, we have \nannounced our candidature for one of the seats \nallocated to our region in the Security Council for the \nbiennium 2012-2013, in the hope of continuing to \ncontribute to its work. \n We reiterate our profound commitment to \nachieving significant progress during the next \nConference of the Parties of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \nin Canc\u00fan. We have participated actively in the \npreparatory work, based on the understanding that \nrarely has humanity faced a larger challenge that \naffects all countries and communities on the planet. \n In rejoining the Human Rights Council, we \nreiterate our commitment to the full respect of human \nrights in all their aspects, including the responsibility \nto protect our respective populations from genocide, \nwar crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against \nhumanity. \n It is commonly held that without peace there can \nbe no development. Promising signs have been seen in \nvarious parts of the world, which, we hope, may lead to \nthe resolution of long-standing tensions. We trust that \nthe direct negotiations recently begun in the Middle \nEast will be fruitful and lead to a Palestinian State that \ncan coexist with Israel in peace and harmony, within \nborders that are secure for both parties. \n We also applaud the engagement and growing \nclimate of cooperation being generated between the \nparties separated by the Taiwan Straits. \n Finally, I am pleased to announce that we have \nachieved a major step forward in addressing the \nInternational Court of Justice, together with Belize, to \nseek a juridical solution to the age-old territorial \ndispute between us. That step required the approval by \n  \n \n10-55276 42 \n \nour Congress of the Special Agreement signed with \nBelize in December 2008, which cleared the path for a \npopular referendum, as provided for under that \nAgreement. We hope that the Belizean Parliament will \nalso authorize as soon as possible the referendum to be \nheld simultaneously in both countries, as the final step \nthat allows both parties to present themselves to the \nCourt."

        "file_text": "It gives me \ngreat pleasure at the outset to extend warm \ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \nsession. I am confident that your election was the right \nchoice. \n I would also like to commend the outstanding \nmanner in which Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki conducted \nthe meetings of the previous session. His statesmanship \nand experience reflected positively on the work of the \nsession. \n We would also like to extend our thanks and \nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and \nthe Secretariat for their ongoing and appreciated \nefforts. \n We followed with keen interest and actively \nparticipated in the preparations for the High-level \nPlenary Meeting on the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). We have reviewed our achievements \nand identified obstacles and challenges in a way that \nwill enable us to meet our obligations. There is no \ndoubt that the success attained and the constructive \nrecommendations submitted will encourage Member \nStates to make further progress in this respect. \n We would like to underscore the great importance \nof development aid in achieving the MDGs and of the \nneed to maintain such assistance even in the current \nsituation of successive global crises and in the context \nof the increasing burden of foreign debt on the \neconomies of the developing countries and their ability \nto achieve the MDGs. \n I would like to take this opportunity to give the \nAssembly a brief review of the recent political \ndevelopments in my country, especially regarding the \nimplementation of the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement (CPA) signed in 2005, which was the \nsubject of a high-level meeting on the Sudan held three \ndays ago at the invitation of the Secretary-General and \nattended by a number of leaders and Heads of State. I \nnote the concluding communiqu\u00e9 citing positive \ndevelopments in the implementation of the CPA and \nthe steps to establish peace in Darfur. It also \ncommended the holding of public elections in the \nSudan last April in an atmosphere of tranquillity and \npeace. International observers were witness to the \ncredibility and integrity of the voting process. \n Arrangements are now under way for the holding \nof the referendum in Southern Sudan on schedule \nconcerning the options of unity or separation. For our \npart, we are determined that our fellow citizens in the \nSouth shall have their say without coercion and in an \natmosphere of freedom, integrity and transparency. We \nalso hope that unity will be the voluntary choice of the \ncitizens of Southern Sudan. We therefore call on all \npeople to support and consolidate the unity of the \nSudan and to participate in observing the referendum. \nWe also welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s decision to \nask former Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa to \nchair the United Nations panel mandated to observe the \nreferendum. \n \n \n13 10-55122 \n \n We also recall my Government\u2019s efforts to \nconsolidate peace in Darfur, which has undergone \nseveral positive changes that continue to promote the \nnormalization of the situation. Lasting peace would \nrestore to Darfur the vitality that has faltered in the \npast years due to conflicts fuelled by the proliferation \nof arms and by regional and international interventions. \nThe recent positive developments have enabled the \nholding of elections throughout Darfur, helped to \nconsolidate democratic legitimacy and led to the \nestablishment of new elected institutions. \n These positive transformations, which have \ncreated new conditions on the ground, have encouraged \nthe Government to develop a new strategy for Darfur, \nconcerning which we have conducted broad \ndiscussions with the people of Darfur at the individual, \ncollective and institutional levels, and with all the \nnational political forces. We have also conducted \nconsultations on Darfur with our partners in the peace \nprocess, first and foremost the African Union-United \nNations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) and \nthe African Union High-Level Implementation Panel \nably and skilfully led by President Thabo Mbeke. \n Many of our partners in the peace process and the \ninternational community have also supported and \nencouraged this strategy. The new strategy is based on \nfive key components: the establishment of security; the \nconsolidation of development; the resettlement of \ninternally displaced persons and people affected by the \nwar so they can lead a life of dignity; the \nencouragement of internal reconciliation that would \npromote social peace; and the pursuit of negotiations \nwith a view to drafting a settlement document agreed \nby the people of Darfur. The strategy envisages the \ncompletion of the negotiations currently under way in \nDoha through the sincere efforts and under the auspices \nof the sister State of Qatar. \n With a view to achieving the strategy\u2019s \ndevelopment goals, the Government has appropriated \nfrom its own resources the sum of $1.9 billion over the \nnext four years to cover the costs of development \nprojects, in addition to what it hopes to raise from \npartners and donors. \n The strategy is designed to work closely with \nUNAMID, the Joint African Union-United Nations \nChief Mediator for Darfur, and the African Union \nExecutive Council in order to facilitate and arrange \nconsultations with the people of Darfur so as to \nuniversalize reconciliation and establish justice for all \nthrough national mechanisms and in close consultation \nwith all sectors of Darfurian society. \n It is worth noting that the strategy adopts a \npractical approach to implementation based on two \npillars. The first is the adoption of the idea of \npartnership. In that context, the Government has \nendeavoured to establish partnerships with all States \nand organizations that wish to engage with it on the \nbasis of the strategy. Foremost among those partners \nare UNAMID, the United Nations and its agencies and \norganizations, the African Union Executive Council, \nthe African Union itself and its institutions, the League \nof Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic \nConference. \n The second pillar is the exertion of special efforts to \ninvolve the citizens of Darfur \u2014 particularly at the grass-\nroots level and including elected representatives, civil \nsociety organizations and the internally displaced \u2014 so \nthat the centre of gravity of the peace process will not be \nfar removed from Darfurian society. Thus, the \nprescriptions for peace will be entrenched in the \nconscience of the people, which will facilitate their \nacceptance of them. This vision of peace has gathered \npowerful momentum from the positive changes in our \nrelationship with Chad, in addition to our vigorous efforts \nto strengthen our regional relations in the interest of \npromoting peace in the Sudan. \n With a view to bolstering stability in the various \nregions of the Sudan and eliminating the causes of \npotential armed conflicts, in October 2006 the \nGovernment concluded, in the Eritrean capital, \nAsmara, an agreement with the Eastern Front. The \nagreement provided for security arrangements that led \nto peace and security throughout the territory. In order \nto reinforce our efforts to implement the agreement, it \nwas agreed to convene an international conference on \nthe development and reconstruction of Eastern Sudan \non 1 December 2010, which the State of Kuwait has \ngraciously agreed to host. Preparations for the \nconference have been jointly undertaken by the United \nNations Development Programme, the Islamic \nDevelopment Bank in Jeddah, the Kuwaiti Fund for \nArab Economic Development and the Arab \nDevelopment Bank, in addition to the Sudanese \nGovernment. The conference will focus on three \ntopics: infrastructure, services and investment. From \nthis rostrum, I appeal to Member States to participate \n  \n \n10-55122 14 \n \nactively in that important forum in order to establish \nstability in that part of the Sudan. \n We are committed to combating impunity, which \nis part and parcel of the principle of international \njustice and does not admit politicization, \ndiscrimination or selectivity. However, selectivity and \npoliticization are prevalent in what is known as the \nInternational Criminal Court, which has become a tool \nto break the will of the people of the third world and to \nimpose hegemony over them. We have all witnessed \nthe hasty steps taken to subject a State non-party to the \nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court to its \npowers and jurisdiction, as a result of which the \nestablished principles of international law fell victim to \ncrude and unjust political intervention. \n Over the past six years, the Sudan has made \nprogress towards negotiated political settlements with \narmed movements in the South, East and West. The \ninvolvement of the International Criminal Court, in this \ncontext, directly jeopardizes the peaceful settlement \nprocess that the country seeks. Therefore, we \ncompletely reject this intervention, which has no place \nin international law, logic or policy, and is wholly \nunjustified. \n We appreciate and commend the position of the \nAfrican Union and other regional organizations to \nwhich the Sudan belongs, and of countries committed \nto the rule of international law that have condemned \nand strongly rejected the claims of the Court. \nTherefore, we call on the Security Council to \nreconsider its decision and to withdraw the file \ncompletely from the Court. In the light of the high-\nlevel meeting attended by representatives of all \nmembers of the Security Council and many other \ncountries, and of the Secretary-General\u2019s communiqu\u00e9 \nof 24 September commending the efforts of the \nSudanese Government to fight impunity (see SG/2165), \nthe Council should refer the entire file to the Sudanese \njustice system so that it can deliver justice pursuant to \nthe established rules of international law and national \nlegislation. \n After the signing of the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement, we hoped that the international community \nwould show cooperation commensurate with the \nSudan\u2019s many accomplishments. We hoped to be \nincluded in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries \n(HIPC) Debt Initiative and to resume receiving much-\nneeded development aid, like other States emerging \nfrom conflict, as reflected in relevant international \nrecommendations and resolutions. That should be in \naddition to the special treatment that the Sudan should \nenjoy as a least developed country. \n Similarly, we believe that the announcement by \ncreditors of their intention to cancel the Sudan\u2019s \nforeign debts would dispel concerns about the \nreferendum on Southern Sudan and the negotiations \nbetween the two parties regarding the post-referendum \narrangements. We therefore call for cancellation of the \nSudan\u2019s debts, on the basis of the same standards \napplied to other least developed African countries. That \nwould help fight trends that lead to confrontations and \ninstability and the deterioration of development in \ndeveloping countries. \n The African continent has continued to suffer \nfrom the repercussions of the global economic and \nfinancial crisis, as well as from the adverse effects of \nclimate change, including their impact on the prices of \nfood and energy. That has widened the scope of \npoverty and hunger and has increased social tensions, \nmigration, displacement, armed conflict and the \ninability of African States, especially the developing \ncountries, to cope with the humanitarian consequences \nof natural disasters. \n In that regard, we would like to draw attention to \nthe need to accord priority, through the New \nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development, to questions \npertaining to the continent on the United Nations \ndevelopment agenda; to build the capacity of African \nand African Union institutions to maintain peace; to \ntake affirmative action in financing the continent\u2019s \nplans for combating poverty, the AIDS pandemic and \nmalaria; and to provide humanitarian assistance and \nupgrade the capacities of African States in order to \nstrengthen their efforts in realizing the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \n The question of Palestine has been inscribed on \nthe United Nations agenda for many decades, while the \nPalestinian people have continued to suffer. They are \ndeported, displaced, killed, and driven away from their \nhomeland, despite the fact that the United Nations has \nadopted numerous resolutions that Israel has refused to \nimplement, in clear defiance of the will of the \ninternational community. We call upon Israel to \nimplement all international resolutions and return all \noccupied Arab lands in Palestine, the Golan Heights \nand Lebanon. An independent Palestine is a noble \n \n \n15 10-55122 \n \ndemand and is the legitimate right of the people of \nPalestine, supported by the calls of all peace-loving \npeoples and countries. \n We call for a Middle East free of nuclear weapons \nand weapons of mass destruction. We underline the \nright of States to acquire nuclear technology for \npeaceful uses and to settle disputes through dialogue \nand negotiation. We also stress the need to renounce \nharmful propaganda and the sowing of fear, panic and \ntension in the region. \n We pinned great hopes on the success of an \ninternational consensus on the issues of the \nenvironment and climate, in view of the direct and \nsevere effect of climate change on the life of people in \nmy country and in many others, as confirmed by \nstudies prepared by experts in this Organization and its \nspecialized agencies. That has prompted the Secretary-\nGeneral to draw attention to the close link between \nclimate change and a number of armed conflicts on the \nAfrican continent and elsewhere, in particular over \nDarfur. \n We therefore hoped that the efforts to address \nclimate change would be crowned with success at the \nCopenhagen Conference and that the developed \ncountries would pledge, on the basis of their historical \nresponsibilities, to adopt strategies and programmes \nwith clearly defined goals and principles aimed at \naddressing the root causes of climate change. We \nhoped they would pledge to provide the necessary \nfinancial resources for sharing responsibility for the \npreservation of this planet, while fully respecting the \nprinciples agreed on in the 1992 Earth Summit \nDeclaration in Rio de Janeiro. \nI am pleased to recall the laudable attention my \ncountry has given to the problem of mitigating the \neffects of climate change through numerous \nprogrammes, plans and institutions, as well as by \npromoting the necessary awareness of the gravity of \nthe problem among wide sectors of the population. \nHowever, that remains a moral obligation and a \nhumanitarian mission and responsibility that demands \njoint international efforts."

        "file_text": "Mozambique \nassociates itself with previous speakers in \ncongratulating you, Sir, on your unanimous election to \npreside over the sixty-fifth session of the United \nNations General Assembly. Indeed we feel confident \nthat your wisdom and diligence will provide positive \nleadership and success for our deliberations. We \nreaffirm our commitment to support your presidency \nand pledge to fully cooperate with you and all the other \nmembers of the Bureau in the discharge of your noble \nmission. \n We wish to express our gratitude to your \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki \nof the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, for his commitment to \nour Organization and for his strong leadership in \ncarrying out the work of the United Nations, both \nproductively and effectively during the previous \nGeneral Assembly session. \n Equally, I would like to commend the Secretary-\nGeneral, Ban Ki-moon, for his engagement in \npromoting peace and justice and, in particular, for his \ntireless efforts to mobilize the United Nations family to \nadequately address the global challenges facing the \nworld and humanity through concerted multilateral \napproaches. \n Recognizing the steering role of the United \nNations in global governance and highly appreciating \nthe wise choice of reflecting this important and timely \nitem during the present debate, I request your \nindulgence to seize this opportunity to share some \ninformation about developments in Mozambique. As \nwe move steadily towards strengthening the democratic \ninstitutions in Mozambique, we are proud to see that \n \n \n49 10-55128 \n \nthere have been significant achievements in both the \npolitical and the socio-economic spheres of the \ncountry. \n Indeed, thanks to the strengthened political \nstability that Mozambique currently enjoys, the \nGovernment is undertaking a comprehensive public \nsector reform and decentralization process in the area \nof public administration. Similarly, political and social \nstability and good macroeconomic management, \nsupplemented by the attractive investment legislation \nalready in place, have contributed immensely to \ncreating conditions conducive to promoting economic \ngrowth and sustainable development. \n Our main goal is to eradicate poverty, as it is one \nof the major challenges facing our people in their \nefforts to improve their living conditions. We are fully \naware that in fighting poverty we need also to \nsimultaneously address other related challenges, \nnamely, climate change, the energy crisis, food \ninsecurity and the global economic and financial crisis, \nwhose impacts constitute an enduring challenge, \nespecially for developing economies such as that of \nMozambique. All those challenges are interrelated and \nhave multiplier effects on our competitiveness and \ngrowth efforts. \n The threats posed by the negative impact of \nclimate change on our environment need to be \ncontinuously dealt with as a priority and should be \ncomprehensively addressed at the national, \nsubregional, regional and international levels. The \ndevastation due to problems originating in climate \nchange is degrading our environment at an astonishing \npace. In fact, Mozambique and many other countries in \nsub-Saharan Africa are being ravaged by cyclical \nnatural disasters that destroy major arable lands and \nthus reduce land productivity. \n There is no doubt that small island developing \ncountries face the risk of disappearing from the world \nmap. At the same time, it is also important to recognize \nthe plight of coastal developing countries like \nMozambique, which are suffering from the rise in sea \nlevels. \n The heavy burden resulting from the adverse \neffects of climate change constrains the ability of our \nGovernments to allocate the necessary financial and \nhuman resources to decisively address problems related \nto the environment. Hence, developing countries, \nparticularly sub-Saharan countries, do not have the \nrequired financial resources to undertake the necessary \nsteps to mitigate the impact of climate change. To that \nend, we are committed to continue working in a \nconcerted manner with international development \npartners, especially the United Nations and other \nstakeholders with a focus on creating conditions for \nadaptation and local community resilience to the \nimpact of climate change. \n Bearing in mind the principle of common but \ndifferentiated responsibility, we would like to underline \nthat our association with the Copenhagen Accord on \nclimate change is based precisely on our understanding \nthat the global nature of climate change demands a true \nmultilateral response. In that regard, we look forward \nto a successful outcome of the sixteenth Conference of \nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change \u2014 COP 16 \u2014 to be \nheld in Canc\u00fan later this year. We commend the active \nrole of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to \nensure a meaningful result of the climate change \nnegotiations. \n In addressing all the aforementioned challenges, \nstrong and able global governance is of utmost \nimportance to ensure the spurring of the political will \nneeded for concrete actions. The United Nations is the \nonly intergovernmental organization with a universal \ncharacter and the ability to mobilize such a capacity. \nThat is why we believe that concrete steps to \nstrengthen the central role of the United Nations in \nglobal governance are required, through providing it \nwith the adequate resources and authority \ncommensurate with its global responsibility to fully \nrespond to the growing global needs. \n Mozambique will remain engaged in the ongoing \nprocess of reforming the United Nations to ensure its \nefficiency and effectiveness, to increase its credibility \nand legitimacy as a representative of the people of the \nworld. \n In that regard, the revitalization of the role and \nthe authority of the General Assembly as the most \nrepresentative and legitimate organ of the United \nNations cannot be overemphasized. It is here where \neveryone is represented and every vote counts in deciding \non matters of common interest. So it is here where all the \nmost important decisions should be taken \u2014 from issues \nrelated to the maintenance of peace and security, the \npromotion of economic cooperation and social and \nhumanitarian matters to the promotion of human rights. \n  \n \n10-55128 50 \n \nEveryone should abide by and implement all decisions \nand resolutions taken here. Therefore, we need a strong \nGeneral Assembly, well resourced and with the \nnecessary authority to assume its responsibilities on \nbehalf of the international community. \n Another important track of reform that we are \nvery much attached to is the reform of the Security \nCouncil. Although there is no agreement yet on the \nlevel of attainment, we all agree that reform of the \nCouncil should be a priority in the whole United \nNations reform process. It is clear that we need a more \nbalanced representation in the Council. Moreover, we \nare of the view that a Council that is more fair and \ndemocratic in its decisions and actions would \nadequately meet the security necessities of the \ninternational community. \n For a meaningful reform of the Security Council, \nit is imperative that the historic injustice with regard to \nthe African continent be corrected. Indeed, today it is \nno longer acceptable that a continent that represents \nalmost 30 per cent of the whole United Nations \nmembership and whose concerns constitute more than \n60 per cent of the Council\u2019s agenda is not represented \nin the category of permanent member. In that light, \nAfrica deserves to be allocated permanent seats in any \nSecurity Council reform, based on the Ezulwini \nConsensus. \n There is also a need for a more coherent and \neffective United Nations system, capable of efficiently \naddressing and advancing durable solutions for the \npressing economic, social and humanitarian problems \ncurrently facing the world. Member States should also \ncontinue to discuss and find measurable solutions on \nhow to ensure coherence between policy decisions and \nthe implementation of commitments agreed in United \nNations international conferences and summits in the \nfield of development. \n In that regard, Mozambique is proud of the \nprogress made by the General Assembly on system-\nwide coherence. In particular, we commend the \nAssembly for its recent major step in the establishment \nof UN Women. I seize this opportunity to reiterate our \ncongratulations to Her Excellency Ms. Michelle \nBachelet on her appointment as Under-Secretary-\nGeneral of the new entity and pledge our full support \nfor and readiness to collaborate on the successful \naccomplishment of the task of bringing gender equality \nand the empowerment of women to the forefront of the \nUnited Nations work. \n It is also a fact that, although we are open to \nseeing the result of the independent evaluation of the \nOne United Nations pilot country initiative, it is our \nstrong belief that the progress made so far in the \nimplementation of that initiative is extremely \nencouraging. Therefore we call on the United Nations \nto support all countries that voluntarily decide to \nembark on the process of making the United Nations \nsystem work in a more coherent manner at the country \nlevel. \n With regard to the maintenance of international \npeace and security, Mozambique is committed to \ncontinuing to share its experience in the peaceful \nresolution of conflicts, particularly in southern Africa. \nIn our subregion, we share important responsibilities in \nthe promotion of peace and security, as well as with \nregard to regional integration as part of subregional \nand regional efforts to promote international peace and \nsecurity and sustainable development. \n We advocate international peace and security \nbecause we truly believe that they are part of the \nenabling conditions that allow countries to concentrate \ntheir attention on dealing with other pressing needs, \nsuch as the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria and other \ndiseases, the fight against international crime and drug \ntrafficking, addressing poverty-related problems and \nthe promotion of sustainable development. \n It is worth noting that the political situation and \nstability in Southern Africa have improved. Indeed, the \nprocess of implementing the Global Political \nAgreement in Zimbabwe has made significant strides. \nWe also remain committed, under the auspices of the \nSouthern African Development Community, to finding \na peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict in \nMadagascar. \n We are encouraged by the progress being made in \nstabilizing the political situation in Guinea-Bissau, \nespecially the ongoing reform of the armed forces and \nthe public administration. I take this opportunity to call \non the international community to continue supporting \nthe ongoing efforts of the Community of Portuguese-\nspeaking Countries and of the United Nations to find a \nsustainable and lasting peace in that sister country. \n Mozambique reiterates its support for the efforts \nof the international community to find a lasting \n \n \n51 10-55128 \n \nsolution to the problem of Western Sahara, and for the \nright of that country\u2019s people to self-determination. \n Mozambique is concerned that despite all \ncontinued international efforts, it has not been possible \nto bring about peace and stability in the Middle East. \nMozambique is deeply concerned about the volatile \nsituation in that region, where the conflict between \nIsrael and Palestine continues to deprive the \nPalestinian people of the realization of their \nfundamental human rights, including the right to their \nown land and resources and to live in peace with all \nneighbouring countries, including, obviously, Israel. \n We need a strong United Nations that can play a \ncentral role in mobilizing Member States and the \ninternational community at large to commit and fully \ncontribute to regional and international peace and \nsecurity and to an enabling environment for the \npromotion of sustainable development. \n That is why we believe in multilateralism. We \nreiterate our commitment to work in collaboration with \nall States Members of the Organization in the pursuit \nof our common goals to make the world a better place \nfor all humanity."

        "file_text": "\nHistory has shown us that words can change the face of \nthe world. It has proven that the spoken word can \ninfluence the future, but only when they go beyond \nrhetoric. What is our global governance worth if it does \nnot go beyond the expression of ambitions and \nintentions? Words remain ineffectual if they are not \nfollowed up with action. We must therefore act. I say \n\u201cwe\u201d, the nations united, because no country, no matter \n \n \n47 10-54833 \n \nhow large, can respond alone to the great challenges \nfacing humanity. I say \u201cwe\u201d because no large-scale \nproblem is limited to a single country, leaving \nuntouched the lives of those who live elsewhere. The \nobligation to act is a shared, global responsibility.\n That is why today my message is about \nresponsibility and increased accountability. \n At the heart of any form of governance lies \nresponsibility, be it global or local, national or \ninternational. But this is not enough. Indeed, \ngovernance is not only about behaving responsibly; it \nis also about being accountable. This applies not only \nat the level of the single State, but also at the level of \nour United Nations. \n Human rights, security and development are at \nthe core of the mandate of the United Nations. Former \nSecretary-General Kofi Annan pointed out the fact that \nthe three are inextricably linked when he said: \n \u201cThere will be no development without security \nand no security without development. And both \ndevelopment and security also depend on respect \nfor human rights and the rule of law.\u201d \n(A/59/2005, annex, para. 2) \nIt has indeed become common knowledge that human \nrights are unlikely to be protected in an insecure and \nunderdeveloped environment and that economic \ndevelopment cannot be durably sustained in a society \nwhere there is no rule of law. \n Accountability in international affairs is about \nrespecting international law \u2014 the rules that govern \nrelations among States. Without a solid legal basis, \ninternational cooperation remains optional and falls \nshort of the necessary transparency and long-term \nsustainability. Important steps have been taken to \nuphold the rule of law at the international level over \nthe past decades. \n Belgium pleads for the universal acceptance of \nthe competence of the International Court of Justice \nand the International Criminal Court. If all countries \nwere willing to follow up on this appeal, we would be \na step closer to having an effective and accountable \ninternational system. \n Meeting our responsibilities in the field of human \nrights means ensuring efficient means and mechanisms \nto ensure their protection. We need to instil more \ncoherence to our action. Unfortunately, today we focus \nour attention all too often on how to react to human \nrights violations while we should focus more on \nprevention and on the root causes of those violations. \n Human rights are universal. My country strongly \nopposes any form of relativism in this respect. \n International and regional human rights \ninstruments need to be strengthened. The evaluation \nwithin the Human Rights Council in 2011 should give \nimportant momentum to that strengthening. \n There is also a need for increased accountability \nin the field of security, another pillar of the United \nNations. Over the past year, important progress has \nbeen made. The Review Conference of the Parties to \nthe Non-Proliferation Treaty came to a substantial and \nbalanced result. Respect for Non-Proliferation Treaty \nprovisions and cooperation with the International \nAtomic Energy Agency are accountability in practice. \nUnfortunately, the non-acceptance or non-respect of \nthese provisions by countries like North Korea and Iran \nthreatens the international non-proliferation regime. \n In particular, Belgium welcomes the entry into \nforce earlier this year of the Convention on Cluster \nMunitions. The prohibition of the production and use \nof cluster munitions has become the international \nstandard. I am pleased and proud to announce that \nBelgium has recently destroyed its entire stock of \ncluster munitions. \n The Millennium Development Goals and climate \nnegotiations are at the top of our twenty-first century \nagenda, and rightly so. We are all responsible for our \nplanet. In fact, we are all accountable to current and \nfuture generations, especially in the field of poverty \nreduction and environmental protection. Let us not \nforget the ancient Native American saying: \u201cWe do not \ninherit the Earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from \nour children\u201d. \n Creating a world that is equitable, a world that \nwill last, is our common responsibility. Belgium is \ndoing so by spending 0.7 per cent of its gross domestic \nproduct on development cooperation. \n If we indeed accept the need to be accountable \nfor the results we do or do not obtain, we should have \nthe courage to evaluate and adapt the institutions and \ninstruments at our disposal. In that respect, Belgium \nfully supports the efforts of the European Union to \n  \n \n10-54833 48 \n \nparticipate in a timely and effective manner in the work \nof the General Assembly. \n If it is to contribute effectively to global \ngovernance and to take up its global responsibility, the \nUnited Nations needs to continue its efforts to become \nmore representative and more efficient. The creation of \nUN Women was a welcome development, and it has \nmy country\u2019s full support. Of course, gender will need \nto remain a mainstream theme influencing the actions \nof each and every United Nations institution. \n Important discussions on the reform of the \nSecurity Council have been ongoing for quite some \ntime. Belgium hopes that the negotiations will soon \nlead to concrete results. \n I have talked about institutions, and concerns \nabout institutions are, of course, legitimate. But they \nshould never lead us to forget that the first \naccountability of humankind is not created by \nabstractions or institutions, but by the face of a person \nin dire need; of the man, woman or child who is the \nvictim of violence; of those who suffer the violence of \nnature, or from violence perpetrated by other men. \n When it comes to humanitarian protection and \naid, responsibility and accountability have never been \nmore necessary. That is why United Nations \npeacekeeping missions with strong mandates, \nespecially in the field of the protection of civilians, are \nimportant and should be given the necessary \ninstruments, not least in the context of the fight against \nsexual violence. In this context, Belgium strongly \nsupports Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and \nits goals of ensuring the participation, protection and \npromotion of women in peace and security. \n The concept of sovereignty cannot be used as a \njustification for human rights violations against the \ncitizens of any country. On the contrary, sovereignty \nimplies the responsibility to protect, and we support \nthe efforts of the Secretary-General to further put this \nprinciple into practice. \n My key message of increased responsibility and \naccountability also applies to certain situations in the \nworld that I would like to address briefly: the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan and \nPakistan.\n The fiftieth anniversary of the independence of \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo has been an \nopportunity to measure the unquestionable progress \nmade over recent years. What is important as we move \nforward is the consolidation of peace and democracy in \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. Belgium is \npleased that the mandate of the United Nations \nOrganization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo has incorporated the element of \npeacebuilding alongside that of peacekeeping. \n The elections in 2006 allowed the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo to choose the path of \ndemocratization. The Congolese authorities have \nexpressed their determination to persevere on this path \nin confirming their intention to hold elections in 2011. \nThat deserves our full support. \n Despite all this progress, it is clear that many \nchallenges remain. In spite of the rapprochement \namong its neighbours, the situation in the East of the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo remains worrisome. \nWe were reminded of this by the shocking reports of \nwidespread rape in Luvungi. \n The fight against impunity, which is crucial to my \ncountry, hinges first and foremost on the strengthening \nof the rule of law. It is one of the primary \nresponsibilities of the authorities, but here, too, the \nsupport of the United Nations and the international \ncommunity is crucial. Belgium calls on the \ninternational community to continue to assume its \nresponsibility. Like in every country, the Afghan Government is \nheld accountable by the Afghan people. We hope that \nlast weekend\u2019s elections contributed to this. However, \nthe Afghan authorities do not stand alone. The \ninternational community, with a central role for the \nUnited Nations, assists the Afghan Government in \nenhancing the level of accountability to its population. \nGradually, the Afghan authorities need to take on more \nresponsibility, especially in the field of security. This \ntransfer is welcome, but rather than being calendar-\ndriven, it should be results-driven. \n The Belgian Government has decided to extend \nits current military and civilian presence until the end \nof 2011. We believe that 2011 will be of crucial \nimportance in transferring further security \n \n \n49 10-54833 \n \nresponsibilities. The focus of the Belgian presence \nbeyond 2011 will therefore likely be more and more on \ncivilian assistance. \n Nobody can remain untouched by the devastation \nand human suffering caused by the floods in Pakistan. \nAs members of the international community, we have \nto take on our responsibility. This \u201cslow-motion \ntsunami\u201d, as the Secretary-General called it, demands a \nlong-term and strategic answer. Belgium therefore \nwelcomes the three-step approach \u2014 the meeting last \nSunday in New York, the meeting in Brussels next \nmonth of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan, and the \ndonor event in November \u2014 which clearly sets out the \nframework for reconstruction. \n We have to move beyond the stage of emergency \naid. In this respect, I am glad to say that the European \nUnion last week took the firm commitment to improve \nmarket access for Pakistan as a concrete measure to \nreinvigorate Pakistan\u2019s economy. \n Allow me to conclude by recalling John F. \nKennedy\u2019s observation that the only reward for a \npolitician is a good conscience. It may be true that not \nmany other rewards should be expected for politicians. \nBut even so, the conscience of a politician cannot free \nhim from the obligation of being accountable to those \nhe wants to serve, to the people he wants to represent \nand to the country he wants to lead."

        "file_text": "Each year, the great family of nations comes together \nto assess what the Organization has achieved and to \nconsider together ways to respond to the problems \nfacing the world and to acknowledge what unites our \nnations and what still divides them. \n For 65 years, the General Assembly has carried \nout this both difficult and noble mission. That mission \nwas summarized very well by the first speaker at the \nfirst session of the General Assembly, on 10 January \n1946, as the maintenance of peace and security and the \nestablishment, through cooperation, of those conditions \nof stability and well-being which will ensure peaceful \nand friendly relations, based on the principle of equal \nrights and self-determination among the nations of the \nworld. \n Since then, the General Assembly has changed. \nThe number of Members has almost quadrupled, major \ndecisions have been made, historic documents have \nbeen adopted, old problems have given way to new, \nand the scope of responsibilities of the General \nAssembly has greatly increased as it has opened itself \nto new challenges in international security, \nnon-proliferation, disarmament, respect for human \nrights, poverty, terrorism, global warming, the financial \ncrisis and many other issues. \n In short, many things have changed, including the \ncentury. \n Nevertheless and despite the developments that \nhave marked recent decades, the situation in the region \nwhere Armenia is situated prompts me to return to that \nday, 10 January 1946, which is so distant yet so close, \ngiven the objectives that were put forward then and \nwhich continue more than ever to underpin our actions. \n How is it possible to maintain peace, security and \nstability when we keep raising defence spending and \nregularly threaten to use force and to start wars? How \ncan we promote friendly and peaceful relations \nbetween peoples when we promote intolerance and \nhatred and impose blockades and closed borders? How \ncan we assure the principle of the equal rights of \npeoples and their right to make their own decisions \nwhen we reject the fundamental principle of \ninternational law \u2014 the right of peoples to self-\ndetermination?\n I would like to hereby touch upon the conflict \nbetween Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh. The \npeople of Nagorno-Karabakh exercised their right to \nself-determination two decades ago. They fought for \ntheir right to freedom, withstanding the brutal war \nunleashed by Azerbaijan, which had suppressed them \nfor 70 years and attempted to cleanse them from their \nancestral home. For that purpose, it even resorted to \nthe use of mercenaries closely linked to international \nterrorist organizations. The people of Nagorno-\nKarabakh had to pursue their right to self-\ndetermination as they were being denied their right to \nexistence. \n The right of peoples to self-determination is a \nfundamental and indispensable right enshrined in the \n \n \n29 10-55109 \n \nCharter of the United Nations. The advisory opinion \nissued by the International Court of Justice in July \nreaffirmed the wisdom of the founders of this \nOrganization, who made sure that one of the \nfundamental principles for maintaining peace and \nstability in the world \u2014 the right of peoples to self-\ndetermination \u2014 could not be underrated in any way \ncompared with the other principles of international law. \n Let us be realistic. One cannot say each and every \ntime that this is the last self-determination case. No \none is able to stop the progress of history; otherwise, \nthere would not be 192 Member States in this \nOrganization instead of 51, as there were at the time of \nits founding. \n The Nagorno-Karabakh peace process moves \nforward with the internationally mandated mediation of \nthe Co-Chairs of the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group, who \ncontinue their persistent efforts aimed at the peaceful \nsettlement of the conflict based on the fundamental \nprinciples of international law: the non-use of force or \nthreat of force, the equal rights and self-determination \nof peoples and territorial integrity. \n On 17 July, at the margins of the OSCE informal \nministerial meeting in Almaty, the Minsk Group \nCo-Chairs issued a statement in which they reiterated \nthat the proposed principles and elements have been \nconceived as an integrated whole and that any attempt \nto select some of them over others would make it \nimpossible to achieve a balanced solution. Armenia \nfully shares this vision and will continue the \nnegotiations on that basis in search of a peaceful \nsettlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. \n Unfortunately, Azerbaijan rejects two of the three \nprinciples mentioned and is attempting not only to turn \nupside down the essence of the negotiation process, but \nalso to distort the nature of the conflict in various \ninternational forums, including the General Assembly, \nas happened here about two weeks ago and again two \ndays ago. That country is attempting to mislead the \ninternational community, presenting the consequences \nof the conflict as its causes. \n Azerbaijan\u2019s unabated war rhetoric, growing \nviolations of the ceasefire regime, and unprecedented \nmilitary budget increases only exacerbate the situation, \nraising concerns about the already fragile stability in \nthe region. Azerbaijan continues to reject proposals to \ncome to an agreement on the non-use of force or threat \nof force, as well as calls for the consolidation of the \nceasefire. Azerbaijan\u2019s attitude thus represents a threat \nto regional peace and security. The money it derives \nfrom oil revenues is being directed at funding new \nmilitary ventures. We all know the potential results of \nsuch adventurism. \n Azerbaijan should refrain from its continuing \nattempts to remove the settlement process from the \nMinsk Group format and framework and from making \nprovocative and bellicose statements and actions, in \norder that the negotiation process may proceed more \nconstructively and effectively. \n In an era when the protection and promotion of \nhuman rights are considered essential in the civilized \nworld, intolerance for the values of others and acts that \nintentionally, consistently and repeatedly damage or \ndestroy the cultural or religious heritage of other \ncivilizations must be condemned with the same resolve \nand determination as violence against people. \n The destruction by Azerbaijanis between 1998 \nand 2005 in Nakhichevan of thousands of cross-stones \ndelicately carved by Armenian masters in the ninth to \nthe sixteenth centuries is a vivid example of such a \ncrime. Under the Azerbaijani Government\u2019s watchful \neye, thousands of these gigantic medieval sculptures \nwere bulldozed and the area turned into a military zone \nin a Government-sanctioned operation. A resolution at \nthe sixteenth General Assembly of the International \nCouncil on Monuments and Sites stated regretfully \nwith regard to this act of vandalism: \u201c\u2026 this heritage \nthat once enjoyed its worthy place among the treasures \nof the world\u2019s heritage can no longer be transmitted \ntoday to future generations\u201d. \n Armenia\u2019s initiative for the normalization of \nrelations with Turkey without any preconditions was \nfully supported by the international community. Last \nyear, after intensive negotiations, we achieved \nagreement and finally signed the Armenian-Turkish \nprotocols. We made a confident investment in a durable \nrapprochement, while Turkey, unfortunately, \nbacktracked from its commitments and not only \nrefrained from ratifying the signed protocols, but \nreturned to its initial language of preconditions. \nConsequently, the Armenian-Turkish border continues \nto remain the only closed border in Europe. Good \nintentions must be proved in deeds, not just words. \nArmenia is ready to move forward when Turkey will \n  \n \n10-55109 30 \n \nonce again be prepared to normalize relations without \npreconditions. \n While we are discussing all possible ways to \ncreate a more prosperous and safer world for our \npeoples, we would be remiss if we did not speak about \nthe responsibility to protect. As a nation we survived \nthe most heinous crime against humanity, genocide, \n95 years ago. We attach the utmost importance to \nfurthering all international efforts aimed at the \nprevention of genocide and crimes against humanity. It \nis encouraging that further discussions of the \nSecretary-General\u2019s report on early warning, \nassessment and the responsibility to protect (A/64/864) \nare being held in the General Assembly. This will \nenable us come up with a formula that will allow us to \nact in a timely and coherent manner, utilizing all the \nUnited Nations system resources and capabilities for \nearly warning, assessment and prevention of situations \nthat could lead to genocide, war crimes or crimes \nagainst humanity. \n To bolster United Nations capacity to deal with \ncurrent challenges and those ahead, we need to \nincrease our efforts to further the process of United \nNations reform, making more efficient and effective \nuse of existing resources, making the \u201cOne United \nNations\u201d policy work, and better utilizing regional \ncapacities to complement our global actions. \n Today, the world is evolving faster than ever. To \nmeet security, political, economic, social, \nenvironmental and other challenges we simply have to \nput our efforts, resources, and political determination \ntogether to deal with them and move the international \ndevelopment agenda forward."

        "file_text": "Let me begin by \ncongratulating the President of the Assembly on his \nelection to lead the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I \ntrust that he will, with his outstanding experience and \nexcellent diplomatic skills, steer this Assembly to a \nsuccessful conclusion. I also wish to thank his \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, \nfor the efficient and able manner with which he \npresided over the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. \n Ghana subscribes to the declaration by the \nAfrican Union Assembly of Heads of State and \nGovernment that designated 2010 as a year of peace \nand security. Ghana will, therefore, continue to engage \nother member States in the search for peace and \nsecurity in places on the African continent that have \nknown no peace, and we will contribute to renewed \nglobal efforts to prevent conflicts through preventive \ndiplomacy, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. \n As we witness a decline in the number of the \nviolent conflicts that afflicted many countries over the \npast decade or more, it is time to renew our \ncommitment to the work of the Peacebuilding \nCommission in order to ensure that countries emerging \nfrom conflict do not relapse into violence. Ghana was \nprivileged to have served on the organizational \ncommittee of the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) \nand will remain actively involved in the pursuit of the \nattainment of the strategic objectives set for the post-\nconflict countries on the agenda of the Commission\u2019s \ncountry-specific configuration. In this regard, Ghana \nsupports the steps being taken to also place Liberia on \nthe agenda of the Commission. \n As agreed by world leaders in 2005, Ghana \nstrongly supports the principle of the responsibility to \nprotect as the normative framework to prevent and \ndeter the occurrence of genocide, war crimes, crimes \nagainst humanity and ethnic cleansing, which have \noccurred in many countries that were emerging from \nconflict. While the fear of its abuse does not take away \nthe intrinsic value of the principle of the responsibility \nto protect, caution must be exercised in order to avoid \nits abuse. The principle is not intended to undermine \nthe sovereignty of States; on the contrary, it is to \nensure that sovereign responsibility is exercised in a \nmanner that will prevent a repetition of the mass \natrocities that were experienced in places like Rwanda, \nSrebrenica, Cambodia and Sierra Leone, with \ndevastating impacts on neighbouring countries. \n Sadly, in many places, some of those conflicts \npersist in varying degrees of intensity. The \ninternational community must be ready and willing to \nassist national authorities who request such assistance \nwith a view to developing or enhancing the capacity of \ncountries that are manifestly unable or unwilling to \nuphold this responsibility to do so. To that end, we \nwelcome the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal to establish \na joint office to coordinate United Nations system-wide \nefforts to strengthen early warning mechanisms aimed \nat ensuring timely and decisive preventive action \nand/or intervention in appropriate cases, in accordance \nwith the United Nations Charter. \n  \n \n10-55264 22 \n \n While the reduction of extreme poverty and \nhunger is a major development challenge for Africa, \nmost countries in the region are also grappling with the \nproblems of climate change, a high disease burden, \npoor infrastructure, brain drain and the lack of \ndevelopment of productive capacity. In the last few \nyears, African countries have had to deal with the \neffects of rising food and energy prices and the \ncomplications arising from the global financial and \neconomic crisis. Those multiple crises have not only \nreversed impressive recent progress in economic \nperformance, but are also jeopardizing efforts by \nAfrican countries to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \n It is gratifying to see that the interests of the \ninternational community in climate change have \nincreased markedly in recent times, especially after the \nadoption of the Bali Action Plan in 2007. We need to \nsustain that interest and build on the common ground \nthat was first found in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, with the \nestablishment of the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change, and was subsequently \nbuilt on in Berlin, Kyoto, Marrakech, Bali, \nCopenhagen and, soon, Canc\u00fan. \n There are issues that need to be addressed for \nprogress in Canc\u00fan and beyond. What is missing is a \ndemonstrable political will. Without that, countries will \nnot see the need to raise their ambitions to cut \nemissions. Industrialized countries have made pledges \nto cut emissions by 2020. However commendable those \ncommitments may be, they fall short of the 25 to \n40 per cent cut that the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change says will give the world a chance of \nstaying below the recommended two-degree average \nglobal temperature rise. \n We need to preserve the Kyoto Protocol, which is \ncurrently the only existing international agreement \nwith legal status to verify emission reductions. That is \nwhy it is critical for all parties to work together to \naddress the divisions over a second commitment period \nfor the Kyoto Protocol and ensure its continuity after \n2012. \n Just as there was \u201caid fatigue\u201d, developing \ncountries may soon be experiencing \u201cpromise fatigue\u201d. \nWe must get the numerous pledges out of the fine print \nand make them work for humanity. I am simply \nappealing to industrialized nations to fulfil their \nfunding pledges, including the $30 billion in fast-track \nfinancing for developing country adaptation and \nmitigation efforts through 2012, and the pledge to raise \n$100 billion a year by 2020. For developing countries, \nthe early delivery and transparent allocation of that \nmoney will boost our confidence in the dialogue and \nshow that industrialized countries are truly committed \nto progress in the broader negotiations. \n We have made progress in the implementation of \nthe MDG agenda. However, keeping the solemn \npromise we made in 2000 and achieving the Goals by \n2015 will require intensified efforts, much more \nresources and effective cooperation. No one should be \noblivious to the enormous challenges African and other \ndeveloping countries face in their efforts to achieve the \nMDGs. \n Ghana will not compromise under any guise in its \npursuit of good governance and the promotion of the \nrule of law, as these are important prerequisites for \nachieving sustainable social and economic \ndevelopment. African countries themselves have come \nto acknowledge that part of the reason for their \nimpoverishment could be ascribed to poor post-\nindependence governance practices. That is why most \nAfrican countries have taken steps to consolidate their \ngovernance institutions, including strengthening the \nelectoral system. \n Food security is a national priority for Ghana. For \nmost Ghanaians, getting enough good-quality food at \naffordable prices is a major concern. The Government \nis therefore implementing a progressive agricultural \npolicy that will ensure increased production, especially \nin staples and other food crops that our climate and \nland can efficiently support. \n Ghana will soon become an important producer \nof oil and gas. The focus of the Government is to \nensure that Ghanaians will derive the maximum benefit \nfrom oil production. Although oil revenues will start to \nflow around the fourth quarter of the year, the \nGovernment is taking measures to ensure \naccountability and transparency in the management of \nrevenue from oil production. To that end, an oil and gas \nrevenue management bill has been submitted to \nParliament for approval. In addition, the Government is \nholding a series of consultations with several countries \nand private operators who have expertise and \nexperience in the field so that their knowledge can be \ntapped and best practices adopted. \n \n \n23 10-55264 \n \n In our efforts to create wealth and prosperity for \nour citizens, Ghana has made attracting foreign \ninvestment an important pillar in its development \nstrategies. We will continue to pursue such policies in \nthe belief that our efforts will be supported and \nrewarded with genuine partnership. \n Africa is tired of the misery and poverty arising \nfrom resource-induced violent conflicts. Africa wants \nto use its oil and natural resources to create wealth for \nits citizens. We call on the United Nations and \nwell-meaning development partners, including the \ninternational business community, to support our \nefforts to nip the so-called resource curse in the bud \nand exploit our God-given natural endowments for \ndevelopment. \n Whereas the international environment for \ngrowth in Africa is still favourable, the risks posed by \nglobal imbalances and external shocks, such as the \nrecent financial crisis, call for increased international \npolicy coordination. We need a renewed spirit of \nsolidarity and commitment for a comprehensive global \nresponse if we are to confront the challenges of our \ntime. \n It is in that light that Ghana wishes to reaffirm its \ncommitment to the ideals of the United Nations and \ncontinue to live up to its Charter obligations, including \nplaying an active role in international peacekeeping, in \norder to assist the Organization in its task of \nmaintaining global peace and security and promoting \nfruitful and beneficial cooperation among Member \nStates. We must resolve to muster the political will to \nstrengthen the United Nations so that it can function \neffectively and redeem the majority of our peoples \nfrom wars, diseases and poverty by providing the \nfinancial and material resources required to discharge \nthose onerous responsibilities. \n It is only when we measure up to those \nresponsibilities that we can give meaning to the phrase \n\u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations\u201d."

        "file_text": "Our world continues \nto change in profound ways. Technological advances \nhave accelerated globalization, bringing diverse \nchallenges and new agendas. The magnitude of today\u2019s \nthreats requires holistic solutions with a multilateral \napproach. No one country, however powerful, can meet \nthem on its own. Nations of the world need to work \ntogether to forge a coordinated approach. It is a shared \nresponsibility, and the problems will be solved \nsuccessfully only through effective collaboration. \n To meet the challenges, a vibrant institution that \nis up to the task and responds to the imperatives of our \ntime is required. Sixty-five years ago, the world \ncreated the United Nations as the legitimate authority \nfor our collective peace and security. International \ncooperation and solidarity formed the bedrock of its \nexistence. To this day, the United Nations provides the \nonly viable framework and legitimate authority for \nacting globally to address issues that transcend national \nborders. \n As a world institution, the United Nations needs \nto pay attention to its ability to offer itself as a safe \nplace, not just for its traditional stakeholders \u2014 the \nMember States \u2014 but also for international \norganizations, the business community and civil \nsociety. Partnerships with those sectors of society are \nan important vehicle through which the United Nations \nhelps the development of individual countries, and they \nallow our Organization to achieve, in large measure, \nthe key objectives of its mission. \n Our Organization is not without shortcomings, \nand that is why we must constantly redefine its role \nand adapt it to respond to the needs of the world that it \nexists to serve. That is why, with regard to Security \nCouncil reform, Samoa has not wavered over the years \nfrom its principled support for an expanded Council in \nboth the permanent and non-permanent memberships. \nThe economic and political liberalization has changed \nthe contemporary geopolitical realities and landscape, \nand the therefore enlargement of the Security Council \nin both categories is essential for true multilateralism \nand for the Council\u2019s integrity and credibility. \n Equally vital is the ongoing reform to give \nprominence to the General Assembly as the truly \ndeliberative and representative body in the global \ndecision-making process, giving voice and \nrepresentation to all Member States, irrespective of a \ncountry\u2019s wealth and might. That was the basis for \nSamoa becoming a Member of this world body over \n30 years ago. \n The threat of climate change is grave, having dire \nimplications for global peace and security. It threatens \nto intensify existing drivers of conflict in a way that \ncould roll back development across many countries. \nThe causes of climate change and those responsible for \nthem, the multifaceted threats it poses and the solutions \nto mitigate and adapt against its negative impacts are \nwell documented and duly validated by science and \nreal life experiences. \n A new climate change instrument is currently \nunder negotiation. Progress has been painfully slow, \nwhich contradicts the gravity and urgency of the \nproblem. Sadly, vested national interests are taking \nprecedence over concern for a global and just solution. \nIntransigent positions are being advanced to force \nconcessions and to frustrate progress. For a privileged \nfew, their fortunate geographies and resource \nendowments may persuade them to feel that climate \nchange is not an urgent priority and that they can \nafford to wait out the negotiation of a legally binding \nclimate change agreement for as long as it takes. \n There is no such luxury for island nations, which \nparadoxically are at the front line of the destructive \nimpacts of climate change but are least responsible for \nits causes and often least able to respond and adapt. \nIndeed, for some island nations, climate change \nthreatens their very existence and survival as sovereign \nStates. \n With the stakes so high, climate change is \nunquestionably an immediate and urgent priority for \nthe world. It would be a big mistake for any country to \nthink otherwise. Similarly, it would be unhelpful to \nview climate change simply as an environmental issue. \nClimate change is cross-cutting and endangers \neconomic and social development, with serious \nimplications for the peace and security of our \n \n \n27 10-55122 \n \ncommunities, whether its impact is national or \ntransborder. \n Any new climate change treaty, no matter how \nambitious, comprehensive and binding, will be \nineffectual without full membership and the \nparticipation of all United Nations Member States, \nespecially those with the obligation to participate. \nInaction should not be blamed on the absence of \nsolutions to reverse the impacts of climate change but \nrather on the unwillingness of some countries to be part \nof a unified global solution. \n The much publicized fast-track funding \nannounced in Copenhagen to meet the adaptation needs \nof the most vulnerable countries has become a best-\nkept secret. Information on how much of the pledges \nhave been honoured and disbursed, and to whom, has \nbeen scarce. When available, the information is vague \nand seems bereft of coordination. Yet the fast-track \nresources were commitments made at the highest \npolitical level, in recognition at Copenhagen of the \npressing need for an interim measure to help the most \nvulnerable countries avert further harmful effects of \nclimate change, pending the conclusion of a negotiated \nagreement. \n The uncertainty as to the legal form, content and \ncompletion date of a new treaty makes it a moral \nimperative for the promised fast-track resources to be \nmade available without delay and with clear, simplified \nguidelines to ensure that the intended recipients do \nindeed secure assistance. \n Between now and the conference in Canc\u00fan, \nStates parties should move beyond rhetoric and commit \nto reaching an agreement, as a minimum, on those \nbuilding blocks of the Bali Action Plan where \nnegotiations have reached a level of maturity and \nconvergence on agreed compromises. We cannot \ncontinue to defer making the hard decisions. We need \nto reclaim the credibility of the process. Every day of \nindecisiveness disproportionately increases the risks to \nvulnerable countries that are experiencing more \nfrequent and severe climate change impacts. \n We cannot afford to leave Canc\u00fan empty-handed. \nConcrete results must be achieved, not only to give our \npeople confidence that there are substantive responses \nto protect against climate change, but at the same time \nto strengthen our belief that our United Nations can \ndeliver a legally binding agreement. \n Our global security is at risk. Terrorism \ntranscends international borders in its attack on \nuniversal values. Like other international threats, \nterrorism is an area of mutual concern that demands a \ncollective response. Terrorist acts committed under \nwhatever pretext are deeply deplorable and should be \nstrongly condemned. Those who find self-glorification \nin the atrocious crimes that they commit should not \nexpect any sympathy or be provided safe havens to \nhide. \n The non-proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and the risk of their acquisition by \nterrorists, criminals and others should continue to be a \ntop priority of the United Nations. Nuclear terrorism is \none of the most challenging threats to international \npeace and security. A world without nuclear weapons is \na safer, more secure and prosperous place to live. \n We have heard from this podium of the renewed \nefforts of the major nuclear-weapons Powers to restart \nthe reduction of their nuclear arsenals. That is \nencouraging, but we believe that the only absolute \nguarantee against the use and threat of use of nuclear \nweapons is through their total elimination. In that \nconnection, we are comforted by the announcement of \nthe United States Government earlier in the year that it \nwas moving towards ratification of the Pacific region\u2019s \nnuclear-free-zone treaty. \n The peacekeeping work of the United Nations \ncontributes, in large measure, to the stability of \ncountries and regions where it has a presence. It is one \nof the Organization\u2019s growing and most visible \nmandates and has the full support of my Government. \nSamoa\u2019s policewomen and policemen are serving side \nby side with officers of other contributing countries in \npeacekeeping missions in Timor-Leste, the Sudan and \nDarfur. In our Pacific region, we continue to honour \nour commitment to the Regional Assistance Mission to \nSolomon Islands, under the aegis of the Pacific Islands \nForum, through our police contingents. \n Samoa welcomes the recent initiative, brokered \nby the United States, for direct negotiations between \nthe leaders of Israel and Palestine to advance the two-\nState solution, with the nations of Israel and Palestine \nliving alongside each other in peace and security. We \nremain hopeful that with the genuine support and \nunderstanding of other leaders in the region, this will \nnot be another missed opportunity. \n  \n \n10-55122 28 \n \n This Wednesday marks the first anniversary of \nthe tsunami that devastated my country, resulting in a \nheavy loss of life, injury and destruction of property. \nLife will never be the same for the survivors and those \nwho lost loved ones. However, a sense of normalcy has \nreturned and stability has been re-established. \n With the generous support of our development \npartners, the reconstruction phase is progressing well \nand the families and villages affected have been \nresettled on higher ground inland, away from the coast. \nThe necessary infrastructure and utilities for the new \nsettlements are well on their way towards completion. \nThe progress achieved would not have been possible \nwithout the kindness and understanding of Samoa\u2019s \ndevelopment partners and the international community. \n Of significant importance to Samoa in its efforts \nto reinvigorate the economy following the dual impacts \nof the tsunami devastation and the financial crisis is the \nrecent Assembly resolution (resolution 64/295) \ngranting Samoa three more years, to 2014, to put in \nplace a transition strategy to guarantee the \nsustainability of its economic performance after its \ngraduation from least developed country (LDC) status \nin that year. Samoa\u2019s post-tsunami experience and the \npassage of the consensus LDC resolution are important \ndemonstrations of the close and warm relations that my \ncountry enjoys with United Nations Members. \n At the bilateral and personal level, my \nGovernment has already acknowledged the timely and \ntremendous support of all who contributed during the \nemergency and in the recovery and rebuilding phases \nin the aftermath of the tsunami. The United Nations \nmembership was similarly thanked when our LDC \nresolution was adopted. Nevertheless, on behalf of the \npeople and Government of Samoa, I would like here in \nthe General Assembly to again convey our sincere \nappreciation to all our development partners, including \nAustralia, New Zealand, Japan, the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, the European Union, the United States of \nAmerica, our Pacific neighbours, the United Nations \nand its related and specialized agencies, and others too \nmany to mention for their generosity and kindness to \nSamoa. We are very grateful."

        "file_text": "The \nnature of the discussions and decisions taken at the \nHigh-level Plenary Meeting has clearly demonstrated \nthat the various problems, challenges and threats we \nface, however difficult and dangerous they may be, can \nonly be overcome if we work together. The world has \nchanged significantly over the past 10 years, and our \ncapacity to make peoples\u2019 lives in all continents better \nand safer has been broadened. We have seen the change \nin international relations. There has been an \nenhancement of constructive, mutually respectful \ndialogue between States, and a new global partnership \nis forming. All the preconditions exist so that at this \nsession we can establish a road map of international \ncooperation on all strategic issues referred to in the \nOutcome Document of the Summit. Particular attention \nshould be given to the financial economic sphere, \nbecause it is directly linked to achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals. We can achieve those \nGoals, even in the current situation, if the necessary \nfinancial resources, skills and technologies are used to \nsupport development. What has been done so far is \ninsufficient. If we analyse the current situation in an \nobjective way, we see that the largest developed \ncountries have spent trillions of dollars on supporting \ntheir economies. This has given some results, but the \nbackdrop of this is that it has become clear that \nproviding resources for official development assistance \nand international technical assistance continues to be \nbelow the real needs of developing countries and \ncountries in transition. Developed countries have \nadopted protectionist measures. There has been price \npressure on small and medium countries for many \nsensitive categories of goods. In such a context, \nprogress towards the Millennium Development Goals \ncannot be smooth. \n In general terms, Belarus supports the work of the \nGroup of 20 (G-20) and the Group of Eight (G-8) to \novercome the world economic crisis, but we must \nassume that the major countries in these clubs will first \nand foremost promote their own interests. The General \nAssembly must take the necessary measures to improve \nthe economic toolbox of the entire United Nations \nsystem. Otherwise our Organization will not be able to \nplay an important role in global economic management \nand small and medium-sized countries will have no \nleverage on these processes. \n First of all, we must continue the process of \nupdating the work and enhancing the potential of the \nBretton Woods institutions and increase the role of \ndeveloping countries and countries with transitional \neconomies in decision-making in their governing \nbodies. The General Assembly, although it might not \nbe able directly to influence this process, must raise its \nvoice on this issue. We refer here to those bodies where \nall countries, without exception, can put forward their \npositions and submit appropriate proposals. \n In 2005 and 2006, significant efforts were made \nto improve the work of the Economic and Social \nCouncil, converting it from a body that coordinates the \nwork of thematic commissions and committees in the \neconomic and social spheres to a body that adopts \npolitical decisions and recommendations in those areas. \nSome progress has been achieved here, of course; but it \nis insufficient if we want to reach by 2015 good \nindicators with regard to implementing the strategic \ntasks under the Millennium Development Goals. The \nEconomic and Social Council is still the same: it has \nnot become a full-fledged economic organ of the \nUnited Nations. We suggest in the remaining five years \nthat the Council should give special attention to each \nof the Millennium Development Goals and make \nappropriate recommendations to the General Assembly \nand to Member States.  \n Belarus, which has submitted its candidature for \nmembership of the Economic and Social Council in \n2011, is ready to work actively in this regard. \n We cannot attain the Millennium Development \nGoals unless we establish a genuine, strong structure of \nUnited Nations operational activities. Here, we \nwelcome the increased intergovernmental dialogue on \nenhancing coherence in the operations of United \nNations agencies and the measures that have been \ntaken to reform the United Nations gender architecture. \nBesides enhancing the institutions, the financing of \nbodies that undertake operational activities needs to be \nimproved. In this Hall, we have heard many addresses \nwith regard to the work of the G-8 and the G-20 and their \n \n \n23 10-55276 \n \ninitiative to find innovative approaches to financing. We \nhave heard of the intention of the European Union to \nmonitor the Union\u2019s respect for its commitments with \nregard to official development assistance. We hope that \nthose measures will indeed be implemented. \n Belarus, like many other delegations in this room, \nis concerned at the status of the Doha multilateral trade \ntalks, particularly given the recent trends towards a \ntougher position by developed countries. Developing \ncountries in particular suffer from this, as do medium-\nincome countries. For more than 10 years, talks have \nbeen under way on membership of the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) of about 30 States. Is this a \nnormal situation if we are talking about the need to \nensure that States move forward on achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals and a genuinely \nmultilateral trade system? This is genuine \ndiscrimination against certain States. Therefore we \nbelieve that the rules for WTO membership by these \ncountries should be reviewed and simplified. \n If we are now serious about United Nations \nmanagement of global processes, then General \nAssembly resolutions on the role of international trade \nin stimulating development should be more targeted \ntowards achieving long-term results. What is most \nimportant is to make recommendations on urgent \ncollective measures to establish a multilateral trading \nsystem that meets the needs of today\u2019s world. \n The General Assembly must send an unequivocal \npolitical signal to parties to the upcoming Canc\u00fan talks \non developing a new post-Kyoto international \nagreement on limiting emissions of greenhouse gases. \nThis year we have seen that the measures that have \nbeen taken have been inadequate. The virtual absence \nof targeted collective measures by the international \ncommunity could lead to irreversible consequences. If \nStates are ready to demonstrate genuine partnership in \norder to avoid the worst-case scenario, then the \nGeneral Assembly must adopt a resolution on the \nproblem of climate change and offer relevant \nrecommendations and proposals before the  \n29 November opening of the sixteenth Conference of \nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change.  \n It is time to end competing ambitions with regard \nto climate change. Belarus has direct experience of the \nlow level of cooperation between countries and the \nlevel of their respect for each other\u2019s interests. This has \nmeant that our attempts to adopt the most stringent \nvoluntary quantitative limits under the Kyoto Protocol, \nand thus to make our contribution to the common goal \nof protecting the climate, have so far been \nunsuccessful. Belarus\u2019s amendment to Annex B of the \nKyoto Protocol has not yet entered into force. \n Closely related to protection of the climate is the \nissue of a reliable system of global energy security and \nthe development of so-called green economies. Many \nStates already have considerable experience in \nestablishing sustainable, low-carbon economies. Many \nStates still do not have clean technology, and this puts \na brake on their development. Of course, neither the \nUnited Nations system nor any other international \norganization can immediately resolve this problem on \nits own. Establishing a promising international \nmechanism of cooperation in order to enhance access \nto cutting-edge energy technologies, including \ntechnology for new and renewable energy sources, is \npossible only on the basis of a genuine partnership, \nwith leadership from the United Nations and from \nStates that have been most successful in developing \ngreen economies. \n Belarus has already made a significant \ncontribution to establishing such partnerships. We have \nestablished an international laboratory for renewable \nsources of energy based at the Energy Institute at the \nNational Academy of Sciences. This is first and \nforemost a platform for exchanging experiences with \nregard to renewable energy. This is no less important \nthan addressing the climatic conditions in our \ncountries; it will provide an experimental basis for \ndeveloping and testing effective uses of green \ntechnologies. Without any doubt this will make a \nsignificant contribution to developing global renewable \nenergy. We can only imagine how much progress the \ninternational community would make if each State in \nthe world would, within its means, contribute resources \nto the development of renewable energy, aimed not \nonly at its own domestic needs but also at exchanging \nexperiences with foreign colleagues. \n The MDG Summit confirmed the need for the \ninternational community to find longer-term solutions \nto problems. By following such an approach, States \nMembers of the United Nations will, as the Secretary-\nGeneral has said, be able to provide a better future for \nall. Achieving this was the aim of the declaration by \nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus on \nestablishing a partnership with young people to protect \n  \n \n10-55276 24 \n \nthem from social decline; the theme of this partnership \nis helping future generations prosper. The theme of \nyoung people is not new in itself, and it has often been \ndiscussed in various forums. But implementing this \nidea would enable us to take a qualitative step forward \nin establishing a reliable basis for sustainable human \ndevelopment. We are convinced that Member States \nwill support the Belarus initiative to convene a \nthematic General Assembly debate on supporting \ntalented young people and protecting the coming \ngeneration from social decline. \n In April next year we will mark the twenty-fifth \nanniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. In the varied \nspectrum of contemporary challenges and threats the \nissue of Chernobyl has unfortunately become a low \npriority. But the objective situation is that the \nconsequences of that massive man-made disaster are \nstill being felt, which means that implementing the \nUnited Nations 10-year plan for recovery and long-\nterm development of the affected regions is still an \nurgent task. That is not just of concern to Belarus, \nRussia and Ukraine; the successful mitigation of the \nconsequences of Chernobyl is in the interests of the \nentire international community. \n Given that situation, Belarus, Russia and Ukraine \nintend to prepare a draft resolution on enhancing \ninternational cooperation and coordination of efforts in \norder to study, mitigate and minimize the consequences \nof the Chernobyl disaster. That is intended to further \nintensify measures to implement a plan of action and \ndraw the attention of the international community to \nthe memorial events planned for 2011 in the capitals of \nthe States most affected by the Chernobyl disaster. We \ncall for support for that draft resolution on Chernobyl \nin the General Assembly and for the traditional \nsolidarity with the most affected countries. \n This year the Republic of Belarus for the first \ntime became a participant in and donor to United Nations \npeacekeeping operations. That again demonstrates that \nBelarus not only shares the purposes and principles of \nthe United Nations Charter but is making a tangible \ncontribution to strengthening international peace and \nsecurity. \n In conclusion, allow me to assure the Assembly \nthat our country will continue to play its part in \nenhancing the authority and increasing the institutional \ncapacity of the United Nations. Given its universal \nnature, the United Nations should guard and enhance \nits paramount role in the global management of peace \nprocesses, improve people\u2019s lives and protect them \nfrom the threats and challenges of our unstable times.

        "file_text": "I bring to all delegates at this \nsixty-fifth session of the General Assembly the warm \ngreetings of my Government and people. \n The United Nations was founded out of the ashes \nof war and violence. Its noble ambitions, grounded in \nthe timeless values of peace, equality and justice, seek \nto create a better world for this and future generations. \nBut if those values are to mean anything, the United \nNations must not be merely about a statement of \naspiration. Instead, we must strive until the United \nNations provides the framework where the timeless \nvalues I speak of can be given life through meaningful \nand practical responses to the contemporary challenges \nour peoples face. \n The challenges are many, but this week has drawn \nthree of them into particularly sharp focus: first, our \nglobal efforts to halve poverty and achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals by 2015; secondly, a \nglobal financial crisis that threatens to undo much of \nthe progress we have made in lifting people out of \npoverty; and thirdly, a climate crisis that carries the \nrisk of planet-wide disruption that endangers entire \nnations and the continuation of much of what we take \nfor granted today. \n Those challenges are all a function of the \ndominant characteristic of the modern world: our \ninterconnectedness as a global community. And we will \nmeet the challenges only if we adopt an interconnected \nresponse. The notion that we can protect our national \nand global interests through inward-looking national \nresponses is no longer valid. Instead, it is in all of our \ninterests for the United Nations to provide the platform \nthat facilitates global, interconnected responses. \n  \n \n10-54965 16 \n \n But I think we have some way to go if that \nplatform is to be created. When it comes to the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), although \nprogress has been made, we have not connected the \nrhetorical support for their achievement to actual \ndelivery. When it comes to the financial crisis, we have \nnot connected the benefits of globally open financial \nsystems to measures that protect against the risks that \nthose systems create. And when it comes to the climate \ncrisis, we have not connected the scientific evidence to \nglobal policy responses that mitigate the worst \nextremes of climate change. \n We could choose to continue in this vein, but it is \nclear where that would lead us. Or we could choose to \nask ourselves if we are prepared to be held accountable \nfor carrying our share of the responsibility.  \n My country recognizes that we must deliver our \npart. We are on track to meet most of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, especially in the areas of \neducation and health. We are doing all we can to \nweather the financial crisis with the minimum suffering \nfor our people. And we recognize that we must do more \nthan just complain about climate change. We have \ncreated our Low Carbon Development Strategy, which \nsets out a long-term path to protect our 16-million-\nhectare rainforest and move our entire economy onto a \nlow carbon trajectory. \n But there are times when it feels as though the \ninternational system sets out to put hurdles on the path \nto overcoming the challenges. Inconsistencies and a \nlack of coherence among aid, trade and climate policies \nin the developed world, to name just three areas, often \ncreate difficulties for developing countries who seek to \nmake progress. \n The United Nations can help to change those \nrealities, and provide the framework for global \nresponses that match the ambition of the institution. \nBut at the core of that framework must be an enhanced \nunderstanding of the concept of accountability. \n As countries like mine fully embrace our need to \nbe accountable for the actions we take to support a \nglobal response to the MDGs, financial instability and \nclimate change, so too developed countries must \nrecognize their responsibilities and the need to take a \nholistic approach to their dealings with the rest of the \nworld. Aid flows are appreciated and valuable, but they \nsometimes pale into insignificance when those \ncountries that promote how their aid is helping the \nachievement of, for example, the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals are also pursuing unjust, narrow-\nminded trade or climate policies. \n I therefore call on the United Nations to establish \na set of global accountability indicators with which we \ncan transparently monitor whether the members of the \ninternational community are pursuing policies that, in a \nholistic sense, help them discharge their global \nresponsibilities, not just through the provision of aid \nbut also through the avoidance of unfair trade and \nclimate policies. Through the Millennium Development \nGoals, we have started to develop some of the \nindicators we need. As we enhance them further, I \nbelieve we will see that better accountability, properly \nunderstood, can help us rise to the challenges we face. \n I would like to highlight the centrality of the need \nto protect and preserve our environment. While each of \nthe issues I have mentioned is a global one requiring a \nglobal response, the environmental challenges we face \nmock those who think we still live in a world where \nglobal collective action is somehow a matter of choice. \n The destruction of a natural habitat anywhere in \nthe world removes life forms that could have been the \nbedrock of future medical advances for citizens \neverywhere. A ton of carbon emitted in Africa or Asia \nthreatens the citizens of the smallest village in North \nAmerica. When those who seek to represent their \ncitizens deny that that is true, or fail to understand its \nconsequences, they threaten their own national \ninterests and the wealth and security of their nation. \n Therefore, failure to appreciate the need for an \ninterconnected, global response to climate change and \nloss of biodiversity is not just an abdication of \nresponsibility to some intangible global good or to \npeople on the other side of the world. It is a very real, \nmeasurable threat to citizens in every village, hamlet \nand city in the world. History will not judge kindly \nthose who were too blinkered or ignorant to realize \nthat. So a step change in our efforts to avoid \ncatastrophic climate change and protect biodiversity is \nneeded. \n When we met here last year, many hoped that the \nUnited Nations would facilitate agreement on global \naction to stabilize our planet\u2019s climate at the meeting of \nmost of the world\u2019s leaders in Copenhagen in \nDecember. Not only did the global community fail to \naccomplish that, we are now in real danger of suffering \nfrom a catastrophic drift in ambition, where we no \n \n \n17 10-54965 \n \nlonger even try to connect the scientific evidence on \nclimate change with the necessary global action to \navert it. \n This drift in ambition must be stopped. It is a \nconsequence of choices we make; it is not \npredetermined. So we must rededicate ourselves to \ncrafting a shared response to shared climate threats. \nMost progressive countries now realize this, and are \ncommitted to temperature rises of a maximum of 2\u00b0 \ndegrees C or lower. They feel that this will require \nglobal economic growth powered by efficient and clean \nenergy, new green industries, and a new, less carbon-\nintensive approach to forestry and agriculture. \n But despite knowing this, the international \ncommunity continues to fail to put in place the \nmeasures that will enable the economic transformation \nthat we claim we want. This is in large part due to the \nabsence of a global agreement that puts a price on \nhigh-carbon activity and rewards low-carbon \ninnovation. We need this to change. To that end, \nGuyana continues to hold that the international \ncommunity needs a legally binding global climate \ntreaty that would first facilitate the emission cuts \nneeded to stabilize the planet\u2019s climate, and then \nenable us to move on from seeing climate change \npurely in terms of its costs, while also allowing us to \nsee how it can catalyse a once-in-a-lifetime global \neconomic transformation that can benefit people \neverywhere. This cannot happen without deep, binding \nemission cuts in today\u2019s developed world, which could \nstimulate the financial flows that can address \nmitigation and adaptation across the developing world. \n We recognize that such a global treaty may not be \nachievable this year, but we are not powerless to act \nnow. The international community can do three things \neven in the absence of a treaty, and we can achieve \nbreakthroughs in each when we meet in Canc\u00fan. \n First, we can hold the developed countries \naccountable for the commitments they have made to \nthe immediate short-term ramping-up of financing for \nclimate action in the developing world. The existing \ncommitments of a total of $30 billion by 2012 and \n$100 billion per year by 2020 can be agreed to in \nCanc\u00fan. Secondly, we can solve the vexed issue of an \neffective financial transfer mechanism to ensure that \nthe funds flow both to adaptation and mitigation \nactions. Thirdly, we should look at ramping up \nmeaningful sectoral responses that work in the short \nterm. Specifically, in Guyana we believe that action on \ndeforestation and forest degradation is one of the \nefforts that can be made quickly and with maximum \nimpact. I want to emphasize that none of this is about \nasking the developed world to provide us with aid. \nInstead, it is about ensuring that the capital for \naddressing climate change is allocated where it can \nhave the biggest impact. \n In addressing these matters, I want to raise a \nsensitive subject: the Copenhagen Accord, which was \nthe only tangible outcome of last year\u2019s climate \nSummit. I know that many countries here today \nassociated themselves with the Accord reluctantly, and \nthat some did not associate themselves with it at all. \nBut I believe that reluctant or no association with the \nCopenhagen Accord, and strong support for some of its \nprovisions, are not mutually exclusive. Even countries \nthat did not associate themselves with the Accord \nshould hold the developed world accountable for its \ncommitments. \n We have long said in Guyana that if the \ninternational community is prepared to be held \naccountable, we will not be found lacking. Three years \nago, we said that notwithstanding the immense climate \nchallenges in our country \u2014 in 2005 floods caused \ndamage equivalent to 60 per cent of our gross domestic \nproduct \u2014 we were prepared to do our bit. We have \ndetermined that, as a country more than 80 per cent of \nwhose territory is rainforest, we can make a \ndisproportionate contribution to solving climate \nchange. So we have looked at the contribution we can \nmake in two ways: first, by creating a financial \nmechanism whereby we can put our entire rainforest \nunder protection; and secondly, by using the resources \nwe receive for the climate services we provide from \nour protected forest to reorient our economy on a low-\ncarbon trajectory. \n As a consequence, after one of the most \ncomprehensive national consultations on climate \nchange anywhere in the world, we have started to \nimplement our low-carbon development strategy. We \nhave identified how we can cumulatively save forest-\nbased emissions of 1.5 gigatons by 2020. We have a \ndeal in place with Norway on reducing emissions from \ndeforestation and forest degradation, and because of \nthis we are in the process of creating a climate finance \nfund that will amount to between $300 million and \n$500 million between this year and 2015. We have also \nidentified how we can use this climate financing to \n  \n \n10-54965 18 \n \ninvest in education and health care; to catalyse private \nfinance to move virtually our entire economy to clean \nenergy; to open up non-forested land for new economic \nactivities; to invest in climate adaptation needs and to \nsupport our indigenous people in the economic and \nsocial transformation of their communities. We \ntherefore hope that we are demonstrating the value of \naction on the three interlinked financing commitments \nI spoke of, and I hope that we are starting to show how \ninterconnected global responses can deliver globally \nvaluable results. \n The United Nations is, despite its many \nlimitations, our best hope for the advancement of \nhumanity. Its universality allows the Organization to \nplay a central and catalytic role in balancing the \ndiffering interests of Member States and in generating \nconsensus on the issues that divide us. We must \ntherefore commit fully to the principles and purposes \nof its Charter and to the improvement of its structure. \nOn behalf of my country and people, I wish to assure \nthe Assembly of our full support for the Organization \nand for strengthening its capacity to better fulfil the \nmany mandates entrusted to it."

        "file_text": "At this sixty-fifth session of \nthe General Assembly, it is right that we re-examine \nthe role of the United Nations in global governance, as \nwe strive to help it adapt as fast as our times are \nchanging, so that it serves all its Members equally.  \n In my understanding, global governance \nrecognizes the inevitable and welcome \ninterconnectedness of nations, the unique \ncircumstances and contributions of each and the \nprinciple of mutual respect. I say \u201cwelcome\u201d because, \nas we have seen, major threats of a global scale \u2014 like \nthe financial crisis, climate change, terrorism, poverty \nand other challenges to world peace \u2014 need the \nconcerted efforts of all nations if they are to be \naddressed effectively. \n The just-concluded High-level Plenary Meeting \non the Millennium Development Goals has provided us \nanother opportunity to assess the role of the United \nNations, measure the progress we have made and \nconsider the hurdles that remain in meeting the various \nGoals we set for ourselves. It is evident that the United \nNations is uniquely placed to play a crucial role in \nmobilizing and galvanizing all nations for the common \ngood, driving forward our collective initiatives and \ncoordinating actions that foster the social and \neconomic development of all. \n Still, the United Nations is the sum total of \nMember States, and it can only be as good as the \nconstituent Members want it to be. If there were a \ncommon understanding and shared values among all \nMember States, the Organization would deliver more \nefficiently on its mandate. But it has become clear that \nthe United Nations has evolved into a two-tier \norganization, reflecting a world that seems to be \ndivided into two major categories: one considered to \nhave inherent, laudable values, rights and liberties, and \nanother that needs to be taught and coached on those \nvalues. \n My country and many in the developing world \nseem to fall into that second category. Not only \nmarginalized and disenfranchised, we are also \nconsidered chronic violators of our own human rights. \nThe implication is that the United Nations holds a \ncertain standard for some countries, and another for \nothers, especially on international issues concerning \nwhich every single Member should be treated equally \nunder the law.  \n In my view, a debate between those two \ncategories is urgently needed within the United Nations \nmembership so as to regain the noble founding ideals \nof the Organization. No entity is better placed than our \ncommon United Nations to bring equality and respect, \ndespite disparities in economic status. \n The same situation pertains in the realm of \ninternational justice and the rule of law. Rwanda \nsubscribes to the principle that everyone and every \nState is accountable to laws and that the rule of law \nshould govern us all. But these laws must truly be \nequally enforced and independently adjudicated. \n Reaffirming the role of the United Nations in \nglobal governance presupposes strengthening and \nreforming it to make it more effective and efficient in \nits response to global challenges. The impetus to \nreform our global governance structures, however, is \nthe desire to ensure that they are equipped to deal with \nthose challenges and secure a brighter future for all the \ncitizens of the world. \n When there are no avenues for appealing \ninternational rulings, when there is an accountability \ndeficit in key global institutions and when ordinary \ncitizens feel that the United Nations cannot deal \nadequately with the issues affecting their daily lives, \nthe United Nations cannot be seen as credible, relevant \nand democratic. We should make sure the Organization \ndoes not become a tool for the powerful to protect their \ninterests and enhance their influence or use it in \nsubjugating others. \n \n \n13 10-54965 \n \n Rwanda believes in multilateralism and \nunderstands that global challenges can be effectively \nresolved only through international cooperation. The \nUnited Nations must continue to be at the centre of that \nagenda and play its role without bias or prejudice. \n As we in Rwanda continue to rebuild our country, \nwe have become acutely aware of the need for lasting \npeace and security in our region and have worked hard \nto achieve it. We know that stability is the key \nprerequisite for our development and the improved \nlives of our citizens and our neighbours, and we have \nunreservedly committed ourselves to attaining it. We \nwill continue to work in partnership with our \nneighbours, international and regional organizations \nand the African Union to ensure that peace and security \nprevail and that Africa fully realizes its potential. \n Lastly, let me say that each of our countries, \nseparately and collectively, has a duty to the people of \nthe entire world, especially the most vulnerable."

        "file_text": "I extend my \nheartfelt congratulations to Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-fifth session. I also express my appreciation \n  \n \n10-54959 32 \n \nto His Excellency Ali Abdussalam Treki for his efforts \nas President at the previous session. I should also like \nto express my respect to His Excellency Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his leadership. \n Sixty-five years ago, in the aftermath of the \nSecond World War, Japan faced the same challenges as \nthose that today confront developing countries. Japan \nreceived a great deal of support from the international \ncommunity in its struggle to overcome those \nchallenges. It is for that reason that Japan feels \nstrongly about attainment of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), which is a main focus of \nthe General Assembly this year.  \n At this time, the international community faces a \nseries of challenges, including poverty, hunger, \ninfectious diseases, the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction and missiles, regional conflicts and \nglobal environmental issues. It is an honour for me to \nhave this opportunity to share with the General \nAssembly my thoughts regarding the role Japan should \nplay in the international community, building on our \nown experiences.  \n Let me start by sharing a philosophy that I \ncherish, namely, that the primary role of the leader of a \ncountry should be to create a society in which human \nsuffering is reduced to a minimum. I believe that it is \nthe duty of all political leaders to minimize, to the \nextent possible, sources of human suffering such as \npoverty, disease and conflict. With that philosophy in \nmind, I shall now discuss Japan\u2019s concrete \ncontributions in four areas: development, the global \nenvironment, nuclear disarmament and non-\nproliferation and peacekeeping and peacebuilding. \n The first area of our contribution is assisting the \ndevelopment of the developing countries. After the \nSecond World War, Japan achieved economic \nreconstruction owing in part to international assistance. \nLater, through rapid economic growth, Japan became \none of the major economic Powers. With such history \nbehind it, Japan cannot overlook the realities of the \nworld today, where a billion people suffer from hunger, \nwhere nearly a million die each year of malaria and \nwhere poverty keeps some 72 million children out of \nschool.  \n Japan attaches great importance to achieving the \nMDGs. I attended the MDG summit the day before \nyesterday (see ), where I announced our new \ncontributions in the areas of health and education \u2014 \nthe Kan commitment \u2014 based on our desire to save all \nfledging lives and to enable all children to go to \nschool. Over the course of five years, we will provide \n$5 billion in health assistance and $3.5 billion in \neducation assistance. Our commitment in the area of \nhealth includes a contribution of up to $800 million to \nthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \nMalaria. Our assistance in the area of education will \nprovide a high-quality educational environment for \nmore than 7 million children. \n Japan will continue to work comprehensively on \ndevelopment assistance in accordance with the concept \nof human security, and will lead the efforts of the \ninternational community towards meeting the MDGs. \nAs a part of those efforts, my country proposes to \nconvene an international conference in Japan next year \nin order to strengthen coordination among a broad \nrange of stakeholders, including Governments and \ninternational and non-governmental organizations, and \nto in follow up on the High-level Plenary Meeting on \nthe MDGs. \n Reinforcing assistance to Africa, in particular, \nwhere progress towards the achievement of the MDGs \nis slow, is one of the priorities of the international \ncommunity. Attaining the MDGs in Africa is an \nimportant pillar of the Tokyo International Conference \non African Development (TICAD) process. Japan is \nenhancing its efforts in areas such as health, water and \nsanitation, education and food. Japan will continue and \nstrengthen its assistance in order to honour our \ncommitments made at TICAD IV, including the \ndoubling of our official development assistance and \nproviding support in order to double private investment \nto Africa by 2012. \n The second area of our contribution is the global \nenvironment. At last year\u2019s United Nations Climate \nChange Conference, Japan announced its target of \nreducing emissions by 25 per cent compared with 1990 \nlevels by 2020. That is premised on the establishment \nof a fair and effective international framework in which \nall major economies participate, as well as on their \nagreement on ambitious targets.  \n Small island States face the danger of being \nsubmerged as a result of climate change. With a view \nto adopting a new, comprehensive and legally binding \ndocument, Japan will continue to coordinate with other \nStates and the United Nations to lead international \nnegotiations to ensure the success of the sixteenth \n \n \n33 10-54959 \n \nsession of the sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, to be held at the end of this year. We will also \nsteadily support developing countries that are \nvulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change, \nincluding those taking mitigation measures such as \nreducing emissions through public-private partnerships. \n Next month, the tenth meeting of the Conference \nof the Parties to the Convention on Biological \nDiversity will be convened in Nagoya, Japan, under the \ntheme \u201cLiving in harmony with nature\u201d. At that \nmeeting, we must come to an agreement on beginning \nnew actions in order to halt the rapid progression of \nbiodiversity loss. The greatest challenges in that regard \ninclude setting a common global action target and \nestablishing a new international regime in the area of \naccess and benefits-sharing in connection with genetic \nresources. As Chair of the meeting, Japan is \ndetermined to play an important role in these efforts. \n The third area of our contribution is nuclear \ndisarmament and non-proliferation. I believe that given \nthat the invention of nuclear weapons and the \nsubsequent threat to the survival of the human race was \nman\u2019s doing, the solution to the problem must be \nwithin the reach of man\u2019s efforts. Japan, as the only \ncountry that has ever suffered the devastation of atomic \nbombings, has a moral responsibility to take concrete \nsteps to achieve a world without nuclear weapons. \nJapan is determined to lead the international \ncommunity in those endeavours.  \n Every year for the past 65 years, peace memorial \nservices have been held in Hiroshima and Nagasaki to \npray for a world without nuclear weapons. Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon visited Japan in August this year \nand was the first Secretary-General to attend the \nHiroshima peace memorial ceremony and visit \nNagasaki. I would like to thank him once again for \nmaking that visit. A representative of the United States \nwas also in attendance at the Hiroshima ceremony, \nalong with representatives of other countries. I very \nmuch welcome their decision to attend, which will \ncontribute to increasing momentum towards a world \nwithout nuclear weapons. \n Japan bears a responsibility to all humankind to \npass on to future generations an awareness of the \ncatastrophic nature of nuclear weapons. With that goal \nin mind, I decided to appoint atomic bomb survivors \u2014 \nknown in Japan as hibakusha \u2014 as special \ncommunicators for a world without nuclear weapons. I \nhave asked them to send out messages to the world \nabout the horror of the use of nuclear weapons and \nabout the value of peace, which only those with first-\nhand experience can convey.  \n Japan will coordinate with other countries and \ncivil society to promote education on disarmament and \nnon-proliferation issues. At the sixty-fourth session, \nJapan submitted a draft resolution entitled \u201cRenewed \ndetermination towards the total elimination of nuclear \nweapons\u201d, which the General Assembly adopted in \nDecember as resolution 64/47, with the United States \nas a co-sponsor for the first time. Japan is determined \nto continue its efforts to strengthen the trend of \nbroadening support for that resolution in the \ninternational community.  \n The steady implementation of the agreement \nachieved at the Review Conference of the Parties to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \nheld in May, is essential. On the occasion of the \nopening of the new session of the General Assembly, \nJapan and Australia co-hosted a meeting of foreign \nministers from like-minded countries on the issue of \nnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. We also \nlaunched a new group dedicated to working towards a \nworld without nuclear weapons. We intend to deepen \ndiscussions on reducing the role and number of nuclear \nweapons in the world. \n Here, I must make reference to the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea and Iran. The nuclear and \nmissile-development programmes of the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea pose a threat to the entire \ninternational community. Japan urges the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea to take concrete actions in \naccordance with the series of relevant Security Council \nresolutions and the joint statement of the Six-Party \nTalks. Moreover, the steady implementation of the \nrelevant resolutions by all Member States is essential.  \n Japan has not altered its intention to \ncomprehensively resolve outstanding issues of concern, \nsettle the unfortunate past and normalize relations in \naccordance with the Japan-Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea Pyongyang Declaration. To that end, \nit is absolutely indispensable to resolve the abduction \nissue. If the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \ntakes constructive and sincere steps such as \nimplementing its agreement with Japan, Japan is ready \nto respond in kind. \n  \n \n10-54959 34 \n \n On the Iranian nuclear issue, it is important for \nthe international community to work in unity to \nimplement firmly the relevant Security Council \nresolutions and to urge Iran to take realistic decisions. \nJapan will continue to urge Iran to make efforts to \ndispel the suspicions of the international community. \nWe will also work together with the international \ncommunity for a peaceful and diplomatic resolution of \nthis issue. \n The fourth area of our contribution is \npeacekeeping and peacebuilding. Japan, which \nunderwent reconstruction from the destruction of war \nand achieved economic growth, is deeply aware of the \nimportance and value of peace. Our efforts in the area \nof peacekeeping and peacebuilding are a manifestation \nof our determination to act proactively towards \nachieving true peace. \n There is a common assumption that \npeacebuilding activities aimed at promoting health and \neducation, industrial development and employment \nshould begin after peacekeeping is concluded. \nHowever, in order to realize true peace, it is imperative \nto work on peacebuilding efforts in tandem with \npeacekeeping activities from the earliest stages of the \nlatter. In April this year, as President of the Security \nCouncil, Japan hosted an open debate of the Council on \npost-conflict peacebuilding (see S/PV.6299). Japan will \nmake efforts to advance this seamless approach to \npeacebuilding in the world, based on the perspective of \nhuman security. \n In Haiti, which was devastated by unprecedented \ndamage following the tragic earthquake earlier this \nyear, a team of engineers from the Japan Self-Defence \nForces is actively contributing to the United Nations \npeacekeeping operation\u2019s recovery efforts. In flood-hit \nPakistan, we currently have helicopters of the Self-\nDefence Forces providing assistance as an international \ndisaster relief team. With regard to Timor-Leste, we \nrecently took the decision to send military liaison \nofficers to the United Nations peacekeeping operation \non the ground. Japan will continue to actively \nparticipate in United Nations peacekeeping and \ndisaster relief operations. \n Furthermore, we will make concrete efforts in \nsuch areas as investing in peace using official \ndevelopment assistance, providing assistance to \ntraining centres for peacekeeping operations and \ndeveloping human resources, such as in the training of \ncivilian peacebuilding experts in Asia. \n Of all the places in the world where \npeacebuilding efforts are under way, Afghanistan in \nparticular is at a crucial stage. At this moment, it is \nAfghanistan that poses the greatest challenge for the \ninternational community in terms of peacebuilding, and \nit is to Afghanistan that Japan is providing its most \nintensive assistance. Japan, in cooperation with various \npartners, has supported the Afghan Government\u2019s \nefforts in a comprehensive and integrated manner, \nfocusing on three pillars: the improvement of security, \nincluding police training; reintegration through \nvocational training for former Taliban rank-and-file \nsoldiers; and job creation and sustainable and self-\nreliant development through agricultural assistance and \nsimilar strategies. \n Japan will cooperate with the Republic of Turkey \nin assisting in Afghan police training by providing \nfunding as well as police personnel, with a view to \nimproving security in Afghanistan. We also recently \ndisbursed $50 million in assistance for the \nreintegration of insurgents. Japan will provide its \nassistance in such a way that the people of Afghanistan \nwill be able to perceive a tangible improvement in their \nlivelihoods. I wish to stress the importance of United Nations \nreform. The United Nations is the only universal \ninternational organization with the goal of promoting \nworld peace and prosperity. Ensuring a functional \nUnited Nations that is capable of effectively addressing \ndiverse global issues is of the utmost importance. To \nthat end, all Member States must work proactively to \npromote structural reform and functional reinforcement \nof the United Nations. The United Nations, for its part, \nmust continuously maintain the understanding and trust \nof Member States by ensuring its own transparency and \naccountability.  \n The role of the Security Council is particularly \nimportant for the United Nations to perform effectively \nin resolving global challenges. For the Security \nCouncil to be effective, it needs to have legitimacy and \nreflect the current realities of the international \ncommunity. In that regard, reform of the Security \nCouncil is indispensable.  \n \n \n35 10-54959 \n \n I believe that Japan, as the only country that has \never suffered the devastation of atomic bombings and \nas a country that does not possess nuclear weapons, is \nwell suited to play a role in the Security Council in the \ntwenty-first century. I wish to express once again \nJapan\u2019s determined aspiration to take on further \nresponsibilities for international peace and security as a \npermanent member of the Security Council. \n Japan is confronted today by various social and \neconomic challenges, including an ageing society, a \ndeclining birth rate, fiscal problems and energy \ndependency on other countries. I regard those \nchallenges as global, as many countries are destined to \nface them sooner or later. It is my belief that Japan will \nbe able to contribute to the world by providing an \ninnovative model, developed through its own national \nexperience, for solving problems facing the world now \nand in the future. Japan is determined to tackle those \nchallenges aggressively.  \n Compared with the magnitude of the \nresponsibility we bear to the future of humankind, the \ndifferences that divide nations are not great. I am \nconvinced of that. Everything rests on the decisions \nand actions we take today. Let each one of us take that \nthought to heart as we begin the new session of the \nGeneral Assembly and seek to achieve good results in \nour deliberations."

        "file_text": "The mission of the United \nNations is to protect the dignity, security and well-\nbeing of all human beings. Therefor, peace, security, \nstability and general welfare constitute the tenets of \nTurkey\u2019s work and action in the United Nations. Since \nthis Assembly gave us an overwhelming mandate for \nTurkey\u2019s non\u2013permanent seat on the Security Council, \nwe have worked hard, sincerely, objectively and \neffectively to contribute to peace, security and the \nwelfare of the international community. \n In these two years, we have tried to offer added \nvalue, in a fair and principled manner, in addressing \nvarious global and regional issues. We have sought to \nadvance the discussions within the Council on an issue \nto which we have always accorded high priority: \npeacekeeping and peacebuilding. Indeed, this \nafternoon, we will be holding a Security Council \nsummit to exchange views and ideas on this matter at \nthe highest political level. Furthermore, next Monday, \nwe will hold a thematic debate of the Security Council \non counter-terrorism. \n Terrorism is indeed a leading and most pressing \nchallenge for the international community on the \nglobal scale. It cannot be countered without sincere, \neffective, cohesive and concrete international \ncooperation. I would like to recall that our struggle \nagainst terrorism is bound to fail unless we fight all \nterrorist organizations, irrespective of their supposed \npolitical, ideological, ethnic or religious aims. \n The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nis one of the risks of our contemporary world. We \ncannot overcome that menace unless all Member \nStates, including nuclear States, adopt a just and \nprincipled approach to their respective policies. \nEstablishing a credible global non-proliferation regime \nwill not be possible if we ignore the de facto existence \nof nuclear weapons in certain countries at the heart of \nsome of the world\u2019s most delicate regions. \n In this context, I would like to call on all Member \nStates to intensify their efforts to create a zone free of \nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, as was \nenvisaged in Security Council resolution 687 (1991), \nand as has been repeatedly called for by the General \nAssembly. We also support the calls made in May at \nthe Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons for \nconvening a conference on a zone free of weapons of \nmass destruction in the Middle East in 2012. I believe \nthat such an initial step would be a sine qua non for all \nnon-proliferation initiatives in the rest of the world. \n In responding to those security challenges, we \nshould keep in mind that global problems cannot be \nsolved unilaterally, bilaterally or within a small circle \nof like-minded nations. Therefore, it is more important \n \n \n25 10-54827 \n \ntoday than ever for us to adopt a multilateral approach \nto global problems.  \n One such problem is the current global economic \ncrisis. Though we are in a slow recovery, the impact of \nthe crisis is still being felt today. We must draw the \nproper lessons from it in order to avoid a recurrence of \nsimilar shocks in the future. That crisis was caused by \nthe irresponsible acts of some financial institutions in \nthe most developed markets. Ordinary people have \npaid the highest price for the mistakes of a few in \ndeveloped nations. The current economic crisis \nrevealed once again the weakness and deficiencies of \nthe existing global and national financial and economic \narchitectures, which lack effective governance and \nregulations to oversee reckless financial institutions. \n The Turkish economy, however, has managed to \nstay on course in spite of the world economic crisis, \nthanks to previously undertaken comprehensive \neconomic and financial measures. Within the Group of \n20 (G-20), we strongly support the efforts of \ninternational forums aimed at restoring global growth \nand streamlining financial practices. We believe that \nthe G-20 should continue to play a central role in \nputting together the right policies and measures to \nthose ends. \n The situation of the least developed countries has \nworsened in the aftermath of the global crisis. Every \neffort should therefore be made to integrate those \ncountries into the global economy. In that endeavour, \nwe should act according to the principles of free and \nfair trade and avoid protectionist tendencies. It is with \nthese thoughts that we look forward to the Fourth \nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed \nCountries, to be organized next year in Istanbul. \n During the past decade, Turkey\u2019s economic \nindicators improved, as did its development assistance. \nOur relatively greater means have enabled us to \ncontribute more to the development of others. Turkey \nhas now evolved into an emerging donor. With the \ncontribution of Turkish-based non-governmental \norganizations, our overall development assistance \nexceeds $1.5 billion annually. Through the Turkish \nInternational Cooperation and Development Agency, \nwe allocate that amount to diverse capacity-building \nprojects, in fields such as health, education, agriculture \nand infrastructure. \n Developing nations are also more exposed than \nothers to the gravest threats of four interconnected \nproblems: global warming, climate change, epidemics \nand food security. In recent years, tragedy has struck \nmany nations because of the adverse impact of climate \nchange around the world. Some parts of our planet are \nexperiencing severe drought, while others have been \nhit by devastating floods. The current plight of \nPakistan is a reminder that this has become a pressing \nissue that calls for urgent remedial action. We must \nacknowledge that a sustainable environment is an \nindivisible global public good for humankind. We must \ntherefore assume collective responsibility for \npreserving it. Billions of lives, not just today but also \nof future generations, will depend on the actions we \ntake now. \n The global food crisis is another urgent concern. \nIt poses a worrying challenge to coming generations. \nThese compelling economic, demographic, ecological \nand biological challenges oblige us to redefine the \nnotion of security. Such issues no longer fall into the \ncategory of soft risks, but rather pose a clear and \npresent threat to humankind.  \n In the face of such overwhelming threats, it is \ntime to take global action within the United Nations \nframework. To that end, I call on Member States to \nexplore the possibility of establishing a global rapid-\nreaction capability to effectively tackle natural and \necological disasters, food shortages and epidemics. \nThis would also help to maintain international peace \nand security by mitigating threats that arise from weak \ngovernance, the collapse of public order and domestic \nor inter-State conflict over diminishing natural \nresources. \n If we allocate a small fraction of our defence \nexpenditures to financing and establishing a \npeacekeeping capability, we will have more cost-\nefficient results in maintaining peace and stability in \nthe world. Moreover, if we could pool some of our \ndefence equipment \u2014 equipment that has lost its \neffective utility in military terms but is still relevant for \ndisaster-relief operations \u2014 we could swiftly improve \nsuch rapid-reaction capability. Of course, existing \nregional capacities could be instrumental in this global \nendeavour. All such resources should be channeled \ndirectly to those in need, and not eroded by excessive \nadministrative costs. \n On the political side of our agenda, there is no \nshortage of enduring regional issues. Because of time \n  \n \n10-54827 26 \n \nconstraints, I will touch only briefly on some of them \nhere.  \n Permanent peace in the Middle East is the key to \na peaceful and stable future for the world. \nUnfortunately, the absence of peace there has had \nserious and adverse strategic consequences for the rest \nof the world. Turkey has therefore always supported \nevery effort aimed at reaching a comprehensive peace \nin the Middle East. In this understanding, we \nappreciate President Obama\u2019s efforts and welcome the \ndirect negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. \nWe hope that this new engagement can take us closer \nto a viable and fair settlement. \n On the other hand, it will be very difficult to \nmake progress towards permanent peace unless we put \nan end to the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza. In this \ncontext, the attack in May of the Israeli armed forces \non the international humanitarian aid convoy on the \nhigh seas resulted in grave civilian casualties and was \nan unacceptable act, in clear violation of international \nlaw. In the light of international law, Turkey expects a \nformal apology and compensation for the aggrieved \nfamilies of the victims and the injured people. \n Therefore, we attach particular importance to the \nwork of the panel of inquiry and the fact-finding \nmission. We are pleased to have received the report \n(A/HRC/15/21) of the fact-finding mission established \nby the United Nations Human Rights Council. The \nreport offers a solid legal framework for establishing \nthe facts of the incident. We also look forward to the \nsuccessful completion of the work of the panel. \n As for Iraq, the elections of 7 March marked a \nnew period for the people of that country. \nNevertheless, the post-election political stalemate is \naggravating the security situation and hindering the \nlaunch of a comprehensive reconstruction programme. \nWe sincerely hope that the new Government in Iraq \nwill reflect the balance that emerged at the elections. \nThe new Government must be inclusive, effective and \ndemocratic. In the aftermath of the withdrawal of \nforeign combat troops, we also urge all neighbours of \nIraq to act responsibly and support the territorial \nintegrity, political unity and sovereignty of Iraq. We \nmust all help the Iraqi people in their quest for a better \nfuture. \n Our contributions to international efforts in the \nsearch for an urgent and peaceful settlement of the \nIranian nuclear issue will also continue. This \ncontroversy can be resolved only in conformity with \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency norms and \nobligation under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons, and in respect for the right to the \npeaceful use of nuclear energy. In this vein, the Tehran \nDeclaration and the July gathering in Istanbul provide \na window of opportunity to be seized. We believe that \nthere is no alternative to diplomacy. \n As a Balkan country, Turkey attaches cardinal \npriority to the peace, stability and economic \ndevelopment of the Balkans. In recent years, we have \nactively engaged in result-oriented initiatives in the \nBalkans by intensifying our high-level bilateral visits \nto Belgrade and Sarajevo. Moreover, the launching of \ntrilateral cooperation mechanisms with Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and Serbia, on the one hand, and with \nBosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, on the other, was \nof historic significance. Through these mechanisms, we \nare trying to create a new atmosphere of mutual \nunderstanding and cooperation among those nations. I \nbelieve that the integration of the western Balkan \ncountries into the European and Euro-Atlantic \nstructures would be a decisive final step for the \nresolution of conflicts in the region.  \n As for the Caucasus, we remain committed to \npursuing our efforts in search of a comprehensive and \nsustainable peace in the region, while respecting the \nprinciple of territorial integrity. In recent years, we \nhave all seen how frozen conflict can easily turn into \nactive clashes in the region. Given this context, we \nattach particular importance to the peaceful resolution \nto the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. \n Any failure in Afghanistan will certainly have \nunpredictable consequences for the international \ncommunity. Therefore, Afghanistan deserves our close \nattention and sincere commitment. Afghanistan is \ngoing through a historic process of transformation. As \nmilitary operations continue, there must be a \nsimultaneous and growing emphasis on civilian efforts \nto win the hearts and minds of the Afghan people. \nTurkey\u2019s commitment to Afghanistan is open-ended. \nWe will continue our assistance as long as the Afghans \nrequire it.  \n Supporting Pakistan\u2019s democracy is also of \nsingular importance, not only in and of itself, but also \nto the stability of the region as a whole. In the wake of \nthe terrible disaster caused by the floods, it is critically \n \n \n27 10-54827 \n \nimportant to support the people and the democratic \nGovernment of Pakistan in healing their wounds. \n Africa is another region that requires the \ninternational community\u2019s collective responsibility and \naction. The burden of resolving the overwhelming \nproblems of that continent cannot be placed on the \nshoulders of Africans alone. It is in this understanding \nthat Turkey has devised a comprehensive policy that \nincludes effective political, social and economic \nmeasures to help address the challenges that Africa \nfaces. \n On the Cyprus issue, our long-standing \ncommitment and full support of a just and lasting \nsettlement remains unchanged. We share the vision of \nthe Secretary-General that a settlement will be within \nreach before the end of this year, but this process \nshould not be open-ended. A positive outcome \nemerging from these negotiations would rapidly \ntransform the eastern Mediterranean into a pillar of \npeace, stability, cooperation and welfare in the \nEuropean Union. \n The Turkish Cypriots have shown that they are in \nfavour of a settlement, as clearly manifested in the \n2004 referendum, but they continue to suffer unjustly \nfrom the absence of a settlement. I would like to repeat \nthe call made by the Secretary-General to the \ninternational community to take the necessary steps to \neliminate the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots and \nenable their integration into the greater world.  \n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate our view that the \nUnited Nations can and should play an even larger role \nin chartering a better future for humankind. It is up to \nus, the Member States, to provide the United Nations \nwith the necessary political support and concrete tools \nso that it can fulfil that role. I assure the Assembly that \nTurkey, for its part, will continue to lend its full \nsupport and cooperation to the United Nations in our \nquest to leave a much safer, more prosperous, cleaner \nand healthier world to our children."

        "file_text": "Allow \nme to congratulate Mr. Deiss on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \nsession. He has taken on that formidable task at a \ncrucial period for our United Nations. I assure him of \nMicronesia\u2019s full support. I would also like to pay \ntribute to his esteemed predecessor for his \ndistinguished leadership. \n Sadly, I wish to begin my statement by \nexpressing the sincere sympathy of the people and \nGovernment of the Federated States of Micronesia for \nthe many victims of recent natural disasters \neverywhere. Having been victims of natural disasters \nourselves, our hearts go out to the victims of the recent \nhurricanes, earthquakes, mudslides and floods that are \nnow occurring on an unprecedented scale and with \nincreasing frequency and devastating intensity all over \nour planet. Overwhelming evidence points to one \ncommon denominator in all those events, and that is \nglobal climate change. \n I am deeply honoured to address the General \nAssembly, at its sixty-fifth session, for the first time on \nbehalf of the Federated States of Micronesia. This \nAssembly accords Micronesia and the small island \ndeveloping States an extraordinary privilege to bring to \nthe whole world the most pressing issues affecting us \nthat demand our collective response. \n Despite the many years of negotiations to curb its \ndevastating effects, the climate change crisis continues \nto haunt us. The negotiating process has moved along \nvery slowly, while in stark contrast the rapid increases \nin the incidence and severity of environmental hazards \ncontinue to take their toll, with devastating results. I \ncannot help but think of the needless human suffering \neverywhere, and what the future holds for my country \nand the small island developing States if business \ncontinues as usual. \n As a small island developing State, Micronesia\u2019s \nfuture is intrinsically linked to the global climate. That \nis why we are gravely concerned by the acute \nenvironmental problems related to the extreme \nvulnerability of our islands to sea-level rise and \nclimate change. Those threats are indisputable, and \ndelays in adopting a comprehensive and legally \nbinding agreement to avert this global disaster are \nwithout excuse. \n In Micronesia, we are deeply disappointed at the \nglacial progress in the negotiating sessions and climate \nchange meetings of the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change. At the same time, we \nare growing increasingly alarmed by the prospect of \nshrinking ambitions for the meeting in Canc\u00fan, \nMexico, later this year. That is not an acceptable \nresponse to a crisis of enormous proportions, certainly \nnot for Micronesia and not for any of the small island \ndeveloping States, who need fast action. This is an \nissue of survival for us. \n We must find a better response \u2014 a genuine \nresponse that supports mitigation and adaptation \nmeasures that will achieve significant reductions in \n  \n \n10-55109 12 \n \ngreenhouse gas emissions and thus preserve the \nintegrity of our Earth\u2019s environment and also the \nlivelihoods of its inhabitants. My island nation and the \nsmall island developing States, for that matter, are not \nmajor contributors to the causes of climate change. All \npresent know that. But we are nevertheless determined \nin our efforts to contribute to finding solutions. \n For its part, Micronesia continues to take the lead \nto combat climate change by utilizing the opportunities \nunder the Montreal Protocol on Substances that \nDeplete the Ozone Layer. Through the Montreal \nProtocol we can solve a big part of the climate change \nproblem. That is why Micronesia has developed a \nproposal with the support of Mauritius, the Marshall \nIslands, Seychelles and the Philippines that calls for \nthe phasing down of the production and use of \nhydrofluorocarbons. Under our proposal we will be \nable to eliminate one of the greenhouse gases listed \nunder the Kyoto Protocol, and we are encouraged that \nother countries, such as Canada, the United States and \nMexico, already have come forward with similar \nproposals. \n Frankly, we have been delighted by the interest \nshown in our proposal so far, and I commend it to the \nAssembly\u2019s attention. Today, I encourage all \ndelegations to consider supporting it. Our collective \naction is imperative if we are to effectively curb and \nreverse global warming. That is the kind of \ncollaboration that I encourage here. \n Just as we are delighted by our Montreal Protocol \nproposal, we are equally proud of an initiative within \nour Pacific region, launched in August by the \nGovernments of the Republics of the Marshall Islands \nand Palau and my own Government at the margins of \nthe forty-first Pacific Islands Forum meeting in \nVanuatu. This is the Green Energy Micronesia \nInitiative, which calls for a 20 per cent improvement in \nenergy efficiency by suppliers in areas such as \ntransportation and electric power generation, a 30 per \ncent improvement in energy use by end users and a \n20 per cent electricity generation through renewable \nenergy by 2020. As island countries with a total \ndependence on fossil fuels for our energy generation, it \nis no longer economically, financially and \nenvironmentally sustainable to continue down that \npath. We must look towards developing, utilizing and \nembracing our renewable sources of energy. \n Our prospect for success will remain grim with \nour limited capacity and available financial resources. \nWe encourage and call upon our development partners \nand the international community to support our efforts, \nincluding through increased financial support, transfer \nof technology and capacity-building. \n In our seemingly idyllic settings as island \nnations, it may seem to many around the world that we \nlive an easy life and demand action only from others. \nHowever, the reality is that our island nations are \nactively playing our part in maintaining, and promoting \nthe protection of, our Planet Earth. We accept our \nresponsibility for conserving the biodiversity of our \nislands and waters and for using resources in a \nsustainable manner. \n That is why Micronesia and our Micronesian \nsister nations the Republics of the Marshall Islands and \nof Palau, as well as the Territory of Guam and the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, \ncontinue to promote the Micronesia Challenge to \nconserve at least 30 per cent of the near-shore marine \nresources and 20 per cent of terrestrial resources across \nour Micronesian region by 2020. \n Given our individual limitations, we can confront \nthese challenges only through regional collective \nactions. I want to express our utmost gratitude to those \ncountries and international organizations that continue \nto support the Micronesia Challenge and help us \nachieve our goals. Being small island countries with \nlimited resources, we see realistic success in \ncollaborative partnership with the international \ncommunity. \n Micronesia will continue to address the \nprotection of the ocean and its resources. As a Pacific \nisland country with one of the largest exclusive \neconomic zones in the Western and Central Pacific \nOcean, we ascribe particular importance to the ocean \nand its resources. The ocean has a fundamental and \ncritical bearing on our food security and economic \nfuture. However, human activities on the planet are \nsignificantly affecting our ocean and can bring about \ndisastrous consequences for our food security and \nsustainable development. \n Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in our \nzone remains of great concern, as that abhorrent \npractice continues with its sophistication and \nmultinational criminal operations. We do maintain high \nexpectations that through the support of the \n \n \n13 10-55109 \n \ninternational community we can combat that illegal \nactivity, which threatens the sustainability of our fish \nstocks and deprives our people of potential economic \nbenefits. \n To reverse already discernable trends towards the \ndisappearance of key tuna species that were once \nthought inexhaustible, early this year the leaders of the \nPacific countries that are parties to the Nauru \nAgreement signed the Koror Declaration, agreeing to \nintroduce further conservation measures to protect key \ntuna stocks. One of the measures agreed to is to close \noff additional high-seas areas to purse seine fishing by \nvessels licensed to fish our Nauru Agreement waters. \n Micronesia is fully committed and will work with \nits fellow parties to the Nauru Agreement and the wider \ninternational community to ensure the sustainability of \nour tuna resources. We will hold violators accountable \nthrough internationally agreed mechanisms to prevent, \ndeter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated \nfishing in our waters and the Western and Central \nPacific Ocean region. \n Our oceans and our exclusive economic zones are \ngetting a great deal of international attention because \nof the potential for economic exploitation. We assign \nthe highest priority to greater economic participation in \nall aspects of that exploitation. Increased economic \nparticipation is a major goal for all countries in the \nPacific having considerable marine resources \u2014 not \njust Micronesia. \n However, our participation in the exploitation of \nour own marine resources for economic development is \nheld back by a lack of experience and because much of \nour basic infrastructure still needs to be supported and \ndeveloped. On the overall scoreboard, the Pacific small \nisland developing States have not claimed their rightful \nshare of their own fisheries resources. International \nsupport has to be given to help us build our capacities \nnot only in negotiating agreements and developing our \nfisheries industries but in realizing a greater share of \nthe benefits from the catch of fish stocks from our own \nexclusive economic zone. \n In this review year for both the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and the Mauritius Strategy for \nSmall Island Developing States, we must take full \nadvantage of both occasions and rise to the challenge \nto meet our world\u2019s new and emerging needs. \n One of the major preoccupations of the General \nAssembly over the last 15 years has been the reform of \nthe United Nations. I do not need to belabour the issue, \nas all present are aware of Micronesia\u2019s long-standing \nposition, especially in regard to the reform of the \nSecurity Council. For permanent membership, we \nreiterate our support for Japan and India from our Asia \nand Pacific region. From other regions, Germany and \nBrazil also deserve equal consideration. We call for \naccelerated efforts to bring the negotiations to a \nsuccessful conclusion. \n Peace in the Middle East remains elusive, but we \nhave high hopes that the resumption of direct talks \nrecently in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere between \nthe Israelis and the Palestinians will pave the way to a \nlasting peace and a final settlement with a two-State \nsolution. The whole world has a stake in the Middle \nEast peace process. Micronesia fully supports the peace \nprocess and urges all members of this Assembly to play \na constructive role and work towards an outcome that \nbrings permanent peace and security to the Middle \nEast. I want to express my profound gratitude to the \nUnited States, Egypt, Jordan and the Quartet for their \ncritical roles and leadership in finding a solution to this \nformidable challenge. For it to be met, we must \nrespond with our collective action and support. \n I have been most privileged to have this \nopportunity to address the Assembly on behalf of my \nsmall island country. As I close my statement, I want to \nreassure this Assembly that Micronesia will continue to \ndo its part as a responsible Member of this \nOrganization."

        "file_text": "Last September, I had the \nprivilege of addressing this Assembly for the first time \nas Palau\u2019s Head of State (see A/64/PV.7). It is an \nhonour for me to do so once again this year. \n Palau\u2019s national story is one of achievement and \nsuccess. Palau was the last country to emerge from \nUnited Nations trusteeship. The Constitution of our \nnew country incorporated the rights and freedoms \nenshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights and is a testament to the efficacy of the United \nNations. The United Nations also helped us form a \nstrong partnership with the United States of America, \nour former Administering Authority. This partnership \nwas renewed on 3 September when the United States \nand Palau entered into a new agreement that will assist \nPalau in its efforts to achieve economic self-\nsufficiency, and for this we express our profound \ngratitude to the United States of America. \n Palau is also proud of our role in the international \ncommunity, joining international conventions and \nmeeting our international obligations. Our officers are \nhelping to maintain peace in fragile States. We have \ndeployed peacekeepers to Darfur, Timor-Leste and \nSolomon Islands. \n For Palau, environmental sustainability is not a \nrecent construct. Respect for the environment and its \npreservation is Palau\u2019s most deeply ingrained tradition \nand is at the heart of our culture. Palauans have always \nknown that caring for the long-term health of the \nenvironment is the foundation of our progress and \nsurvival. \n With our traditions as our bedrock, I am pleased \nto say that Palau has virtually achieved our Millennium \nDevelopment Goal (MDG) targets, according to the \nUnited Nations-sanctioned report. Palau has succeeded \nin achieving universal literacy, gender equality, \nmaternal health and access to education. We have \neliminated poverty and hunger and reduced child \nmortality to a degree comparable to even the most \nadvanced developed countries. We thank, among \nothers, our closest friends and allies: first the United \nStates, then Japan and the Republic of China on Taiwan \nfor helping us reach this point.  \n We consider the MDGs to be a minimum, and we \nwill continue to strive for higher goals, including the \ngoal of combating the ever-increasing spread of non-\ncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer, heart \ndisease and obesity, which the Pacific Islands Health \nOfficers Association has declared a regional epidemic \nin the Pacific. \n We are a small country, but blessed in many \nways. I reiterate that we have risen to achieve the \nMDGs by caring for our God-given resources. We have \nput in place a system domestically to conserve and \npreserve our terrestrial and marine biodiversity. We \nhave also joined with our Pacific neighbours to address \nthe health of our oceans together through the Pacific \nOceanscape programme. \n \n \n19 10-54959 \n \n Palau, and indeed the entire world, is connected \nby a web of life that is in peril. For too long, we have \nfocused our attention primarily on commercial \ninterests. We have abused nature and must change our \nthinking. We must reorient our priorities to put \nbiodiversity and the welfare of our ecosystems first. In \nso doing, we can serve both our long-term commercial \ninterests and protect the natural bounty that sustains us. \n One issue that symbolizes the threat to our \nbiodiversity succinctly is the fight to conserve our \noceans. Last year, I declared the world\u2019s first shark \nsanctuary from this podium. It was a good first step. I \nalso advocated for an end to unsustainable, cruel and \nwasteful shark finning on the high seas at the resumed \nReview Conference on the United Nations Fish Stocks \nAgreement. We cannot accept the loss of 73 million \nsharks a year for a pot of soup. \n Palau is doing all it can, but this work cannot stop \nat the boundary of any one country. We are all \nconnected. This is why I am proud that President Lobo \nSosa of Honduras and I signed this week a joint \ndeclaration calling on all other nations to stop \nunsustainable shark fishing. \n Moreover, according to scientific studies, such as \nthat entitled \u201cPatterns and ecosystem consequences of \nshark declines in the ocean\u201d, the health of sharks is \nlinked directly to the health of tuna. Palau and other \ncountries rely on tuna as their principal fisheries \nresource, and the world community relies on it as an \nimportant food source. We must work together to \nensure the continued viability of this important stock. \nThis past year, I hosted a summit of the parties to the \nNauru Agreement to take steps to ensure that tuna \nremains plentiful. Along with other leaders of countries \nparties to the Naura Agreement, we limited purse seine \nfishing, agreed to close the doughnut holes between \nour jurisdictions, and implemented a vessel day \nscheme. These are steps which we believe are vital to \nensuring the continued viability of our stocks. \n When Palau and other Pacific small island \ndeveloping States (SIDs) joined together at the sixty-\nthird session of the General Assembly to initiate \nresolution 63/281, \u201cClimate change and its possible \nsecurity implications\u201d, we did so recognizing that not \nonly is climate change a development issue, but has \nnow risen to the level of a security issue. The \nsuccessful adoption of resolution 63/281 by consensus \nwas a landmark occasion for Pacific SIDs and a step \nforward for the international community. The \naccelerating conflict and dislocation caused by climate \nevents warrant an urgent response from the Security \nCouncil. We repeat our call for Security Council action \non this resolution. \n After personally visiting the Pacific islands \nearlier this year, His Highness Sheikh Abdullah Bin \nZayed Al Nahyan, Foreign Minister of the United Arab \nEmirates, convened an historic summit between the \nArab League and the Pacific SIDs. The summit was a \nsuccess. Our two regions, which had never before \nengaged bilaterally, found a new understanding of \nshared goals, culture and traditions. Palau is grateful to \nthe League of Arab States for being the first regional \ngroup to recognize the potential of the Pacific SIDs as \na strong, viable and cohesive unit. \n We are hopeful that this is the year when we will \nmake substantive progress on Security Council reform. \nOur position on the issue has been stated clearly and \ncontinually in the negotiation room. If we as an \norganization are to maintain our relevance, we must \nreform the Council so that its membership reflects the \never-evolving membership of the General Assembly. \nPalau strongly supports expanding Security Council \nmembership, particularly by adding Japan as a \npermanent member. \n On the issue of security, Palau is hopeful that the \nreturn of Israelis and Palestinians this month to the \nnegotiating table will bear fruit. The crucible of the \nworld\u2019s Abrahamic faiths should not be the land of so \nmuch turmoil. The resolution of this intractable \nproblem is of the utmost importance so that the region \nand its reality may reflect its historic message of peace \non Earth. Palau can only add its voice to the chorus of \nsupport for a just, comprehensive and regional solution \nin accordance with the Road Map, the Arab Peace \nInitiative and the relevant Security Council resolutions. \nWe welcome the opportunity to actively support the \nprocess in the General Assembly this fall. Indeed, \nworld peace hinges on peace in the Middle East. \n Palau also supports the efforts of the international \ncommunity on disarmament and the prevention of the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons. Palau\u2019s was the \nworld\u2019s first nuclear-free Constitution, and so the \nelimination of nuclear weapons is of special concern to \nus. Having experienced the horror and devastation of \nwar, we and our neighbours long for the day when the \nentire world is free of nuclear weapons. We therefore \n  \n \n10-54959 20 \n \nwelcome all efforts to add the Middle East to the list of \nnuclear-weapon-free zones. \n The SARS pandemic shone a bright light on the \ngaps in our collective ability to prevent the spread of \ndiseases internationally. With the participation of \nTaiwan, we can now help to fill those gaps. We \ncongratulate the world community on making itself \nhealthier by granting Taiwan observer status at the \nWorld Health Assembly. Given the importance of a \nuniversal approach to global problems, Palau advocates \nfor Taiwan\u2019s inclusion in the activities of the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization and the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange. The world needs its input to ensure civil \naviation safety and security, and to effectively tackle \nclimate change for the benefit of all. \n When I began my address, I related the success \nstory that was Palau\u2019s emergence from trusteeship. As I \nwind down my remarks, I will speak candidly about \nour challenges. Today, Palau still feels the pain from \nthe wounds inflicted during our colonial days. Damage \nwas done to our islands. One, for example, was \nstripped of much of its resources, making it difficult \nfor those who live there to sustain the livelihood they \nonce enjoyed. This happened to our once phosphate-\nrich island of Angaur. We call on the international \ncommunity for appropriate relief for this historic and \nlasting injury \u2014 a relief that will heal the gaping \nwounds on our island, ease our pain and bring justice \nto our people. \n In addition, as a result of the fierce battles fought \nover our islands during the Second World War, \nexplosives were rained down on our land. Some of \nthose explosives still lie there, live, and pose an \nextreme danger to the lives and limbs of our people. \nWe appeal to the conscience of the world, especially \nthose responsible, to remove this danger from our \nmidst. \n As a developing nation, Palau is thankful for the \ngrants provided to us by our allies, friends and \npartners. They have been invaluable. But our \ndeveloping economy faces a crisis that grants alone \ncannot address. Without a strong local economy based \non private enterprise and the free market, our young \npeople will continue to leave our shores to pursue \nbetter employment abroad. We need more than just \nhumanitarian grants; we need private investment to \nspur and sustain our economic development. I therefore \ninvite investors and entrepreneurs from all over the \nworld to come to Palau to invest and establish \npartnerships with our talented people, so that we can \ncreate a vibrant economy for now and for our future."

        "file_text": "I am happy to congratulate you, Sir, on your \nelection to preside over the General Assembly during \nthe current session. I wish you every success in \nmanaging our business. \n It would be remiss of me not to express our \nappreciation to your predecessor for his efforts during his \nstewardship of the Assembly during the previous session. \n I also wish to express the appreciation and thanks \nof my delegation to the Secretary-General for his \nefforts in the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity, which will not be achieved until the world \ngets rid of all weapons of mass destruction and \nimplements the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \n(NPT) with respect to all, without distinction. \n I remind the Assembly that my country has \nstressed the important need to amend the NPT so as to \nenable the International Atomic Energy Agency \n(IAEA) to perform its tasks and verify the reduction of \nnuclear arsenals, whose existence is the most \ndangerous threat to mankind. Equally important, we \nmust encourage States to possess and use nuclear \nenergy for peaceful purposes. We have affirmed many \ntimes that the voluntary initiative of our country to \nreject all activities related to the production of prohibited \nmaterials should be a role model for countries \npossessing, or seeking to possess, nuclear power. \n The United Nations was established to meet the \nneeds and concerns of Member States. An honest and \nstrict evaluation of the current situation and the \nOrganization\u2019s achievements shows that we still need to \nwork in unison to support it. Here we should \ncontemplate the suggestions of our brother, the Leader \nof the Revolution, Colonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi, in his \naddress to the Assembly during the sixty-fourth session. \n The United Nations is at a crossroads. It must be \nreformed in order to achieve equality for all States. \nThis is the real reform to which we all aspire: that the \nGeneral Assembly become the main legislature, the organ \nthat can produce binding resolutions, as it represents the \nreal parliament of the world. The Security Council, on \nthe contrary, should be the executive tool, \nimplementing the resolutions of the Assembly. We have \ntime and again called for permanent membership to be \ngiven to certain Member States, but, in order for the \nCouncil to accommodate small States as well, the ideal \nsolution is to give Security Council membership to \nregional groups. That would secure the representation \non the Council of all nations, without the exclusive \nveto right, which is contrary to democracy. \n The African continent, which has been deprived \nof fair representation on the Security Council, should \n  \n \n10-55276 2 \n \nhave a permanent seat. That is a legitimate request. It \nwould put the African continent on an equal footing \nwith all the other geopolitical groupings. The speedy \npace of development in developing countries and the \nneed to narrow the painful gap between the developing \nand developed countries require international cooperation \nwithin the framework of a new and effective partnership. \n It goes without saying that the underdevelopment \nand poverty of most nations are the remnants of \ncolonization and plunder, the theft of their resources and \nthe illegal usurping of their riches. The former colonizers \nshould apologize for those actions. It is time the \nAssembly took the necessary measures to criminalize \ncolonialism, put the blame on the countries concerned and \nmake them accountable for their historical responsibilities. \n Nations suffered immensely from the two world \nwars, after which the United Nations was established. \nSince then the world has witnessed wars of aggression \nand illegal interventions which are a flagrant violation \nof all international customs and conventions. \n The invasion of Iraq is a shameful example of \nsuch unfair and heinous wars. In order to achieve \ninternational justice, the United Nations is called upon \nto establish an international investigative panel to \nunderstand the motivation behind the invasion and to \ninvestigate the mass killings and executions of \nprisoners of war, including the head of State. \n At this forum last year, the Leader of the \nRevolution, our brother, Colonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi, \nalso raised the question of the political assassination of \nmany personalities, including Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, \nJohn Kennedy, Patrice Lumumba, Martin Luther King, \nMaurice Bishop and many Palestine Liberation \nOrganization leaders. Those assassinations shocked the \nconscience of the world and created anger and rage the \nworld over. However, justice was not done; the \nperpetrators enjoyed, and continue to enjoy, impunity. \nMy country has called for an effective international \ninstrument to secure an honest investigation of all the \ncircumstances that led to the assassinations.  \n An alternative Headquarters for the United \nNations has been suggested. We all know that certain \nconsiderations were in play in choosing the host \ncountry for the current Headquarters. But for the good \nconduct of our work, and to facilitate the work of the \ndiplomatic missions accredited to the United Nations, \nit is imperative to choose another Headquarters, in \nanother country. We must study all the bids presented \nby other countries, at the forefront of which is the offer \nby the Jamahiriya to host the Headquarters. \n Anti-personnel mines are weapons used by weak \nStates to defend their territories against invaders and to \nprotect themselves. Strong and mighty States do not need \nsuch weapons, because they possess advanced arsenals. In \nthis connection, the Convention on the Prohibition of the \nUse, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\nPersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction, the Ottawa \nTreaty, should be amended in a way that takes into \naccount the security interests of small States. The drafters \nshould have included a provision for compensation to be \npaid to the States where such mines have been planted. \nMy country suggests a review of the Treaty. \n We must distinguish between the heinous \nphenomenon of terrorism and the deliberate biased \ndistortion of the struggle of nations languishing under \noccupation. The Palestinian people are waging an \nincredible struggle against enemies nourished by a \nracist creed, who deny the right of that oppressed \npeople to existence and self-determination. \n The world understands the suffering and losses of \nthe Palestinian people over 62 years. We cannot deny \nthe facts of history. This question cannot be settled \nthrough the so-called peace process, because it will go \non indefinitely. The solution, rather, is the establishment \nof one democratic State in which all can coexist, \nwithout discrimination, in accordance with the \nsuggestion by our brother Muammar Al-Qadhafi in his \n\u201cWhite Book\u201d regarding Isratine. \n In the framework of strengthening cooperation \nbetween the States of the South and those of the North, \nmy country is to play host in October to an Arab-\nAfrican summit. We shall also host, in November, a \nsummit of Africa and the European Union, which will \nbe a major transformation in the relationship between \nall the States concerned. We call on all stakeholders \nand all States to take part in the two summits at the \nhighest level, as they are of prime importance. \n In current circumstances, and in the framework of \ntoday\u2019s challenges, we have great hope that bold \nmeasures will be taken to strengthen the General \nAssembly, its authority and effectiveness so that it \nbetter represents the interests of all nations."

Sustained economic \ngrowth, financial stability, social inclusion and the full \nexercise of democracy have converged and reinforced \neach another. Over 20 million Brazilians rose out of \npoverty, and many others out of extreme poverty. \nNearly 30 million people joined the middle class. \n Strong and transparent public policies reduced \ninequalities in income, access and opportunities. \nMillions of Brazilians rose to dignity and real \ncitizenship. The strengthened domestic market \nprotected us from the worst effects of the global crisis \nset in motion by the financial casino in the richest \ncountries in the world. \n Brazil is proud to have achieved almost all of the \nMillennium Development Goals and to be well on the \nway to meeting them all by 2015. The inability of any \ncountry to achieve those Goals must be seen as a \nfailure of the entire international community. The \npromotion of development is a collective responsibility. \nBrazil has been working to assist other countries to \nreplicate its successful experiences. In the past years \nBrazil\u2019s actions on the international stage have been \ndriven by a sense of solidarity. We are convinced that it \nis possible to have a humanistic foreign policy without \nlosing sight of national interests. That policy is \nsupported by South-South cooperation. The IBSA \nFacility for Poverty and Hunger Alleviation, created by \nIndia, Brazil and South Africa, finances projects in \nHaiti, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Palestine, \nCambodia, Burundi, Laos and Sierra Leone. Brazil has \nsubstantially increased its humanitarian aid and the \nnumber of its cooperation projects with poorer \ncountries.  \n Africa occupies a very special place in Brazilian \ndiplomacy. Since taking office, President Lula has been \nto Africa 11 times and visited over 20 countries in the \ncontinent. We have set up an agricultural research \noffice in Ghana, a model cotton farm in Mali, a \nmanufacturing plant for antiretroviral drugs in \nMozambique and professional training centres in five \nAfrican countries. Through trade and investment, we \nare helping the African continent to develop its \nenormous potential and reduce its dependency on a few \ncentres of political and economic power. \n Brazil is particularly concerned about Guinea-\nBissau. It is not by isolating or abandoning Guinea-\nBissau that the international community will help it \naddress the challenges it still faces. We need intelligent \nmodalities for cooperation, which can promote \ndevelopment and stability and encourage the necessary \nreforms, especially with regard to the armed forces. \n This year, in which a significant number of \nAfrican countries celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of \ntheir decolonization, Brazil renews its commitment to \nan independent, prosperous, just and democratic \nAfrica. \n There are few places where international \nsolidarity is more needed than Haiti. We joined the \nUnited Nations in mourning the tragedy that took the \nlives of hundreds of thousands of Haitians. We \nourselves lost great Brazilians, including Dr. Zilda \nArns \u2014 a woman who dedicated her life to the poor, \nespecially children \u2014 Mr. Luiz Carlos da Costa, \nDeputy Head of the United Nations Stabilization \nMission in Haiti, and 18 of our peacekeepers. \n We would like to express our compassion for the \nsuffering of the Haitian people and, above all, our \nadmiration for the stoicism and courage with which \nthey have been facing adversity. The Haitian people \nknow that they can count on Brazil to not only help \nthem maintain order and defend democracy, but also \nassist in their development. We are keeping our \npromises and will keep a watchful eye on the situation \nto ensure that the commitments of the international \ncommunity go beyond rhetorical statements. \n  \n \n10-54827 6 \n \n In recent years, the Brazilian Government has \ninvested heavily in South America\u2019s integration and \npeace. We have strengthened our strategic partnership \nwith Argentina. We have reinforced MERCOSUR, \nincluding through financial mechanisms unique among \ndeveloping countries. \n The establishment of the Union of South \nAmerican Nations (UNASUR) aims at consolidating a \ngenuine zone of peace and prosperity. UNASUR has \nalready demonstrated its value in promoting \nunderstanding and the peaceful resolution of conflicts \namong and within countries in South America and has \nmade foreign interference in our region even more \nunwarranted. By creating the Community of Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean States, launched in Bahia, \nBrazil and confirmed in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, we have \nreaffirmed the region\u2019s willingness to extend to Central \nAmerica and the Caribbean the integrationist ideals \nthat animate South Americans. \n Brazil reiterates its condemnation, shared by all \nin Latin America and the Caribbean, of the illegitimate \nembargo against Cuba. Its sole result has been to \nhamper the efforts of millions of Cubans in their \nstruggle for development. \n We condemn anti-democratic moves, such as the \ncoup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Honduras. The return of former \nPresident Zelaya without threats to his freedom is \nindispensable for the full normalization of Honduras\u2019 \nrelations with the region as a whole. \n When President Lula first spoke in this Hall, in \n2003, the world lived under the shadow of the invasion \nof Iraq. We hope we have learned the lessons of that \nepisode. Blind faith in intelligence reports tailored to \njustify political goals must be rejected. We must ban \nonce and for all the use of force that is inconsistent \nwith international law. Furthermore, it is fundamental \nto value and promote dialogue and the peaceful \nresolution of disputes. \n In order to achieve a truly secure world, the \npromise of the total elimination of nuclear weapons \nmust be fulfilled. Unilateral reductions are welcome \nbut insufficient, especially when they occur in tandem \nwith the modernization of nuclear arsenals. \n As President Lula has often stated, \nmultilateralism is the international face of democracy. \nThe United Nations must be the main center of \ndecision-making in international politics.  \n The changes that have occurred in the world over \nthe past few decades and the series of crises we have \nfaced in food security, climate change, the economic \nand financial sphere and peace and security make it \nurgent to redefine the rules that govern international \nrelations. \n The financial crisis of 2008 accelerated change in \nglobal economic governance. The Group of Twenty \n(G-20) replaced the Group of Eight as the primary \nforum for deliberation on economic issues. The G-20 \nwas a step forward, but it must be adjusted to ensure, \nfor instance, greater African participation. The \nrelevance and legitimacy of the G-20 can be preserved \nonly if it maintains frank and permanent dialogue with \nall the nations represented in this General Assembly. \n At the height of the crisis, we succeeded in \navoiding the worst-case scenario: a surge of \nuncontrolled protectionism, which would have thrown \nthe world into a deep depression. But the developed \ncountries have not demonstrated the necessary \ncommitment to global economic stability. They \ncontinue to let themselves be guided by parochial \ninterests. Nowhere is that more evident than in the \nDoha round of negotiations in the World Trade \nOrganization. A balanced solution to that negotiating \nprocess, which has lasted for almost 10 years, would \npromote economic expansion and the development of \nthe poorest countries, with the end of distorting \nsubsidies and protectionist barriers. After all, poor \ncountries are the greatest victims of the narrow and \nselfish view that still prevails in international trade. \n Reforms have also been insufficient in the \nfinancial sector. Unjustified resistance is preventing the \nimplementation of agreed-upon changes. Obstinacy in \nmaintaining anachronistic privileges perpetuates and \ndeepens the illegitimacy of institutions. \n Another major challenge we face is achieving a \nglobal, comprehensive and ambitious agreement on \nclimate change. In order to move forward on this \nmatter, countries must stop hiding behind each other. \nBrazil, like other developing countries, has done its \npart. But in Copenhagen, several delegations, \nespecially from the rich world, sought excuses to evade \ntheir moral and political obligations. They forgot that \none cannot negotiate with Nature. \n A positive outcome of the sixteenth Conference \nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change, with real progress in \n \n \n7 10-54827 \n \nforests, financing for adaptation and mitigation and a \nreaffirmation of the Kyoto commitments, is \nindispensable. The Mexican presidency can count on \nBrazil\u2019s engagement to achieve this objective. \n In 2012, we will host, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, \nthe Rio+20 Conference. On behalf of the Brazilian \nGovernment, I invite all delegations to fulfill the \npromise of truly sustainable development. \n The reform of global governance has not yet \nreached the field of international peace and security. In \nthe economic and environmental areas, the wealthiest \nnations have already understood that they cannot do \nwithout the cooperation of the poor and emerging \ncountries. When it comes to war and peace, however, \nthe traditional players are reluctant to share power. \n The Security Council must be reformed and \nexpanded to allow for greater participation by \ndeveloping countries, including as permanent \nmembers. We cannot continue with working methods \nthat lack transparency and that allow the permanent \nmembers to discuss behind closed doors and for as \nlong as they wish issues that concern all mankind. \n Brazil has sought to live up to what is expected \nfrom all Security Council members, including non-\npermanent ones \u2014 namely, that they contribute to \npeace. For this reason, we made a serious effort to find \nan instrument that could enable progress towards a \nsolution of the Iranian nuclear question. In so doing, \nwe relied on proposals that had been presented as a \nunique opportunity to build confidence between the \nparties. The Tehran Declaration of 17 May, signed by \nBrazil, Turkey and Iran, removed obstacles that, \naccording to the very authors of those proposals, had \npreviously prevented an agreement. \n The Tehran Declaration does not exhaust the \nissue and was never intended to do so. We are \nconvinced that, once back to the negotiating table, the \nparties will find ways to resolve other issues, such as \n20 per cent enrichment and the stock of enriched \nuranium accumulated since October 2009. In spite of \nthe sanctions, we still hope that the logic of dialogue \nand understanding will prevail. The world cannot run \nthe risk of a new conflict like the one in Iraq. We have \nbeen insisting, therefore, that the Iranian Government \nmaintain an attitude of flexibility and openness towards \nnegotiations, but it is necessary that all those \nconcerned also demonstrate such willingness. \n We are closely following developments in the \npeace process in the Middle East. We hope the direct \ntalks between Palestinians and Israelis launched earlier \nthis month will produce concrete results that lead to the \ncreation of a Palestinian State within the pre-1967 \nborders, a State that ensures for the Palestinian people \na dignified life, co-existing side by side and in peace \nwith the State of Israel. \n However, it is not the format of the dialogue that \nwill determine whether it will yield results. What \nmatters is the willingness of the parties to reach a just \nand lasting peace. That will be easier with the \ninvolvement of all those concerned. Freezing the \nconstruction of settlements in the occupied territories, \nlifting the Gaza blockade and ending attacks against \ncivilian populations are crucial elements in the process. \n In his visit to Israel, Palestine and Jordan in \nMarch, President Lula spoke with government leaders \nand representatives of civil society about those issues. \nWe frequently receive in Brasilia the leaders of various \ncountries of the region, who seek support in resolving \nproblems that have afflicted them for decades and have \nnot been solved through the traditional means and \nactors. Brazil, which has about 10 million people of \nArab descent and a sizeable Jewish community living \ntogether in harmony, will not shy away from making its \ncontribution to the peace that we all yearn for. \n Brazil\u2019s commitment to the promotion of human \nrights is also unwavering. We favour a non-selective, \nobjective and multilateral treatment of human rights, \nwithout politicization or bias, in which everyone \u2014 the \nrich and the poor, the powerful and the weak \u2014 is \nsubject to the same scrutiny. In our view, the exercise \nof human rights is more effectively ensured by \ndialogue and cooperation than by arrogant attitudes \nderived from self-declared moral superiority. \n During his eight years in office, President Lula \nhas developed a foreign policy that is independent, free \nof any sort of submission, and respectful of Brazil\u2019s \nneighbours and partners. It is an innovative foreign \npolicy, which does not distance itself from the \nfundamental values of the Brazilian nation: peace, \npluralism, tolerance and solidarity. \n Just as Brazil has changed and will continue to \nchange, the world is also changing. We must deepen \nand accelerate this process. With the technology and \nwealth at our disposal, there is no longer any \njustification for hunger, poverty and epidemics of \n  \n \n10-54827 8 \n \npreventable diseases. We can no longer live with \ndiscrimination, injustice and authoritarianism. We must \nface the challenges of nuclear disarmament, sustainable \ndevelopment and freer and fairer trade. Rest assured, \nBrazil will continue to fight to make these ideals a \nreality."

        "file_text": "\nEight years after Switzerland became a full Member of \nthe United Nations, we are delighted to see that the \npresidency of this General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \nsession fell to the 2004 President of the Swiss \nConfederation, Mr. Joseph Deiss, to whom we wish the \ngreatest success in his tenure. \n In 1998, the twentieth special session of the \nGeneral Assembly was held to contribute to the \nelimination or substantial reduction of the illegal \nproduction of drugs and drug abuse by 2008. Ten years \nlater, at a follow-up review meeting supported by this \nprestigious world body, the conclusion was reached \nthat little progress had been made regarding the \nproposed goals and that there were therefore plenty of \nreasons for the international community to be \nconcerned about the growing threat posed by the global \ndrug problem. It was determined that a new 10-year \nplan was needed to cover the period until 2019, when \nthe General Assembly will have once again to convene \nMember States in order to assess the outcome of \nmeasures implemented to eliminate the most serious \nthreat to our citizens\u2019 safety at the dawn of the twenty-\nfirst century: transnational organized crime and illegal \ndrug trafficking. \n Today, almost 250 million people between the \nages of 15 and 64 consume drugs worldwide. Although \nthat consumption extends to many regions around the \nworld, the highest concentration of users is found in \nareas with the most pronounced economic and social \ndevelopment, such as the United States, Western \nEurope and Central Asia. \n Drug consumption is harmful to health, causing \npersonality disorders that often lead to loss of will, \napathy and the development of pathological behaviour. \nFurthermore, tens of thousands of people die every \nyear as a direct result of drug consumption, while \nothers, depending on the way these toxic substances \nare consumed, are affected by diseases such as \nHIV/AIDS and hepatitis C. \n Today, illegal drug trafficking constitutes a global \nblack market, a kind of underground or hidden \neconomy for the growth, manufacture, distribution and \nsale of this merchandise in the form of marijuana, \nopium, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamines and other \nvarieties of such substances and others. That market, \nwhich is ruled like any other by the laws of supply and \ndemand, now amounts to the astronomical sum of \napproximately $400 billion a year. That astronomical \nsum means that the global drug trade is worth more \nthan the gross domestic product of 122 of the \n184 countries that appear on the annual World Bank \neconomic index. Every year, the global drug market \ngenerates more wealth than countries such as Chile, \nDenmark, Egypt, Finland, Israel, South Africa and \nPortugal. But, at the same time, it is more \neconomically powerful than many of the world\u2019s \nleading petroleum producing countries such as Kuwait, \nQatar, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and the \nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela. \n In pursuit of its goals of conquering markets and \naccumulating wealth, transnational organized crime has \nbegun availing itself of a new type of unprecedented, \ninhumane and cruel violence. Drug trafficking uses \nkidnapping, contract killings, torture and beheadings \nboth in battles between drug trafficking groups and \nagainst the people and institutions that confront them. \nDrug trafficking sows fear and terror. It executes public \nservants as well as ordinary citizens. It murders \njournalists, teachers, doctors, students and housewives. \nDrug trafficking knows no limits or borders; it knows \nonly horror, barbarism, bloodshed and crime. \n It is so powerful that it influences and interferes \nin vital areas of government, such as the armed forces, \nthe police, intelligence services and the justice system, \nin its attempt to make State institutions serve its \nmacabre and sinister interests. \n  \n \n10-54833 32 \n \n In the face of all of this, some people are right to \nwonder whether transnational organized crime and \nillegal international drug trafficking can be defeated. Is \nit really possible to tackle and defeat all that this form \nof international crime entails? \n Our response is: yes, it is possible. It is possible \nto take it on and to defeat it. It is possible to reduce it \nand to mitigate its harmful effects. However, to do so, \nseveral elements need to be in place. First, we need \ngenuine commitment at the global level and authentic \nand genuine political will at the level of national \nGovernment. \n We also need a paradigm change or a new \nstrategic vision that will focus our efforts to fight the \nproblem, not only on the supply side, as has \nfundamentally been the case so far, but also on the \ndemand and consumption side.  \n It is imperative that we curb indiscriminate gun \nsales and human trafficking. We need to implement \nexchange and cooperation policies among the narcotics \nproducer, transit and consumer countries. We need to \nintroduce new technologies, strengthen intelligence \nsystems, better train and enhance the professionalism \nof those in charge of ensuring public safety, design \nprevention mechanisms, generate educational \nopportunities, reduce poverty and create jobs, and get \ncommunities involved in building protective networks \nagainst crime. \n We hope that, in 2019, when the General \nAssembly convenes its member States to evaluate the \noutcome of its new 10-year Plan of Action on \nInternational Cooperation towards an Integrated and \nBalanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem \n(see resolution 64/182), we will be in a position to say, \nfor the sake of our families, our young people, our \nsocieties and, ultimately, of humanity as a whole, \u201cWe \nhave prevailed. We have defeated the leading threat to \nthe security our peoples at the beginning of the twenty-\nfirst century. We have beaten drugs.\u201d \n It is important also to note that the human and \nmaterial losses experienced as a result of natural \ndisasters in 2010 are a great cause for concern. To date, \nwe have seen 47 floods and landslides, affecting \ncountries as far apart as India and Brazil, China and \nColombia, Russia and Congo, Kazakhstan and \ncountries of East Africa, Mexico and Central America, \nPakistan, Yemen and the Sudan. \n To date, there have been 12 hurricanes, cyclones \nand typhoons, affecting countries such as Mexico, \nIndia, the Solomon Islands and Madagascar. To date, \nwe have suffered eight serious droughts, followed by \nfires, in Bolivia, California, the Caribbean, China, \nSpain and Russia. To date, there have been seven \nearthquakes, from the tragedy in Haiti to China, from \nTajikistan to Chile, and from Afghanistan to Mexico. \n That does not include the volcanic eruptions \u2014 \nthese too made no distinction between rich and poor. In \nthe case of Iceland, the volcano led to the most serious \ninterruption of air traffic since the Second World War. \nIn addition, we need to take into account the numerous \ncold snaps, avalanches and storms that have occurred \nand their resultant epidemics \u2014 foremost among them, \ncholera in Africa and dengue fever in Latin America \nand the Caribbean. \n As we can see, vulnerability to natural disasters \naround the world is on the rise, and development levels \nare falling quickly as a result. Most of these natural \ndisasters are caused by climate change or global \nwarming. It is therefore imperative that this world body \nadopt, as soon as possible, guidelines to regulate the \nemission of carbon dioxide and to protect the planet\u2019s \nbiodiversity. \n There is much work to be done around the world \nto draw up and adopt policies and practices that will \nenable us to prevent the impact of natural disasters. In \nthis context, it is crucial to incorporate risk \nmanagement into development and land-use planning. \nWe need to design and implement early warning \nsystems in coastal areas, cities at risk, schools and \nhospitals. And we need urgently to re-equip critical \ninfrastructure to ensure that it is adequate to withstand \nfuture catastrophes and to minimize human loss. Faced \nwith this situation, the Dominican Republic intends to \nparticipate actively in the work of the Global Platform \nfor Disaster Risk Reduction, whose next meeting will \ntake place in Geneva, Switzerland, in May 2011. \n Likewise, with advisory assistance from the \nUnited Nations Development Programme and New \nYork\u2019s Columbia University, in October we will be \nmeeting with the ministers responsible for social policy \nas well as the mayors of cities at greatest risk in order \nto review ongoing activities in the integration and \nplanning of natural disaster risk management. \n Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to \nsuggest, as we did during a visit to L\u2019Aquila, Italy, that \n \n \n33 10-54833 \n \nthe United Nations system create a world alliance of \ncountries at risk in order to exchange experiences, \nknowledge and ideas, and to pass along best practices \nlearned during catastrophes. We are convinced that this \nwould be a major contribution to the design and \nimplementation of measures that will help save lives \nand minimize material damage."

        "file_text": "Allow me, Sir, at the \noutset, to extend to you my delegation\u2019s warm \ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I would \nlike to assure you of my delegation\u2019s full cooperation \nin the discharge of your high responsibilities. My \ndelegation would like to register our appreciation to the \noutgoing President, Mr. Ali Treki, for his able \nleadership during the sixty-fourth session. We would \nalso like to take this opportunity to express our \nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, for \nhis tireless efforts to ensure that the Organization lives \nup to the purposes and principles set out in its Charter.  \n Allow me to begin my statement today by \nreviewing some salient aspects of the political and \neconomic transformation in Ethiopia.  \n Such a review should of necessity begin with the \ndemocratization process in Ethiopia, which is now \nalmost completing its second decade. In the political \ntransformation in Ethiopia over the past two decades, \nour single-minded focus has been on building \ninstitutions of democracy, good governance and the \nrule of law. The essence of all our endeavours in that \nregard has been the devolution of power to the people. \nOur federal democratic order, built on the basis of \nunity in diversity, has laid the foundation for lasting \npeace and security. The democratization process that \nEthiopia has embarked on is irreversible and is taking \ndeep root at the level of the State and the society at \nlarge. \n Still, a democratization process in any country is \nnot an end in itself. The whole purpose is to create an \nenvironment conducive to bringing about a better life \nfor the people. That inevitably leads me to our \neconomic policy and strategy. Today in our country \naccelerated development is in full swing, while a \ndemocratic culture and its institutional underpinnings \nare developing at the grass-roots level.  \n The successful results achieved during the last \nseven years and the challenges and experience gained \nin the process of implementing the previous five-year \neconomic plan have helped in the formulation of the \nnext five-year plan \u2014 officially called the Growth and \nTransformation Plan \u2014 covering the period of 2011 to \n2015. The objective of that plan is to lay the necessary \nbasis for nation-building by creating and strengthening \na stable, democratic, developmental State and to \nachieve the economic and social goals in the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).  \n At the end of the five-year period the net result of \nall our efforts will be that poverty in our country has \nbeen made history. We are confident that by that time \nour people will celebrate, together with the \ninternational community, the end of an era of food \ninsecurity and dependency on food aid. That historic \nevent will give us an opportunity to extend our deep \ngratitude to all our partners for their assistance in our \ndifficult times. We pledge to redouble our efforts and \nutilize their assistance for rapid development of our \ncountry that will extricate us from food insecurity once \nand for all. \n As regards the Millennium Development Goals, \nthe High-level Plenary Meeting of the sixty-fifth \nsession of the General Assembly, held here in New \nYork just last week, was timely. The outcome \ndocument of that forum (resolution 65/1) should not be \njust an appeal but a new pact, binding on stakeholders \nwith respect to renewed commitment to ensure that the \ncollective promises made at the dawn of the new \nmillennium are kept. The action agenda designed to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 \nmust ensure the mutual responsibility and \naccountability of all stakeholders.  \n We in Ethiopia have made substantial progress on \nall fronts towards achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. We have taken full charge of our \ndestiny, devised our own strategy and maximized the \nmobilization of our domestic resources to achieve the \nMDGs. The results so far have been very encouraging. \nOver the past seven years, the Ethiopian economy has \nperformed well, having achieved an annual average \ngrowth rate of 11.6 per cent. The robust economic \ngrowth we have achieved has created the basis for \nsimilarly robust growth in social indicators, and hence \non progress in achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals. \n Assessing the state of the MDGs today would not \nbe complete without some reflections on Africa from \nthe perspective of economic and social development \n  \n \n10-55396 12 \n \nand its organic link to the MDGs. In that connection, I \ncan do no better than to refer to what Mr. Zoellick, \nPresident of the World Bank, said at the High-level \nPlenary Meeting on the MDGs (see A/65/PV.3). The \nmost important point he made was that he believed in \nAfrica and that Africa can be a global pole of growth \nand attract investment on African terms. That is what \nwe have been saying all along. He also said that one \nneeds to work with developing countries as clients, not \nas development models from textbooks, and to help \nthem to solve problems, not to test theories. We in \nAfrica know what we can do; we want to know what \nthe rest of the world will do to help us achieve our \ngoals. \n The issue of climate change remains among the \nmost critical challenges facing humankind today. Much \nhas been said, from Rio to Kyoto to Copenhagen. What \nhas been promised has thus far resulted in far less than \nthe urgency of the matter merits. We believe that time \nis running out, and we are concerned that national \nagendas of zero-sum preferences are overshadowing \nthe real urgency of addressing the matter in an \naccelerated and coordinated manner. The upcoming \nCanc\u00fan meeting on climate change should be different \nfrom its predecessors. It should come up with a legally \nbinding commitment, coupled with the political will, to \nallocate the necessary resources for adaptation and \nmitigation efforts, especially for the most vulnerable \nand exposed countries. \n On energy and development, it has always been \nself-evident that access to energy is key to fighting \npoverty. It is central to development. Yet, 1.4 billion \npeople worldwide are without electricity, 80 per cent of \nwhom live in rural areas. Given the urgency of this dire \nsituation, we fully support the goal of universal energy \naccess by 2030, as set by the United Nations. \n As the prevalence of conflicts around the world \nclearly indicates, international cooperation is of \nparamount importance to complement the efforts of the \nUnited Nations in the area of peace and security. In \nthat regard, Ethiopia, as a founding Member of the \nUnited Nations, has always been at the forefront in \ndischarging its responsibilities in the area of peace and \nsecurity. Since the early 1950s, Ethiopia has been an \nactive participant in United Nations peacekeeping \noperations. At the moment, Ethiopia is among the \nmajor troop-contributing countries to United Nations \npeacekeeping missions. \n Among the challenges that the international \ncommunity faces in the area of peace and security is \nthe scourge of terrorism. Like many other countries, we \nhave been at the receiving end of this problem. We \nbelieve that unreserved international cooperation is the \nonly viable way to combat terrorism. Ethiopia will \ncontinue to do its level best in that regard. \n Any discussion of peace and security on the \ninternational scene today will inevitably have to take \nup the situation in the Horn of Africa. It is regrettable \nthat we still cannot talk about the situation in Somalia \nwith a great deal of optimism. On one hand, the threat \nof extremism continues unabated in Somalia, as does \nthe danger posed by international terrorist networks \nand their sponsors to Somalia, and beyond. On the \nother hand, it is clear that there is little chance for \nmaking progress in Somalia until there is harmony and \ngreater seriousness of purpose at the highest level \nwithin the Transitional Federal Institutions of Somalia. \n The Council of Ministers of the \nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), \nwhich met here in New York on 22 September \npreceding the mini-summit on Somalia convened by \nthe Secretary-General on 23 September, expressed its \nregret with regard to differences within the leadership \nof the Transitional Federal Government. It called upon \nthem to strengthen their cohesion and work together to \naddress the multiple challenges facing the country. \nFurthermore, the Council of Ministers reaffirmed the \nDjibouti process as the sole basis for peace and \nreconciliation in Somalia, expressed concern about the \nproliferation of initiatives and urged the United \nNations and other stakeholders to engage within the \nregion and with IGAD. \n With regard to the situation in the Sudan, \nEthiopia is of the firm view that conceivably there is \nno other conflict on the continent today comparable to \nthat of the Sudan. Hence, we believe that success in the \nSudan will mean significant success for Africa as a \nwhole. By the same token, failure may entail a serious \ncatastrophe for Africa. That is why the African Union \nhas given its unreserved attention to the issue, as \nillustrated by the effort of the High-Level \nImplementation Panel led by former President Thabo \nMbeki. We would like to express our appreciation to \nthe Secretary-General for holding a timely high-level \nmeeting on the Sudan here on 24 September. The \noutcome of the meeting has been encouraging. \n \n \n13 10-55396 \n \n It goes without saying that the referendums in \nSouthern Sudan and Abyei should be held on time and \nstrictly in conformity with the terms of the \nComprehensive Peace Agreement. However, we \nbelieve that, irrespective of the outcome of the \nreferendums and without in any way detracting from \nthe historic significance of that date, the parties should \nnot fix their minds solely on 9 January 2011. The \nparties ought to recognize that here are several \ncommonalities, interests, bonds and values between the \npeoples of the Sudan, north and south, that transcend \nthe decision to be taken in January 2011. That is why it \nis of paramount importance that negotiations on post-\nreferendum issues should be conducted in earnest and \nwith the seriousness of purpose that the issues deserve. \n When we talk of security in the Horn of Africa \nregion and the southern Red Sea, we cannot avoid \nraising our concern once again about the destructive \nrole that the Government of Eritrea has continued to \nplay since independence. We in the IGAD region have \ntime and time again warned the United Nations, as well \nas the international community, that the Eritrean \nregime is the principal destabilizer in our subregion, \nwith its utter contempt for international law and the \nnorms of international behaviour.  \n It is indeed regrettable that the Security Council \nis not taking the necessary steps to compel Eritrea to \nlive up to what is expected of it under Council \nresolution 1907 (2009). Despite the sanctions, Eritrea \nis still the principal architect of the complicated \nsituation in Somalia, through its training, arming and \nnurturing of extremist elements such as Al-Shabaab \nand Hizb al-Islam, who are causing havoc in that \ncountry today.  \n That reprehensible conduct on the part of the \nregime has been by no means isolated or confined to \nour subregion. On the contrary, it has been standard \nbehaviour for the Eritrean regime, extending far \nbeyond the subregion, to other parts of the continent \nand sometimes even outside it. \n Consistent with its innate character, the regime \ncommitted acts of aggression against practically all its \nneighbours in the space of only a few years after its \nindependence. That is unprecedented for any newly \nindependent State, giving Eritrea the dubious \ndistinction of being an international pariah in the \nfamily of nations. Therefore, if we are to achieve a \nbreakthrough in Somalia, the time is long overdue for \nthe Security Council to take resolute action and see to \nit that its decisions are complied with. \n \n Since its founding more than six decades ago, the \nUnited Nations, as the principal global player on the \ninternational scene with multifarious responsibilities, \nhas, under the circumstances, lived up to the vision set \nfor it in the Charter. There is no gainsaying the fact \nthat if the United Nations did not exist, we would have \nhad to create it. It is an indispensable Organization, \nparticularly for us in the developing world. However, \nwhile underscoring its importance, we should not lose \nsight of the need for its reform, which is an ongoing \nprocess. That is how we can ensure the Organization\u2019s \nviability. Ethiopia will always be ready to give \nwhatever support is necessary to that end.  \n When we talk of the United Nations as a global \nactor, the importance of cooperation between the \nUnited Nations and our continental organization, the \nAfrican Union, need hardly be emphasized. Of \nparticular significance is the ongoing cooperation and \nconsultation between the United Nations Security \nCouncil and the African Union Peace and Security \nCouncil, in line with the provisions of Chapter VIII of \nthe Charter of the United Nations. We should continue \nthat cooperation, and Ethiopia will do whatever is \nnecessary in that regard. \n In conclusion, let me reiterate, as a founding \nMember, Ethiopia\u2019s enduring commitment to the ideals \nof our Organization and the fulfilment of its objectives, \nas set out in the Charter, which remains a living \ndocument and a source of inspiration for the \ninternational community."

        "file_text": "It gives \nme great pleasure to offer you, Sir, and your friendly \ncountry, Switzerland, our warmest congratulations on \nyour election to preside over the sixty-fifth session of the \nGeneral assembly. I also wish to express our appreciation \nto your predecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, of the \nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, for his fruitful efforts in \nconducting the deliberations of the previous session. \n For more than 65 years, since its inception, the \nUnited Nations has registered tangible achievements. It \nhas offered assistance and expertise in the socio-\neconomic and environmental spheres, as well as in the \ncause of international security and peace, and has \ncontributed to the establishment of stability in a \nnumber of regions of the world. \n The Sultanate of Oman hopes that at this session \nthe Assembly will make unprecedented progress in our \nshared pursuit of international peace and security, as \nwell as prosperity. \n The international community meets today in \nchallenging times, faced with a whole range of thorny \nissues, from ongoing political instability to security \nchallenges, financial crises, economic and environmental \nproblems, the nuclear question and non-proliferation. It \nmay be useful to recall here the lesson that such \nchallenges can best be met through dialogue and \npositive participation by all, aimed at arresting threats \nto international peace and security. \n The floods in Pakistan led to the dislocation of \nmore than 20 million Pakistanis, who have lost their \nhomes and are still experiencing tragic suffering, \ndespite the continuing international rescue efforts. \nMore outside assistance, expertise and capabilities are \nneeded to help Pakistan overcome this tragedy and \nmitigate its consequences on the ground, as well as \npush ahead with the reconstruction process. \n Those floods, the volcanic eruption in Iceland and \nthe H1N1 epidemic, for example, are recent phenomena \nthat have highlighted how interconnected the States of \nthe world are and the need for international \ncooperation. What affects one corner of the world can \ntruly have sweeping impacts across the globe. \n The United Nations, its specialized agencies and \nlegal organs were established after devastating wars, in \nthe aftermath of the First and Second World Wars. \nAlthough the international community has not yet been \nable to find the means to resolve complex political \nproblems, the United Nations offers multilateral \nmechanisms and goals that have played an enormous \npart in the reduction or neutralization of many crises. \nIn addition, it plays key roles in helping developing \ncountries in numerous specialized fields related to \nsocio-economic development and the protection of the \nenvironment. \n We believe that the effectiveness of the United \nNations must reach a new level. This requires that the \npermanent members of the Security Council accept a \nreorganization of the United Nations, including an \nexpansion of its administrative base, with fair management \nof world trade interests, in a way which makes Member \nStates feel that it is an Organization for all. \n We look forward to seeing the international \ncommunity conduct a comprehensive review of the \nrequirements for international peace and security, in \nview of all the lessons learned from wars in the past \ncentury and in this century. \n We also look forward, Mr. President, along with \nyou and all Member States, to a world of lasting \nsecurity, characterized by good intentions and \nconfidence in the future, a world where all peoples \nenjoy shining freedom and the beauty of life. We look \nforward to the day when dialogue prevails on the basis \nof accepting the other, regardless of social and cultural \nvariations between human communities. We believe \nthat dialogue between Governments, which differ in \ntheir perspectives on issues, will lead to a clearer \nsystem of global partnership and coexistence, in which \ndevelopment, welfare and prosperity prevail. \n The Sultanate of Oman believes strongly that part \nof its responsibilities in the context of development is \nto make the Omani person the effective mover of the \nwheel of development. Therefore, my country has \ndedicated all resources towards that goal, especially \nwith regard to education at all levels and medical care \nfor every individual. \n The people of Oman and their Government play \ntheir roles in society and participate effectively in \neverything concerning the life of the Omani citizen \nthrough the Council of Oman, with its two chambers: \nthe Council of State and the Consultative Council. The \nrole of the Omani citizen along the path of his country\u2019s \ndevelopment is central and indispensable, stemming \nfrom the firm conviction of the leader of Oman\u2019s \nrenaissance, His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said, that \nlife is created for mankind, male and female, that \n  \n \n10-55276 4 \n \nfreedom is the core of life, and that free positive \nexpression is the seed of creativity, which is the fuel \nfor development. With that insightful vision of His \nMajesty, the Sultanate of Oman is moving towards the \nfuture with firm determination. \n We wish to stress our strong belief in the absolute \nnecessity of finding a solution to the chronic conflict in \nthe Middle East. Although we support the direct \nnegotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis, \nsponsored by the United States of America, we still \nfeel that the Israeli policy is vague with regard to \naccepting Israel\u2019s responsibility towards the requirements \nof peace: the establishment of an independent, sovereign \nand viable Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its \ncapital, and Israel\u2019s withdrawal from all Arab lands to \nthe borders of 4 June 1967. \n We look forward to an active, positive and \ncontinuing role by United States President Barack \nObama in order to reach a just and comprehensive \nsettlement. We call upon Israel to grasp this historic \nopportunity to establish partnership in peace and \nsecurity with the Arab countries. \n"

        "file_text": "This session of the \nGeneral Assembly is taking place at a time when \ncertain signs of recovery are being observed in the \nwake of the global economic and financial crisis, and \ncome on the heels of sharp spikes in food and energy \nprices. Although the world is still grappling with the \neffects of those multiple and interrelated crises, the call \nof last week\u2019s summit on the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) for intensified collective action gives \nhope for optimism. \n As the world plunged into the worst economic \ncrisis since the Great Depression, the best minds \naround the globe sought clear answers as to what went \nwrong and what needed to be rectified. Many argued \nthat the economic theories referred to as neoliberalism \nor market fundamentalism, which have prevailed for \nthe past quarter century, were flawed. Their main \npremise \u2014 based on the notion, for instance, that \nmarkets are self-correcting and that regulation is \naccordingly unnecessary \u2014 seems to have been proved \nwrong. \n The experience of countries and regions that have \nachieved rapid growth and progress in poverty \nreduction has shown that the State can deliberately \nintervene in the economy and even correct market-\nbased incentives in such a way as to promote inclusive \ngrowth and sustainable development. Hence, a new \nconcept of development is emerging that envisions a \nreversal in the thinking on the roles of the State and the \nmarket. \n As a generator of the new and innovative ideas \nand development notions that have changed the world \nin the past, the United Nations is, in our view, the right \nplace to engage intimately in nurturing such \nfundamental concepts, which could have a huge impact \non the development policies and prospects of its \nMember States. That could prove to be an important \naspect of the deliberations that the President proposed \nas the theme for this debate \u2014 \u201cReaffirming the central \nrole of the United Nations in global governance\u201d. \n It has been widely recognized that today\u2019s global \nchallenges require global solutions. The underlying \nprinciples and characteristics of the United Nations \nmake it an indispensable part of the evolving global \ngovernance system. The United Nations is the world\u2019s \nmost universal, legitimate and authoritative \norganization and a political centre for global \ncooperation. It represents a unique forum for \nsynthesizing solutions to global problems, ranging \nfrom nuclear weapons to climate change, and \ndevelopment to human rights. It is at the United \nNations that we see world leaders commit themselves \nto making the world a safer, fairer, more prosperous \nand greener place to live for this and future \ngenerations. \n Yet, it is a fact that there are challenges that have \nfound or are seeking to find solution outside the United \nNations. A legitimate question would be: why? There \nmay be many factors at play and many facets to cover \nin finding an easy answer to that question. But what \nhas emerged as obvious from our deliberations is the \nfact that, if the United Nations is to reaffirm its central \nrole in global governance, it will have to be efficient \nand its reform vigorously pursued. \n The revitalization of the General Assembly must \nbe further pursued so that our deliberations and \ndecisions have a more practical and meaningful impact \non the lives of the people in whose name we act here. \nThe role of the Economic and Social Council in global \neconomic decision-making must be enhanced. The \nreform of the Security Council, aimed at making it \nmore representative of the world\u2019s current reality, will \ncertainly be a critical boost to reaffirming the central \nrole of the United Nations in global governance. \nMongolia stands for a just and equitable enlargement \nof the Security Council by increasing the number of \npermanent and non-permanent seats and ensuring the \nfair representation of developing and developed \ncountries alike. \n Development, peace and security, and human \nrights are the three main pillars of the United Nations. \nMongolia welcomes the revitalization of the United \nNations development agenda, as attested by the High-\nlevel Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the \n \n \n5 10-55128 \n \nMillennium Development Goals last week and, most \nimportantly, by the vibrant international debate in the \nlead-up to the summit. As a result, we are clearly in a \nmuch better place today as regards world leaders\u2019 \ncommitment to intensifying the efforts towards the \nachievement of the MDGs by 2015. \n On our part, my Government recommitted itself, \nat the Summit, to the acceleration of our efforts \ntowards poverty reduction, gender equality and \nenvironmental sustainability, the three MDGs where \nwe are lagging behind. We have committed ourselves \nto a multisectoral, participatory and people-centred \napproach to the implementation of the MDGs, to \nimproved governance as a foundation for successful \ndevelopment outcomes, and to better monitoring and \nevaluation of our work as we move forward. \n As we intensify our poverty reduction efforts at \nhome, we plan to focus more on issues of gender \nequality and the empowerment of women as a critical \npart of success. My Government is confident that the \nnewly created UN Women will be an important partner \nin this endeavour. This year, Mongolia presented its \nnational voluntary presentation on gender equality and \nthe empowerment of women to the Economic and \nSocial Council and will proceed to improve the \nlegislative framework enabling women to realize more \nfully their economical and political potential, have \nbetter access to health services for themselves and their \nchildren, and participate more visibly in democratic \ngovernance. \n Attending to the needs of the most vulnerable is \nat the core of the United Nations development agenda. \nAs a landlocked developing country, Mongolia, along \nwith other fellow Members, strives to advocate the \ninterests of that group of countries. Despite the \nprogress in implementing the priorities of the Almaty \nProgramme of Action, the landlocked developing \ncountries continue to be marginalized from \ninternational trade. They still experience higher costs \nof moving goods across borders, which puts their \nproducts at a competitive disadvantage and discourages \nforeign investment. \n With a view to maximizing our coordinated \nefforts for the full and effective implementation of the \nAlmaty Programme of Action and the MDGs through \nenhanced analytical capability and home-grown \nresearch on our specific needs, Mongolia initiated the \nestablishment of the International Think Tank for the \nLandlocked Developing Countries. I am delighted to \ninform Member States today that the multilateral \nagreement for that institution was endorsed by the \nministers for foreign affairs of the landlocked \ndeveloping countries last week at their ninth annual \nmeeting. I extend my Government\u2019s sincere \nappreciation to all stakeholders, including the \nSecretary-General, the Office of the High \nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, \nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \nDeveloping States, and our fellow members for their \nunwavering support. \n Climate change is another critical area for global \ngovernance. Building on progress achieved in \nCopenhagen in shaping a broad political consensus, it \nis imperative now to invigorate global negotiations \nunder the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change in the lead-up to the sixteenth session \nof the Conference of the Parties in Canc\u00fan later this \nyear. \n The impact of climate change on Mongolia is \nundeniable. In less than 20 years, more than 70 per \ncent of our territory has been affected by \ndesertification. Hundreds of rivers, springs and lakes \nhave dried up, causing water shortages and biodiversity \nloss. Yet, climate change adaptation and mitigation \ntechniques suitable for scaling up to meet the country\u2019s \nneeds have yet to be fully identified and introduced. \nThe strategies and programmes in place have failed to \nyield the desired results, and the emergence of mining \nas a major industry has only heightened concerns over \nthe environment. The sustainable management of \nnatural resources and addressing the country\u2019s \necological vulnerability will therefore need our \nsustained focus in the years ahead. Four issues \u2014 \nenforcement, dedication, financing and development \ncooperation \u2014 stand out as our priorities in addressing \nthese challenges. \n Last month, my Government held a special \nCabinet meeting in the sands of the Gobi Desert. \nDesertification is an issue of vital concern to more than \n1 billion people in over 100 countries. Continued land \ndegradation, be it from climate change or unsustainable \nagriculture, is a serious threat to the food security and, \nultimately, the human security of those affected. \nThrough the message sent from Gobi, my Government \nexpressed its firm resolve to effectively address \ndesertification within the framework of the United \n  \n \n10-55128 6 \n \nNations Decade for Deserts and the Fight Against \nDesertification. \n In 2010, we have seen renewed international \noptimism with regard to the multilateral disarmament \nagenda. This shift in climate was reinforced by the new \nSTART agreement and the outcome of the Nuclear \nSecurity Summit, both of which were welcomed by my \nGovernment and reflected in the outcome of the \nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The \nConference agreed on forward-looking action plans \nthat impart much-needed momentum to the vision of a \nworld free of nuclear weapons. Mongolia welcomes \nthis outcome and is proud of the contribution it made \ntowards nuclear disarmament and nuclear  \nnon-proliferation by declaring its territory to be \nnuclear-weapon-free. This status is fully recognized by \nthe international community, as attested by the final \ndocument of the NPT Review Conference. \n Mongolia welcomes the increasing role of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in \ncontributing to freedom from fear and freedom from \nwant. The achievement of the MDGs will depend to \nsome extent on the contribution of nuclear applications \nin such areas as nuclear energy, health care, and food \nand environmental security. Mongolia is expanding its \ncooperation with the Agency, especially in human \nresource development and nuclear applications in \nhealth and agriculture. Our 2009-2014 country \nprogramme framework, signed last year with the \nAgency, added the development of nuclear energy \ninfrastructure and the country\u2019s uranium reserves as \npriority areas of cooperation. \n This year, Mongolia has been designated one of \nthe eight Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy \nmodel demonstration site countries. This will help \nMongolia to most effectively address the increasing \ncancer epidemic and to share its experience with other \ndeveloping countries. I would like, therefore, to take \nthis opportunity to express my Government\u2019s gratitude \nto IAEA and its Director General for their valuable \nsupport. \n Mongolia welcomes the second review of the \nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, \nwhich, while emphasizing national implementation, \nstressed the importance of assisting Member States in \nthis task. Mongolia takes seriously its responsibility to \ncontribute to the global counter-terrorism endeavour \nand is party to all anti-terrorism instruments. Last May, \nwe hosted, together with the United Nations, a \nsubregional workshop on the implementation of \nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001). We firmly \nbelieve in the vital importance of furthering \ndevelopment, democracy and respect for human rights \nin fighting terrorism and in building States\u2019 capacities \nto combat it. \n Peacekeeping is an important tool for global \ngovernance in the hands of the United Nations. Since \nits inception, United Nations peacekeeping has \ncontributed to preventing and managing violent \nconflicts and supporting nations in protecting and \nbuilding peace in a post-conflict environment. Over the \npast decade, it has undertaken important reforms to \nmake peacekeeping stronger, more effective and \ncomparatively cost-efficient. Mongolia wishes to see \nmore coherent interaction between the peacekeeping \nand peacebuilding efforts of the United Nations. \n Over the past decade, Mongolia has taken \ndeliberate steps to enhance its participation in United \nNations peacekeeping missions. Mongolia now \nparticipates in six United Nations-mandated \npeacekeeping operations \u2014 including the most \nchallenging ones in the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo, Chad and Darfur \u2014 and stands ready to further \nexpand its participation. \n In the recent past, Mongolia has been an active \nparticipant in international activities aimed at \nstrengthening institutions and processes of democratic \ngovernance, protecting human rights and promoting \ndemocratic consolidation. The 1992 Constitution of \nMongolia guarantees the Mongolian people \nfundamental freedoms and human rights. Mongolia is \nparty to all major international human rights \ninstruments. An independent National Human Rights \nCommission was set up, and a national human rights \naction programme adopted in 2003 is being \nimplemented. The programme is a main policy \ndocument that aims at improving the capacity and \naccountability of the authorities; enhancing the \nparticipation of civil society, mass media and the \nprivate sector; and encouraging public motivation for \nstrengthening human rights protections and combating \nhuman rights violations. All in all, our efforts can be \nsummed up by affirming that political commitment to \nthe protection and promotion of human rights, along \nwith the setting of standards, is in place in Mongolia. \n \n \n7 10-55128 \n \n However, as has been rightly said, no human \nrights record is perfect. The implementation of human \nrights commitments in my country is hampered largely \nby two gaps, namely, a knowledge gap and a capacity \ngap. Furthermore, emerging transboundary threats, \nsuch as the spread of HIV and AIDS and other \ninfectious diseases, human trafficking, migration and \nothers, require an adequate collective response based \non effective regional and international cooperation. \nMongolia looks forward to constructive engagement \nwith the Human Rights Council as it prepares to \nconsider our national human rights report under the \nUniversal Periodic Review in early November this \nyear. \n Direct civic engagement is essential to any type \nof governance, at both the national and the \ninternational levels. My Government endeavours to \nactively engage civil society and communities in policy \ndevelopment and implementation. We have a \npartnership agreement with civil society and, through \nour open Government website, citizens relay their \nviews and comments to assist in drafting policy papers \nand laws prior to their consideration by the Cabinet. \n Over the past two months, I have travelled \nextensively across the country to see first hand the \ndevelopment challenges being faced in the countryside \nand to hear views at the grass-roots level. This kind of \ndirect interaction is essential to identifying people\u2019s \nimmediate and long-term needs alike and to reflecting \ntheir concerns in the Government\u2019s activities. Earlier \nthis year, through the Mongolia Economic Forum, we \nalso had an extensive discussion on economic and \ndevelopment issues with businesses, civil society and \nmedia to set our priorities for the years ahead. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n To have people employed, educated and healthy \u2014 \nin other words, human development \u2014 is at the heart \nof the policies and activities of my Government. \nTowards this end, my Government is pursuing policies \nto accelerate inclusive economic growth through wide-\nscale industrialization and by undertaking mega-projects \nin mining and infrastructure development. National \nwealth will be distributed to each and every citizen of \nMongolia through a newly established human \ndevelopment fund in the form of regular allowances, as \nwell as through health care, education and housing \nbenefits. \n Mongolia has the honour and privilege to assume \nthe chairmanship of the Community of Democracies \nnext year, and looks forward to a strong collaboration \nwith fellow members and other global stakeholders. In \nconclusion, may I reiterate Mongolia\u2019s strong \ncommitment to and support for the United Nations \u2014 a \nstrong, inclusive and open United Nations as the \nguarantor of global governance."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, \n On behalf of the Vietnamese Delegation, I wish to congratulate you on your \nelection as the President of this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am \nconfident that your experience will help bring this session to great success. \nViet Nam fully endorses the theme \u201cReaffirming the central role of the \nUnited Nations in global governance\u201d that you proposed for this debate. \n I would also like to take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation to \nMr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his significant contributions to the sixty-fourth \nsession. \n Mr. President, \n Our session coincides with the sixty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, \nthe world\u2019s largest multilateral organization established with a noble mandate of \ncoordinating actions of all nations towards peace, prosperity and justice. Over the \npast 65 years, the international community and the United Nations have recorded \nextraordinary achievements in a wide range of areas. \n Along with conceptual changes on sustainable development coupled with \nequitable distribution and enjoyment of fruits produced by growth, the lives of the \nmajority of humankind have been improved and better cared for in many aspects. \nThe process of globalization and the scientific-technological revolution have \nrendered national interests increasingly interdependent and intertwined. Linkages \nand exchanges among nations have expanded and deepened, thus further enriching \nthe material, cultural and spiritual values of mankind. \n Guided by the primary purposes enshrined in its Charter, which are to maintain \ninternational peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, promote \ncooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or \nhumanitarian character, and guarantee human rights, the United Nations has through \nits membership carried out its lofty mandates in a concrete manner. In this regard, \nwe treasure the outstanding contributions of the United Nations to the prevention of \na new world war, settlement of conflicts and civil wars in many countries, roll back \nof arms races and promotion of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, \nsubsequently contributing to the consolidation of international peace and security as \nwell as creation of such a peaceful and secure environment as it is now for \nhumankind to develop. \n Besides, we cannot help mentioning the considerable role played by the \nUnited Nations in accelerating the process of decolonization in the 1960s and 1970s, \nwhich helped liberate over 80 nations from the shackle of colonialism, win national \nindependence and become members of the United Nations. We can never obscure \nour memories of the four consecutive decades of development initiated by the \n A/65/397\n \n3 10-56315 \n \nUnited Nations since the 1960s to assist nations, especially the newly independent, \nin emerging autonomous and mastering their own processes of socio-economic \ndevelopment, improvement of health care and education, and protection of the \nenvironment. The United Nations has also made highly essential contributions to the \ndesign of an international legal system, with the Charter of the United Nations itself \nbeing the most important piece of legislation. \n While a new world war has been avoided, the world of today is still fraught \nwith untold paradoxes and challenges, and the sword of Damocles is still hanging \nover mankind. We all have witnessed many a war, local conflict, international \nterrorism, arms race, and proliferation of nuclear weapons. Confrontation, \nunilateralism, violation of national independence and sovereignty, and inequality in \ninternational relations, though somewhat abated, have persisted, and new dangers \nhave surfaced. Over 1 billion people are still living in destitute poverty, and \nhundreds of millions of others put under the scourge of climate change, food \ninsecurity, natural disasters, pandemics and terrorism. \n Mr. President, \n This situation requires our greater efforts and solidarity to achieve a world of \ngenuine peace, a better life, and a brighter future for all. \n The 65-year journey of the United Nations and mankind as a whole with all \ntheir successes and constraints has taught us a valuable lesson that the key to \nsuccess lies in each nation\u2019s own efforts, enhanced international cooperation and \npromoted multilateralism on the basis of respect for fundamental principles of \ninternational law and the Charter of the United Nations. \n In this spirit, Viet Nam holds that this session of the General Assembly under \nthe theme \u201cReaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance\u201d \nshould focus on the following issues: \n First, it is imperative to maintain a peaceful and secure environment to \nfacilitate nations\u2019 development. In this connection, the United Nations should \ncontinue promoting efforts for disarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear \nweapons given the new opportunities and prospects, while ensuring the rights of \nnations to use nuclear technologies and energy for peaceful purposes. As regards \ndifferences concerning nuclear proliferation risks, Viet Nam supports efforts aimed \nat solutions through dialogue and peaceful negotiation. \n At the same time, the United Nations should continue promoting measures for \nadequate settlement of civil wars and local conflicts ongoing in many regions of the \nworld, especially those in Africa as the continent suffering the most in the \ndevelopment process, as has been visibly evident at the newly concluded high-level \nmeeting on the Millennium Development Goals. \n Against such a backdrop, Viet Nam supports efforts for a fair, comprehensive \nand long-term solution to peace in the Middle East. Supporting the reconstruction \nand national reconciliation efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq, we hope that the people \nof Iraq and Afghanistan will soon enjoy security, independence and sovereignty for \ndevelopment. With regard to Kosovo, Viet Nam calls on the parties concerned to \nenhance dialogue in order to achieve a comprehensive solution based on Security \nCouncil resolution 1244 (1999). \nA/65/397  \n \n10-56315 4 \n \n Second, the international community and the United Nations should continue \nefforts to build equal international relations, and further improve the international \nsystem of law and institutions. Developing countries should be enabled to take part \nin the globalization and international integration process in a proactive and effective \nmanner. Developed countries, on their part, should fully deliver on their \ncommitments to development assistance, technology transfer and market access. It \nis important that the United Nations undertake measures to prevent unilateral use of \neconomic means against developing countries. In that context, Viet Nam once again \ncalls upon the United Nations to press ahead with the implementation of the General \nAssembly resolutions requesting the United States to immediately end its policy of \nembargo against the Republic of Cuba. \n Third, the United Nations, in order to adapt to a changing world, needs to \npromote reforms as a priority in its agenda. The reforms should be implemented in a \nprompt, comprehensive, balanced and transparent manner with a view to enhancing \nthe role of the General Assembly, enabling the Economic and Social Council to help \nthe United Nations maximize its role in the development sphere, and enlarging the \nSecurity Council membership and improving its working methods. Viet Nam hopes \nthat the negotiations on the United Nations reforms, particularly the reform of the \nSecurity Council and its membership enlargement, will soon produce fruitful results. \n Viet Nam also looks forward to more coherent, consistent and effective \ndevelopment activities of the United Nations so as to better respond to the demands, \npriorities and specific conditions of recipient countries. The operation of the Human \nRights Council and other United Nations human rights mechanisms should continue \nto be improved to avoid double standards and politicization. \n Mr. President, \n As actors with an increasingly important role in international affairs and \nhaving contributed to the work of the United Nations in many areas, regional \norganizations have proven effective in helping address many regional and global \nissues. I wish, in this connection, to mention in particular the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with its incessant growth and development as a \ndynamic and integrated cooperative organization of 10 countries in South-East Asia, \nwhich is striving for the goal of an ASEAN Community by 2015 that rests on three \npillars, i.e., the political-security community, the economy community, and the \nsociocultural community. \n In its cooperation with external partners, ASEAN has been effectively \nasserting its posture in an environment of peace, security and cooperation for \ndevelopment in the region and the world. The Association has served as the major \ndriving force for cooperation and integration in East Asia, especially in the \neconomic and trade fields. Moreover, ASEAN has been actively promoting the \ndevelopment and sharing of norms and codes of conduct among nations, including \nparticularly the Treaty on Amity and Cooperation, the Treaty on a Southeast Asia \nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone, the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South \nChina Sea, and the ASEAN Convention on Counter-Terrorism. \n As the Chair of ASEAN in 2010 under the theme \u201cToward an ASEAN \ncommunity: from vision to action\u201d, Viet Nam has been making every effort to \ncontribute to the success of the Association. Motivated by the policy of supporting \nand harnessing cooperation with the United Nations, we have been working closely \n A/65/397\n \n5 10-56315 \n \nwith relevant partners to ensure success for the upcoming ASEAN-United Nations \nsummit due to be held in October 2010 in Hanoi, thus uplifting the ASEAN-United \nNations cooperation to a new calibre. \n Mr. President, \n Alongside the birth of the United Nations, a new Viet Nam, the Democratic \nRepublic of Viet Nam, now the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, was founded. This \ncountry has since then surmounted uncountable harsh trials throughout its struggle \nfor national independence and freedom. Having mingled with the mainstream of \nhistory of mankind and the United Nations, the Vietnamese people\u2019s struggle for \nindependence, freedom and development has made remarkable contributions to the \ncommon success of mankind in an effort for a world of peace, justice and \ndevelopment. \n For the past thirty years as a United Nations Member, Viet Nam has joined \nhands with other Member States in working towards the adoption of many \nresolutions, decisions and concrete measures aimed at curbing the arms race, \npromoting comprehensive and full disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction, resolving international conflicts and disputes by peaceful \ndialogue, developing social, cultural and economic cooperation, and ensuring human \nrights. \n It is those commitments and determination that have led the multifaceted \ncooperation between Viet Nam and the United Nations to increased improvement \nand incessant development. In the past, the United Nations rendered valuable and \npractical assistance to Viet Nam in finance and expertise for the country\u2019s post-war \nreconstruction, helping Viet Nam particularly overcome the difficulties arisen \nduring the period of blockade and embargo. \n Today, the United Nations system and its organizations have been active in \nproviding policy advice and technical assistance to help Viet Nam address \ndevelopment challenges as the country steps up industrialization and modernization \nfor the goal of a strong country, a rich nation and an equitable, democratic and \nadvanced society. \n Viet Nam has been actively implementing the \u201cDelivering As One\u201d initiative \nin Viet Nam with a view to enhancing its national ownership capacity in \ndevelopment cooperation and contributing to the reform of the United Nations in \ngeneral and the United Nations development agencies in particular. Viet Nam has \nalways paid attention to promoting the tripartite cooperation between Viet Nam, a \nUnited Nations agency and an African country in such areas as agriculture, \nirrigation and infrastructure, and this has yielded initial encouraging outcomes. We \nhave recently organized the second Viet Nam-Africa International Forum in Hanoi, \nwhich drew keen interests and large participation from most African countries and \ninternational organizations. \n In the years ahead, building upon the past success of its foreign policy of \nopenness, diversification and multilateralization of external relations, Viet Nam will \nstep up its international integration and make further contribution to the work of the \nUnited Nations for the sake of peace, stability, equal relations among countries and \nan environment conducive to the development of all nations. \n \nA/65/397  \n \n10-56315 6 \n \n Mr. President, \n With the firm belief in and strong commitment to the work that requires the \njoint dedication of hearts and minds of the United Nations and its Members, I \nsincerely wish this session of the General Assembly every success, thus meeting the \ncommon cherished aspiration of the peoples for a world of peace and prosperity. \n Thank you very much for your kind attention.

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to convey to the Assembly the \nwarm and fraternal greetings of His Excellency \nMr. Pierre Nkurunziza, who has just been re-elected for \na second term of five years. He had planned to take \npart in these meetings himself, but the Unity \nInternational Foundation insisted on awarding him the \nRising Star of Africa prize for his role in building and \npromoting peace, and that led him to delegate attending \nthe High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and the general debate of the \nAssembly\u2019s sixty-fifth session to me. \n We wish to congratulate the President of the \nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session and to reiterate the \nthanks of the Burundi delegation to his predecessor for \nhis remarkable work. We also pay due tribute to our \nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \nfor his involvement in the follow-up to Assembly \nresolutions and for the important guidance that he \ncontinues to give our Organization. His visit to \nBurundi on 9 June 2010 is a clear sign of his \ncommitment to peacebuilding and to strengthening the \ndemocracy regained in our country at great cost. \n Burundi is participating in the sixty-fifth session \nfollowing the top-to-bottom renewal of national \ninstitutions. For the first time in Burundi\u2019s history, the \ndemocratically elected institutions have completed \ntheir term of office. That powerfully demonstrates the \npolitical maturity and resolve of the people of Burundi \nto break with the turbulent past in order to invest in the \npeace, stability and reconciliation that are prerequisites \nto sustainable development. \n We take this opportunity to reiterate the thanks of \nthe Government and people of Burundi for the role of \nthe international community, the United Nations, the \nEuropean Union, the African Union, the European \nParliament, the East African Community, the ACP-EU \nJoint Parliamentary Assembly, the Common Market for \nEastern and Southern Africa, the Economic \nCommunity of Central African States, friendly \ncountries and various organizations in participating in \nthe funding and observation of the aforementioned \nelections, which were peaceful, transparent and fair \nand in accordance with international standards. \n For its part, the party that won the elections is \naware of the absolute need to promote national \nreconciliation and political tolerance as much as it can. \nFrom the day after the first round of the election and \nthen in his inaugural speech, the President of the \nRepublic himself expressed his resolve and that of the \nwinning party to govern Burundi for and with all the \npeople of Burundi. Furthermore, Burundi\u2019s \nConstitution also provides for political inclusion \nmechanisms in managing the State\u2019s affairs. \n During the new Parliament, the Government of \nBurundi is committed to following its peacebuilding \nprogramme and strengthening security for all, in \nparticular by completing disarmament of the civilian \npopulation and the socio-economic reinsertion of \ndemobilized individuals and returnees. Furthermore, \nthe Government of Burundi will particularly emphasize \nregional cooperation and integration, as well as \nenhancing security in its geographical area, together \nwith neighbouring countries. \n Promoting good governance in its various \ndimensions is also one of the main concerns of \nBurundi\u2019s Government. With regard to political \ngovernance, it will continue to promote the rights of \npolitical parties, including by strengthening the spirit \nof dialogue between political partners. \n With respect to economic governance, there will \nbe efforts to improve business conditions to encourage \nboth national and foreign investment. The Government \nof Burundi reaffirms its determination and zero-\ntolerance commitment to combat financial corruption \nand fraud. \n In the area of the judiciary, every possible effort \nwill be made to combat impunity with respect to any \ntype of crime, and transitional justice will be promoted \nduring this Parliament. \n Concerning socio-economic development, the \nGovernment of Burundi will focus every effort possible \non combating poverty, in particular through \ndevelopment of priority production sectors, namely, \nagriculture and livestock, energy, social infrastructure, \ntourism, environmental renewal and new information \nand communication technologies. We will give special \nattention to developing public-private partnerships with \na view to sustained economic growth. \n In the social domain, the Government of Burundi \nwill concentrate on the education and health sectors to \ncombat ignorance and disease. To meet crucial needs in \nthose areas, many schools and clinics will be built \n  \n \n10-55109 10 \n \nthroughout the country. Furthermore, the services in \nthese two sectors will also be improved. \n Relaunching and promoting the Burundian \neconomy depends also on consolidating regional \ngroups and developing projects and programmes that \nintegrate common interests. In that framework, the \nGovernment of Burundi will play a larger role in the \npromotion of regional organizations of which it is a \nmember, such as the Economic Community of the \nGreat Lake Countries, the International Conference on \nthe Great Lakes Region, whose Executive Secretariat \nwe host, the East African Community, the Common \nMarket for Eastern and Southern Africa, and others. \nThat ambitious programme requires consistent support \nfor its implementation. Thus Burundi clearly requires \nvarious forms of support. \n To that end, we take the opportunity of this forum \nto make a strong appeal to the international \ncommunity, to the United Nations system and to the \ncountries represented here and to charitable \norganizations to continue their tireless support to the \nGovernment of Burundi with the ultimate aim of \nallowing it to lay the foundations for long-term \ndevelopment and for solidifying the achievements \nmade in terms of peace, democracy, stability and \nreconciliation. \n In the context of international relations and \nrelations between States, Burundi is convinced that the \nissue of global governance in general and economic \ngovernance in particular remains a major concern of \nmost of our countries. Thus promotion of equity must \nbecome the leitmotif and the warhorse of the \norganizations of which our respective States are full \nmembers. \n Burundi desires additional efforts to allow \ndeveloping countries sufficient representation in the \ninternational financial institutions such as the World \nBank, the International Monetary Fund and others. We \nbelieve that is the way to promote a fairer and more \ngeographically balanced world. \n Burundi is committed to the African Union\u2019s \nposition on Security Council reform, in particular that \nthe African continent should have two permanent seats \nwith all of the privileges held by the five permanent \nmembers. \n Today the entire world is confronting a number of \nchallenges and natural disasters, some of which are \nlinked to climate change. Developing countries in \ngeneral and African countries in particular are the most \nharshly affected, because of a lack of resources to deal \nwith such challenges. \n It is high time that countries agree to take more \naudacious measures in order to provide the financing \nnecessary to combat the negative effects of climate \nchange, by stimulating and promoting in particular \ntechnology transfer and without forgetting capacity-\nbuilding in the poorest and thus the most vulnerable \ncountries. By effectively combating the effects of \nclimate change, our countries will inevitably resolve in \npart the problem of food insecurity, which is also a \nsignificant threat to sustainable development. \n In that light, we call upon the wealthy countries \nto act in favour of developing countries, particularly \npost-conflict countries such as Burundi, through \nmultiple, ongoing and significant support to key social \nand economic sectors. It is urgent that all development \npartners respect the promises they have made to \ndeveloping countries in general and those countries in \nAfrica in particular by increasing official development \nassistance. \n Burundi \u2014 whose stability has benefited from the \nexcellent attention and considerable support of United \nNations entities, the international community and \nfriendly countries \u2014 remains very concerned by the \nissue of the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity. It reaffirms its commitment to cooperate with \nthe United Nations in consolidating the achievements \nmade with regard to peace and stability and in handling \nthe finances necessary for its socio-economic \ndevelopment. \n Furthermore, in terms of international solidarity, \nall countries must combine efforts to make this world a \nharbour of peace. For that reason, Burundi is taking an \nactive part in the United Nations Operation in C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire to bring peace to that country, the United \nNations Mission in the Central African Republic and \nChad, the African Union-United Nations Hybrid \nOperation in Darfur and the African Union Mission in \nSomalia (AMISOM). \n With respect to Somalia, Burundi is committed on \nthe ground despite the many problems its troops are \nencountering. We reiterate our request to the United \nNations with regard to improving the living and \nworking conditions of the AMISOM forces. We take \nthis opportunity to recall the promises made in that \n \n \n11 10-55109 \n \nregard by the Secretary-General when he visited \nBurundi on 9 June. We also call on other countries to \ndeploy additional troops so that AMISOM can become \na truly continental mission able to fulfil its mandate. \n In closing, Burundi welcomes the determination \nand commitment of the United Nations to make our \nworld one of peace, democracy, tolerance and \ndevelopment, where individual and collective rights \nand freedoms are clearly protected. Therefore, we \nencourage everyone to go forward towards that noble \nmission. Our wish is that the next session of the \nGeneral Assembly may take place in a context where \nmost of the conflicts currently threatening some \ncountries and the world as a whole will have been \nresolved."

        "file_text": "I \ncome to this rostrum on behalf of France to express my \nsincere and fervent faith in the United Nations. \nFrance\u2019s ambition is to be a major actor in building a \nsystem of global governance that is more just, more \ncohesive, more social, and a global order that is \norganized and regulated around a stronger, more \nrepresentative and more effective United Nations \u2014 a \nUnited Nations capable of meeting the great challenges \nof our century. \n I look out upon the Assembly. I know many of \nthose present here today. For 25 years now \u2014 even \nmore \u2014 I have been going up and down the corridors \nof the United Nations because I like the United \nNations, because I believe in the United Nations, and \nbecause I know it to be indispensable. \n I would like to speak to the Assembly candidly. I \nam going to talk about men and women, suffering and \nhope. I am going to talk about responsibility, because \nwe have responsibilities as citizens, diplomats and \npolitical leaders to meet these sufferings, hopes and \nexpectations. \n Of course, all of us would have an infinite \nnumber of reasons to present a litany of generous \nintentions, only to go home, our conscience clear, for \nwhat we had said a little while before to the Assembly \nand then go back to our day-to-day problems at home. \nOf course, after the terrible economic crisis from which \nwe have barely emerged, we have to live with reduced \nbudgets and tense socio-economic situations. The times \nare difficult and our fellow citizens are worried. The \ntemptation to retreat exists. Of course, to correct the \nlarge imbalances and injustices that undermine our \nsociety and to fight for the planet\u2019s security and \ndevelopment, we can always count on others. But \nwhich others? There are no \u201cothers\u201d. We are all here, \nthe nations of the world, represented in the General \nAssembly, and we only have to decide together to act. \n Not acting today would be to resign ourselves to \ndisorder, injustice and chaos. That choice will never be \nFrance\u2019s because it is not in keeping with our history, \nor our values, or our interests. Faced with disorder in \nthe world, the greatest risk today would be to lapse into \nroutine. Please do not tell me that we cannot move \nforward, that the situation is at an impasse. No, in the \npast, we have been able together, collectively, to be \nrevolutionary on fundamental subjects, even at the \nexpense of the national sovereignties which we all \nrepresent here. \n Recall our boldness here in 1988, General \nAssembly resolution 43/131, and then two years later, \nresolution 45/100, on humanitarian assistance to \nvictims of natural disasters and similar emergency \nsituations. These resolutions allowed us for the first \ntime to guarantee free access of humanitarian workers \nto the affected regions. Then there was Security \nCouncil 688 (1991) (5 April 1991) on the situation in \nKurdistan, where, for the first time, the door was \nopened to a military operation to protect civilian \npopulations against an oppressor State. \n These were two historic moments which laid the \nfirst markers of the right to intervene. This became the \nresponsibility to protect, which this Assembly adopted \nby consensus at the 2005 World Summit (see resolution \n60/1). Who could have imagined that such an upending \nof international law would be possible? The fight was \nlong and difficult; it is not over \u2014 far from it. To speak \ncandidly to the Assembly, the results are not \ncompletely what I had expected. But we must note that, \ntogether, we were able to overcome some obstacles \nwhich were supposed to be insurmountable. Let \nnothing stop us from taking up subjects which we \ndecide on together. \n Our first shared responsibility is development \u2014 \nto make sure that all men and women, including the \nmost impoverished, have decent living conditions. The \nwidening gap of inequalities is not only morally \nunacceptable, it is politically dangerous. Of course, it \nis costly to act, but the cost of inaction is even greater. \n The conclusions of the High-level Meeting on the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) that we just \nheld place our responsibilities squarely before us. This \n \n \n37 10-55122 \n \nis an urgent matter. We can no longer ask suffering \npopulations to continue to wait. \n The President of the French Republic, Nicolas \nSarkozy, reminded the Assembly of this fact, that France \nis the second largest global donor of official \ndevelopment assistance \u2014 \u20ac9 billion per annum \u2014 \ntargeted to education, health, food security, sanitation \nand infrastructure. France\u2019s commitment to development \nwill not slacken, but figures do not make a policy. Our \nassistance must be judged according to its results. We \nneed to go further and move faster for children dying of \nmalaria \u2014 one every 30 seconds \u2014 for entire families \nstricken by AIDS, and for all those who are hungry or \ncannot go to school. \n I ask the Assembly: what planet do we wish to \nleave as a legacy to our children? Will we be able to \nmake an ambitious decision to combat climate change \nand preserve our environment? This is a subject that \nconcerns us all and requires a global partnership, one \nwhere we aspire to find an agreement on both reducing \nemissions and measures to be taken in order to adapt. \nAnd we must, first and foremost, ensure that the \ncommitments undertaken will be implemented and that \nfollow-up mechanisms and effective institutions will be \nput in place. \n For all of this, we must find a great deal of \nmoney \u2014 several tens of billions of dollars per year \u2014 \nfor us and our planet. Let us provide the means to \nrealize our ambitions. The solutions are here, within \nreach; they have proved to be effective and await only \nour political will and our courage. They are called \ninnovative financing. The tax on airline tickets was a \nstep forward, a long time in coming. Today we should \ngo farther by adopting an international tax on financial \ntransactions which would permanently change matters \nfor development. It is an idea that I have been \ndefending for more than 20 years. It is a priority for \nFrance now. The President alluded to it here a few days \nago. \n Bear in mind that a minute tax of 0.005 per cent, \nthat is five cents on a transaction of \u20ac1,000, could raise \n\u20ac30 billion to \u20ac40 billion per year, almost one quarter \nof official development assistance. Who could deny \nthat this is a stable and predictable way of raising a \nmassive amount for development? Even with half of \nthat amount, it would be possible to send every child to \nschool in the low-income countries. Everyone agrees \ntoday that it is technically and economically feasible to \nestablish such a mechanism. \n And, make no mistake; we are not talking about \ndiminishing official development assistance or dodging \nour responsibilities. No, on the contrary, this amount \nwould come as an addition. And so we must not waste \ntime, we are together, this is what we established this \ninstitution for, this institution, unparalleled in history, \ncalled the United Nations. \n It is now a universally recognized principle that \ndevelopment cannot occur without peace and security, \nwhich are the basic raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the United Nations. \nHere, the challenges remain considerable. Afghanistan, \nSomalia, the Sudan, the Middle East \u2014 so many \nconflicts continue to feed chaos throughout the world. \n How many missed opportunities, how many \ndashed hopes, how many misunderstandings have for \nmore than 60 years \u2014 I repeat, 60 years \u2014 marked this \nprocess, peaceful in name only, in the Middle East? \nThe Arab-Israeli conflict concerns us all. I say Arab-\nIsraeli because, besides the Palestinian track, France \nconsiders it just as important to work on the Lebanese \nand Syrian tracks. Today we have before us a historic \nopportunity. We cannot let it slip. \n The process almost stopped yesterday evening. I \nam not sure that it will continue in an orderly way and \nwith unanimous support. I hope it will. We have \nlimited time remaining. Palestine, the new State \nMember of the United Nations which many of us have \nbeen calling for, will be, I hope, the best guarantee of \nsecurity for Israel. \n All States in the region have a critical role to \nplay. All of that is important, but what is necessary is \nthat the Israelis and Palestinians make a strategic \ndecision to put an end to this conflict in their own \ninterests. I would therefore call on the sense of \nresponsibility of President Abbas and Prime Minister \nNetanyahu; together they must make the painful \ncompromises on the road to peace. \n I have said that I have faith in the United Nations. \nI served the United Nations, as perhaps you know, in \nKosovo and in a number of other places. I know, \nrespect and deeply love the men and women who give \nlife to the United Nations. From this rostrum, I wish to \npay tribute with emotion, affection and respect, to all \nthose who, in serving the United Nations, take risks \nevery day for our shared ideal of peace and \n  \n \n10-55122 38 \n \ndevelopment. I think of all the friends we have lost \u2014 \nand the friends we may still lose \u2014 year after year, \nand, of course, of those who take their place. \n The fight is noble. Respect for the values and \nuniversal principles of human rights constitutes the \nindispensable foundation on which United Nations \naction must be built. The ambition to build a world \norder founded on universal respect for human dignity \nhas been and will always be at the heart of French \ndiplomacy. \n Have we collectively progressed in our service of \nthese values? Not enough. How long will we continue \nto accept \u2014 now that we live in a so-called \ninformation society, a world where people can know \nwhat is happening in other places \u2014 that, in terms of \nhuman rights, there are so many blind spots, so many \nforgotten tragedies and so much suffering that remain \nhidden? As I asked at the beginning, what has become \nof the responsibility to protect? \n Today the success of the United Nations must \nfirst of all be assessed in terms of its contribution to \nthe protection of civilians. That is the first area in \nwhich our requirements should be upheld. Every day \nmassacres and rapes are committed throughout the \nworld, in Somalia, in Darfur and in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, including in regions where \npeacekeeping operations are deployed. \n We can no longer simply count the victims when \nmass crimes are committed. Our courage must not be \nless than that of those who die from risks that we no \nlonger know how to take. \n France believes that the International Criminal \nCourt is one of the most important advances made in \nthe history of a humankind conscious of the dangers to \nwhich it is exposed by its own demons. France \nunderstands the criticism of those that believe that the \nCourt is too slow or that it goes too far. Let us be clear, \nFrance will always support the idea of international \ncriminal justice that is impartial and universal, for it is \nthe only way of fulfilling the imperative dictated by \nour history, namely, combating impunity. To all who \nare shocked by the boldness of some of the Court\u2019s \nprosecutions, I say that, on the contrary, it would be \nappalling if the victims were deprived of their right to \njustice. \n Human rights, the protection of civilians, \ninternational justice \u2014 these are not hollow concepts \nor empty principles for us. For France, they are first \nand foremost principles of action, and the only valid \ncriterion for judgement is the impact of our actions on \nthe actual situation. \n In Guinea, after the killings in the Conakry \nstadium, on 28 September 2009, we came together to \ndenounce the human rights violations and to assist the \nvictims of the atrocities committed. The Secretary-\nGeneral dispatched an International Commission of \nInquiry to the field one month after the fact, and I \nwould like to once again thank him sincerely for that. \nThe Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court \ninstituted proceedings. That pressure enabled Guinean \ncivil society in the field to make the difference. Today \nthe junta has been replaced by a transitional executive. \nNothing has been won. There will be a second round of \nelections in two weeks. But I wanted to recall this \nsuccess of the United Nations since at the beginning I \nsaid that the responsibility to protect was threatened. I \nthink we can all agree that there is a movement \nforming in civil society throughout the world and that \nwe can still take action."

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate \nthe President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \nsession on his election. As one of the Vice-Presidents \nat this session, we assure him of our full support and \ncooperation. I also take this opportunity to convey \nprofound gratitude and appreciation to my brother, Ali \nTreki, the outgoing President, for his able leadership \nduring the sixty-fourth session. Pakistan owes him \ngratitude for his timely initiative to convene a plenary \nmeeting of the Assembly on the humanitarian \nemergency arising from the floods in Pakistan (see \nA/64/PV.110). \n I come to the Assembly at a difficult time in \nPakistan\u2019s history. The recent flash floods \u2014 the worst \nin living memory \u2014 have left behind a trail of death \nand destruction. Precious lives have been lost, millions \nof acres of crops have been washed away, homes have \nbeen destroyed and livelihoods have been lost. We are \ngrateful to the United Nations, our development \npartners and other friends in the international \ncommunity for standing up with us in this difficult \nhour and for their important contribution in supporting \nrescue and relief operations in Pakistan. \n The Government remains focused in its resolve to \naddress the challenges posed by that humanitarian \ncrisis. We are determined to rebuild a better and vibrant \nPakistan and to do so in a transparent and accountable \nmanner. The resilience of our people should enable us \nto achieve that. \n We live in an ever more interconnected and \ninterdependent world, a world where our fate and \ndestinies are interwoven like never before, a world \nwhere it is increasingly difficult to maintain islands of \npeace and prosperity while conflicts, oppression and \nadversity fester. We live in a world where dividends of \npeace are shared as easily as the fallout of adversity or \ninstability. \n Today, we face an integrated onslaught of a series \nof new and emerging challenges that seriously threaten \neconomic growth and development, social cohesion \nand environmental protection in our countries. We \nclearly have reached a decisive moment. We will have \nto make wise and well-considered choices that bring \npeace and prosperity to our world at present while \nprotecting and preserving it for future generations. \n The response is simple: global problems require \nglobal solutions. The world needs a new multilateral \napproach that truly subscribes to the values and \nprinciples that we, the peoples of the United Nations, \nsigned on to 65 years ago. \n  \n \n10-55264 24 \n \n The United Nations Charter envisages a world \nwhere equity is valued as much as entitlement, where \ninclusiveness replaces exclusiveness, where dialogue \nand collaboration define engagement, where \ntransparency and openness guide business and \ndecision-making in global institutions. Full and \nunconditional adherence to those values and principles \nis what will put us on the road to durable peace and \nsecurity and sustained economic growth. As the primus \ninter pares, the United Nations is the only and truly \nuniversal multilateral Organization that enjoys the \ncredibility, legitimacy and universal acceptability to \nrealize that \u2014 which is also its raison d\u2019\u00eatre. \n Pakistan supports comprehensive reform of the \nSecurity Council to make it more representative, \nequitable, transparent and accountable. Council reform \nmust be guided by the principles of equality and \ndemocracy, which could conform to a dynamic future, \none not entrenched in the historical mistakes and \nindividual privileges of the past. We should look for an \noutcome that unites and does not divide the \nmembership, one that strengthens and does not weaken \nthe Organization. Our collective search should \nculminate in a consensus solution that corresponds to \nthe interest of the entire membership, particularly small \nand medium States, developing countries and Africa. \n Pakistan, as a leading troop-contributing country \nfor United Nations peacekeeping, is playing its due \nrole in the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity. Our peacekeepers have laid down their lives \nin missions that were operationally demanding and \ngeographically difficult. The unique status of the \nUnited Nations brings acceptance to its peacekeeping \nactivities, and the success of peacekeeping operations, \nin turn, brings credibility to the world body. For those \nsuffering in a conflict zone, the sight of a blue helmet \nprovides a beacon of hope, which has illuminated the \nlives of millions by bringing peace and alleviating their \npains and sorrows. \n Our commitment to the promotion of peace, \nsecurity and stability, the development of friendly \nrelations with other nations, respect for sovereignty \nand territorial integrity and the promotion of economic \nand social development is unwavering. It is that firm \nconviction that has enabled our democratic \nGovernment to remain steadfast in its resolve to fight \nterrorism and extremism, even as we have to deal with \nthe massive destruction caused by catastrophic floods. \nOur national consensus and resolve to fight extremism \nand terrorism remains unshaken. \n The world recognizes and applauds the important \nsuccesses achieved by our security forces against \nterrorists. Those successes have come at a heavy cost. \nMore than 20,000 innocent civilians have fallen victim \nto terrorism, and more than 2,500 personnel of the \nsecurity forces have offered the ultimate sacrifice. Our \nmaterial losses are nearly $50 billion. The Pakistani \nnation will persist in its efforts to eliminate terrorism. \n The issue has both regional and global \ndimensions. It is imperative that all countries do more \nto combat that menace. It is also essential to address \nthe root causes of terrorism, which are often found in \npoverty, deprivation, injustices and oppression. \nTerrorists recognize no borders; they have no religion \nand no creed. It is therefore absurd to malign a whole \npeople or a region or any religion on that account. We \ncannot accept the stereotyping of Muslims as terrorists. \nIslam is a religion of peace, compassion and \nbrotherhood. Terrorism is a complete antithesis to \nIslam\u2019s humanistic outlook and noble values. \n Pakistan supports the just cause of the Palestinian \npeople for restitution of their inalienable national \nrights, including their independent Palestinian State \nwith Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital. \n The brazen use of force against the humanitarian \nfreedom flotilla on 31 May 2010, which resulted in the \nkilling of humanitarian workers, was a flagrant \nviolation of international law and norms. We look \nforward to a prompt, impartial and transparent inquiry \nof the incident by the Secretary-General\u2019s Panel of \nInquiry. \n The dispute over Jammu and Kashmir is one of \nthe oldest on the agenda of the United Nations. It is \nabout the exercise of the right to self-determination by \nthe Kashmiri people through a free, fair and impartial \nplebiscite under United Nations auspices. \n Pakistan views the prevailing situation in Indian-\noccupied Kashmir with grave concern. Over the past \ntwo months, more than 100 Kashmiris have been killed \nby Indian security forces in Kashmir. We strongly \ncondemn that brutality. The human rights of the \nKashmiri people must be respected and their voices \nheard to create an enabling environment for a peaceful \nsolution to the long-standing Jammu and Kashmir \ndispute. Pakistan reaffirms its complete solidarity with \n \n \n25 10-55264 \n \nthe Kashmiri people and urges the international \ncommunity to persuade India to end its repression in \nKashmir. \n Pakistan is willing to engage India in a \ncomprehensive dialogue to normalize relations between \nthe two countries by finding amicable solutions to all \noutstanding issues, including the core dispute of \nJammu and Kashmir. A peaceful resolution of the \nKashmir dispute, in accordance with United Nations \nresolutions and taking into account the aspirations of \nthe Kashmiri people, would create an atmosphere \nconducive to durable peace and stability in the South \nAsian region. \n In the spirit of global solidarity and good-\nneighbourly relations, Pakistan has hosted the largest \nconcentration of refugees anywhere in the world for the \npast 30 years. We continue to host our Afghan brothers \nas a moral and humanitarian duty. No country has \nsuffered more than Pakistan from the direct and \nindirect consequences of decades of conflict in \nAfghanistan. We thus have an abiding stake in peace \nand stability in Afghanistan. Our commitment to that \nobjective remains firm. The time has come to transform \nAfghanistan from the centre stage of proxy wars, \ninterference and confrontation into a hub for \ninternational cooperation and development. \n Pakistan believes that the restoration of societal \nequilibrium in Afghanistan is an Afghan responsibility \nand cannot be imposed externally. We support all \nefforts for national reconciliation that are Afghan-\nowned and Afghan-led. We congratulate the \nGovernment of Afghanistan on holding successful \nparliamentary elections. They will strengthen President \nKarzai\u2019s initiation of national reconciliation and \nreintegration. \n Disarmament and non-proliferation are important \npillars of the international peace and security \narchitecture. We remain committed to both objectives \nand believe that they should be pursued in an equitable \nand non discriminatory manner. The asymmetric build-\nup of conventional weapons and the espousal of \naggressive doctrines have a negative impact on \nregional security. \n The pursuit of discriminatory policies and \ndisregard for the security interests of States seriously \nerode globally the moral authority that must underlie \nequitable approaches to promoting the goals of nuclear \ndisarmament and non proliferation. We have \nconsistently pursued a policy of conventional and \nnuclear restraint, along with conflict resolution in \nSouth Asia. We reaffirm our proposal for a strategic \nrestraint regime as an important way to promote the \ncause of peace, stability and security in our region. \n Pakistan, with the fifth largest population in the \nworld and only 0.4 per cent of the world\u2019s total \ngreenhouse-gas emissions, is one hundred and thirty-\nfifth on the global list of greenhouse-gas emitters. \nDespite such a low contribution, climate change is \ncausing irrevocable damage to Pakistan, with \ntremendous social, environmental and economic \nimpacts. While the world continues to discuss climate \nchange and its scientific basis and to seek a fair and \nequitable outcome of the ongoing negotiations under \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange (UNFCCC), climate change has already \nbecome a reality for 170 million Pakistanis. \n The present situation in Pakistan reconfirms our \nextreme vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate \nchange. It also complicates the post-flood \nreconstruction and rehabilitation scenario in Pakistan. \nIt is in Pakistan\u2019s interests to work vigorously and \ncreatively for an early and successful conclusion to the \nongoing climate-change negotiations under UNFCCC \nauspices. Any lasting solution will have to respect the \nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities \nand the respective capabilities of countries. \n With an active and empowered Parliament, a \nvigilant and well-informed civil society, free media and \nan independent judiciary, Pakistan\u2019s democratic \nGovernment is putting in place mechanisms to ensure \ngood and accountable governance at all levels in the \ncountry. The democratic Government, inspired by the \nvision of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto, attaches special \nattention to the promotion and protection of the human \nrights of all segments of society, particularly women, \nchildren and minorities. In May, Pakistan ratified the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \nand the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, \nInhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. \nPakistan is now a State party to all 27 human rights \nconventions. \n We welcome the creation of the new composite \ngender entity, UN Women. We hope it will lead the \nefforts to promote rights, empowerment and equality \nfor women throughout the world. \n  \n \n10-55264 26 \n \n Pursuing peace and forging close regional \neconomic partnerships is an important pillar of our \nstrategy to pursue economic growth and development \nin Pakistan. We are working through both the \nEconomic Cooperation Organization and the South \nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation to further \ndeepen regional collaboration and expand people-to-\npeople contacts, including through inter-parliamentary \ncooperation. \n Our strategy and actions at the national level stem \nfrom a firm belief that the primary responsibility and \ncentral action in our pursuit for economic growth and \ndevelopment is vested in our nation. Despite a \nchallenging economic and security environment, we \nare pursuing an aggressive reform programme. That \nagenda focuses on pro poor growth, boosting rural \neconomy and agriculture, affirmative action for women \nand minorities and expansion of social safety nets. We \nare conscious that that requires enhanced fiscal space, \nfor which we have introduced economic and tax \nreforms in close collaboration with international \ndevelopment partners. We have to work together to make this world a \nsafe and secure place for our children. We have to \nmake strenuous endeavours to achieve the ideals of the \nUnited Nations Charter. We have to make this world a \nprosperous place free from hunger, want and poverty. \nWe owe all this to our future generations. We cannot \nafford to fail in this endeavour."

        "file_text": "It is a great \nprivilege and signal honour for me to address the \n  \n \n10-55276 20 \n \nAssembly on behalf of the President of the Republic of \nMali, His Excellency Mr. Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9, \nwho, because of a very busy schedule resulting from \nthe celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of Mali\u2019s \nindependence, is unable to be here with us today. He \nhas expressly charged me with conveying to the \nAssembly his sincere greetings and his wishes for \nevery success for the work of this current session. \n At the outset I should like to convey to you, Sir, \nthe warmest congratulations of the delegation of Mali \non your election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session. Your election is a \ntribute to your eminent professional skills and is also \nan expression of the unanimous recognition given by \nthe international community to the commitment of your \ncountry, Switzerland, a friend of Mali, to the ideals of \nour Organization. I assure you of my delegation\u2019s \nconstant support in fulfilling your mandate. Allow me \nalso to express our deep appreciation to your \npredecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, for his deep \ncommitment and the remarkable manner in which he \nguided our work during the sixty-fourth session of the \nGeneral Assembly. In turn, I commend the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his constant efforts and \nhis commitment to meeting the aims and objectives of \nthis Organization. \n On 28 September 1960, only a few days after the \nproclamation of independence, my country, Mali, became \na Member of the United Nations. Today, on 28 September \n2010, 50 years later, I, speaking to you from this \nselfsame rostrum, would like to reaffirm with force and \nconviction the commitment of the Republic of Mali to \nthe promotion of the principles and purposes of the \nCharter, the establishment of friendly relations with all \nnations of the world and the promotion of international \ncooperation, and to contributing to the dawning of a \nworld of peace, justice and progress. \n Indeed, today a new Mali is on the rise. Under the \nleadership of President Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9, this \nnew Mali continues to progress towards the \ndevelopment and well-being of its people, each day \nfurther building upon the gains of peaceful democracy, \nrecognized worldwide as being exemplary, and further \nenhances its presence in Africa and on the international \nstage. Today, on 28 September 2010, I convey here and \nnow to the peoples of the world, to the Governments of \nfriendly countries, and to Mali\u2019s development partners, \nthe greetings and gratitude of my country and reaffirm \nthe solidarity and commitment of the Republic of Mali \nin our shared quest for a better world. This general debate has opened by setting out to \ntackle a timely subject, the reaffirmation of the central \nrole of the United Nations in global governance. In this \nregard, Mali reiterates from the outset its faith in the \ncapacity of the Organization to be a catalyst in the \nprocesses of global democratization and governance. In \nthat connection my country, Mali, continues to call for \na reform of the global economic and financial \narchitecture, the only way to prevent the occurrence of \neven worse crises. In the same vein, Mali believes that \njust and equitable representation of all regions of the \nworld must be guaranteed within our Organization, in \nparticular through Security Council reform. \n In that regard, Mali reaffirms its adherence to the \nEzulwini Consensus and to the Sirte Declaration, \nadopted by the heads of State and Government of the \nAfrican Union, and fully supports Africa\u2019s demand for \ntwo permanent seats and five non-permanent seats. A \nreformed Council would better reflect the geopolitical \nrealities of the world today, thus contributing towards \nrepairing the historical injustices towards Africa, the \nonly region of the world not to have a permanent seat on \nthe Security Council. In the same spirit Mali, together \nwith all other Member States, will strive to reinforce \nthe effectiveness of the role of the Council and to \npromote the revitalization of the General Assembly. \n With only five years now to the 2015 deadline set \nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals and in \nspite of the tireless efforts made by many developing \ncountries, millions of people worldwide are still \nwaiting for the Millennium Declaration to take \nconcrete effect. The High-level Plenary Meeting on the \nMillennium Development Goals, which has just \nconcluded, would have been a useful opportunity for \nheads of States and Government to evaluate the \nprogress made in various areas, draw lessons from the \nbest practices and define approaches towards meeting \nthe Millennium Development Goals by 2015. For its \npart, the Republic of Mali is resolutely committed to \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals in a \nsustainable manner through the adoption of a 10-year \nplan for the years 2006-2015, and through the \nimplementation of a strategic framework for growth \nand poverty reduction and a project for economic and \n \n \n21 10-55276 \n \nsocial development, all of which focus in particular on \nagriculture and food security, education and health. \n From this rostrum I invite the international \ncommunity to continue to support our efforts in \nimplementing this range of economic and social \ndevelopment policies in Mali, as we are encouraged by \nthe results achieved in previous strategies. Indeed, the \nimplementation of such strategies has made it possible \nto increase the schooling rate from 64 per cent in 2002 \nto 80 per cent in 2008. Mortality for children under the \nage of 5 has fallen from 229 per thousand in 2001 to \n191 per thousand in 2006, while HIV/AIDS prevalence \nhas fallen from 1.7 per cent in 2001 to 1.3 per cent in \n2006. Thus, Mali deems it essential to expedite the \nimplementation of the commitments made at key \ninternational conferences, particularly the Monterrey \nInternational Conference on Financing for Development, \nthe Brussels Conference on the Least Developed \nCountries, the Barbados Global Conference on the \nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \nStates and the Almaty Conference on landlocked \ndeveloping States. \n Undoubtedly climate change poses one of the \ngreatest challenges currently facing the international \ncommunity. Today more than ever, the survival of our \nplanet is threatened by natural disasters caused by this \nphenomenon, which seriously affects the living \nconditions in developing countries such as my own \nthrough \u2014 in our case \u2014 the encroachment of the \ndesert, the silting up of the Niger river, the \ndeterioration of our ecosystem, the shortening of the \nwinter season and poor rainfall distribution. That is \nwhy Mali will spare no effort to make its modest \ncontribution towards finding a global and binding \nagreement on climate change. To that end, in \nNovember 2010 my country will host a regional forum \non sustainable development. \n The AIDS pandemic continues to hamper \ndevelopment efforts in many countries and thus poses \none of the greatest threats to the survival of humanity \nand global security. In keeping with the Abuja \nDeclaration on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Other \nRelated Infectious Diseases, the Brazzaville \nCommitment for universal access to treatment in Africa \nand the Lom\u00e9 Declaration on HIV/AIDS in Africa, \nMali has launched a vast programme of multisectoral \nreform, both at the institutional and operational levels. \nThat programme compels all the sectors, in particular \nthe public, private and civil society sectors, to become \nbetter organized in order to better coordinate their \nactivities to combat AIDS effectively and be held \naccountable to the nation. \n The new transnational threats of trafficking in \ndrugs, arms, human beings and terrorism seriously \njeopardize international peace and security. The \ninternational community must resolutely tackle those \nthreats. That means acting quickly and effectively. As I \nunderscored in the General Assembly during the \nsecond review of the United Nations global counter-\nterrorism strategy on 8 September 2010, Mali has \nadopted a new strategy to combat the lack of security \nand terrorism. On the one hand, this new strategy seeks \nto strengthen national capacities through robust actions \nin the field of security and community development \nand on the other hand it seeks to promote effective \nregional cooperation with the unified commitment of \nStates of the Sahelo-Saharan region and with the \nsupport of the international community. Building on \nthis same impetus, the President of the Republic of \nMali, His Excellency Mr. Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9, has \ntaken the initiative of organizing a conference in Mali on \npeace, security and development in the Sahelo-Saharan \nregion. \n The maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity has been and will remain one of the most \npressing concerns of the international community. \nWithout peace there is no development or prosperity, \nnor will there be, and that is why Mali remains firmly \nattached to the ideals of peace and stability, both within \nand beyond its borders. In this regard, we welcome the \nprogress made in national reconstruction and \nreconciliation, in peacebuilding and in the process of \ndemocratic transition, in particular in Guinea-Bissau, \nthe Republic of Guinea, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.  \n In the Middle East, we reaffirm our solidarity \nwith our brother Palestinian people in their courageous \nstruggle for the creation of an independent and \nsovereign State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, \nand we have closely followed the evolving situation in \nthat part of the world and continue to support the \nrelevant resolutions of the United Nations in this area. \n To conclude, I should like to reiterate our \nsolidarity with the brotherly people of Haiti, as they \nseek to rebuild their country, and to express our deep \nsympathy to the victims of the natural disasters that \nhave afflicted China, India, Pakistan, Russia and other \n  \n \n10-55276 22 \n \ncountries, in particular in Africa. Millions of people \nworldwide continue to place their hopes in the United \nNations, and, as the community of nations, we do not \nhave the right to let them down. It is our obligation to \nguarantee sustainable development for future generations \nand to preserve them from the scourge of war."

        "file_text": "At the outset, \non behalf of the Republic of the Niger, I would like to \nextend to Mr. Joseph Deiss my sincere congratulations \non his outstanding election as the President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. His \ncountry, the Swiss Confederation, is known for its long \ntradition in the area of international relations, and his \nown career reveals proven skill and a wealth of \npersonal experience. Because of that, we believe that \nunder his leadership the work of this session will be \ncrowned with success. I can assure him of the full \nsupport and complete cooperation of my delegation in \ncarrying out his noble and lofty mission. \n To his predecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, \nrepresentative of the great Socialist People\u2019s Libyan \nArab Jamahiriya, I would like to pay particular and \nfully merited tribute to him for the exemplary way and \nthe talent with which he led the work at the Assembly\u2019s \nlast session. \n Finally, with consideration and admiration, I \ncommend the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, a \npromoter of peace, for his tireless investment in the \nsearch for the most appropriate solutions to the many \nchallenges that assail the world today and cry out daily \nto the individual and collective consciences of its \nleaders. The particular attention he gives to the \nsituation of the most vulnerable countries, his constant \nadvocacy for achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals and his recent journey to Africa deserve to be \ncommended. \n The world will recall that on 18 February 2010, \nin the face of an anti-constitutional drift imposed on \ndemocratic and republican institutions of my country \nby the Government in place, and the grave and certain \nrisk of the disintegration of national cohesiveness, the \ndefence and security forces of the Niger were obligated \nto intervene on the political scene. \n This was not the intervention of an army hungry \nfor power, but that of officers who were concerned \nwith safeguarding the unity and integrity of their \ncountry, which had been endangered by the Head of \nState at the time, who, through sheer self-interest, had \ndecided to ignore, by undertaking a civilian coup \nd\u2019\u00e9tat, all of the laws of the Republic, beginning with \nthe Constitution itself, which was replaced with \nanother that would have generously extended the \npresidential mandate for three years, which was to have \nended on 22 December 2009. It was therefore for good \nreason that our arrival was welcomed by national and \ninternational opinion. \n Having headed the country since 18 February \n2010, the Supreme Council for the Restoration of \nDemocracy, over which we have the great honour to \npreside, immediately set itself the primary goal of \ntaking all decisions necessary to bringing peace to the \nsocio-political life of the country. It was precisely to \nthat end that it drew up its programme for governing \non the basis of three pillars: the restoration of \ndemocracy; cleaning up the country\u2019s political and \neconomic situation by fighting against impunity, \n  \n \n10-54833 44 \n \ncorruption and bribery; and the reconciliation of the \npeople of the Niger. \n With a view to restoring a normal constitutional \nregime, the National Independent Electoral Commission, \nwhich was created to that end, drew up and proposed a \nschedule for general elections and a draft budget for \norganizing seven planned elections to the Government \nand the Supreme Council for the Restoration of \nDemocracy, which accepted them after slight \nmodifications. According to that timetable, the electoral \nprocess will take place from 31 October 2010 to 6 April \n2011 and will include a constitutional referendum as well \nas local, legislative and presidential elections. \n I am pleased to recall here that, by an ordinance \nof 11 March 2010, we decided to make ineligible \nmembers of the defence and security forces, as well as \nmembers of the transitional Government. I should \ntherefore like to take this opportunity to make an \nurgent appeal to the international community to \ncontinue to assist the Niger and its National \nIndependent Electoral Commission in the organization \nof the programme of elections that I have just \nelaborated. This assistance is crucial if we are to \nachieve within the established time frame the core goal \nof the Supreme Council and the transitional \nGovernment of restoring constitutional order in the \nNiger, following the outcome of the electoral process. \n Moreover, with a view to guaranteeing free, fair, \ntransparent and credible elections, the Supreme \nCouncil for the Restoration of Democracy and the \nGovernment of the Niger, solemnly request through me \nthe participation of the United Nations and all \ninterested international institutions in observing the \nvarious elections. \n I was determined to make this trip to New York, \ndespite the many urgent needs and constraints \nassociated with the transitional agenda under way in \nthe Niger, to solemnly reaffirm before this august and \nhonourable Assembly that the commitments we made \nfollowing the events of 18 February 2010 are now at a \nvery advanced stage of implementation and that, God \nwilling, they will be upheld within the established time \nframe and with international support. In this respect, I \nnote and welcome the fact that, in the report he \nrepresented to the Security Council on 13 July 2010 \n(S/2010/324), the Special Representative of the \nSecretary-General for West Africa stressed that the \ntransitional authorities in the Niger have fully \nrespected their commitments. \n In accordance with the second commitment made \nby the Supreme Council for the Restoration of \nDemocracy, on 11 May 2010 we established a \ncommission to combat economic, financial and fiscal \ncrime and to promote good governance, which is \ncurrently implementing a programme to restore the rule \nof law in the Niger. In parallel, a high authority for \nreconciliation and consolidation of democracy has been \ncreated. This new institution is working with all the \nnecessary care to achieve the third goal, which is to \nconsolidate our national unity. \n Finally, at the international level, since \n18 February we have clearly reaffirmed the Niger\u2019s \ncommitment to the universal values of peace, security, \ngood-neighbourliness, human rights, the rule of law, \ndemocracy, international solidarity, strict compliance \nwith the Charter of the United Nations, the Charter of \nthe African Union, the statutes of the Economic \nCommunity of West African States and all other \nrelevant international legal instruments. \n Poor economic and financial governance and the \npolitical and institutional crisis were, unfortunately, not \nthe only threats facing the Niger. Sadly, there was \nanother scourge that was even more dangerous and \ncalled for urgent countermeasures, but whose existence \nwas long concealed by the authorities of the time. I \nrefer to the very serious situation of food insecurity in \nwhich my country finds itself. \n On 10 March, an urgent appeal was made to the \nentire national and international community for major \nsupport to be given to our country in its efforts to \naddress this disaster. With the prompt and concrete \nsupport of the Niger\u2019s development partners and \nthrough the national mechanism for the prevention and \nmanagement of food crises, action to mitigate the crisis \nhas been diligently undertaken. Of particular note \namong these efforts are the cash-for-work operations, \nthe sale of reasonably priced grain, the free distribution \nof food, seed and livestock feed assistance, and care \nfor malnourished children. \n I take this opportunity to convey to all our \ngenerous donors the profound gratitude of the people \nof the Niger, the Supreme Council and the transitional \nGovernment for that commendable and unforgettable \nshow of solidarity. We hope to see it continue so that \nwe can address the emerging situation resulting from \n \n \n45 10-54833 \n \nfloods wreaking havoc in several regions of our \ncountry. We are also pleased to see that food security is \nhigh on the list of issues on which the General \nAssembly will focus during its current session and \namong the priorities set for the Organization in 2010 \nby the Secretary-General. \n At this stage, I welcome the initiative of Under-\nSecretary-General John Holmes to come to the Niger \nand visit isolated rural areas in order to see for himself \nthe desperate situation into which the people and their \nlivestock have been plunged. During his visit, he was \nable to assess the scale of the crisis and its impact on \npeople \u2014 in particular on children \u2014 and livestock. \nThe appeal he made to the international community, \nadvocating the mobilization of $130 million to provide \nurgent assistance to the populations affected, remains \nhighly urgent. We know, however, that we can count on \nthe understanding and ongoing concern of our \ndevelopment partners, which have already been \nreflected in the gradual resumption of their cooperation \nwith the Niger. \n It is obvious that my country has serious \nsocio-economic problems, but the people of the Niger \nare determined to overcome them with the support of \nthe international community. My country is young. It \nhas just celebrated its fiftieth year of independence \nwithout fanfare because of the food crisis. Its people \nare young, but they are also dynamic and resolved to \nbegin their march on the path to development. \n This sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly \nis taking place in an international context of strong \ncontrasts. Indeed, while tangible progress continues to \nbe made daily in many areas of concern, we face many \nnumerous and varied challenges in many other areas. \n In Africa, positive developments have been \nrecorded. I welcome the holding of free, transparent and \nfair elections, in particular in the Sudan and Burundi. I \nwelcome the decision of the authorities of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire \nto organize presidential elections very soon. It is my hope \nthat the electoral process under way will be a success. \nIndeed, that is the only way that C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire will restore \nthe stability and calm that will allow it to fully play its \nrole as a driving force in West Africa. \n Finally, I note that the peace and security \narchitecture of our continental organization is being \nstrengthened with the support of our partners, such as \nthe European Union and the United Nations, in \nparticular with imminent operationalization of the \nAfrican peace force and the early warning mechanism. \nIt is my ardent hope that significant progress shall soon \nbe made on the political front in other friendly \ncountries, such as the Central African Republic, the \nComoros, Somalia and Madagascar, in the Great Lakes \nregion and Darfur. \n In the Middle East, the launch of direct bilateral \nnegotiations should, we hope, lead to comprehensive \npeace based on the two-State solution, with an \nindependent and viable Palestine living side by side in \npeace and security with Israel and other neighbouring \ncountries. From this rostrum, I wish full success to the \ndirect negotiation process among officials of those two \ncountries, sponsored by President Barack Obama of the \nUnited States of America. \n Other threats to international peace and security \ncontinue to confront us on a daily basis. I refer above \nall to terrorism, drug trafficking and the proliferation \nof small arms and light weapons. West Africa \u2014 and in \nparticular the Sahelo-Saharan region, of which the \nNiger is an integral part \u2014 is currently suffering the \nbitter nexus of terrorism and trafficking of all types. In \nspite of the efforts made, it must be recognized that \nnational and regional authorities continue to have \ndifficulty neutralizing these armed groups. The \nabduction last week of foreign nationals in northern \nNiger reminds us of the gravity of the situation and of \nthe urgent need for the measures necessary to deal \neffectively with this threat to peace, security and \ndevelopment in our country. \n Indeed, with each passing day, terrorism grows in \nscale in our subregion and threatens to tarnish the \nimage of the Sahel countries, compromise tourist \nrevenues and exacerbate our people\u2019s poverty and \ninsecurity. We all know that poverty and desolation are \nfertile grounds for terrorists. We must therefore \nrecognize the urgent need to promptly strengthen \ninternational cooperation and economic and social \ndevelopment programmes in these areas in order to \neradicate these scourges. The response to all these evils \nmust be coordinated. That is why the countries \nconcerned created a mechanism to coordinate counter-\nterrorism activities following a ministerial meeting \nheld in Algiers on 16 March. With respect to drug \ntrafficking, the Economic Community of West African \nStates has adopted a plan of action to combat it, and \nurgently appeals to the international community to \nassist in its implementation. \n  \n \n10-54833 46 \n \n It has been widely understood since the 2005 \nWorld Summit that peace, security, development and \nhuman rights are interdependent and mutually \nreinforcing. In other words, peace, security and human \nrights cannot be effective in a context of \nunderdevelopment and poverty. It is clear that the \nSecretary-General fully shares this view because he has \nmade sustainable development one of his highest \npriorities throughout 2010 through the achievement of \ninternationally agreed development goals. In this \nrespect, the High-level Plenary Meeting on the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), held from 20 \nto 22 September, was a real opportunity for the \ninternational community to address many subjects of \nmajor concern more thoroughly. \n As the participants in the High-level Meeting \nfirmly highlighted and I would note, there is a clear \nlink between the availability of resources and the \nachievement of the MDGs. From my point of view, the \nachievement of the MDGs remains possible for the \nNiger, as I emphasized at the Meeting, but only to the \nextent that substantial financial resources are made \navailable, in particular through an expanded and \nenhanced partnership with the international \ncommunity. That is why I appeal for the mobilization \nof the resources necessary through compliance with \ncommitments made in the Millennium Declaration \n(resolution 55/2), the Monterrey Consensus \n(A/CONF.198/11), and in the Outcome Document of \nthe Doha International Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment (A/CONF.212/L.1/Rev.1*). \n The terrible earthquake that struck Haiti with \nsuch force on 12 January; the deadly floods that \ncontinue to affect Pakistan, India and the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China; the terrible droughts and floods in \nthe Sahel; and the heatwave in Russia have all made us \naware of our collective vulnerability to natural \ndisasters and their underlying causes, such as \nenvironmental degradation and climate change. \n In this respect, as highlighted by the participants \nat the 20 September high-level meeting on the \nInternational Year of Biodiversity, the protection of the \nenvironment should be everyone\u2019s priority. It is \nnecessary to follow up on the voluntary commitments \nmade in the Copenhagen Declaration, in particular with \nrespect to financing adaptation and mitigation \nmeasures. \n With respect to United Nations reform, it is \nencouraging to note the significant progress made in \nthe empowerment of women, governance and financing \nactivities to operationalize development. Let us not \nforget that, on 30 June, the General Assembly \nestablished the composite Entity for Gender Equality \nand the Empowerment of Women, which, as of \n1 January 2011, will be responsible for addressing \ngender issues in place of the four institutions that have \nhitherto worked to promote gender equality and the \nempowerment of women. This is an important act \nwhich we dare to hope will lead Member States to \nadvance in other sectors of United Nations reform, in \nparticular reform of the Security Council. \n I am convinced that this will strengthen the \nOrganization\u2019s legitimacy and capacity for action in the \nservice of international peace and security. Indeed, if it \nis to be up to this immense and delicate task, the \nUnited Nations must be just, representative and \ndemocratic."

        "file_text": "I congratulate you, \nMr. President, on your election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session, and I thank \nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali Treki, for his \nexcellent stewardship of the Assembly at its sixty-\nfourth session. I seize this opportunity to convey to you \nthe warm greetings of the Honourable \nDr. Navinchandra Ramgoolam, Prime Minister of \nMauritius. \n We are meeting this year against the backdrop of \nthe triple blow of food, fuel and financial crises, which \nhave significantly slowed the social and economic \nprogress of many, particularly developing, countries. \nAlthough we are now witnessing signs of gradual \nrecovery, we are nonetheless aware of the fact that the \nworld is still mired in the consequences of the \nrecession. \n These crises have exposed the deficiencies of the \ninternational financial and governance structure and \nmade us realize that the pre crisis status quo has to be \nchallenged, if we are to ensure a better future for our \npeople. While we acknowledge the pre eminent role \nthat the Group of 20 is playing in addressing the \nfinancial and economic crisis, the widening and \nacceleration of global integration and \ninterconnectedness dictate the necessity of \ndemocratizing the international economic and financial \ndecision-making processes in order to ensure that the \nfuture development of our global economy is balanced \nand equitable. \n It was therefore reassuring to hear the Managing \nDirector of the International Monetary Fund, \nMr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, stating last Monday, \n \u201cTo regain momentum, we need a sense of shared \nresponsibility among the various actors \u2014 the \ndeveloping countries themselves, the advanced \n \n \n29 10-55264 \n \neconomies and, in part, the international financial \ninstitutions.\u201d (A/65/PV.3) \n The statistics are eloquent regarding the negative \nimpact of the multitude of crises on the progress \nachieved on the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). As global economic output has declined, the \nranks of the poor have swelled with the newly poor. \n A week ago, from this very rostrum, an \nimpressive number of world leaders reaffirmed their \ncommitments to the Millennium Development Goals. \nIn our drive to enable the less fortunate to lead a \ndignified life, it is imperative that we have closer \ncooperation and collaboration between Government, \ncivil society and the private sector, supplemented by \ninnovative thinking, cutting-edge knowledge and path-\nbreaking initiatives. \n Success in achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals is inextricably linked to the \nbroader agenda of climate change. The effects of \nclimate change and global warming threaten the very \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals. \nWhile climate change is affecting all countries, it is \nabundantly clear that the small islands and low-lying \nand coastal States are the most affected by its \nconsequences. \n We therefore urge that the small island \ndeveloping States be given simplified access to \nfinancing from the $30 billion of fast-start funding \npledged in the Copenhagen Accord and similar access \nto the longer-term funds proposed for the Copenhagen \nGreen Climate Fund. That adaptation funding should \nbe in the form of grants and not loans. \n We hope that the forthcoming Conference of the \nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change, to be held in Canc\u00fan later this \nyear, will build on the 2009 Copenhagen Accord to \nultimately arrive at a legally binding agreement on \nlimits to greenhouse gas emissions based on the \nprinciple of common but differentiated capabilities and \nresponsibilities and the establishment of mitigation and \nadaptation funds. Let us therefore join our efforts and \nnot miss the opportunity, because a world that is \nclimate-smart is within reach, if we act now, act \ntogether and act differently. \n In its effort to contribute towards the global \nmomentum to attain a low-carbon future, Mauritius is \nimplementing the Maurice Ile Durable project, which \naims at protecting the environment and minimizing \ndependence on fossil fuels through increased \nutilization of renewable energy and a more efficient \nuse of energy in general. \n The High-level Review Meeting on the \nimplementation of the Mauritius Strategy for the \nFurther Implementation of the Programme of Action \nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island \nDeveloping States re emphasized the fact that, owing \nto their inherent specificity, small island developing \nStates should be recognized as a distinct category of \ncountries and should be granted special treatment, \nparticularly in accessing official development \nassistance and concessionary funding. The present \ngross domestic product criterion applied in graduating \nleast developed countries to middle-income status is \nmost unfair to small island developing States, since it \ndoes not take into account the unique vulnerabilities of \nthose States. \n The time has come for a shift in how we think of \ndevelopment. We need to articulate strongly a new \ndevelopment paradigm, one where developing \ncountries are part and parcel of the solution to create a \nmore vibrant world economy in this truly multipolar \nworld. \n We therefore look forward to the successful \nconclusion of the Doha Development Round at the \nearliest possible date. It is also crucial to close the gaps \nin the provision of Aid for Trade so as to support the \nbuilding of supply capacity, which lies at the core of \ndevelopment. \n At the subregional level, Mauritius, in its \ncapacity as the new chair of the Indian Ocean \nCommission, will continue to lay greater emphasis on \nthe creation of an economic and commercial space, the \nimplementation of a regional strategy on fisheries and \naquaculture, the promotion of tourism in our region in \ntraditional and emerging markets, and the development \nof a comprehensive regional anti-piracy programme. \n A fundamental precondition for socio economic \ndevelopment can be found in a process of social \ninclusiveness, with human rights at its core. As a \nmember of the United Nations Human Rights Council, \nMauritius is firmly committed to the safeguarding and \nprotection of human rights, at both the national and the \ninternational levels. In this regard, we unreservedly \ncondemn the serious human rights violations \ncommitted by warring factions in conflict zones, where \n  \n \n10-55264 30 \n \nvulnerable members of the society, particularly women \nand children, are being targeted. At the national level, a \ntruth and reconciliation commission has started the \nchallenging task of compiling a report on slavery and \nindentured labour in Mauritius during the colonial \nperiod. \n Mauritius continues to be preoccupied with the \nfate of pro democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose \nheroic and unbreakable determination and \nsteadfastness to free her people from years of \nsubjugation compel all of us who are strong advocates \nof democratic values to stand and speak up. Depriving \nMs. Aung San Suu Kyi of the right to stand as a \ncandidate in the forthcoming general elections \nscheduled in November this year is considered by my \ndelegation as the deprivation of the basic rights of the \npeople of Myanmar to freely choose the leaders to \nwhom they wish to entrust the destiny of their country. \n Democracy and the rule of law are essential \nelements for the development, stability, security and \nprosperity of any country. The world has made \nsignificant strides in this respect. Nonetheless, it is \nregrettable that conflicts in certain parts of the world \ncontinue to undermine progress. The imperatives of a \nglobalizing world require the international community \nto remain seized of these issues and not to shirk its \nresponsibilities. \n In the Indian Ocean region, Mauritius is \nparticularly concerned with the current political \nimpasse prevailing in our neighbouring sisterly \ncountry \u2014 Madagascar. We are actively engaged in the \nSouthern African Development Community (SADC), \nthe African Union (AU) and the Indian Ocean \nCommission, working to assist Madagascar to find a \npeaceful solution to the political crisis. \n In this regard, we wish to state that we are \nsupportive of the initiative led by the Coordination \nNational des Organisations de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Civile to \norganize an inter Malagasy dialogue in order to find a \nsolution designed by all Malagasies to the crisis in \nMadagascar. And we sincerely hope that the dialogue \nwill be credible, transparent and include all sections of \nMalagasy society in the search for durable peace in the \ninterest of both the country and the region. Mauritius \nhas offered its assistance in setting up an SADC liaison \noffice in Madagascar in order to provide support in \nmoving the Malagasy-Malagasy dialogue. \n Two decades of civil unrest have inflicted untold \nmiseries and difficulties on the Somali people and \nrendered governance of the country almost impossible. \nWe commend the Intergovernmental Authority on \nDevelopment for its efforts to promote peace and \nsecurity in Somalia through the Transitional Federal \nGovernment. We believe that the people of Somalia \ndeserve greater commitment from the international \ncommunity towards restoring law and order inside the \ncountry and also towards putting an end to the piracy \nproblem off the coast of Somalia. \n In order to promote a more proactive engagement \nof the countries of the region in the fight against \npiracy, Mauritius will host the Second Regional \nMinisterial Conference on Piracy on 6 and 7 October, \nin collaboration with the European Union, the Indian \nOcean Commission and the Common Market for \nEastern and Southern Africa. Mauritius is also \nenvisaging the possibility of trying piracy suspects \ncaught in the Indian Ocean in its courts, if the \nlogistical, infrastructural and financial support of the \ninternational community is adequate. \n The current process for talks between Israelis and \nPalestinians has given renewed hope for lasting peace \nthrough the creation of an independent sovereign \nPalestinian State existing side by side with the State of \nIsrael within secured and recognized borders. \nMauritius has always supported the legitimate and \ninalienable right of the Palestinian people to live in \npeace and security in an independent Palestinian State. \nWe therefore commend President Barack Obama for \nhis initiatives and leadership in enabling the direct \ntalks between President Abbas and Prime Minister \nNetanyahu. \n Global governance in the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security will remain incomplete \nuntil we achieve a comprehensive reform of the United \nNations Security Council \u2014 a reformed Security \nCouncil that meets and responds to the geopolitical \nrealities of the twenty-first century. In this respect, \nMauritius fully supports the Common African Position, \nas enshrined in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte \nDeclaration. We reiterate our support for India, the \nlargest democracy, obtaining a permanent seat in a \nreformed Security Council. We also support the \nrightful aspiration of Latin America and the Caribbean \nfor a permanent seat in the Council. \n \n \n31 10-55264 \n \n We have in no uncertain terms drawn the \nattention of this body every year to the fact that \nMauritius has sovereignty over the Chagos \nArchipelago, including Diego Garcia. The Chagos \nArchipelago was illegally excised by the United \nKingdom from the territory of Mauritius prior to our \nindependence. This dismemberment was done in \nblatant violation of General Assembly resolutions 1514 \n(XV) of 14 December 1960 and 2066 (XX) of \n16 December 1965. We have raised the issue of the \nsovereignty of Mauritius over the Archipelago with \nsuccessive British Governments and initially pursued \nthe matter as a friendly dispute. In view of the lack of \nprogress, we suggested that the issue be addressed in \nbilateral talks. Although the process of bilateral talks \nwas initiated in January 2009, the issue of our \nsovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago has yet to be \naddressed. \n We are deeply concerned that the British \nGovernment decided on 1 April 2010 to unilaterally \ndeclare a marine protected area around the Chagos \nArchipelago \u2014 our territory \u2014 allegedly to protect the \nmarine environment. The unilateral establishment of \nthis marine protected area infringes the sovereignty of \nMauritius over the Archipelago and constitutes a \nserious impediment to the eventual resettlement there \nof its former inhabitants and other Mauritians, as any \neconomic activity in the protected zone would be \nprecluded. The Government of Mauritius has decided \nnot to recognize the existence of the so called marine \nprotected area. \n The illegal excision of the Chagos Archipelago \nfrom the territory of Mauritius has indeed a tragic \nhuman dimension. All the inhabitants of the \nArchipelago were at that time forced by the British \nauthorities to abruptly leave their homes there, in total \ndisregard for their human rights. Most of them were \nmoved to the main island of Mauritius. The \nGovernment of Mauritius is sensitive to and fully \nsupportive of the plight of the displaced inhabitants of \nthe Chagos Archipelago and to their desire to resettle \nin their birthplace there. \n Mauritius greatly appreciates the unflinching and \nunanimous support it has consistently received from \nthe African Union and the Non-Aligned Movement for \nthe assertion of its sovereignty over the Chagos \nArchipelago. The last AU Summit held in Kampala last \nJuly and the last Non-Aligned Movement Summit held \nin July 2008 in Sharm el-Sheikh both reaffirmed that \nthe Archipelago, including Diego Garcia, forms an \nintegral part of the territory of the Republic of \nMauritius. They also called upon the United Kingdom \nto expeditiously put an end to its unlawful occupation \nof the Chagos Archipelago with a view to enabling \nMauritius to effectively exercise its sovereignty over it. \n We urge the United Kingdom once again to take \nthe necessary steps for the unconditional return of the \nChagos Archipelago, including Diego Garcia, to \nMauritius without further delay. In our annual \nstatement, we also reaffirmed the sovereignty of \nMauritius over Tromelin Island. The Governments of \nMauritius and France reached an agreement earlier this \nyear on the co management of the island and its \nmaritime zones without prejudice to the sovereignty of \nMauritius over Tromelin. This is considered to be a \nfirst and positive step towards the resolution of the \nsovereignty issue. The Republic of Mauritius is a crucible of \ncivilizations and cultures. We are proud to be a haven \nof peace, where people of various backgrounds and \ntraditions live together in harmony. The people of \nMauritius are inspired by the philosophy of \nmulticulturalism and consider their diversity to be a \nrich human resource. Based on the vision expressed in \nour motto, \u201cUnity, equality and modernity\u201d, we have \ncommitted to place humanity at the centre of all \ndevelopment in our pluralistic society \u2014 a society \nbased on diversity, respect for cultural individuality, \nnon-discrimination and sharing common values. \n The United Nations is the pre-eminent forum for \nintercultural dialogue. My country will fully play its \npart in the combined global effort for all human beings \nto enjoy the consideration and respect that are their \nbirthright. \n Finally, I should like to reaffirm Mauritius\u2019 \nunwavering faith in the United Nations in the \nmaintenance of international peace, security and \ndevelopment.

        "file_text": "Let me begin by warmly \ncongratulating President Joseph Deiss on his election \nand extending the best wishes of the Irish Government \nfor a successful term in office. \n We gather this year against a backdrop of grave \nchallenges confronting the global community. \nForemost among them is the continuing crisis of global \nhunger and poverty. We recognize the obligation upon \nus to fulfil the commitments made to the world\u2019s most \nvulnerable people when the Assembly adopted the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000. Our \nGovernments have to contend with the most severe \nglobal recession in many decades, but we must limit \nthe impact of the crisis on those in greatest need. We \nmust also maintain our commitment to halving the \nproportion of people living in extreme poverty and \nhunger by 2015. \n Firmer action is also called for in responding to \nthe threat posed by climate change. If the global \ncommunity fails to act now on that issue, we will face \na steadily escalating threat to our planet and to human \nsurvival. In recent months, we have also seen the \ndevastating consequences that natural catastrophes, \nsuch as those that have afflicted Pakistan and Haiti, can \nunleash on vulnerable populations. \n As with so many of the challenges and threats to \nour common security, it is to this great Organization \nthat we instinctively turn in searching for effective \ncollective responses. The universality of its \nmembership gives the United Nations a unique \nlegitimacy and authority. It brings the nations of the \nworld together under a common roof. It provides an \ninvaluable framework for common reflection and \ndecision-making. With the necessary political will, the \nMember States can use the authority and reach of the \nUnited Nations to fashion a more peaceful, equitable \nand secure world. \n One area requiring our close attention is reform \nof the United Nations itself. To improve the \neffectiveness of the Organization, we need to ensure \nthat its structures are fit for their purpose and adjusted \nto twenty-first-century realities. Ireland has actively \nchampioned the reform agenda at the United Nations in \nrecent years, and we will continue to do so. \n In that regard, I warmly welcome the \nestablishment of UN Women. Ireland is committed to \nsupporting that important new body within the United \nNations system, as it promotes greater gender equality \nand works to enhance the rights and well-being of \nwomen worldwide. Also, the benefits to be had from \nthe \u201cdelivering as one\u201d programme \u2014 greater coherence \nin United Nations development activities and improved \ndelivery of services at the country level \u2014 are clear and \ntangible. The valuable work done in those areas \ndemonstrates that reform can be achieved when it is \nclearly shown to be in our collective interest. \n  \n \n10-55128 36 \n \n We need to do more, however. There is a pressing \nneed for a Security Council that is more properly \nreflective of twenty-first-century realities and that can \nfunction better and with increased transparency. The \nconstructive deliberations on that issue within the \ninformal plenary of the General Assembly should be \nintensified, with a view to identifying whether there is \na model for reform that can command broad consensus. \n The system for apportioning the expenses of the \nOrganization should better reflect the principle of \ncapacity to pay. Ireland and its European Union \npartners have highlighted that issue in recent years, and \nwe will continue to follow it closely. I look forward to \npositive results from the review of the existing scale \nmethodology that the General Assembly has been \nmandated to carry out. \n Perhaps the greatest challenge we face as a global \ncommunity is to take effective action to eliminate \npoverty and hunger. We set ourselves clear targets in \nadopting the Millennium Development Goals 10 years \nago. Here in New York we have reviewed progress \nover the past week. We have welcomed the remarkable \nprogress that has been generated through our collective \naction in areas such as education, child health and the \ntreatment of HIV and AIDS. But the reality remains \nthat the actual numbers of people living in poverty and \nhunger in our world continue to increase. \n In recent times, economic crisis and uncertainty \nhave devastated the lives of communities already \nfacing extreme poverty at the same time that they \nimpose pressure on development budgets worldwide. It \nis therefore imperative that developed and developing \ncountries, in partnership, now examine rigorously \nwhich actions have worked in the fight to end poverty \nand which can be pursued more effectively. We also \nneed to focus more clearly on key sectors. \n Since the publication of our Hunger Task Force \nreport two years ago, Ireland has been arguing that a \nmore concerted, comprehensive approach is required to \nend the continuing crisis of world hunger. The number \nof chronically hungry people has risen to almost one \nbillion. One in four children in the developing world is \nundernourished. Failure to address that crisis is \nundermining progress across the full range of \ndevelopment goals. And yet the means are available, at \nan affordable cost, to end that scandal. We need to \nmobilize the political will to do so. \n Last week, with the United States Secretary of \nState, I hosted a meeting of international leaders to \nbuild a partnership focusing on nutrition in the first one \nthousand days of life, from pregnancy to two years of \nage. We recognized and will give our full support to \nthe Scaling Up Nutrition Initiative of the Secretary \nGeneral. Our determination to maintain international \nattention to that issue is driven by the conviction that it \nis possible in the five years remaining to deliver \nmeasurable progress on our commitment to halve the \nproportion of people suffering from extreme poverty \nand hunger by 2015. \n One of the core tasks of this Organization is to \ncontribute to the maintenance of international peace \nand security. War and conflict are not merely \nprofoundly destabilizing for the regions in which they \noccur; they also threaten the collective security of \nmankind. Mobilizing effective international responses \nto armed conflict, as and when it occurs, and providing \npeacekeeping and peacebuilding support in that context \nare high on the United Nations agenda. In that vitally \nimportant area, the United Nations record of \naccomplishment speaks for itself, as explicitly \nacknowledged through the awarding of the Nobel \nPeace Prize in 2001. \n There is one conflict that, more than most, \nrequires the sustained engagement of the international \ncommunity at the present time. The direct talks under \nway between Israeli and Palestinian leaders present a \nhistoric opportunity to make progress towards a just \nand lasting peace in the Middle East. I have no doubt \nthat progress towards a comprehensive settlement \nbased on the two-State solution would contribute more \nto improving global security than any other single \npeacebuilding effort. \n I want to salute the leadership and commitment \ndemonstrated by President Obama, Secretary of State \nClinton and Special Envoy Mitchell in persuading \nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority to resume direct \nnegotiations. While there have been many critical \njunctures in the Middle East peace process in the past, \nthere can be no doubting the significance of the \ninitiative which is under way at present. It represents \nwhat is possibly the final opportunity to achieve a just \nsettlement based on two States living side by side in \npeace and security. \n President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu \nare also to be commended for their personal \n \n \n37 10-55128 \n \ncommitment to this process. I encourage both sides to \nstay the course and not to be deterred by those who \nseek to derail the process. In particular, I urge all \nparties to refrain from any actions which could \nendanger the negotiation process. It is vital that every \neffort be made to keep the process intact. Our own \nexperience in the Northern Ireland peace process has \nshown that political progress can only be achieved \nthrough dialogue. Maximum restraint for the duration \nof these talks, which are intended to be \u2014 and should \nbe \u2014 completed in 12 months, would be a small price \nfor lasting peace. In this regard, I echo the statement \nmade earlier today by the High Representative of the \nEuropean Union (EU), Catherine Ashton, regretting the \nIsraeli decision not to extend the moratorium on \nsettlements. There could be no greater single \nconfidence-building measure and practical \ndemonstration of commitment to peace than a decision \nto desist from all settlement construction in the West \nBank and East Jerusalem. \n We must not forget Gaza at this critical time. I \nwitnessed for myself the appalling humanitarian plight \nof the people of Gaza when I visited the region last \nFebruary. Eighty per cent of them live below the \npoverty line. The deprivation and hardship that they are \nsuffering because of the blockade are painfully \nobvious. Yet the people of Gaza show a remarkable \ndignity and resilience in the face of living conditions \nwhich are quite simply unacceptable. \n I welcome the steps taken so far to improve the \ndelivery of humanitarian and consumer goods to Gaza. \nHowever, the reality remains that much more needs to \nbe done in terms of rebuilding Gaza and allowing \nnormal commercial activity to resume. In particular, \nexports must be allowed to resume from Gaza; the vital \nwork of recovery and reconstruction, which has been \neffectively on hold for almost two years, must be \nfacilitated; and key infrastructural projects identified \nby the United Nations must be allowed to proceed. \n I would also urge greater support for the \ninvaluable work performed by the United Nations \nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the \nNear East (UNRWA), and its brave and dedicated staff, \non behalf of the Palestinian people. I and others who \nhave visited Gaza in recent months, such as Secretary-\nGeneral Ban and European Union High Representative \nAshton, can testify to the importance of what UNRWA \nis doing to support the welfare of Gaza\u2019s inhabitants \nand to provide them with some basis for confidence in \na better future. \n The lack of progress in resolving the differences \nbetween the international community and Iran over that \ncountry\u2019s nuclear programme is a source of great \nconcern. I urge the Iranian authorities to engage \nconstructively on this issue and to comply with the \nclear requirements set out in numerous Security \nCouncil and International Atomic Energy Agency \n(IAEA) resolutions, most recently in Security Council \nresolution 1929 (2010). There is a sincere wish on the \npart of all of us to negotiate seriously and \nconstructively with Iran on these and other important \ninternational issues. I look forward to such a dialogue \nresuming in the near future. \n Any discussion with Iran would also need to \ninclude the human rights situation there, about which \nthere continue to be the gravest concerns. Iran must do \nconsiderably more than it has done up to now to \nrespect and fulfil the international obligations it has \nundertaken in the field of human rights. Recent cases \nof human rights abuses are profoundly disturbing, and \nIran must be held fully accountable for them. \n The global security which we all wish to achieve \ndepends crucially on the eradication of the means of \nconflict. Efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament and to \nprevent the further proliferation of nuclear weapons \nhave been key objectives for the United Nations since \nits inception. They have also been a major foreign \npolicy priority for successive Irish Governments. \nIreland was the first country to sign and ratify the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The \nsuccessful outcome to last May\u2019s NPT Review \nConference has reinvigorated the Treaty and is an \nimportant milestone on the road towards the eventual \nelimination of all nuclear weapons. A key priority for \nIreland is implementation of the action plan on nuclear \ndisarmament agreed there. \n I am pleased that Ireland made an important \ncontribution at the Review Conference. In particular, \nwe were able to facilitate progress in relation to \nimplementation of the 1995 resolution on a zone free \nof weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. I \nhope that the strong spirit of compromise evident at the \nReview Conference will be maintained and built upon \nin the preparations for the 2012 conference on the \nMiddle East resolution. \n  \n \n10-55128 38 \n \n Ireland is also satisfied with the progress made \nover the past couple of years on the issue of cluster \nmunitions. The Convention on Cluster Munitions, \nwhich was negotiated in Dublin in May 2008, has \nentered into force as of 1 August this year. This \nlandmark development brings closer the prospect of the \nelimination of all cluster munitions and of the \nunacceptable harm to civilians they cause. We must \nnow move ahead with implementation of the \nConvention and promotion of the widest possible \nadherence to its provisions. \n Ireland is actively supporting preparations for the \nfirst meeting of States Parties of the Convention in \nVientiane in November. We will continue to show \nleadership on this issue and to do all we can to ensure \nthe worldwide elimination of these atrocious weapons. \n This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the \nfirst deployment of Irish troops under the United \nNations flag. In 1960, just five years after we joined \nthis Organization, Ireland decided to participate in a \npeacekeeping mission to what was then the newly \nindependent Congo. This began a long and \ndistinguished tradition of service in United Nations \npeacekeeping operations in a wide variety of conflict \nsituations around the globe. We will continue to \ncontribute personnel to such missions and to play our \npart in the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity. I welcome the constructive discussions which \nhave taken place within the Special Committee on \nPeacekeeping Operations on ways of improving the \nfuture conduct and management of United Nations \npeacekeeping missions, following on from Secretary-\nGeneral Ban\u2019s recent paper on the New Horizon \nInitiative. \n This year, Ireland was honoured when our \nPermanent Representative, Ambassador Anne \nAnderson, took on the role of co-facilitator, along with \nSouth African and Mexican colleagues, of a major \nreview of the United Nations peacebuilding \narchitecture. We were very pleased to be able to make \nour contribution to this important and wide-ranging \nreflection on the work of the Peacebuilding \nCommission, five years after its establishment. The \nthree co-facilitators have submitted a report which \naims to revitalize the Commission and give it renewed \nfocus and impact. I look forward to positive \nconsideration by Member States of this report and the \nrecommendations it makes. \n Ireland has also been active in relation to another \nset of issues which have a significant bearing on \nconflict resolution and peacebuilding. This year marks \nthe tenth anniversary of the adoption of Security \nCouncil resolution 1325 (2000), which, for the first \ntime, explicitly acknowledged the key role of women \nin conflict resolution and peacebuilding. We have been \nworking hard to raise international awareness of this \nresolution and to encourage greater implementation of \nits provisions by Member States. \n As part of our focus on resolution 1325 (2000), \nwe have been pleased to work with Liberia and Timor-\nLeste in conducting important lessons-learned \nexercises. A report will be presented to the Secretary-\nGeneral shortly on the key findings made in this \nprocess. We are also working to finalize our national \naction plan on women, peace and security in the very \nnear future. \n Ireland strongly supports the vital role played by \nthe United Nations in upholding and defending human \nrights around the world. Next year\u2019s review of the \nHuman Rights Council provides an opportunity to \nassess the Council\u2019s performance to date and to \nconsider how it might be improved and strengthened. \nAs a candidate for election in 2012, we look forward to \nmaking our own contribution to the work of enhancing \nthe Council\u2019s performance. \n Ireland is also deeply supportive of the work of \nthe International Criminal Court (ICC) and the \nInternational Tribunals in promoting justice and \ncombating impunity. I welcome the successful outcome \nto the recent Kampala Review Conference of the Rome \nStatute of the International Criminal Court, including \nin relation to defining the crime of aggression, and I \nurge the fullest cooperation on the part of all Member \nStates with both the ICC and the International \nTribunals. \n The appalling human tragedy of Darfur continues \nto challenge the international community. I applaud the \ncourageous efforts of the United Nations personnel and \nall of the others on the ground in Darfur who are \nworking to provide vital humanitarian services. \n We hope that all sides in Sudan will continue to \nengage in the fullest cooperation in support of the \nUnited Nations/African Union mediation efforts in \nDarfur and also in the preparations for the historic \nreferendum in southern Sudan early next year. Full \nimplementation of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace \n \n \n39 10-55128 \n \nAgreement still remains fundamental to securing peace \nand stability in Sudan as a whole and in the region. \n The continuing unjust detention of Aung San Suu \nKyi in Burma epitomizes the fate of prisoners of \nconscience everywhere who seek to uphold the values \nof democracy and free speech. I call for her immediate \nand unconditional release. I also call for the release of \nall other political prisoners in Burma and for the \nlaunching of a genuine, inclusive national dialogue. \nAnd I very much endorse Secretary-General Ban\u2019s call \non Burma\u2019s leaders to create the conditions in which \nfree and fair elections can take place. \n In a world where we continue to face enormous \npeacebuilding challenges, the Northern Ireland peace \nprocess is an example of what can be achieved with \npatience, imagination and strong international support. \nThis year saw a hugely significant step forward in \nNorthern Ireland with the devolution of policing and \njustice powers to a locally elected Minister accountable \nto the Northern Ireland Assembly. That is a major step \ntowards fulfilling the vision of the Good Friday \nAgreement, which was signed 12 years ago. \n That Agreement provides a genuine possibility \nfor political inclusion for all who reject violence. It is \nthe framework within which the Irish Government, \nworking in partnership and full cooperation with the \nBritish Government and the Northern Ireland \nExecutive, is helping to build economic prosperity, \nassist communities to move beyond conflict and sow \nthe seeds for a shared future for all. \n The European Union and its 27 member States \nare firmly committed to effective multilateralism with \na strong United Nations at its core. We look forward to \nfurther consultations with the Member States of this \nOrganization on proposed changes to the status of the \nEuropean Union in the General Assembly. These \nmodest adjustments will help the Union to make a \nmore effective contribution to the work of the \nAssembly and of the United Nations. A European \nUnion speaking with a clear and coherent voice on the \ngreat global challenges that this Organization must \naddress will, I believe, strengthen the impact and \neffectiveness of the United Nations as a whole. That is \nsomething to which Ireland and its EU partners attach \nthe utmost importance. \n We live in times of profound and unsettling \nchange and daunting global challenges. As we struggle \nto deal with these challenges and to chart ways forward \nin an insecure world, the United Nations is an \nincreasingly valuable resource. It remains the \ninternational organization with the greatest potential \nfor international consensus-building and for the \nframing of collective strategies and solutions. At its \nheart are the fundamental principles embodied in the \nUnited Nations Charter, principles which have \nunderpinned the conduct of international relations over \nthe past 65 years and whose strength and validity is \nmore apparent today than ever before. \n Ireland is steadfastly committed to this \nOrganization and the principles and values on which it \nrests. I very much welcome the General Assembly \nPresident\u2019s emphasis on the need for a strong, inclusive \nand open United Nations, and we look forward to \ntaking part in the consultations which he has indicated \nhe will be convening. We look to the United Nations as \nthe indispensable forum for developing effective \nmultilateralism and for leading international \nendeavours towards the creation of a more peaceful, \nprosperous and secure world."

        "file_text": "The values upon which the Organization was founded, \n65 years ago, are still appropriate for overcoming the \nglobal challenges we face today. Whether in fighting \npoverty, protecting the environment and conserving \nbiodiversity, building peace in conflict areas, helping \npopulations affected by natural disasters, promoting \nhuman rights, the rule of law and democracy in the \nworld, making progress towards disarmament and \nnon-proliferation or combating terrorism, we need to \nwork together today more than ever before. \n You yourself, Mr. President, have quite rightly \norganized the general debate under the theme \n\u201cReaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \nglobal governance\u201d. As a founding Member of the \nUnited Nations, Luxembourg fully endorses the \nSecretary-General\u2019s assessment that only the United \nNations has the scope, knowledge and legitimacy \nnecessary to develop and implement effective policies \nin order to address global challenges, which require \nurgent and collective responses. However, we cannot \ncontent ourselves with that simple article of faith. We \nneed to draw the necessary conclusions and take \nresponsibility for them. Those responsibilities are both \nindividual and collective ones, especially for members \nof the international community and our universal \nOrganization. \n At the High-level Plenary Meeting on the \nMillennium Development Goals, which was held \nearlier this week, we reiterated our collective \ndetermination to do everything possible to free \nhumankind from hunger, illiteracy and disease and \nultimately to free the Earth of inequalities \u2014 between \nand within continents, regions and countries and \nbetween men and women. \n Luxembourg welcomes this renewed commitment \nto combat poverty in its manifold dimensions. The \nestablishment of a true partnership for development is \nbased upon shared responsibilities for both donor and \nrecipient countries. Although we rely on stronger \naction from developing countries on good governance, \nthe rule of law, capacity-building and development \nownership, developed countries must fulfil their \ncommitments in terms of aid quality and quantity. This \nis a needed basis for such a partnership, particularly \nwith regard to Africa. \n I am proud to say that Luxembourg is among the \ncountries to have kept its promises. We strive to be a \nreliable international partner, even in times of crisis. \nBy 2000, Luxembourg\u2019s official development \nassistance (ODA) had reached the threshold of 0.7 per \ncent of gross national income (GNI), and in 2009, our \nODA surpassed 1 per cent of GNI. Our Government is \ncommitted to maintaining this effort, both in terms of \nvolume and percentage of gross national income. That \neffort is necessarily linked to steadily growing quality \nof aid. \n The duty to prevent, contain and resolve violent \nconflict is a central aim of our Organization. The \n  \n \n10-54959 36 \n \nCharter calls on us to unite our forces in order to \nmaintain international peace and security. With more \nthan 120,000 men and women deployed, peacekeeping \noperations have reached an unprecedented scale in \nrecent years. While the stabilizing role of United \nNations forces is undeniable, the changing nature of \nconflicts and the increasing complexity of mandates \nhave also revealed the limits of the system, structures \nand basic tools of our Organization. \n The mass rapes and sexual assaults that took \nplace in North Kivu this summer and the inability of \nthe United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission \nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo to protect \ncivilians are stark reminders of the difficulty of \nmaintaining peace in conflict areas in the absence of \nadequate resources and mandates. Those atrocities \ncompel us to urgently continue the debate on the future \nof peacekeeping operations and to overcome our \ndifferences and divisions on this particular issue. \n They also serve to underscore once again the \nimportance of substantial United Nations action to \neradicate the use of sexual violence as a weapon of \nwar. In that regard, I welcome the appointment of \nMs. Margot Wallstr\u00f6m as Special Representative of the \nSecretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. In \nthis, the tenth anniversary year of Security Council \nresolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and \nsecurity, such heinous acts and flagrant violations of \nhuman rights can no longer be tolerated. Impunity must \nalso be brought to an end. \n While the primary responsibility for the safety \nand safety of its citizens and for combating poverty and \nestablishing the rule of law lies within the Congolese \nGovernment, the international community must do \neverything possible to support that Government in its \nefforts to ensure that those responsible for these \nhorrendous crimes are actively sought out, tried and \npunished. Combating impunity must also lead us to be \nfar more attentive to the report on violations of human \nrights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \nbetween 1993 and 2003, the publication of which the \nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for \nHuman Rights has announced for 1 October 2010. \n As I said at the Review Conference of the Rome \nStatute, held in Kampala in May, combating impunity \nfor the most serious crimes should not be an abstract \ngoal any longer, but become a tangible and concrete \nreality. All of us must cooperate to ensure success in \nthat regard. \n Year after year, in this very forum, we express \nour hope to see peace established in the Middle East. \nWe once again call for a solution based on the \ncoexistence of two States, Israel and Palestine, living \nside by side in peace and security. We urge the parties \nto assume their responsibility to create through their \nactions the framework for a lasting settlement of the \nconflict. To date, as we know, such calls have mostly \nbeen in vain. \n The resumption of direct talks between Israelis \nand Palestinians on 2 September 2010, however, once \nagain gives me hope that we will finally reach a final \nsettlement that ends the occupation that began in 1967 \nand leads to the birth of an independent, democratic, \nviable and contiguous Palestinian State living in peace \nand security with Israel and its other neighbours. I \ngenuinely hope that the call by President Obama to \nwork to achieve a Palestinian State in 2011 will \nbecome a reality. \n However, we must not be distracted by the \nenemies of peace and those who seek to sabotage peace \ntalks. It will be important for both parties to show \ndetermination, courage, calm and restraint, and to act \nsolely according to international law. Hence the \nimportance of ending all settlement activities. They are \nillegal, contrary to international law and clearly \nconstitute an obstacle to peace. Why is that so? While \nthe material fact of building on another person\u2019s land is \nin itself to be condemned, it is also a symbol of \ndomination and humiliation that cannot be accepted. As \na European, I am heartened that the European Union \npersists in its strong unanimous call for a prolongation \nof the moratorium beyond next Sunday, 26 September \n2010. President Obama\u2019s position is clearly and \nunambiguously along the same lines. \n Meanwhile, it will be of paramount importance to \nfind a lasting solution for the situation in Gaza and to \nrevive its economy. The blockade continues. I hope \nthat the calls by the United Nations Relief and Works \nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East will at \nlast be heard. In that context, I welcome the launching \nby the Secretary-General of an international \ninvestigation into last May\u2019s incident involving the aid \nflotilla en route to Gaza. A full, honest, impartial, \nbalanced and transparent investigation consistent with \n \n \n37 10-54959 \n \ninternational standards is of great importance. It also, \nof course, entails the credibility of our Organization. \n In the Sudan, the implementation of the \nComprehensive Peace Agreement is entering its final \nphase with the referendum on the self-determination of \nSouthern Sudan and Abyei. After more than two \ndecades of confrontation, the prospects for a settlement \nare taking shape at last. The road ahead nevertheless \nremains fraught with difficulties. It is our collective \nresponsibility to help the Sudan steer through this \ncritical period and carry out a process that at last leads \nto lasting peace for its people. We must ensure that the \nelections are conducted in a transparent and peaceful \nmanner, regardless, of course, of the outcome. \n Increased efforts are also needed to support the \ncurrent initiatives of the African Union and the United \nNations towards a political solution involving all \nparties in Darfur in order to address the root causes of \nthe conflict and ensure the protection and promotion of \nhuman rights, justice and reconciliation. The \ncontinuing violence in Darfur threatens the stability of \nthe whole of the Sudan and of the larger region. \n A comprehensive approach is also needed in \nSomalia, a country that has for too long been \nsynonymous with civil war and bloody conflict. Only a \ncomprehensive approach will put an end to the terrorist \nthreat that armed groups pose to Somalia, the \nsubregion and the entire international community, as \nwell as permanently eradicating piracy and establishing \nthe rule of law in Somalia. \n My country seeks to play its full effective role in \nthe global efforts to resolve the crisis in Somalia. To \nthat end, Luxembourg actively participates in \nOperation Atalanta to deter, prevent and suppress acts \nof piracy and armed robbery off the Somali coast, as \nwell as in the military mission to help train security \nforces of the Transitional Federal Government \u2014 two \noperations launched by the European Union in support \nof Security Council decisions. Together with our \nEuropean and African partners, we intend to continue \nour support for the Djibouti peace process and for the \nsearch for a lasting political solution. \n Allow me for a moment to address another issue \nthat I believe it is important not to overlook when \ndiscussing ways to guarantee and strengthen peace, \nsecurity and stability at the international level: \ndisarmament and non-proliferation. The success of the \neighth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty \non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held \nhere in New York in May, brought us closer to our \ncommon goal of a world safer for all and free of \nnuclear weapons. It will now be important to maintain \nthe political momentum and to ensure the full \nimplementation of the decisions taken, including that \nrelating to the holding by 2012 of a conference on a \nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. I am \ncertain that progress in this area will not remain \nwithout implications for other actors and for other \nissues. \n In addition, as I had the opportunity to say \nyesterday at the ministerial meeting on revitalizing the \nwork of the Conference on Disarmament convened by \nthe Secretary-General, we must continue our efforts at \nboth nuclear and conventional disarmament. The \nconstant search for security at the lowest possible level \nof armaments will make an essential contribution to \nstability in the world. \n In that regard, I welcome the entry into force, on \n1 August 2010, of the Convention on Cluster \nMunitions, which prohibits the use, production, \ntransfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions. At the \nnational level, Luxembourg, which was among the first \ncountries to sign and ratify the Convention, has also \nprohibited the funding of cluster munitions. \n The progress made towards a legally binding \narms trade instrument under the auspices of the United \nNations is also to be welcomed. The problems linked to \nthe unregulated trade in conventional weapons and the \ndiversion of those weapons into illicit markets have the \npotential to fuel instability, organized crime and \nterrorism, thereby  jeopardizing peace, security and \nsustainable economic and social development. Hence \nthe importance of finally adopting a binding instrument \nin this field. \n Next week, together with other partners, my \ncountry will hold a symposium in Boston on an arms \ntrade treaty. All United Nations Member States have \nbeen invited to participate. We hope thereby to \ncontribute to the discussion and consideration of this \nimportant issue. \n If we believe in the relevance of a multilateral \napproach based on the United Nations, we must give \nthe Organization the means to be the centre of \nmultilateral action and a real catalyst for change. We \nneed to push for decisive internal reforms, including, I \nbelieve, reform of the Security Council. We are all \n  \n \n10-54959 38 \n \naware of the need for Council reform to make it more \ninclusive and more representative of today\u2019s realities, \nas well as more effective and more transparent. \nEnsuring an adequate place for small States, which \nnow represent the vast majority of the Organization\u2019s \nMember States, is paramount in this regard. \n We must review the instruments at our disposal, \nbe it peacekeeping operations, to which I referred \npreviously, the Peacebuilding Commission or the \nHuman Rights Council, including the necessary \nintegration of human rights in all aspects of United \nNations action.  \n The Peacebuilding Commission represents a key \nasset for the operational capacity of the international \ncommunity in the vast peace agenda. Luxembourg fully \nsupports the philosophy behind the Commission and is \nactively involved in the Guinea-Bissau configuration. \nThe Commission has begun to prove its usefulness. \nHowever, we should consider how we can make its \nresults more tangible at the country level in order to \nallow other countries to benefit from its achievements \nand face emerging challenges. Our goals must meet the \nexpectations of post-conflict societies and peoples. In \nthat regard, I welcome the recent decision to include \nLiberia on the Commission\u2019s agenda. \n We also need to overcome the systemic \nfragmentation that has gradually developed since the \nestablishment of the Organization and enhance system-\nwide coherence. An important step in that direction \nwas taken this year with the establishment of the \nUnited Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the \nEmpowerment of Women (UN Women). I would like to \nwarmly welcome the appointment of Ms. Michelle \nBachelet as head of UN Women. I have no doubt that  \n \nshe will demonstrate a dynamic and unwavering \ncommitment to serve women and girls worldwide. She \nwill be able to rely on the full support of my country, \nwhich has for many years pursued an integrated gender \napproach and an active policy of promoting gender \nequality, including in the area of development \ncooperation. \n As you rightly pointed out, Sir, when you were \nelected to the presidency on 11 June (see A/64/PV.93), \nour primary task is to work together to find \nconstructive solutions for the dignity, safety and \nsecurity and well-being of all. My country is ready to \ncontinue to play its part at the national level, but also \nas a member of the European Union. The willingness \nof Luxembourg to assume its national responsibilities \ncan be seen in the concrete examples that I have just \ngiven. It is also expressed in our bid for a non-\npermanent seat in the Security Council for the period \n2013 to 2014. \n The commitment of Luxembourg is also a \nEuropean one, as I have just said. By strengthening its \ncapabilities and the increased synergy of its \ninstruments following the entry into force of the \nLisbon Treaty, the European Union is now more than \never ready to be an active, effective and supportive \nactor for the United Nations in all areas in which the \nOrganization is active. The European Union wants to \nbe such an active and supportive partner. Hence the \nimportance we attach to a resolution regulating the \neffective participation of the European Union in the \nwork of our Organization. It is only together in the \nUnited Nations that we can help build a better future \nfor all. "

        "file_text": "I stand before this \nAssembly as an envoy of His Excellency Mr. Rupiah \nBwezani Banda, President of the Republic of Zambia. \n Zambia wishes to align itself with the statement \ndelivered by His Excellency Ngwazi Professor Bingu \nWa Mutharika, President of the Republic of Malawi \nand current Chairperson of the African Union. \n This session is taking place amid global \nchallenges such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, \nenvironmental degradation, international terrorism, \npiracy, HIV/AIDS, extreme poverty and hunger, among \nothers. It is an occasion for all Member States to \ncollectively engage in dialogue aimed at finding \nsolutions to the challenges that our countries are \nfacing, in order to contribute to the socio-economic \ndevelopment and well-being of our people. \n The Assembly\u2019s theme this year is appropriate, as \nit provides an opportunity to reaffirm the central role \nof the United Nations in global governance. The role of \nthe United Nations is felt in areas such as \npeacekeeping, security, human rights, the promotion of \ngender equality and the fight for social justice and \nequality. However, emerging global challenges, such as \nthe recent financial and economic crisis, also call for a \ngreater role for the United Nations in global economic \ngovernance. In that regard, our Government would like \nto see a strengthening and enhancing of capacity in the \nUnited Nations to enable it to deal with some of those \nchallenges. \n Allow me to express Zambia\u2019s gratitude to the \nSecretary-General for organizing the important high-\nlevel meetings that preceded the general debate. \n The summit to review the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) provided an opportunity \nfor the international community to take stock of \nexisting gaps and the challenges faced in the \nattainment of the MDGs. At that meeting I elaborated \non the progress Zambia has made and the challenges \nwe continue to face in our efforts to attain the MDGs. \nIn spite of the strides made in improving the \nmacroeconomic environment and putting in place \ndevelopment frameworks, the incidence of poverty in \nmy country remains high, partly because our efforts \nalone are not enough. I therefore wish to reiterate calls \nto the international cooperating partners to honour all \nof their commitments to ensure that the 2015 targets \nare realized. \n Let me also add that the measures that the \nZambian Government has adopted to address the issue \nof hunger and poverty include devising agricultural \nsector policies that enable smallholder farming \n  \n \n10-55128 56 \n \nhouseholds to improve their productivity. In that \nconnection, this year Zambia has recorded a bumper \nharvest of maize, which is our main food crop. That \nwill ensure food security and increased incomes for \nsmallholder farmers, who constitute the majority of the \nfarming community. \n We are mindful, however, of the fact that climate \nchange, as evidenced by persistent periods of droughts \nand floods in our countries, poses one of the most \nserious threats to the agricultural sector and thus to \noverall food production. While as a Government we are \ndoing everything possible, such as investing in \nagricultural research and irrigation methods, the debate \non climate change should not lose sight of the need to \nassist developing countries, including Zambia, in \nbuilding capacities to adapt in order to mitigate \nnegative impacts on the agricultural sector. Without \nthose, poverty and hunger will persist in my country. \n Zambia shares the concerns of the Secretary-\nGeneral regarding current global resource loss and \necosystem degradation. It is important that mankind \nreverse the ongoing trends of natural resource loss and \necosystem degradation as a commitment to protect \nbiodiversity. That will be achieved only if all \nstakeholders step up their efforts and meet the MDGs \nand other internationally agreed development goals. \n My delegation welcomes the positive \ndevelopments that have occurred in the past year in the \narea of arms control and disarmament. The Security \nCouncil\u2019s convening of a summit to address \ndisarmament issues, the Secretary-General\u2019s launch of \na five-point nuclear disarmament proposal, the entry \ninto force of treaties establishing nuclear-weapon-free \nzones in Central Asia and Africa, and the convening of \na summit in Washington to discuss nuclear \ndisarmament and non-proliferation, among others, must \nindeed be commended. We hope those efforts and the \nmomentum generated will be sustained and will lead to \nthe resolution of all outstanding issues in the area of \ndisarmament. \n Zambia, however, continues to face difficulties in \ncontrolling the inflow of small arms and light weapons. \nThe illicit trade in small arms threatens security and \nretards social and economic development in our \ncountry. Zambia therefore calls for the establishment of \na strong and legally binding international instrument on \nthe arms trade. We strongly support the convening of \nthe United Nations conference in 2012 to establish \nlegally binding common international standards for the \nimport, export and transfer of conventional arms, with \nspecific measures against defaulters. \n On the reform of the United Nations, in particular \nthe Security Council, Zambia reaffirms its support for the \nAfrican position, as espoused in the Ezulwini Consensus \nand the Sirte Declaration, that Africa should be granted, \namong others, not less than two permanent seats, with all \nof the prerogatives and privileges including the right of \nveto, and two additional non-permanent seats. Africa is \nthe only continent without permanent seats, and yet it has \nthe second largest membership of the United Nations. \nGranting Africa permanent seats will redress that \nhistorical injustice. \n The Government of Zambia recognizes the \nimportant role that women play in attaining \ndevelopment. Furthermore, we recognize that the \nempowerment of women and their inclusion in the \ndecision-making process have enhanced their role in \ndevelopment. That is why Zambia has integrated \nwomen of all sectors of society in decision-making \npositions, and we are committed to doing even more. \n Our Government welcomes the establishment of \nUN Women, the United Nations Entity for Gender \nEquality and the Empowerment of Women, and the \nappointment of Ms. Michelle Bachelet, the former \nPresident of Chile, to head it. It is our hope that the \nnew Entity will have a strong and effective presence at \ncountry level and will help Member States implement \nstandards and will provide them with the much-needed \nfinancial and technical support required to achieve \nwomen\u2019s empowerment, equality and equity. \n As the Assembly is aware, Zambia has been \nhosting refugees prior to and since its independence in \n1964 and is party to all refugee conventions. My \ncountry was among the first on the African continent to \nhost a refugee camp. Zambia is committed to hosting \nrefugees, and our experience has demonstrated that \nvoluntary repatriation is a desirable and durable \nsolution. However, as an under-resourced and least \ndeveloped country, hosting refugees is a major \nchallenge for us. We therefore call upon the \ninternational community to provide financial assistance \nto enable us to discharge that responsibility through the \nprovision of minimum standards of care. \n In addition to the question of refugees, the issue \nof internally displaced persons, which has continued to \nincrease worldwide, especially in Africa, equally calls \n \n \n57 10-55128 \n \nfor our attention. The adoption by the African Union \nlast year of the Convention for the Protection and \nAssistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa is \nan important landmark that requires the support of the \ninternational community at large. \n The sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe continue to \ncause great suffering to the people of that country and \nto the southern Africa region as a whole. Similarly, the \nembargo that the United States has imposed on Cuba, \nwhich the United Nations has condemned through \nnumerous General Assembly resolutions, has caused \nuntold hardship to the people of Cuba. Zambia calls on \nthis body to ensure that the sanctions on Zimbabwe and \nthe United States embargo on Cuba are lifted. \n In an effort to consolidate democratic \ngovernance, Zambia is in the process of enacting a new  \n \nconstitution. The National Constitutional Conference \nthat was established to oversee the process concluded \nits work and submitted a draft constitution, which \nawaits tabling before Parliament. As the Assembly may \nbe aware, Zambia will hold presidential and general \nelections in 2011. As in the past, international election \nobservers, including those from the United Nations, \nwill be invited. \n As we reaffirm the role of the United Nations in \nglobal governance, let us not be complacent in the face \nof great suffering and hardship in our world. Let that \nbe the force that drives us to action, where all nations \nwill work together in meeting the goals and aspirations \nof our peoples."

        "file_text": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \nwelcomes, Sir, your ascension to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session with a great \ndeal of anticipation. As one of the primary architects of \nyour own country\u2019s membership in the United Nations, \nyou have demonstrated your belief in the importance of \nthis institution and its role in the modern international \ncontext. As you stand on the shoulders of the giants \nwho have preceded you in this role, we are confident \nthat you will ably apply your unique set of skills and \nexperiences to the advancement of our complex \nagenda. \n We are also excited by the theme that you have \nproposed for your tenure as President of the General \nAssembly, namely, reaffirming the central role of the \nUnited Nations in global governance. It is a theme that \nresonates loudly with Saint Vincent and the \nGrenadines, and indeed with many of the small and \nmarginalized States that form a significant part of the \n192 members of the General Assembly. \n We small States have emerged as some of the \nmost jealous and zealous guardians of the United \nNations Charter. This vigilance is born of principle and \nnecessity. The Charter is the document that guarantees \nour place in the Assembly as the sovereign equals of \nevery other country of the world. The United Nations \nremains the only venue that affords us both a seat and a \nvoice in global affairs. To Saint Vincent and the \nGrenadines, the United Nations must be the centre of \nglobal governance because it is our only option for \nglobal governance. There are some States that \nfortuitously find themselves in the inner sanctums of \nthe Security Council \u2014 and the Group of Eight (G-8), \nand the Group of Twenty (G-20) and the Organization \nfor Economic Cooperation and Development. For \nthem, the centrality of the United Nations may vary \nwith the political winds or the shifting sands of great \npower intrigue. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has \nno such luxury. We cannot take our ball and go home, \nto play on other fields and interact in other forums. The \nUnited Nations is all we have. Its centrality in global \ngovernance, for us, is therefore an essential and \nindisputable truth. \n You assume the leadership of the General \nAssembly, Mr. President, at a time when the centrality \nof the United Nations role is being challenged as never \nbefore. Various organizations and small groupings of \nStates, with selective membership and opaque modus \noperandi, have coalesced to become global decision-\nmakers and shapers of our post-Cold War existence. \nFor our purposes, it is irrelevant whether these \ngroupings have formed to respond to or to precipitate \nthe declining effectiveness of the United Nations. \nHowever, the fact is that in the face of global crises of \neconomy, climate, trade and reform, we have been \ntested and we have been found wanting. We face the \nreal threat of devolving into a mere talk shop, an \namalgam of unwieldy bureaucracies or a toothless \nrubber stamp of decisions taken elsewhere. To avoid \nsuch an ignominious fate, we must actively defend our \nrole and legitimacy as the global centre of international \ngovernance and decision-making. Permit us the \nopportunity to offer a few simple suggestions to assist \nin achieving this goal. \n First, for the concept of global governance to \nhave meaning and relevance, we must inject some \nmeasure of consistency and predictability into the rules \n \n \n9 10-55408 \n \nthat govern our family. Saint Vincent and the \nGrenadines is committed to the international rule of \nlaw and the role of the institutions that advance the \nrule of law and adjudicate international disputes. \nGovernance is ineffective if the rich and powerful \namong us can place themselves beyond the ambit of \ntimely compliance with rules and decisions. \n In that regard, we cite the case of the ongoing \ndispute between the United States and Antigua and \nBarbuda on the issue of online gaming, which has \nalready been adjudicated in Antigua and Barbuda\u2019s \nfavour by the World Trade Organization (WTO). We \nurge those two countries \u2014 both strong friends of Saint \nVincent and the Grenadines \u2014 to quickly arrive at a \njust and equitable resolution of this matter. Our region \nwas the unfortunate, and no doubt unintended, victim \nof WTO rulings that have gutted our once-thriving \nbanana industry and threatened to stall that crucial \nengine of our development. The case against banana \ntariffs was successfully brought to the WTO by the \nUnited States, which does not grow a single bunch of \nbananas. We are confident that our friends will honour \nthis relatively minor gaming ruling as we have been \ncompelled to adapt to previous paradigm-shifting \ndecisions. \n Secondly, the resolutions adopted and decisions \ntaken by the General Assembly must have some worth \nbeyond the paper upon which they are printed. In the \ndusty archives of our body are hard-fought decisions \nand resolutions on Palestine, on human rights and on \nthe economic crisis. We have made annual near-\nunanimous calls for an end to the Cuban embargo. \nThen our documents are dutifully filed away to be \nignored by dissenters or resuscitated in future sessions \nwith, at best, incremental advancement. As long as \nGeneral Assembly decisions and resolutions remain a \nbuffet from which Member States can selectively pick \nand choose, our role in governance will continue to be \nhamstrung. Member States must take the sovereign \ndecision to honour the will of the international \ncommunity not because they have to but because it is \nthe right thing to do. If we continue to champion the \ndecisions with which we agree while disregarding all \nothers, we are not participating with good faith in the \ndeliberations of this body and we are doing violence to \nthe very concept of a community of nations. \n Nor should States manipulate the concept of \nconsensus to make it a virtual veto on United Nations \naction. Consensus must always be a central goal, but \nnever a barrier, to decisive action by the General \nAssembly. Necessary, desirable and urgent action \ncannot be sacrificed on the altar of consensus. \nDemocracy demands that, when consensus cannot be \nachieved, the recorded will of the majority should be \nrespected. \n Thirdly, we must hold every nation to account for \ncommitments that have been voluntarily taken. Much \nhas been written and said about donor fatigue, which is \nshorthand for the limited attention span of multilateral \nand bilateral donors when confronting systemic \ndevelopment issues. Much less has been said about \ncommitment fatigue: the developing world\u2019s \nexasperation with oft-made but seldom-honoured \ncommitments. But make no mistake, fatigue has set in, \nas we grow increasingly tired of waiting for the 0.7 per \ncent of gross national income promised by the \ndeveloped world at the International Conference on \nFinancing for Development in Monterrey in 2002, the \nbillions pledged at the G-8 Summit in Gleneagles for \nthe doubling of aid to Africa, the $10 billion in \nironically titled fast-start funding that was to \nmaterialize this year for climate change adaptation and \nthe $1.1 trillion promised by the G-20 in April 2009. \n To Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, therefore, it \nis puzzling how some of our friends and development \npartners can suffer from donor fatigue when they have \nyet to donate what was originally promised. It is \nsimilarly confounding when, reflective of this \nsupposed fatigue, donors attach so many conditions \nand bureaucratic impediments to unlocking assistance \nthat it becomes all but inaccessible. Small States like \nours have neither the capacity nor the desire to \nestablish entire bureaucracies dedicated solely to \nnavigating the administrative labyrinth of irregular and \nunpredictable aid flows. Nor are we interested in the \nupkeep of armies of foreign consultants, who seem to \nbe the primary beneficiaries of some international \ndevelopment efforts. \n Commitment fatigue morphs into anger when \nconsidered in the context of the Haitian people in the \nwake of the indescribably devastating earthquake of  \n12 January. In March this year the United Nations held \nan inspiring donors conference, in which over  \n$10 billion was pledged for Haiti\u2019s recovery from the \nearthquake. Today, six months after that conference, \nand eight months beyond the earthquake, a pathetically \nminiscule percentage of those pledges has actually \nbeen delivered. While less than 20,000 temporary \n  \n \n10-55408 10 \n \nshelters have been built to date, over 1.5 million \nHaitians are still living in tents. A few days ago, we \nlearned that women and children living in tent cities \nwere killed when heavy rains and winds struck Haiti. \nNo one can claim that this result was unexpected, as \nwe in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) have \nbeen sounding alarms for months about the dangers \ninherent in the imminent rainy season. To survive a \ncatastrophic earthquake only to be killed by rain is an \nunfathomable tragedy. The entirely avoidable deaths of \nthose women and children will remain a stain on the \ncollective conscience of this body and on our \nmembership. Talk is cheap, even when it is the heady \ntalk of billions of dollars. Commitments made must be \ncommitments kept. We must hold to account those who \nrepeatedly make empty promises. \n Fourthly, we must cede no ground to the creeping \nencroachment of non-inclusive, non-transparent and \nnon-representative groupings. We have no doubt that, \nfor example, the G-20 has a useful and even essential \nrole to play in the global economy. There is an \nundeniable logic to a small group of the world\u2019s largest \neconomies, almost all of which are our close friends, \nmeeting informally to thrash out matters that affect \nonly their large economies. However, the logic fades \nsomewhat in the face of a crisis that has spread rapidly \nand comprehensively to every corner of the globe. \n That is why Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \nnoted with concern the G-20 statement from Pittsburgh \na year ago, which proclaimed, \u201cWe designated the  \nG-20 to be the premier forum for our international \neconomic cooperation\u201d. Our esteemed friend and \nbrother, President Obama of the United States, repeated \nthese sentiments from this podium a few days ago \nwhen he stated, \u201cwe made the Group of 20 the focal \npoint for international coordination\u201d (). \n Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was not \nincluded among the \u201cwe\u201d who established this role for \nthe G-20 in Pittsburg. Indeed, we, like 172 other \nMember States, were not admitted to the meeting, we \nsaw no agenda and we read no minutes of the decisions \nthat were taken. As dedicated champions of the Charter \nof the United Nations, we also note that Articles 1 and \n55 of that document designate the United Nations as \nthe forum for international economic cooperation and \nsolutions. \n Indeed, our caution towards the G-20 can be \nfound in President Obama\u2019s very endorsement of it. I \nshall quote again from his statement of a few days ago. \nHe said, \u201cbecause in a world where prosperity is more \ndiffuse, we must broaden our circle of cooperation to \ninclude emerging economies \u2014 economies from every \ncorner of the globe\u201d (ibid.). We could not agree more. \n In the wake of the worst financial crisis since the \nGreat Depression, 172 economies should not be locked \nout of economic discussions, waiting anxiously on the \ndoorstep of the G-20 for signals and policy shifts that \naffect our continued survival. We in the Caribbean \nhave been disproportionately and devastatingly \naffected by the crisis, which we played no role in \ncreating. Yet we have been forced to rely on friendly \nnations as interlocutors on our behalf. We remain \nconvinced that the deliberations and past decisions of \nthe G-20, from its misunderstanding of the precarious \nvulnerabilities of small, highly-indebted, middle-\nincome countries to its draconian outlook on offshore \nfinancial services \u2014 would have benefited from our \nperspective. \n We therefore call on the United Nations \nmembership to give meaning to the words of our \nCharter and to re-establish our body as a forum for \nmeaningful solutions and cooperation on economic \nmatters. We must reinvigorate the work of the \nEconomic and Social Council. We must renew the \nmandate of the ad hoc working group to decisively \nfollow up on the issues contained in the Outcome of \nthe Conference on the World Financial and Economic \nCrisis and its Impact on Development (see resolution \n63/303, annex). \n Good global governance must therefore be \npremised on global inclusiveness. This is our fifth \npoint: no corner of the world should be excluded from \nparticipation in our global family. \n In that regard, we once again highlight the case of \nour friends in Taiwan. The United Nations and its \nspecialized agencies must find ways to ensure the \nmeaningful participation of the 23 million people of \nTaiwan. Just as their economic strength has merited \ninclusion in the WTO and the universality of global \nhealth challenges have logically compelled their \nparticipation in the World Health Assembly, so too \nshould the global reach of climate change merit the \nmeaningful participation of Taiwan in the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \nThe interconnectedness of global air travel, and our \nshared safety concerns, similarly mandate the \n \n \n11 10-55408 \n \nparticipation of Taiwan in the International Civil \nAviation Authority. This is not the case of a tiny  \nnon-governmental organization, to be allowed or \ndenied meaningful participation on some bureaucratic \nwhim. This is a legitimate and vibrant expression of \nthe ancient and noble Chinese culture, with a \npopulation 200 times greater than that of Saint Vincent \nand the Grenadines. \n The Government and people of Taiwan have \nadvanced a reasonable and responsible policy of \nengagement to usher in a new era in cross-Strait \nrelations, and have an enviable record of development \ncooperation and assistance around the world. The \ninternational community can and should encourage and \nreward this responsible global citizenship with \nmeaningful participation in the relevant specialized \nagencies. \n Similarly, urgent and more inclusive reform in the \nmembership of the Security Council is the litmus test \nof our verbal commitments to governance, reform and \nrevitalization. There is simply no justification for the \ncontinued exclusion of the entire African continent or \nother significant and influential emerging powers from \npermanent membership in the Security Council. The \ndefenders of the status quo may soon find that they are \nprotecting an increasingly irrelevant and illegitimate \ninstitution. \n However, we feel that the Council is too \nimportant to be allowed to whither into obsolescence. \nReform and expansion of the permanent and  \nnon-permanent membership of the Security Council, \nincluding the provision of dedicated non-permanent \nmembership for small island developing States, is an \nimperative that is long past due. \n Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is proud to have \nannounced its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on \nthe Security Council for the 2020-2021 term. If \nsuccessful, we would be the smallest country ever, by \npopulation, to occupy such a position, and only the \nfourth of CARICOM\u2019s 14 United Nations Member \nStates to assume such a responsibility. Our bid is \npremised on the historical exclusion of CARICOM \nStates and small island developing States from this \ncritical body, and the value that we believe our \npresence and perspective will bring to the Council\u2019s \ndeliberations. \n Saint Vincent and the Grenadines makes \nminiscule monetary and military contributions to the \nUnited Nations. But our contribution to the \nmaintenance of international peace and security is \nmeasured in our historical aversion to wars, our culture \nof tolerance, peace and plurality and the perspective of \na small State that understands that peace is not always \nbest achieved with millions of dollars or armed \nenforcers, but often with dialogue and small but \nmeaningful peacebuilding actions. Our contribution is \nsuccinctly captured in our national motto, which, \ntranslated from Latin, reads simply \u201cPeace and \nJustice\u201d. \n Sixthly, and most important, we must never be \nshy to use this institution to operationalize our \ncommonly held ambitions for a better world and to \ntackle the global issues of our day. Too often, we spend \ntime lowering, rather than rising to meet, the \nexpectations of a world that is clamouring for our \ncollective leadership. \n Our continued failures to achieve a binding \nsolution on climate change mitigation and adaptation is \na case in point. In the months since the painful lessons \nof the so-called Copenhagen Accord, devastating \nfloods in Pakistan and heatwaves and fires in Russia \nhave shown us once again that no nation is immune \nfrom the reach and impact of climate change. But the \nvulnerability of large nations to ruinous hurricanes, \nfloods and fires does not approach the very unique and \nspecific existential vulnerabilities of small island \ndeveloping States. For, while all States are vulnerable \nto natural disasters, only small island developing States \nare threatened with being wiped off the map entirely \nand ceasing to exist. \n As such, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is not \ninterested in the lowering of expectations as we head to \nCanc\u00fan. The need for a binding and meaningful \nagreement on climate change cannot be deferred \nindefinitely. We view with disgust the transparent \nattempts to measure the financial or political cost of \ndoing what must be done to save our planet. We are \nthreatening to destroy our own world, as we \nshamelessly squabble over dollars and degrees. If we \nfail in this endeavour, history will look most \nunfavourably on the narrow, short-term interests that \nwe placed ahead of our own survival. \n In a similar vein, and in the interest of time, Saint \nVincent and the Grenadines echoes and adopts as our \nown the proposals enunciated by our CARICOM sister \nStates for prompt action on the global challenges of \n  \n \n10-55408 12 \n \nnon-communicable diseases, small arms, narcotics and \ntransnational crime, the decade-old Doha Development \nRound of trade negotiations, international cooperation \nin tax matters and concessional assistance and debt \nrelief for middle-income island States. We cannot allow \nnarrow ideological agendas to distract us or detract \nfrom the accomplishment of these tasks, upon which \nthere is broad agreement. \n Finally, a crucial component of the overarching \nprinciple of sovereign equality is that of sovereignty \nitself. We believe wholeheartedly that, in the words of \nthe great Caribbean singer and poet Bob Marley, \n\u201cevery man has a right to decide his own destiny\u201d. We \ntherefore reject, with equal fervour, any foreign or \noutside interference in the democratic processes of \nindependent States. This is a principle upon which we \nare unyielding. In many of our small countries, it takes \nonly a few minor mercenaries, or ideologically \nmisguided or misinformed millionaires, to \nfundamentally threaten the fabric of our fragile \ndemocracies. Unfortunately, those interlopers are often \naided and abetted by those unpatriotic opportunists \nwho see sovereignty as a fungible commodity, to be \nbartered and traded to the highest nefarious bidder for \nshort-term political gain. \n Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is populated by \na proud and noble people, with a history of fierce \nstruggle for freedom and independence. There is a steel \nin the psyche of our Caribbean civilization and its \nVincentian component; a steel forged in the fires of \nslavery and genocide and beaten on the anvil of \ncolonialism, exploitation and resistance. Our small size \nbelies our indomitable spirit. We possess an \nindependence that undergirds Cuba\u2019s heroic resistance \nto an unjust and internationally condemned blockade. \nWe have a strength that informs the nobility of the \nHaitian people\u2019s response to unimaginable tragedy. We \nlay claim to a resilience that is etched in our collective \nhistory, and reverberates in the names of our region\u2019s \nnational heroes, such as Nanny, Garvey, Bussa, Mart\u00ed, \nand Chatoyer, to name but a few. Our democracies can \nbe neither bought, sold nor intimidated. And our \ncommitment to the democratic inclusiveness of the \nUnited Nations and the supremacy of its Charter is \nsimilarly unshakeable. \n It is against that backdrop, Mr. President, that you \nwill find Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to be a \nstrong ally in your efforts to re-establish the central \nrole of this body in matters of global governance.

        "file_name": "ZWE_65_2010.txt",
        "file_text": "Allow me once again to \nextend to you, Sir, our warmest congratulations on \nyour election as President of General Assembly at its \nsixty-fifth session. I would, at the same time, like to \nassure you of Zimbabwe\u2019s support and cooperation \nduring your presidency. \n We are meeting today to reaffirm our \ncommitment to the United Nations and, in particular, to \nits comprehensive agenda for the promotion of peace \nand security, sustainable development and human \nrights. We are, however, concerned that the world \ntoday continues to witness unbridled acts of \naggression, wars, conflicts, terrorism and rising levels \nof poverty. We are also alarmed that powerful States, \nwhich daily preach peace and good governance, \ncontinue to trample with impunity upon the \nsovereignty of poor and weak nations. Zimbabwe \nyearns for a community of nations that recognizes and \nrespects the sovereign equality of all nations, big and \nsmall, in accordance with the Charter of the United \nNations. We all have positive roles to play in \npromoting peace and development for the benefit of \npresent and future generations. \n As Members of the United Nations, we have \nrecognized the pressing need to reform our \nOrganization to make it better able to carry out its \nvarious mandates. Zimbabwe stands ready to work \nclosely with you, Sir, as well as with other Member \nStates, to ensure that the reform process is speeded up \nand carried out on the basis of consensus and \ndemocratic participation.  \n Most immediately, we must find ways and means \nto re-establish and assert the pre-eminent role of the \nUnited Nations in advancing peace and security, \ndevelopment and the achievement of internationally \nagreed goals, particularly the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). Why are the developed Western \ncountries, especially those permanent members of the \nSecurity Council with the veto, resisting the \ndemocratization of the United Nations organs, \nespecially the Security Council? Are they not the ones \nwho talk glibly about democracy in regard to our \ndeveloping countries? Or are they sanctimonious \nhypocrites whose actions contradict their sermons to \nus? \n As we all know, the General Assembly is the \nmost representative organ of the United Nations. Its \nposition as the chief deliberative policymaking organ \nof the United Nations should therefore be respected. \nWe need to move with haste and find common ground \non how to revitalize the Assembly to enable it to fulfil \nits mandate as the most important body of the \nOrganization. Most important, this process of \nrevitalization must redress the continued encroachment \nby the Security Council on issues that fall within the \nGeneral Assembly\u2019s purview and competence. \n Our position on the reform of the Security \nCouncil is well known. It is completely unacceptable \nthat Africa remains the only continent without \npermanent representation on the Council. That \nhistorical injustice must be corrected. We therefore \nurge Member States, including those that have vested \ninterests in maintaining the status quo, to give due and \nfair consideration to Africa\u2019s legitimate demand for \ntwo permanent seats, with full powers of veto, plus two \nadditional non-permanent seats. Africa\u2019s plea for \njustice cannot continue to be ignored. We all have an \n  \n \n10-54965 8 \n \nobligation to make the Council more representative, \nmore democratic and more accountable. \n Zimbabwe continues to advocate greater equality \nin international economic relations and decision-\nmaking structures. We therefore recognize the \ncentrality of the United Nations in setting the global \ndevelopment agenda and believe that it is only a more \ncoherent United Nations system which can better \nsupport the realization of all the internationally agreed \ndevelopment goals. \n The developing world, particularly Africa, \ncontinues to suffer from the effects of the global \neconomic and financial crises. It is important to \nunderstand that the critical issues we face today cannot \nbe addressed effectively when so many countries and \nregions are left out of the key decision-making \nprocesses of the institutions of global governance. \n We need to participate in the making of policies \nand decisions that affect our very livelihoods. It is for \nthis reason that we have called, and continue to call, \nfor the reform of multilateral financial institutions, \nincluding the Bretton Woods institutions. \n It is clear that climate change is now one of the \nmost pressing global issues of our time. Copenhagen \nfailed to produce a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, an \noutcome that many of us had hoped for. Yet that \nConference was significant in its own way. It \ndemonstrated the futility of attempts by the rich and \npowerful to impose their views and policies on the \npoor and weak. \n What we need is not an imposition of solutions \nbased on self-interest, but a consensus on the reduction \nof harmful emissions and a climate-change regime that \nbalances adaptation and mitigation backed by the \ntransfer of technology and resources. \n We need to pay special attention to the three \npillars of sustainable development, namely, economic \ngrowth, social development and environmental \nprotection. In doing so, we should implement the \nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities. \nIt is our hope that when our negotiators meet in \nCanc\u00fan, Mexico, this December, they will produce an \noutcome that addresses the needs of those most \naffected by the effects of climate change. \n Global food security continues to be a matter of \ngreat concern, particularly in the light of increased \ndrought and flooding. We reiterate our call for an \nurgent and substantial increase in investment in \nagriculture in developing countries. Global efforts to \naddress the food crisis, the impact of climate change, \nand the drive to achieve the MDGs must go hand in \nhand. \n It is disappointing that the Doha Development \nRound has stalled, despite nine years of negotiations, \nmainly due to the intransigence of some countries. The \nDoha Round of trade must not be allowed to die but \nmust, instead, remain focused on development, as was \noriginally envisaged. \n We also call on the developed world to show \ncommitment to global food security by increasing trade \nand access to their markets. Developing countries need \nto break away from the unending cycle of humanitarian \nassistance, and this can be achieved if they have \nincreased access to developed- country markets. \n Zimbabwe strongly condemns the use of \nunilateral economic sanctions and other coercive \nmeasures in international relations. Such measures are \ncompletely at cross purposes with the principles of \ninternational cooperation as enshrined in the Charter of \nthe United Nations. I say this because my country \ncontinues to be a victim of illegal sanctions imposed by \nthe European Union and the United States without any \nreference to the United Nations and with the evil \nintention of causing regime change. These illegal \nsanctions have caused untold suffering among \nZimbabweans, who alone should be the deciders of \nregime change. \n Our Inclusive Government is united against these \nillegal sanctions and has made repeated appeals \nwithout success for their immediate and unconditional \nremoval. The rest of the international community, \nincluding the Southern African Development \nCommunity, the Common Market for Eastern and \nSouthern Africa and the African Union, has similarly \ncalled for the removal of the sanctions, but these calls \nhave gone unheeded. \n We urge those who imposed these iniquitous \nsanctions to heed the call by the international \ncommunity to unconditionally remove them. The \npeople of Zimbabwe should, like people of every other \nsovereign State, be left to freely chart their own \ndestiny. \n Every year, this body adopts a resolution on \nending the economic, commercial and financial \n \n \n9 10-54965 \n \nembargo imposed by the United States on Cuba. To this \ndate, those resolutions have gone unheeded by the \nUnited States and the result has been the continued \nsuffering of the people of Cuba. Zimbabwe joins the \nNon-Aligned Movement and other well-meaning \ncountries which call for the immediate lifting of the \nruinous embargo. \n Zimbabwe has expressed its concerns with regard \nto the continued stalemate in the Middle East peace \nprocess. It is unacceptable that, decades on, peace \ncontinues to elude that part of the world. We call upon \nall parties involved, particularly Israel, to respect the \nrelevant resolutions passed by the United Nations. It is \nour sincere hope that the current negotiations under \nway will be inclusive and eventually lead to the \ncherished goal of a sovereign State of Palestine, thus \nending decades of suffering for the Palestinian people. \n Since its inception in February 2009, our \nInclusive Government has fostered an environment of \npeace and stability. Several reforms have been \nimplemented, and the Government has created and \ninstituted constitutional bodies agreed to in the Global \nPolitical Agreement (GPA). The constitutional outreach \nprogramme is currently under way and upon its \nconclusion a new draft constitution will be formulated \nas precursor to a referendum next year, hopefully to be \nfollowed by an election. \n Achievements in the economic area include the \nrevitalization of capacity utilization in industries, the \ncontainment of inflation, improvement of service \ndelivery in health and education, as well as the \nrehabilitation of basic infrastructure such as roads, \nwater and sanitation facilities. The three parties to our GPA have worked hard to \nimplement most of the issues that we agreed on. To \nmaintain the momentum, we need the support of the \nregion and that of the international community. In this \nregard we commend the Southern African \nDevelopment Community, the African Union, the Non-\nAligned Movement and indeed like-minded members \nof the international community for giving us their \nsupport. We believe that constructive engagement, and \nnot isolation and punishment, will bring the necessary \nimpetus to the efforts of our inclusive Government. \nOur great country is indeed marching forward in peace \nand unity."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the \nGovernment and the people of the Republic of \nSuriname, I take this opportunity to congratulate \nMr. Joseph Deiss on his election to preside over this \nsixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am \npleased to see Switzerland, one of the newest members \nof the Organization, occupying this high office, \nespecially since his country has a long-standing and \nconstructive record regarding international neutrality \nand respect for international order. I am convinced that \nhis diplomatic experience, as well as his well-known \nin-depth knowledge of current international issues, will \nenable him to successfully discharge the important \nresponsibilities of his office. As one of the Vice-Chairs, \nSuriname pledges its full support for his work agenda \nfor this session. \n I wish to express our appreciation to Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki for his unwavering efforts in \nsteering the Assembly\u2019s work at its sixty-fourth \nsession. \n I also pay tribute to the Secretary-General, \nMr. Ban Ki-Moon, for his leadership and guidance of \nthis Organization throughout the past years of crisis \nand turbulence. \n It is a great honour for me today to address the \nAssembly, as a leader who recently received a mandate \nfrom the Surinamese people to realize sustainable \neconomic and social development through our own \nefforts and with the support of all friendly nations. \n Twenty-seven years ago I had the honour to \naddress the Assembly. I then stated: \n \u201cby the same token, we are dismayed by the fact \nthat, in spite of the presence of the Organization \non the international scene for almost four \ndecades, its lofty goal of creating an international \norder based on respect for international law and \nthe peaceful settlement of disputes seems today to \nbe as elusive as ever\u201d. (A/38/PV.28) \nToday we can conclude that things have not \nfundamentally changed. \n The challenge we face is that of striking a proper \nbalance between full recognition of the sovereignty of \nthe individual Member States of the United Nations \nand the apparent need for global governance regarding \nthe global issues that endanger the very survival of our \nplanet and its inhabitants. We are not there yet. It has \nbecome obvious to Suriname that this balance can be \nachieved only when participants in the international \narena refrain from using military force and/or \neconomic coercion. We have even seen States abuse \ntheir own legal system to force their political will on \nanother nation. \n Restricting ourselves to the Caribbean region, the \nRepublic of Suriname is deeply concerned about the \npersistence of the imposition for almost half a century \nof the economic, commercial and financial embargo \nimposed against Cuba with the aim of changing \ndevelopments of that nation\u2019s political, economic and \nsocial road map. Those coercive measures cause \nunnecessary hardship and have severe effects on the \nrightful development and well-being of the Cuban \npeople. Suriname therefore joins Member States which \nsince 1992 have consistently been calling in vain for \nthe rejection of the unilaterally imposed embargo \nagainst Cuba. As is the case on the national level, the \ninternational community will prosper only when all \nvalues protected by the rule of law are distributed \nequally, notwithstanding the asymmetry that \ncharacterizes international relations. \n \n \n13 10-55103 \n \n My country finds itself at a crossroads in its \nhistory. The electorate gave its leaders a mission to \ncreate a society in which everyone participates and \neveryone shares in what the country has to offer, \nmeeting their basic material means, and in which \nsolidarity prevails. The aim is the creation of a just \nsociety in which people can develop themselves to \ntheir highest potential and become international role \nmodels and leaders in areas in which our society \nexcels. No one will be left behind in this task of \nnation-building. My Government pledges not to waste, \nbut to protect, our national inheritance and assets for \nfuture generations and the world. Moreover, we will \nseize every opportunity to generate greater national \nwealth. \n We will devote special attention to groups who in \nthe past have had limited scope for development. In \nthis regard, I refer to our indigenous peoples and our \ncountrymen living in tribal communities. Our intention \nis to gradually break the cycle of their isolation and \nconsiderably improve their quality of life. \n When we look at the many national challenges \nfacing us, it is clear that our task will not be easy. In \nalmost all sectors of the economy and society we have \nsuffered enormous neglect, and there has been a \ndecline, stagnation and reversal of national growth. As \na result, today many segments of our society have \nbecome desperate and hopeless. We therefore need a \nbold new visionary approach to give our people what \nthey justly deserve as co-owners of a nation endowed \nand blessed with so many riches. \n However, we need to overcome two huge \nchallenges that since decolonization have haunted and \nblighted our national destiny as a people. \n First, we must dismantle any lingering remnants \nof the colonial police State which blocks and obstructs \nthe establishment of a free, democratic, constitutional \nState based on the pillars of an independent judiciary, a \nGovernment free of corruption, a legislature that acts \nin the interests of the people, and a free and \nindependent press committed to the honest \ndissemination of information. \n Another major challenge that we face is the \ntransformation of our society from an economy which \nis merely a source of profit for foreign interest groups \ninto one that is based and built on a healthy \ninterdependence. Suriname needs a new national \neconomic approach created by Surinamers and for \nSurinamers. \n We realize that we are part of the global \ncommunity, which as a result of technology is \ngradually turning into a global village, fostering \nintensive relations in both a negative and a positive \nsense. Despite all the resources and knowledge at our \ndisposal, we are still faced with what seems an \ninsurmountable challenge: to rid the world of extreme \npoverty, to ensure adequate education for our children, \nto stem the tide of infectious and other diseases, or to \ntake responsible decisions on environmental \nsustainability. We have to recognize that with today\u2019s \ninterdependence many challenges transcend national \nborders and that the ability of countries, in particular \ndeveloping countries, to make progress on many of the \ninternational development goals does not merely \ndepend on domestic policy choices. An international \nenabling environment in this regard is of increased \nsignificance. \n Climate change is a global threat that will affect \ndeveloping countries in a most devastating way. \nSuriname, with its low-lying coast, belongs to the top \n10 countries which will be seriously affected by sea-\nlevel rise. This is ironic, because we are not culpable \nfor the excessive levels of greenhouse gases in the \natmosphere, but we are about to bear a heavy part of \nthe brunt. \n According to the United Nations Environment \nProgramme, global biodiversity loss is high, so high \nthat 2010 has been declared the International Year of \nBiodiversity by the United Nations in order to attract \nattention to this global problem. In this respect, \nSuriname could serve as an example for the world, as \nits laws to save forest and biodiversity date from the \nmiddle of the past century. We are proud to state here \ntoday that Suriname is rightly called the greenest \ncountry on Earth for its 90 per cent forest cover. \n That having been said, it is ironic that a country \nsuch as Suriname, with such a good environmental \ntrack record, is overlooked and that the world\u2019s efforts \nare concentrated on countries that are using their \nresources unsustainably, thereby sending the wrong \nmessage globally. We believe that we should tackle this \nproblem head on, starting at home, moving towards our \nimmediate neighbours and from there to the subregion \nof South America and the Caribbean, thus creating a \n  \n \n10-55103 14 \n \nsubstantial force at the world forum dealing with the ill \neffects of climate change. \n It seems that the standing forest and the wealth of \nSuriname\u2019s biodiversity are being taken for granted by \nthe global community, as there are no structures in \nplace to provide incentives to continue on the path of \nsustainability. Despite that, we promise that our \nchoices for development will duly respect a proper \nbalance between nature and development. \n Various high-level meetings have been organized \nto address issues of common concern, such as the fight \nagainst HIV/AIDS, the negative effects of climate \nchange, arms proliferation, the effects of the global \neconomic and financial crisis and transnational \norganized crime and its associated ills. \n At this time it is necessary to draw special \nattention to the issue of non-communicable diseases, \nwhich is of great concern to all of us. The initiative of \nCaribbean Community leaders, subsequently endorsed \nby the Commonwealth, to organize a high-level \nmeeting of the General Assembly in 2011 to address \nthe rising incidence and prevalence of \nnon-communicable diseases is very important. It \nhighlights the ever-growing need for the international \ncommunity to join forces in addressing this global \nbarrier to development. \n Although non-communicable diseases are \ncurrently not a part of the indicators for assessing \nprogress in the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), they undoubtedly have a \nnegative impact on those Goals. We can no longer \nignore this emerging health crisis, which \ndisproportionately impacts the poorest people, pushing \nthem further into poverty and deprivation. Therefore, \nthe global development agenda needs to include \nmeasures to address this problem, if we do not wish to \njeopardize the accelerated achievement of the MDGs \nby 2015. \n We are aware of poverty and extreme human \nsuffering resulting from natural disasters. We \nempathize with the peoples of Haiti, Pakistan, China, \nChile and all other countries where major weather \npatterns have wreaked havoc. Suriname is of the \nopinion that all nations should effectively and \nadequately contribute to the alleviation of the dire \nneeds of our fellow citizens of the world. These people \ndeserve more than expressions of sympathy; they \ndeserve to see that promises made to them are kept. \n Finally, we want to share our thoughts on the \nstructural causes of poverty and the resulting ill effects \non societies. My Government believes that education \nrelated to survival skills and production is the only way \nto effectively eradicate poverty. Money given to poor \npeople for the sake of one\u2019s own conscience is an \nabsolute waste. Accordingly, we ask ourselves whether \nwe should continue to use the phraseology \u201cfighting \npoverty\u201d or should instead start talking about pursuing \nwealth. Therefore, the slogan of my country in our \nlingua franca is: \u201cBroko a pina, tek yu gudu\u201d, which \nmeans \u201cBreak away from poverty, by pursuing wealth\u201d."

        "file_text": "Our \ngoals at the national level are goals we also want to see \nachieved in the international community. They are \ngoals that the international community must tackle as \npriorities. They include eradicating indigence and \nreducing and eliminating poverty and its root causes, as \nwell as ensuring a dignified life and favourable \nworking conditions for all. We also want an \ninternational system that is more democratic and \nefficient. We want the issues that I have mentioned to \nbe resolved through cross-cutting policies. We can \nwork to promote democracy in every country of the \nsystem, but we are badly off indeed if the law of the \nstrongest prevails in the overall system.  \n Uruguay will always take a moral and ethical \napproach to every issue, whether with regard to the \nenvironment, human rights or international security. In \nevery instance, the ultimate guide is the human person. \nWe must in the end, therefore, always rely on our \nconscience. However, the functioning of the system is \ncrucial, for that is what generates social, territorial and \ngender inequality. \n At the outset, we welcome the election of the \nArgentine Republic as Chair of the Group of 77 and \nChina. Argentina is a brotherly country that shares \ncommon principles and values with us. \n Uruguay, in keeping with its historical path and \ntraditions, reaffirms its commitment to the principles of \ninternational law. I would like to underscore in \nparticular our firm support for the peaceful solution of \nconflicts; the sovereign equality of States; the \nprinciples of non-intervention and of the self-\ndetermination of peoples; respect for human rights; \ninternational socio-economic cooperation; and \nmultilateralism. The maximum expression of those \nprinciples is to be found in this Organization. \n I would also like to express our rejection of the \nuse or the threat of use of force, of terrorism and of all \ntypes of violence, and of the application of coercive \nmeasures in contravention of the Charter of the United \nNations, such as the economic, financial and trade \nembargo against Cuba by the United States, which we \nfirmly reject. That unilateral measure is contrary, not \nonly to the Charter but also to international law and to \none of the most dearly held principles of my country\u2019s \nforeign policy, namely, the peaceful settlements of \ndisputes. \n Uruguay is party to the principal international \nconventions relating to the environment and \nsustainable development. Thus, we have reaffirmed our \nresponsibility for the protection of the environment as \na human right and a fundamental component for \nachieving truly sustainable development. \n Uruguay has a long history of defending, \npromoting and protecting human rights and \ninternational humanitarian law. Those principles are a \ncentral priority of the State, enshrined in the traditional \npillars of the Republic\u2019s foreign policy, which \nconstitute the political and institutional foundations of \nthe country. We welcome the progress made this year \nin Kampala, Uganda, which has led to the \nstrengthening of the regime established under the \nStatute of the International Criminal Court. Uruguay is \namong the countries that have subscribed to the widest \nrange of conventions in the area of human rights and \ninternational humanitarian law. \n Uruguay\u2019s long-standing tradition of defending \nthose principles has allowed us to take a leading role \nin, among other areas, the protection and promotion of \nthe rights of children. We believe it is vitally important \nthat we continue to focus our efforts to promote the \ndefence and protection of children and to ensure their \nwell-being. \n We also reaffirm our full support for the \nintegration of a gender perspective into all policies and \nprogrammes of the United Nations system. In that \nrespect, we welcome the adoption of the resolution \n(resolution 64/289) on the coherence of the United \nNations system, which, in particular, created the new \nUnited Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the \nEmpowerment of Women. We would also like to \nexpress our satisfaction with the appointment of  \n  \n \n10-55396 6 \n \nMs. Michelle Bachelet, former President of Chile, as \nUnder-Secretary-General for UN Women. We are \nconfident that her experience will serve as a vital asset \nfor the new Entity. \n Uruguay has a steadfast commitment to the cause \nof peace and our country\u2019s foreign policy bears \ntestimony to that fact. We have given decisive support \nto all measures aimed at the elimination of nuclear \narms and other weapons of mass destruction. We have \nalso advocated the control and reduction of \nconventional weapons. We underscore, once again, the \nimportance of the swift universal implementation of \nthese agreements. \n Likewise, and without prejudice to the \nreaffirmation of our hope to see a Nuclear Weapons \nConvention, we believe that the entry into force of the \nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and a fissile \nmaterial cut-off treaty during the present year, would \nconstitute decisive steps in the consolidation and \ndeepening of the progress made in the area of \ndisarmament. We must not stop, because to stop is to \ngo backwards, and to go backwards is to expose \nhumanity to the horrendous and unacceptable risk of \nnuclear holocaust. \n It is our hope that, in 2012, a conference will be \nheld, without further delay or conditions, in which all \nof the States of the Middle East will participate, with \nthe aim of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone, \nfree of all other weapons of mass destruction as well, \nthrough freely agreed arrangements between the States \nof the region, with the full support and commitment of \nthose States that possess nuclear weapons. Similarly, \nUruguay supports the Secretary-General\u2019s five-point \ninitiative for a world free of nuclear weapons. \n Uruguay actively participates in the United \nNations multilateral system of peacekeeping and \nmaintenance of international security, as well as in \nefforts to defend human rights and uphold international \nhumanitarian law through peacekeeping operations, \nbased on our conviction that these are a solid testimony \nto the collective commitment of the international \ncommunity as a whole. That commitment on the part of \nmy country can be seen both on the ground, through \nour deployment of more than 2,500 Blue Helmets, \ndeployed principally in Haiti and the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, and in its work on the political \nlevel here at Headquarters. \n We recognize that the Security Council holds the \nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. But we believe it is \nextremely important to promote a closer relationship \nbetween the Council and the General Assembly. The \ngreater the distance between them, the more difficult it \nis for peacekeeping operations to achieve their \nobjectives and for their complex mandates to be \neffectively implemented. \n In this respect, the existing gap between the \ncomplexity of the mandates and the resources available \nposes a challenge that we must confront every day. We \nare convinced that is of fundamental importance for us \nto ensure that adequate consideration is given to the \nallocation of the resources needed for the proper \nfunctioning of those operations. The conditions offered \nby the system also need to be updated, so that the \nUnited Nations has at its disposal the equipment and \nhuman resources that it needs. That subject affects \ndeveloping countries in particular, since it is they \nwhich provide the large majority of the troops and thus \nthe viability of their participation in missions is at \nstake. \n The case of Haiti probably provides one of the \nbest illustrations of the need for a cross-cutting \npolitical effort to lift a country out of a situation of \ncrisis and institutional and social stagnation. \n Uruguay has never been indifferent to the \nchallenges that this brotherly country has had to \nconfront and continues to confront today. From 2004 to \ndate, we have deployed more than 10,000 military \npersonnel to the United Nations Stabilization Mission \nin Haiti, who have faithfully carried out the mandate \napproved by the Security Council for the stabilization \nprocess in that country. \n In its role as coordinator of the Group of Friends \nof Haiti, Uruguay has for some years been advocating \nfor a mandate that, without neglecting the urgent \nsecurity needs, permits at the same time the \nestablishment of the conditions necessary for \nstrengthening the productive capacity of the country, \nwhich was seriously affected by the earthquake of  \n12 January 2010. \n In our view, greater emphasis should be placed on \nproviding teachers, doctors, engineers, agronomists, \nexperts in information technologies and volunteer \nworkers, who could contribute effectively to solving \nthe problems of the Haitian population. Investing in \n \n \n7 10-55396 \n \nhuman resources in Haiti is of fundamental importance \nfor the future development of the country. \n Over the past two years, there has been an open \nprocess of restructuring the peacekeeping system, \nwhich was necessary given the new reality that we are \nfacing. That process must be viewed as part of a larger \nproject of reform of the Organization, which, through \nvarious initiatives, seeks to be more effective, to work \nin a more coordinated manner and to enjoy greater \nlegitimacy. \n Uruguay reiterates its adherence to that process \nof reform of the United Nations. The process, begun \nduring the 2005 Summit, which gave rise to the creation \nof two new structures within the Organization \u2014 the \nHuman Rights Council and the Peacebuilding \nCommission \u2014 should be brought to completion \nthrough the consideration of various outstanding \ntopics, including the reform of the Security Council. \nThe current international reality is such that that body \nneeds to be more representative and democratic. We \nmust therefore take steps to effect its expansion, while \nguarding against an extension of the historical \nobstacles that run contrary to the principle of the \nsovereign equality of States, such as the right of veto. \n A very clear example of Uruguay\u2019s commitment \nto the United Nations reform process, which seeks to \nestablish greater effectiveness and coordination within \nthe system, is its direct participation in the \u201cDelivering \nas One\u201d programme. Three years after the pilot \nprogramme was launched in Uruguay, we have recently \ncompleted the country evaluation and can affirm that \nthe design, implementation, follow-up and evaluation \nof the process have contributed to the national \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to strengthen the coordination \namong the various State bodies through a joint \nprogramming exercise, which made possible greater \ninteraction between agencies, the Government and the \nUnited Nations system. \n Uruguay has formally expressed its aspiration to \noccupy a seat as a non-permanent member of the \nSecurity Council for the period 2016-2017. We are the \nonly candidate country in the region at the present \ntime. Since its accession to the United Nations as a \nfounding Member and despite having pursued a foreign \npolicy inspired by the same purposes, principles and \nideals enshrined in the United Nations Charter, \nUruguay has occupied a seat in the Security Council \nonly once, which was during the period 1965-1966. \n Presenting one\u2019s candidacy to the body in which \nthe international community has entrusted the current \nglobal collective security system constitutes the most \ndemanding test of a State\u2019s foreign policy. In the \npresent context, which is profoundly marked by \nmultiple global crises, it is imperative that we work \njointly towards building long-term strategies and \nsolutions that will lead us to more just and equitable \nsocieties. \n In that regard, the role of the United Nations in \ninternational economic and financial governance is \nfundamental in terms of democratizing decision-\nmaking and ensuring equal participation in global \ndecisions that affect us all and directly impact strategic \nplanning in the short, medium and long term. \nCoordinated, transparent and harmonious decision-\nmaking is essential for achieving tangible results that \nimprove the living conditions and situation of the \nworld\u2019s citizens. Our country deems it important to \npromote dialogue in order to foster bridge-building \namong the various decision-making forums.  \n We must be aware that without a healthy natural \nenvironment, all other development efforts will have a \nlimited effect. In that context, the global phenomenon \nof climate change is perhaps the most urgent and \ndramatic challenge currently facing humanity. It poses \nadditional challenges to development and forces us to \nurgently consider the need to implement measures to \nadapt to and mitigate its adverse effects. Such \nmeasures require changes in production methods and \nseriously compromise the distribution of domestic \nresources. \n Achieving sustainable development that takes \ninto account the economic, social and environmental \ndimensions is fundamental to ensuring long-term \nresults and a healthy environment for present and \nfuture generations as well as sustained economic \ngrowth. That goal is also a necessary precondition for \nreducing disparities between the developed world and \nthe developing world, particularly in the quality of life, \nincome distribution and human development \nindicators. \n In closing, Uruguay would like to reaffirm the \nimperative necessity of renewed political commitment \naimed at achieving an open and equitable multilateral \ntrade system based on clear rules that would permit all \ncountries to benefit from the potential provided by \ninternational trade as the engine of development. \n  \n \n10-55396 8 \n \nHunger eradication, food production and agricultural \ntrade are closely related and must be strengthened \nthrough a predictable multilateral system that provides \nguarantees to producers and ensures food availability \nto the most vulnerable sectors. In that context, the \nelimination of subsidies and other non-tariff barriers \nthat hinder access to markets is essential, as is a \nsuccessful conclusion of the Doha Round based on a \ndevelopment perspective."

        "file_text": "I congratulate you, Sir, on your election to \npreside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \nsession. We fully endorse your proposal to analyse the \ncentral role of the United Nations in global \ngovernance. The United Nations is the international \nforum in which to exchange ideas and adopt measures \nthat strengthen the pillars upon which our governance \nstands. \n Panama\u2019s geography has allowed my country to \nserve as a bridge between and meeting point of the \nmost diverse cultures and civilizations. Thanks to the \ndiscovery of our special privileged position in 1513 \nand the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, today \nwe connect Europe, the Americas and the East. That is \nhow our story has been written. Five hundred years \nlater, we are still working for the benefit of the world\u2019s \nmaritime commerce. \n Our ethnic diversity is a symbol and example of \nour national unity. Panama is committed to promoting \neconomic growth and social justice. We make possible \nthe peaceful coexistence of all ethnicities and creeds. \nWe Panamanians love peace, and we manage our canal \nwith scrupulous careful neutrality. Our foreign policy \nis defined by respect, the defence and promotion of \ndemocracy, human rights, and international peace and \ninternational security, all within the framework of the \ndoctrine of human security. \n Panama has played an active role in favour of the \ninternational community at important United Nations \nforums. Among these are the Security Council, the \nCommission on Human Rights, the Human Rights \nCommittee, and the Committee on the Elimination of \nDiscrimination against Women. Our pacifism does not \n \n \n21 10-54833 \n \nimply passivity in the face of situations that affect \ninternational security and the governance of peoples. \nChange is in the air all over the globe. People demand \neven more of their public servants. Our political and \ndiplomatic activities are founded on the principles of \ninternational cooperation and the strengthening of \nglobal multilateralism. \n Trafficking in drugs, weapons, human organs and \npersons \u2014 associated with illegal migration \u2014 as well \nas money-laundering, banditryism and terrorism are the \nwork of criminal organizations that seek to destabilize \nour democracies. The trafficking and illegal possession \nof weapons have a devastating effect on human \nsecurity and governance in our countries. \n For Panama and the Central American region, \ndrugs are our weapons of mass destruction and are a \nvital issue. Drug traffickers filter through our land and \nsea borders, polluting our young people with their \npoison. Additionally, our region is being used by \nnetworks of human traffickers that steer mixed \nmigratory flows of persons from other continents \nthrough our borders. \n In the face of these challenges, my country and \nthe other members of the Central American Integration \nSystem have decided to create a regional security \ncoordination centre. These regional efforts to fight \ntransnational organized crime, based in my country, are \nalready yielding encouraging results. \n We understand that it is vital to work jointly to \nimprove the functioning of international institutions, \nfor the benefit of humanity. In this regard, I find it a \nvery positive sign for the region that President Porfirio \nLobo of Honduras is participating fully in this \nAssembly. In order to count on a world that is more \nstable and secure, we must set aside our differences. \nStability requires us to work together to strengthen \nhuman security, both regionally and globally. \n Globalization has entered a period of \nconvergence among the diverse various economies; this  \nwill continue for some years. While the previous stage \nof globalization lasted some 60 years, we believe that \nthe one that began in 1990 will conclude its \nreadjustments by mid-century. It is also necessary to \nnote that as a result of this process of convergence, we \nhave suffered during the past two years the effects of a \nsignificant crisis. \n This global crisis demands newer and better \nforms of government for our societies. This global \ncrisis demands the expansion of our markets and better \nmanagement of our intergovernmental relations. In this \ncontext, we appreciate the efforts towards developing \nthe exchange of goods, workers, tourists and \ninvestments across the China Straits, which offer a new \nthrust to achieving the full potential of our trade \nrelations with that region. \n For its part, Panama is also expanding its trade \nrelations through the negotiation of free trade \nagreements with Peru and Colombia. We are also \nactively pursuing free trade agreements negotiated with \nCanada, and the United States of America and an \nassociation agreement between Central America and \nthe European Union. Accordingly, I wish to take this \nopportunity to ask for the support of all Governments \ninvolved, with a view toward their approval and \nratification of all these treaties. \n We are on the threshold of an era of economic \ngrowth and opportunity in Latin America. Thus, we \nrenew our commitment to a more just and inclusive \nfree trade that offers economic opportunities and \nprosperity to all our peoples. With change and reform \nsweeping the region, we have more than enough \nreasons to promote a new age of cooperation and \nworking together. Together, we can seize this \nopportunity and successfully face our common \nchallenges. \n Panama enjoys very healthy and strong relations \nwith its main partner, the United States of America \u2014 a \npartner that is committed to our region\u2019s success. Such \nan engaged partner is crucial for the region\u2019s success. \nOn both trade and security issues, the United States is \nand always has been an ally and a willing friend. \n Additionally, we understand that for the \ncomprehensive development of trade relations and the \nstrengthening of our economies, more measures are \nrequired to ensure effective tax collection. To this end, \nPanama has signed agreements to avoid double \ntaxation and prevent tax evasion. This is part of a \nnational strategy that seeks to strengthen transparency \nand the competitiveness of our country\u2019s international \nservices. We have already signed agreements with \nMexico, Barbados and Portugal, and a while ago with \nthe State of Qatar. We have also concluded negotiations \nwith Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, France, \nLuxembourg, the Republic of Korea and Singapore. \n  \n \n10-54833 22 \n \n We want to offer the Panamanian experience as \nan example to the world. It is an economic story of \nreform at home along with strong international trade \nand business relations across the region; these have had \nexcellent results and have proved fruitful. \n The Government of Panama welcomes the \nadoption of resolution 65/1, entitled \u201cKeeping the \npromise: \u2014 united to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals\u201d, and, at the same time, we \nreaffirm our commitment to that document. \n In a little less than a year in Government, we \nhave developed structural reforms and programmes to \nmeet the needs of our people, focusing particularly on \nsociety\u2019s most vulnerable groups. Among these \nprogrammes, allow me to highlight one that consists of \ngrants to elderly people who lack retirement funds or \npensions. Additionally, we have established a system of \nuniversal scholarships to support our young people \nwith a monthly stipend from the first to the twelfth \ngrades. Whether the student attends a public school or \na private school with modest tuition fees, the State is \nreducing the dropout rate and strengthening \nrelationships among teachers, parents and students. \n Moreover, in December 2009, we decreed the \nhighest largest minimum wage increase in the past \n50 years. We are thus helping workers in the private \nand public sectors who were earning very low wages. \nAdditionally, we established a solidarity fund to assist \nPanamanians of limited means in buying their first \nhome. \n Panama will invest more than $13 billion in \npublic infrastructure over the next five years. This \neffort will include the building of hospitals, the \ndevelopment of roads, the expansion of Tocumen \nInternational Airport, the building of other airports, and \nthe establishment of the MetroBus, as well as the \nconstruction of a modern subway system in Panama \nCity. That first subway line will raise the quality of life \nfor Panamanian families, who will thus have more time \nto share and strengthen family values. \n These projects, together with the expansion of the \nCanal and the responsible and sustainable exploitation \nof our natural resources, will cost more than $20 \nbillion in the coming years and will generate thousands \nof jobs that the country so sorely needs. All of these \npublic works projects will be developed with the \nhighest environmental standards and will contribute to \na more dynamic economy for Panama and the region as \na whole. \n The theme chosen for this debate could not be \nmore appropriate; we concur that the United Nations \nhas a calling to play a central role in global \ngovernance. To that end, we need to deepen the process \nof reforms begun within the Organization. Panama is \ncommitted to making its contribution to this process, \nplacing its geographical position and its logistics \ninfrastructure at the service of the Organization. \n In this regard, my Government has two key \nprojects, namely, the establishment of a United Nations \ninter-agency centre for Latin America and the \nCaribbean and the creation of a regional logistics \ncentre for humanitarian assistance, both to be located \nin Panama. The first will promote more coherence and \nsynergy between all regional offices, with greater \nefficiency in the use of resources. The second will \nimprove the regional capacity to respond to natural \ndisasters and humanitarian crises, and will be the site \nof warehouses for the United Nations, and the Red \nCross and Red Crescent. \n We reaffirm our conviction that the United \nNations is the international forum for the exchange of \nideas and for adopting measures that strengthen the \npillars upon which world governance rests. The United \nNations is also a forum of goodwill where nations can \nwork together on shared goals. In our region that \nmeans jobs, opportunity and security for our peoples. It \nalso means modernizing economies, reforming the \nGovernment, and ensuring social well-being. \n Panama is a good example of this success. Today, \nmy country reaffirms its belief in and solidarity with \nthe United Nations system. I say this unambiguously \nand with great certainty. We are fully prepared and \nwilling to offer all the peoples of the planet the best \npossible service and utility and, as a product of that, to \ndevelop our citizens. That is Panama\u2019s mission, and we \nwill accomplish it."

        "file_text": "At the outset, \nI would like to join previous speakers in addressing our \nsincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \nsession and to assure you of the full support of our \ndelegation. \n This year, the general debate is being held on the \neve of the sixty-fifth anniversary of the entry into force \nof the United Nations Charter, which laid the \nfoundation of our Organization. For more than six \ndecades, the United Nations has been tested by \nnumerous challenges and crises. Today, we can proudly \nstate that it has proven its relevance, importance and \nvision for humankind. \n We extend our appreciation to Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon for his tireless efforts in steering the \nwork of this global Organization and addressing \ncritical international issues. We commend his \nengagement in convening the High-level Plenary \nMeeting on the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs), during which Member States, including my \nown country, assessed the progress achieved and the \nnumerous challenges we face in implementing the \nMDGs. \n The Republic of Moldova is committed to the \naccomplishment of the MDGs by 2015. As a member \nof the Economic and Social Council, Moldova \npresented its comprehensive national voluntary report \non the MDGs during the Council\u2019s annual ministerial \nreview meeting in July. The inclusion of the MDGs in \nour national policies and their effective implementation \nare among my Government\u2019s main priorities. I take this \nopportunity to express our appreciation to the \norganizations of the United Nations system for their \nsupport in reaching the Goals. \n The economic and financial crises that beset the \ninternational community have been exacerbated by \nfood insufficiency and natural disasters, local and \nregional conflicts, terrorism and transborder \ncriminality. The issues on the agenda of the United \nNations reflect modern realities and challenges. I \nwould like to bring to the Assembly\u2019s attention a few \nareas that are of the utmost importance, namely, human \nrights and democracy, welfare and sustainable \ndevelopment, climate change, peace and security and, \nlast but not least, the reform of the United Nations. \n Building a state of law lies at the heart of the \noverall activities of the Moldovan Government. The \ndevelopment of legal and institutional frameworks in \nthe area of human rights and strengthening human \nrights protection mechanisms are among our \nGovernment\u2019s main objectives. While our country is \ncharacterized by diversity and multiculturalism and \n  \n \n10-55408 2 \n \nintercultural and interreligious dialogue, we reiterate \nour commitment to fighting extremism, xenophobia \nand other forms of racism and discrimination.  \n Our country became a member of the Human \nRights Council for the first time in 2010. Our \nmembership is in line with Moldova\u2019s irreversible \ncourse towards protecting human rights and \nfundamental freedoms. We assumed the commitment to \ncontribute to the prevention of human rights violations \nthrough our active participation in the Council\u2019s \nactivities. We will present our first national report \nunder the Universal Periodic Review mechanism in \n2011. \n I would also like to point out that Moldova is a \nState party to nearly all multilateral treaties in the field \nof human rights within the United Nations system. Last \nweek, we deposited with the Secretary-General our \nratification document on the Convention on the Rights \nof Persons with Disabilities. We will soon become a \nfull-fledged member of the International Criminal \nCourt (ICC), following the recent ratification by the \nParliament of the Republic of Moldova of the Rome \nStatute of the ICC. \n We express our solidarity with the appeals \narticulated in various United Nations forums that more \nbe invested in the advancement of women. We support \nthe Secretary-General\u2019s Global Strategy for Women\u2019s \nand Children\u2019s Health. Likewise, we are confident that \nthe new entity, UN Women, will contribute to the \nconsolidation of international efforts to achieve the \ngoals of equality and advancement for all women. \n Although the impact of the global economic crisis \nhas had a negative effect on the economy of the \nRepublic of Moldova, including on the achievement of \nMDG targets, the crisis has also constituted a turning \npoint in starting new economic reforms, building up \ninnovative partnerships and mobilizing all national \nstakeholders in order to create a sustainable economic \nand social system. To that end, the Government has \nproceeded to change the country\u2019s development \nparadigm to an economy based on investments, \ninnovations and competitiveness, creating new jobs \nand undertaking robust measures in the area of poverty \nreduction. \n Those goals will not be achieved unless we create \na healthy and eco-friendly environment while putting \nin place a sound infrastructure that protects our wealth \nand families from natural disasters. In recent years, \nMoldova has confronted considerable natural \ncalamities, from acute droughts to harsh floods, whose \ndevastating impact and frequency have increased each \nyear. The harm caused to the population, agricultural \nand food production sectors and the overall economy is \nimmeasurable. \n On behalf of my Government, I would like to \nexpress our sincere gratitude to our development \npartners and to Governments and multilateral \norganizations for their prompt response and assistance \nin overcoming the consequences of the severe floods \nthat affected our country last summer. I would also like \nto extend our particular gratitude to the United Nations \nOffice in Moldova for its support in assessing post-\ndisaster needs. For its part, my country has also \nextended a helping hand to others in need, contributing \n$100,000 to the people of Haiti. \n We believe that the adoption of a post-Kyoto \ntreaty is more relevant and vital than ever before. We \nhave to address the challenge of climate change with a \nsynergy of national and integrated international \nresponses. We look forward to a positive outcome to \nthe forthcoming Conference in Canc\u00fan. \n The latest global crises have emphasized the \ncentral role the United Nations is to play in the \nmobilization of efforts by the international community \nand, more than ever, the need to increase the efficiency \nof the Organization. Efforts to strengthen the \nmultilateral potential of the United Nations should be \npragmatically adapted to the new realities, enhancing \nits influence in strict accordance with the United \nNations Charter. The United Nations system therefore \nought to be optimized by strengthening its main and \nsubsidiary bodies in order to avoid duplication by \ndifferent United Nations structures. In addition to \nincreasing the efficiency and effectiveness of United \nNations activities, that reform will save significant \nresources, which can be redirected to priority areas \nwhere the Organization\u2019s support is most needed. \n A major component of the United Nations revival \nis the reform of the Security Council. We welcome the \nresults achieved during the intergovernmental \nnegotiations and believe that the success of the reform \nrequires political commitment by all Member States. \nWe share the view that Council membership should be \nexpanded in both categories and that one additional \nnon-permanent seat should be allocated to the Eastern \nEuropean Group. \n \n \n3 10-55408 \n \n The importance of cooperation to enhance \ninternational security, promote disarmament and  \nnon-proliferation and counter international terrorism \nhas been stressed by many speakers in the Hall. The \nterrorist acts occurring in different parts of the world \ndemonstrate that terrorism continuously threatens \ninternational security, fundamental democratic values \nand human rights. The Republic of Moldova condemns \nterrorism and extremism in all its forms and expresses \nits entire support for the implementation of the United \nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. \n After many years of deadlock, significant \nprogress in disarmament and non-proliferation in all its \naspects was made this year. The new United States-\nRussia START agreement, the nuclear summit in \nWashington and the Review Conference of the Parties \nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons are just a few of the positive examples of \nincreased cooperation by Member States. We welcome \nthe entry into force, on 1 August, of the Convention on \nCluster Munitions, to which Moldova made its \ncontribution, as well as the launch of the negotiations \non an arms trade treaty. \n The participation of the Republic of Moldova in \nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations highlights our \ncountry\u2019s political willingness to contribute to \ninternational peace and stability and to be effectively \nengaged in building a strong security architecture \nthrough peacekeeping and peacebuilding activities. \n The enhancement of international cooperation in \nthe field of conflict settlement, with a view to \npreventing future occurrences or escalation of crisis \nsituations that jeopardize the sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of States, is of primary importance for my \ncountry as it confronts the secessionism phenomenon \nin its eastern districts. \n The Republic of Moldova continues to face \nsignificant security challenges generated by separatism \nin the Transnistrian region of the country. Eighteen \nyears since the ceasefire agreement was signed, \nMoldova remains artificially divided. Because of that, \nthe whole system of international commitments in the \nfields of democratic governance, human rights and \narms control is not functioning in that part of our \nnational territory. The local population is living in a \nsituation of a legal vacuum, with no clear future. \nForeign forces are still stationed in Moldova, despite \nthe lack of consent of the host Government and \nprevious decisions and commitments regarding their \nwithdrawal. \n At the same time, it is absolutely obvious that \nthere are objective considerations in resolving the \nTransnistrian problem. The practical steps undertaken \nby the Government of Moldova clearly show that the \nsettlement of the Transnistrian conflict is one of its \ncentral priorities. We consistently advocate in favour of \na policy of dialogue, openness and trust. Our efforts are \nconcentrated on developing regular contacts between \nChisinau and Tiraspol at the level of political \nrepresentatives, as well as in the working groups \ncreated to build confidence in various areas. Our main \ngoal is to provide much-needed support to the \npopulation and businesses in the region, including \nthrough international projects and programmes. \n International partners in the settlement process \nare also showing interest in increased engagement \naimed at the full territorial reintegration of the \nRepublic of Moldova. That positive trend should be \nstrengthened. The first step in that direction would be \nthe earliest possible unconditional resumption of \nofficial negotiations in the \u201c5+2\u201d format. That would \nallow us to start working on a formula for a viable and \ncomprehensive settlement based on the principles of \nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic \nof Moldova. \n It would also offer us the necessary framework \nfor the implementation of confidence-building and \nreintegration projects, as well as for the transformation \nof the current so-called peacekeeping operation into a \nmultinational civilian mission based on the relevant \ninternational standards and mandate. In that context, \nwe firmly believe that the summit of the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe to be held at \nthe end of this year should provide a clear perspective \nfor the settlement of the Transnistrian conflict and the \nwithdrawal of foreign forces from Moldova, in line \nwith commitments undertaken at the previous summit. \n We would like to take this opportunity to reiterate \nour principled position that conflict situations, \nwhenever they appear, seriously impact peace, security \nand stability. They must therefore be solved on the \nbasis of full respect for the independence, sovereignty \nand territorial integrity of States. \n We are concerned by attempts, particularly by \nnon-State entities, to misinterpret and restate the sense \nof the International Court of Justice advisory opinion \n  \n \n10-55408 4 \n \non Kosovo. Such attempts run counter to the spirit and \nsubstance of the imperative principles of international \nlaw and endanger the international legal order and \ninternational security and stability. It is therefore of the \nutmost importance to make it clear that international \nlaw does not confer the right for ethnic, linguistic or \nreligious groups to break away from the territory of a \nState of which they form part without that State\u2019s \nconsent. \n Like other Member States, the Republic of \nMoldova fully shares the view that unilateral secession \ncannot be an acceptable way of resolving conflict \nissues. When engaging in settlement efforts, we must \nalso proceed from recognition of the fact that each and \nevery case is unique and should not constitute a \nprecedent for addressing and settling other conflicts of \ndifferent factual context. \n The Republic of Moldova is determined to \nadvance on its path towards European integration, \nwhich is a fundamental priority of our domestic and \nforeign policies. The achievement of that goal will \nenable our country to embark on a course of stability \nand prosperity governed by democratic values and \nrespect for fundamental human rights, the rule of law \nand economic freedom. \n Moldova-European Union relations have \nintensified in the past year, given the firm commitment \nof our Government to improve ties with the European \nUnion (EU) and its member States. On 12 January, we \nsuccessfully launched negotiations on the Association \nAgreement and held three rounds of negotiations, \nduring which there was a convergence of approaches. \nMoreover, we have launched three dialogues with the \nEuropean Union, on human rights, visa liberalization \nand the creation of a broad and comprehensive free-\ntrade area. We are confident that the constructive \napproach of our cooperation process will contribute to \nthe advancement of our country on the European track. \nWe are grateful to EU member States for their strong \nsupport and the firm shoulder they have provided for \nMoldova\u2019s ambitious European agenda. \n Furthermore, we consider that since the adoption \nof the Lisbon Treaty, new opportunities have emerged \nfor enhanced European Union cooperation with its \ninternational partners, including the United Nations. \nWe express our support for the active and efficient \nparticipation of the European Union in the work of \nGeneral Assembly. \n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that the \ninvolvement of the Republic of Moldova in the work of \nthe United Nations is one of the strategic objectives of \nour foreign policy. Our country remains committed to \nachieving the objectives of the United Nations Charter, \nas set by the founding fathers 65 years ago and \nembraced by all Member States."

        "file_text": "I join previous \nspeakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \nsession. I am confident that, under your able \nstewardship, our deliberations will be fruitful. \n Sixty-five years ago, the creation of the United \nNations heralded hope for global peace, security and \n \n \n27 10-55128 \n \nrespect for human dignity. Today, the United Nations \nremains the most effective universal body for \npreserving the principles upon which it was founded. \nAs one of its earliest Member States, Afghanistan fully \nand consistently subscribes to the centrality of the \nUnited Nations and to the principles of multilateralism \nthat guarantee a democratic international order in \nwhich we all have an equal voice and participation in \ndecisions impacting our world. \n Today more than ever before, our world demands \na commitment to working together so that we may \novercome the multifaceted challenges and threats to \nour survival and well-being. The United Nations is \npivotal to our ability to translate our common sense of \npurpose and determined political will to replace \ndesperation with hope, poverty with prosperity, \ninjustice with justice and violence with peace. \n Last week, the High-level Plenary Meeting on the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) adopted an \noutcome document and plan of action for the full \nrealization of the Millennium Development Goals \n(resolution 65/1). Fifteen years ago when the MDGs \nwere adopted, we recognized that comprehensive and \ncollective effort was essential to the attainment of the \nGoals. Last week\u2019s summit again underscored the need \nfor enhanced international cooperation and \ncoordination in order to achieve human development \nand well-being. \n Afghanistan remains fully committed to meeting \nits MDG targets. We have made some progress, but the \nscourge of international terrorism, insecurity and \nthreats to the rule of law and governance remain \nenormous challenges to promoting human development \nin Afghanistan. \n On the eve of the ninth anniversary of the \ndeclaration of the global war on terror in October 2001, \nthe international community\u2019s promise to the people of \nAfghanistan of a life free from the fear of the threat \nand exploitation of international terrorism remains \nunfulfilled. Afghans continue to suffer from horrific \nacts of terrorist violence on a daily basis. \n On many occasions from this rostrum, the Afghan \ndelegation has drawn the global community\u2019s attention \nto the reality that terrorism and the ideologies of \nextremism and radicalism are spawned beyond the \nborders of Afghanistan. In spite of the combined efforts \nof our military allies, terrorists continue to infiltrate \nour borders with the intent of inflicting harm on our \npeople and the brave soldiers of partner countries. As \nlong as certain State and non-State actors provide  \nAl-Qaida and affiliated individuals and entities with \nsanctuary, arms and financing, they will remain \nformidable and murderous adversaries. \n Terrorism in our region is a growing threat to \nworld peace and security. The audacity and geographic \nscope of extremist and terrorist groups harboured in \nour region continue to expand. If our international \npartners and allies wish to win the global war on \nterrorism, they must look beyond villages in \nAfghanistan and engage in a strategy that will \neffectively and decisively dismantle organizations and \nnetworks that continue to support terrorist and radical \nmilitants with impunity. Terrorism remains a global \nchallenge that can be defeated only through a concerted \ninternational effort. \n In this context, Afghanistan is committed to \nexpanding counter-terrorism cooperation with the \nGovernment of Pakistan and with other countries in our \nregion. \n The people of Afghanistan have known too much \nviolence and too much despair. We have seen too many \nof our young people lose their lives as a result of war \nand conflict. The Afghan people crave peace, stability \nand security. Although our fight against those who \nmenace the lives and well-being of our people will \ncontinue unabated, we recognize that the success of our \nefforts for development and prosperity will depend \nlargely on our ability to achieve sustainable peace in \nour country. \n With this objective in mind, the Afghan \nGovernment convened a National Consultative Peace \nJirga in June of this year. The Jirga fulfilled President \nKarzai\u2019s promise to consult and engage all Afghans in \npeacebuilding initiatives. The Jirga \u2014 which \nassembled tribal leaders, parliamentarians, and \nrepresentatives of provincial councils, businesses and \ncivil society, and had over 20 per cent female \nparticipation \u2014 helped to jump-start a representative \npeace and reconciliation process that will be pursued in \nconformity with our Constitution and human rights \ncommitments. \n The Consultative Peace Jirga agreed on a \nframework to encourage the rank and file of the \nTaliban to end violence and to join a reconciliation and \nreintegration process. It defined the conditions for a \npeace dialogue with Taliban leaders and endorsed the \n  \n \n10-55128 28 \n \nestablishment of a peace commission to oversee the \nreintegration of armed opposition fighters who \nrenounce violence, resume civilian life, accept our \nConstitution and embrace our democracy. \n Over the past eight years, we and our \ninternational partners have realized substantial \nachievements, but also have made mistakes. Many \nchallenges and obstacles remain to ensuring \nsustainable security for the people of Afghanistan and \nto meeting their aspirations to a better life and future. \nAt the London and Kabul Conferences held earlier this \nyear, the international community not only reaffirmed \nits commitment to safeguarding Afghanistan\u2019s \nsovereignty, territorial integrity and stability, but also \nrecognized the critical importance of Afghan \nownership and leadership to consolidating our joint \nachievements and engaging the greater confidence of \nthe Afghan people. \n By building on the mutual commitments made at \nthe milestone Conferences in London and Kabul to \ntransfer security and development responsibilities to \nthe Afghans, and by pursing comprehensive economic \ndevelopment, security, governance and our inclusive \nreconciliation strategies, we are convinced that we will \nsuccessfully combat the efforts of extremists and \nterrorists seeking to regain hold of Afghanistan. \n For our part, the Government of Afghanistan is \nsteadfast in its commitment to pursuing the reform \nagenda that President Karzai outlined in his inaugural \nspeech. We are committed to reinforcing our social \ncompact with the people of Afghanistan by \nstrengthening our judiciary, combating corruption, \nrevitalizing our economy and promoting good \ngovernance at all levels of the Government. As \ndemonstrated by the recently held parliamentary \nelections, the Government and the people of \nAfghanistan are steadfast in advancing our democracy. \n With the support and collaboration of our \ninternational partners and allies, we are committed to \nenhancing the capacity and ability of the Afghan \nSecurity Forces to assume greater responsibility for the \nprotection and security of our country. In this context, I \nwish to acknowledge the enhanced effort of our \nmilitary allies to protect our civilian populations from \nthe detrimental effects of military operations against \nthe terrorists and militants. \n The people of Afghanistan embrace the challenge \nof building a better future. However, the insidious \ndangers of extremism and terrorism and their ever-\nincreasing link to narcotics pose a serious threat to the \nsecurity and stability of our country and our region. \nAlongside our fight against terrorism, we are \ncommitted to working closely with our neighbours and \nother international partners to win the war on narcotics. \n To complement our efforts to eliminate poppy \nproduction, we wish to see greater action to counter \nsmuggling of precursors into our country and to reduce \nthe demand for and consumption of drugs in other \ncountries. \n Recent climate-induced disasters experienced in \nour region, such as the catastrophic floods in Pakistan, \nnot only pose severe challenges for local populations \nand national Governments, but may also have \nramifications for the economies of countries in the \nregion and for global security. We see increased \nurgency for effective regional collaboration on disaster \nmitigation and response. \n At various international, regional and subregional \ngatherings, we have emphasized the importance of a \nstable, democratic and moderate Afghanistan to the \neconomic development of our region and global \nsecurity. By virtue of its location at the crossroads of \nfour geostrategically important regions \u2014 Central \nAsia, South Asia, China and the Middle East \u2014 \nAfghanistan could play an important role in facilitating \nincreased trade and transit and unleashing the \nenormous potential of our region. We will work \ntowards further gains in trade and transit with countries \nin the region. \n The recent conclusion of the Afghanistan-\nPakistan- Transit Trade Agreement and the signing by \nthe heads of State of Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, \nPakistan and India of an agreement on a gas pipeline \nproject are milestones for increased regional \ncooperation. In addition, we have concluded the \nfeasibility study for a Central Asia-South Asia project \nfor the transfer of electricity from Kyrgyzstan and \nTajikistan to Afghanistan and Pakistan. These \ninitiatives will contribute greatly to peace, security and \nstability in our region. Afghanistan stands ready to step \nup cooperation with all its neighbours on economic, \npolitical and crime-related issues. \n I have spoken of the desire of the people of \nAfghanistan for peace and stability and of our right to \nthem. We are, however, acutely aware that for over half \na century our brothers and sisters in Palestine have \n \n \n29 10-55128 \n \nbeen denied their right to an independent State living in \npeaceful coexistence with its neighbours. We are \nencouraged by the resumption of direct talks between \nthe Israeli and Palestinian leadership, which give us \nhope that sustainable peace in the Middle East may be \nsecured. \n To conclude, I thank the States members of this \nAssembly for their solidarity and their support for the \nliberty and well-being of the people of Afghanistan. \nThe Afghan people will never forget the generosity and \ngreat sacrifices of the United States, NATO and other \ninternational partners, whose men and women have \nbravely stood with us to defend our common security \nand ensure peace and stability for Afghanistan. \n I thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \nefforts to revitalize the sense of partnership, \ncooperation and confidence between Afghanistan and \nthe international community. I also thank the dedicated \nand committed staff of the United Nations and its \nspecialized agencies for helping the Afghan people \nbuild a peaceful, secure and prosperous future."

        "file_text": "This year I \nshould like to devote most of my statement once again \nto the important matter of the Comorian island of \nMayotte. This has been a dispute between us and \nFrance for more than three decades. It is our hope that \nthere will be greater understanding and more active \nsolidarity on this matter on the part of this Assembly. \n It is my belief that the future of my country, the \nUnion of the Comoros, depends on peace and stability. \nBut there can be no lasting stability in my country \nwithout a final solution to this problem. Accordingly, \nthis year we have once again requested that an item on \nthe Comorian island of Mayotte be included on the \nagenda of the sixty-fifth session of the General \nAssembly. \n I also take this opportunity to express the deep \ngratitude of the Comorian people for the valuable and \nunwavering support of the African Union, the League \nof Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic \nConference on this issue.  \n I would like to begin by recalling that, pursuant \nto recommendations of the United Nations, the highest \nFrench authorities have themselves affirmed that the \nComoros should accede to independence within \ninviolable borders. Thus, former French President Mr. \nVal\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing declared, inter alia, that the \nComoros are and always have been an entity and that it \nis natural that they have a common destiny.  \n I also deem it vital and timely to recall today \ncertain resolutions of our Organization confirming the \nlegitimacy of the Comorian claim to the island of \nMayotte. These include resolution 1514 (XV), of \n14 December 1960, on the granting of independence to \ncolonial countries and peoples, which guarantees the \nnational unity and territorial integrity of such countries \non regaining their sovereignty. Resolution 3291 \n(XXIX), of 13 December 1974, reaffirms the integrity \nand unity of the Comoro Archipelago. In addition, \nresolution 3385 (XXX), of 12 November 1975, adopted \na few months after the independence of the Comoros, \naffirms the admission of the Comoro Archipelago, \ncomposed of the islands of Mayotte, Anjouan, Moh\u00e9li \nand Grande-Comore, to the United Nations. \n Lastly, the historic resolution 31/4, of 21 October \n1976, underscores the right of the Comoros and the \nduties of France with regard to that independent \ncountry. Allow me to read out the provisions of that \nresolution that is of paramount importance to my \ncountry and which will remain forever etched in the \nmemory of my Comorian compatriots. \n \n \n19 10-54965 \n \n  \u201cConsidering that the occupation by France \nof the Comorian island of Mayotte constitutes a \nflagrant encroachment on the national unity of the \nComorian State, a Member of the United Nations, \n  \u201cConsidering that such an attitude on the \npart of France constitutes a violation of the \nprinciples of the relevant resolutions of the \nUnited Nations, in particular of General \nAssembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December \n1960 concerning the granting of independence to \ncolonial countries and peoples, which guarantees \nthe national unity and territorial integrity of such \ncountries, \n  \u201c1. Condemns and considers null and void \nthe referendums of 8 February and 11 April 1976 \norganized in the Comorian island of Mayotte by \nthe Government of France, and rejects: \n  \u201c(a) Any other form of referendum or \nconsultation which may hereafter be organized on \nComorian territory in Mayotte by France; \n  \u201c(b) Any foreign legislation purporting to \nlegalize any French colonial presence on \nComorian territory in Mayotte; \n  \u201c2. Strongly condemns the presence of \nFrance in Mayotte, which constitutes a violation \nof the national unity, territorial integrity and \nsovereignty of the independent Republic of the \nComoros;\u201d (resolution 31/4, third and fourth \npreambular paragraphs and paras. 1 and 2). \n France refuses to comply with all those relevant \nresolutions adopted by the General Assembly relating \nto the Comorian island of Mayotte and continues to \nviolate the principle of the inviolability of colonial \nborders. It must be recalled that the principle of the \ninviolability of borders became a rule of customary \ninternational law, codified under paragraph 6 of \nresolution 1514 (XV), which stipulates that:  \n  \u201cAny attempt aimed at the partial or total \ndisruption of the national unity and the territorial \nintegrity of a country is incompatible with the \npurposes and principles of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations.\u201d  \nThat same resolution recalls in its paragraph 7 that:  \n  \u201cAll States shall observe faithfully and \nstrictly the provisions of the Charter of the United \nNations, the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights and the present Declaration on the basis of \nequality, non-interference in the internal affairs of \nall States, and respect for the sovereign rights of \nall peoples and their territorial integrity.\u201d  \n International jurisprudence fully recognizes that \nprinciple of the indivisibility of colonial entities. In the \njudgment handed down on 11 September 1992 in a \ndispute between Honduras and El Salvador, the \nInternational Court of Justice in The Hague declared \nthat the principle of the inviolability of colonial \nborders is a retroactive principle that changes \nadministrative boundaries originally designed for other \npurposes into international borders. \n For many years, my country has called the \ninternational community to witness and has made \nknown its readiness to seek a fair and just solution \nbilaterally. The response to our position was crushing. \nFrance not only took unilateral steps in 1994 to hinder \nthe free circulation of persons by introducing a visa for \nall Comorians wishing to visit Mayotte, part of \nComorian territory, but also, in 2000, it began the \nprocess of making the island a department, which is \nillegal under international law. \n I wish to stress that the imposition of a visa \nrequirement in 1994 had truly tragic human \nconsequences. The small slice of the sea of \napproximately 70 kilometres separating Anjouan from \nthe sister island of Mayotte has now become the largest \nmaritime cemetery in the world. To date, nearly 7,000 \npeople have been killed. \n Moreover, while we had agreed to establish a \nhigh-level working group to relaunch the dialogue in \norder to consider together equitable and just solutions, \non 29 May 2009 France organized another referendum \naimed at changing the status of the island of Mayotte \ninto an overseas department. \n We are surprised that, despite all the good will \ndemonstrated by the Comorian side \u2014 and in particular \nthe innovative proposal on Mayotte known as \u201cone \ncountry, two systems\u201d or two administrations, which I \nmyself introduced at an earlier session of this \nAssembly \u2014 there has been no positive response from \nFrance to that outstretched hand. The dual system \nwould be a compromise that would finally ensure \nrespect for international law, while enabling France to \ncontinue to legally administer the Comorian island of \nMayotte during a period to be mutually agreed. It \nwould also enable our Mahorais brothers and sisters, \n  \n \n10-54965 20 \n \nwhom I love dearly, to preserve their social status and \nstandard of living, and the three other islands to finally \ntake up the many challenges of development in peace \nand stability. \n But France wants to know nothing about this \ncompromise. Faced with such an attitude, we find \nourselves obliged to request our dear Organization to \nrequire France to respect and comply with international \nlaw, implement the various relevant United Nations \nresolutions on the Comorian island of Mayotte, and to \nreconsider its position on our offer, which clearly \nrepresents a huge sacrifice on the part of my country, \nwhich in fact is within its rights. \n What is at stake is the future of the Comoros, a \nsmall sovereign country Member of the United \nNations. Also at stake is the honour of France, a great \ncountry whose ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity \nso strongly and profoundly inspired the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights and the principles \nunderpinning our Charter. Ultimately, what is at stake \nis the honour of our Organization, whose very \ncredibility would be sorely challenged should \ninternational law and legality continue to be \ndisregarded and the territorial integrity of the Comoros \ncontinue to be violated.  \n The United Nations is the guarantor of respect for \ninternational law. It is duty-bound to require that its \nMembers\u2019 legislation complies fully with the relevant \nresolutions. I can only endorse the statement of the \nPresident of the General Assembly, His Excellency Mr. \nJoseph Deiss, who said at the opening of this session \nthat the United Nations is the guarantor of global \ngovernance and enjoys a global legitimacy. \n I cannot end my statement without reiterating that \nthe Comoros supports the efforts of the international \ncommunity, and more specifically the personal efforts \nof His Excellency President Barack Hussein Obama, to \nestablish a just and lasting peace in the Middle East \nenabling the Palestinian people to live freely and safely \nin an independent State and to enjoy fully all their \nlegitimate rights. \n My country also pays tribute to efforts to bring an \nend to the fratricidal conflicts that are ripping apart the \nSudan, Afghanistan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic \nof the Congo and the Great Lakes region.  \n We also reiterate our strong support for the \nterritorial integrity of the brotherly Kingdom of \nMorocco and our full backing for the Moroccan \nautonomy proposal as a definitive political compromise \nsolution to the regional dispute over the Moroccan \nSahara. \n We also reiterate our unwavering support for the \nlegitimate demands of the People\u2019s Republic of China \nfor the return of Taiwan to China\u2019s fold. \n It is through peace, stability and security and \nrespect for international law that our nations will be \nable to attain the development goals they have set \nthemselves to help our peoples. I therefore have full \ntrust that our Organization shall continue to make these \nideals its main focus.\n We must, as soon as possible, implement the \nagreements and resolutions that we have agreed in \norder to find peaceful and definitive solutions to all \noutstanding issues, because any delay in or suspension \nof our search for such solutions would create \nadditional, similar issues and crises in other countries \nand spark the flames of extremism and terrorism \nthroughout the world. We hope that we shall find \nsolutions that will lead to the happiness and well-being \nof all our peoples."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the \nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, I wish the new \nPresident of this session of the General Assembly the \ngreatest success during his term. \n The Bolivarian revolution plans to contribute to \nthe structure and agenda of the United Nations, which \ncurrently reflect the unjust power relationships that \nexist in the world. As it is today, this forum helps to \nperpetuate the unjust relations inherited from the \nSecond World War, relations that become more \nexclusive and authoritarian as neoliberal globalization \nadvances. The President of the Bolivarian Republic of \nVenezuela, Hugo Chavez Fr\u00edas, said on 15 September \n2005, in his speech during the general debate at the \nsixtieth session of the United Nations General \nAssembly that \u201cthe United Nations has outgrown its \nmodel. It is not just a question of simple reform. The \ntwenty-first century requires profound changes that \nwill be possible only if the Organization is truly \nrecast.\u201d (A/60/PV.6, p.17) \n There are two poignant examples that illustrate \nthis unfair and irrational world power architecture. For \nthe past 19 years, the overwhelming majority of the \ncountries of the world have come before the General \nAssembly to demand an end to the economic and \ncommercial blockade imposed on the heroic Cuban \npeople. But what has the Organization done to ensure \nthat the United States Government abides by the will of \nthe General Assembly? The answer is well known: \nnothing. \n Dozens of resolutions have been adopted by the \nSecurity Council and the General Assembly on the \nquestion of Palestine, but the Israeli military and \npolitical elite refuse to comply. The occupying Power \nacts with total impunity and with the complicity of its \nmain ally. What has the Security Council done to get \nthe occupying Power to respect the principles of \ninternational law, including international humanitarian \nlaw, and particularly the four Geneva Conventions of \n1949? The answer is well known: nothing. \n The rebuilding of the United Nations hinges on \nstrengthening the General Assembly and its handling of \nmatters relating to international peace and security. \n \n \n13 10-55408 \n \nVenezuela challenges the fact that a small group of \ncountries impose their conditions in these areas, while \nthe opinion of the majority is not taken into account. A \nstrategy aimed at weakening the General Assembly and \nexcluding it from the most relevant world decisions is \nbeing implemented in the United Nations, while the \nSecurity Council progressively increases its power and \ninfluence over the United Nations agenda and takes \nover topics beyond the purview granted to it by the \nCharter of the Organization. The Secretary-General, \naccording to the Charter of the United Nations, is an \nadministrative officer of the Organization responsible \nfor answering to the interests of all Member States, and \nnot the policies of a few Powers that seek to drive the \nglobal agenda. \n For almost 20 years we have been discussing the \nreform of the Security Council and the strengthening of \nthe General Assembly, yet so far almost nothing has \nbeen achieved. The call from President Chavez to \nrecast the United Nations remains fully valid. To that \nend, Venezuela proposes to eliminate the right of veto \nenjoyed by only five Members of the United Nations. \nThis remnant of the Second World War is incompatible \nwith the principle of the sovereign equality of States. \nVenezuela also proposes an increase in the Security \nCouncil\u2019s membership in both the permanent and  \nnon-permanent categories. Why are developing \ncountries deprived of the right to participate in that \nforum? \n Venezuela therefore urges all States to propose \ncandidates for the post of Secretary-General, with the \naim of democratizing elections to this senior post. We \nbelieve that resolution 11 (I), adopted on 24 January \n1946, regarding the terms of election of the Secretary-\nGeneral, in no way restricts the ability of Member \nStates to discuss and vote in this election. In line with \ndemocratic principles and transparency, Member States \nmust participate in both the nomination and the \nappointment of this senior official. States would \ntherefore be free to choose among several alternatives.  \n Rebuilding the United Nations also requires that \nthe General Assembly fully exercise its responsibilities \nin matters of international peace and security, as \nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. \n Climate change negotiations are unfolding in a \ncomplex context that makes it difficult to arrive at \nconsensus on the majority of topics. Developed \ncountries reject international commitments that are \nfully in force, specifically the Kyoto Protocol. The \nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela hopes that, at the \nnext Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \nin Canc\u00fan at the end of this year, a legally binding \nagreement is reached that is ambitious and respects the \nConvention and the Kyoto Protocol.  \n Venezuela is fighting for the creation of a \ndevelopment model based on a new paradigm that \nsubstitutes the prevailing models of production and \nconsumption. Developing countries and the most \nvulnerable sectors of developed countries suffer the \nimpact of the economic and financial crises of \ncapitalism. It is therefore essential and necessary to \nconsider a transformation of this inhumane model that, \nwith its new crisis, has generated more hunger, poverty, \nunemployment and inequality. The crisis of capitalism \nhas not ended. Its structural nature reproduces itself ad \ninfinitum. Privileged groups, the financial economy, \nspeculators, monopolies and oligopolies and the \nBretton Woods institutions will continue to try to have \nthe crisis paid for by developing countries and the \nworld\u2019s poor and most vulnerable. Neoliberal policies, \nwhich are applied as a result of the global crisis of \ncapitalism, propose the totalitarianism of the financial \nmarkets, deepening the gap between the rich and the \npoor within those countries and widening the \ninequalities between the North and the South.  \n It is also important to underscore that the efforts \nof the developed countries in the context of official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA) have not been \nsustained, as large donors have repeatedly not fulfilled \ntheir pledges when it comes to the agreed goal of \nallocating 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product \nto ODA.  \n Faced with this crisis, developing countries \nshould strengthen South-South cooperation and create \nalternative sovereign mechanisms to avoid the credit \nmonopoly maintained by the Bretton Woods \ninstitutions. To that end, Venezuela aims to create and \nstrengthen regional financial institutions such as the \nBank of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our \nAmerica \u2014 Peoples\u2019 Trade Agreement (ALBA-TCP) \nand the Bank of the South. We welcome the initiatives \nin that regard that are being undertaken in Africa and \nAsia. \n South-South cooperation is a top priority for \nVenezuela. In Latin America and the Caribbean there \n  \n \n10-55408 14 \n \nare already successful experiences such as that of \nPetrocaribe, which fosters supportive cooperation in \nthe energy sector, and that of ALBA-TCP, which is \nproducing successful results in overcoming poverty \nand inequality. These novel forms of solidarity and \nsupportive cooperation contribute to the development \nof our peoples and to the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals.  \n I take great satisfaction in pointing out that, \ndespite the problematic international economic and \nfinancial environment, the Bolivarian Republic of \nVenezuela has met almost all of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, in particular in the areas of \npoverty, health, nutrition, education, child mortality \nand sanitation, among others. We would like to \nunderscore that Venezuela assumed the presidency of \nthe Latin American and Caribbean Summit on \nIntegration and Development in February 2010. The \nthird Summit will be held in our country on 5 July \n2011, within the framework of the historic bicentennial \nanniversary of our signing of our Declaration of \nIndependence.  \n Venezuela attaches particular importance to the \nprocess of union and integration in Latin America and \nthe Caribbean. Progress to that end will lead to the full \noperation of the Community of Latin American and \nCaribbean States, thereby achieving the dream of our \nliberators as reflected in the Constitution of the \nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The union of our \npeoples \u2014 the peoples of the South fighting for \nindependence, freedom, sovereignty and self-\ndetermination \u2014 is a priority of our Simon Bolivar \nnational project, as enshrined in our first socialist plan \nfor the period 2007 to 2013. \n In the face of recurrent attempts to erode the \nsovereignty of countries and in the face of a savage \ncapitalist and neoliberal offensive, the Bolivarian \nGovernment calls for the relaunching of the Group of \n77 and China and the Non-Aligned Movement so that \ndeveloping countries can more forcefully defend the \ninterests of their peoples. \n We wish to avail ourselves of this opportunity at \nthe rostrum to express our appreciation for the \ncompliments sent to President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas by \nnumerous Governments and social and popular \nmovements from around the world on the occasion of \nthe victory in the Venezuelan parliamentary elections \nlast Sunday, 26 September. That victory is a clear \ntestament to the majority support of the people for the \nhumanistic policies promoted by the Bolivarian \nGovernment. This electoral victory will also enable our \nBolivarian Government to strengthen its solidarity with \ndeveloping countries. \n Defenders of peace, justice, freedom and \nsolidarity in the world can continue to rely on the \nsupport of the Bolivarian revolution.

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for \nme to speak to the Assembly today, 20 years after the \nadmission of Liechtenstein to the United Nations. \nMembership of the United Nations is one of the \ncornerstones of our foreign policy and the central \nplatform for global diplomatic contacts. A strong \nUnited Nations, with a strong General Assembly, is a \nmatter of self-interest to us. \n It is therefore a special pleasure, Sir, to welcome \nyou in the presidency of the Assembly. We look \nforward to working under your leadership. You have \nalready shown wise leadership by placing this general \ndebate under the broad theme of global governance, the \ndiscussion most urgently needed in the General \nAssembly, which is the main deliberative body of the \nOrganization.  \n The very purpose of the Charter was in fact to \nestablish a system of global governance, with the \nUnited Nations at its centre. Today, we must ask \nourselves: Is the United Nations still at the centre of \nglobal governance? How does it relate to a number of \nother rising actors in the ever more crowded field of \ninternational relations? How can we improve global \ngovernance so that it better serves our peoples? \n There can be no doubt, to our mind, that global \ngovernance can only be effective if it is truly global. \nThat means global not only in reach, but also in \nparticipation. A system where a few make decisions \nthat everyone else is expected to implement would be \nnot only be unjust, but also ineffective. Past experience \nhas shown time and again that multilateral action can \nbe very effective when it is based on a broad political \nconsensus, which is not the same as giving everyone a \nright to veto. \n A strong fundamental agreement among States is \nthe only way to ensure that decisions are effectively \nput into practice. The place where such decisions are \npossible, where genuine political consensus can be \nforged, is and remains the United Nations. We \ntherefore have to invest in the United Nations to make \nthe improvements that are required, instead of looking \nfor solutions outside. \n It is with this general philosophy in mind that we \nview efforts by different groupings, most prominently \nthe Group of 20, to discuss questions of global reach. \nWe certainly welcome the fact that the largest \ndeveloped nations and the most powerful emerging \nPowers gather to discuss matters that affect the global \neconomic and financial architecture.  \n The recent crisis has illustrated how important \u2014 \nindeed, indispensable \u2014 common action by the Group \nof 20 in such situations can be. And more is to be done \nto address the systemic issues that led to the crisis in \nthe first place. We will continue to support those \nactivities. At the same time, inclusion and participation \nshould be placed higher on the Group\u2019s agenda, and its \nwork should be better integrated with that of the United \nNations system. The quality of the discussions within \nthe Group of 20 and the effectiveness of their outcomes \nwould greatly benefit from an approach based on \n\u201cvariable geometry\u201d \u2014 bringing in the views of all \nthose who are directly affected by the subject matter \nunder consideration.  \n We are therefore an active member of the Global \nGovernance Group, coordinated by Singapore, which \nseeks to promote the principles of inclusion and \nparticipation. We are grateful to the hosts of the next \ntwo Group of 20 summits, Korea and France, for their \nconstructive exchange with Global Governance Group \n \n \n5 10-55276 \n \nMinisters yesterday here in New York. We look \nforward to continuing this dialogue. \n We welcome the work of the Group of 20 and \nother groupings that seek to contribute to global \nsolutions. At the same time, they can only deal with a \nlimited number of issues. And, more importantly, they \ncan never be a substitute for genuine multilateralism, \nwhich must continue to take place inside the United \nNations. But we can only safeguard this central place \nof the United Nations if we can put it to use to find \neffective solutions to problems such as climate change, \ndisarmament and other areas where results have been \ninsufficient. If we continue to underachieve in the \nUnited Nations framework, we must not be surprised if \nsolutions are sought elsewhere. \n The United Nations continues to be the centre of \nglobal governance in the area of peace and security, the \ndomain of the Security Council. The Council has the \npower to make decisions that are binding upon Member \nStates, including on the use of force. This is the \nstrongest tool available in international law. Yet its \neffectiveness is increasingly undermined by the \nperception that decisions of the Council lack the \nrequired political legitimacy.  \n A central ingredient of that perception is the \nCouncil\u2019s composition. Everybody agrees that it no \nlonger reflects today\u2019s geopolitical realities. And yet an \nagreement to change it has been elusive for well over a \ndecade. We believe that there could be a middle ground \nin the negotiations: the creation of a new category of \nseats allowing States to serve permanently on the \nCouncil, if the wider membership elects them to do so, \non a recurrent basis. It seems to us the only logical \napproach towards a compromise, given the various \npositions around the table.  \n But the principal question may well be one of \ntiming. If States increasingly believe that the Security \nCouncil can only be reformed in a climate of serious \ninstitutional crisis, a view with which we disagree, then \nwe must reconsider the wisdom of trying to find a \nnegotiated solution at this time. \n Of no less importance for the legitimacy of the \nCouncil\u2019s work is the way in which it arrives at its \ndecisions. Addressing the way in which the Council \nconducts its work is one of the biggest governance \nchallenges we face in the United Nations system. If the \nCouncil is indeed to carry out its functions on behalf of \nthe entire membership, as mandated by the Charter, it \nmust be ready to listen to those it represents \u2014 \nespecially when they are directly affected by its work. \n The group of small five countries, of which we \nare a member, has over the last few years initiated a \nprocess of reflection and gradual improvements that is \nvery much in the interests of the Council itself. We \nlook forward to continuing this process, with both the \npermanent and the elected members of the Council. \n The role of the United Nations in global \ngovernance depends not only on the performance of its \nintergovernmental organs, but to a great degree also on \nthe performance of the Secretariat. This is an enormous \nresponsibility on the shoulders of all our international \ncivil servants, especially the Secretary-General himself.  \n We saw a few years ago how much damage this \nOrganization can suffer from management failures and \nsystem breakdowns in the areas of procurement and \naccountability. A number of important reforms have \nbeen undertaken since. Most notably, we have \nstrengthened internal oversight and accountability. But \ncan we be confident that we have now appropriately \nmanaged the risk of another system breakdown in the \nfuture? Clearly, more needs to be done in this area, in \nparticular to fully implement some of the management \nreform measures already taken. \n The strongest emerging tool in our system of \nglobal governance is the dimension of justice. We have \nmade tremendous normative and institutional progress \nin this area in the recent past. At the same time, we are \nstruggling with the challenge to reconcile peace and \njustice in particular. How can we balance the dignity of \nvictims and the justice owed to them with the \nlikelihood of preventing further crimes? That is a \nchoice nobody will want to face. \n But experience shows that there is no \ncontradiction between peace and justice over the long \nrun. And there is a broad international consensus that \nthere can be no impunity for the worst crimes under \ninternational law, and therefore no amnesties.  \n Given the massive crimes committed against \ncivilian populations all over the world, this common \nstance against impunity is more important than ever. It is \nembodied by the International Criminal Court, whose \neffects are felt across the globe. Most important, though, \nit is also leading States to make greater efforts to fulfil \ntheir obligations to investigate and prosecute domestically. \nThese are developments of truly historic dimensions.  \n  \n \n10-55276 6 \n \n We are only at the beginning of our efforts to \nintegrate the justice dimension into our overall \ngovernance structure. This integration will not be a \nquick or easy process. But we must not shy away from \nthese discussions, and we have to approach them with \nboth an open mind and a determination to stand firmly \non the principle of fighting impunity. \n The challenges in global governance are \nnumerous and interlinked. The governance architecture \nreflected in the Charter gives us the possibility of \naddressing them. It is up to us to make the necessary \npolitical investments to make this system work for our \npeoples."

        "file_text": "Let me start by \ncongratulating His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \nelection to the presidency at the sixty-fifth session of \nthe General Assembly, and assuring him of the fullest \ncooperation of the Icelandic delegation. \n When I spoke for the first time from this \ndistinguished rostrum last year, my country was \nravaged by financial crisis. It left Iceland with a total \ncollapse of the entire banking system. Our financial \ncrisis was exacerbated by the worldwide recession, but \nI have to tell you, honestly, that to a large extent it was \nmade in Iceland. It was the product of a system that \nembraced the neo-liberalistic view of rampant \ncapitalism with lax regulations. Economic emergency \nlaws had to be passed. And we needed the helping hand \nof our close family in the North, the Nordic nations, \nnot least the Faroese, and our friends the Poles, in the \nform of currency loans, just to prevent our society from \nmelting down. \n Now we have swallowed the bitter medicine of \nfiscal cuts and radical financial reforms. We have \nembarked on close cooperation with the International \nMonetary Fund. And Iceland has now applied for \nmembership of the European Union, on which the \nIcelandic people will decide in a referendum in due \ncourse. \n A specially appointed prosecutor is now handling \nthe cases of bankers who allegedly broke the law, and \nthis week, parliament in Iceland is debating whether to \nprosecute former ministers. So we took firm, decisive \naction. \n Well, I can tell you, the medicine worked. Iceland \nis pulling through. We are finally on the road to \nrecovery. We are blessed with ample resources in the \nform of fish in the ocean, the fierce power of our \nwaterfalls and geothermal geysers and a pristine \nnatural environment that supports a flourishing tourism \nsector. Economic growth is, finally, returning to \nIceland. \n I am therefore very happy to inform the Assembly \nthat, this summer, the International Monetary Fund \ndeclared that, technically, the recession in Iceland is \nover. I want to use this opportunity to thank Member \nStates for their support and their understanding. \n The crisis turned our eyes back to what really \nmatters in life, the core values of democracy and \nhuman rights. At home, we have taken important steps \nto change the Constitution to increase the people\u2019s \npower. We are also proud of having legally ensured full \nequality for same-sex partnerships, and we strongly \nurge other nations to remove all discrimination based \non sexual orientation. \n As the Assembly knows, our foreign policy has \nalways reflected the high priority we place on gender \nequality. This year, we celebrate 95 years since women \nfirst gained the right to vote and 30 years ago since a \nwoman was first elected President in Iceland. As \nmembers saw for themselves, with their own eyes, \nwhen the Icelandic Prime Minister spoke here this \nweek, the Icelandic Government is now led by a \nwoman. \n In New York, we also have cause to celebrate. \nIceland for years has supported a new and consolidated \nUnited Nations gender entity, and, look, today it is a \nreality. Well done, United Nations, you deserve a big \npile of thanks for your vision and for your courage. I \ncan state that Iceland will be a strong supporter of UN \nWomen, just as we have been through the transitional \nphase. \n There is also, I believe, another cause for this \nAssembly to celebrate, and that is the fact that next \nmonth we will celebrate the 10-year anniversary of \nresolution 1325 (2000). This has been a priority of the \nforeign policy of Iceland. Let the nations of the United \nNations come together to celebrate by increasing the \nparticipation of women in peace negotiations. \nEmpowering women is empowering society. \n But it is exactly with reference to women\u2019s rights \nthat we have learned with utter sadness about the \ndecision of Iranian courts to stone to death an Iranian \nwoman, Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani. President \nAhmadinejad, on behalf of the Icelandic people, I ask \nyou to spare Ashtiani. \n When we address the looming dangers of climate \nchange, human rights are also at stake. Climate change \nwill wreak havoc on the lives of a great number of \npeople. It will erode what we as an international \ncommunity have defined as their basic human rights. \n Let me take three different examples. The small \nisland nations in the Pacific are threatened by rising \nsea levels to such an extent that whole nations might be \nforced to leave the land of their forebears \u2014 Kiribati, \nfor instance. The floods in Pakistan caused death to \nmany and devastation to tens of millions of people. The \n  \n \n10-54965 54 \n \nmelting of the Arctic ice may prevent my neighbours, \nthe Inuits, from pursuing their traditional lifestyle \nbased on hunting on the ice. \n All this is aggravated by the limitless use of fossil \nfuels that is literally tipping the delicate balance of \nnature. We, the wealthy nations of the world, are \ntherefore paying for the quality of our good life with \nthe human rights of others. If we do not take drastic \naction, more radical action than what was agreed in \nCopenhagen, future generations will see ours as serial \noffenders against the human rights of peoples in need. \n At the same time, millions of people lack access \nto safe drinking water and sanitation. It is a firm \nposition of my Government that the right to safe \ndrinking water and basic sanitation should be \nrecognized as a human right, essential for the real and \nfull enjoyment of life and all other human rights. \n In the fight against climate change, Iceland tries \nto lead by example. We already meet 80 per cent of our \nenergy needs through renewables, and that is far higher \nthan any other nation can claim. We have campaigned \nfor a new global climate fund with the goal of \nfinancing the transfer of green technologies to \ndeveloping countries. \n But we in Iceland also want to contribute in \nanother way. As the Assembly knows, we have not \nbeen able to stop the volcanoes in Iceland from \nerupting with huge clouds of ash, but we have learned \nto harness the fierce power of the fire beneath, and put \nit to use as geothermal energy. Geothermal by itself, of \ncourse, will not solve all the climate problems, but in \nsome parts of the world it could make a huge \ndifference. \n In East Africa, the utilization of geothermal \npotential could free the people of several nations from \nthe bondage of energy poverty. They do, however, lack \nthe geothermal expertise and the finances for the \ninfrastructure. \n Iceland, therefore, has formally engaged in \ndiscussions with some of the big nations operating, for \nexample, in East Africa to form a partnership for a \ngeothermal drive in countries with unused potential. \nIceland would put up the expertise, the partners the \nnecessary financing. This initiative could enable some \ncountries to escape from energy poverty, industrialize \nwithout undue emissions and embark on the road to \nprosperity. \n I have spent almost this entire speech of mine \ntonight talking about human rights in one form or \nanother, and human rights cannot be debated without \ndiscussing the plight of the Palestinians and the people \nof Gaza. We now have the results of the experts, \nmandated by the Human Rights Council, who \nconcluded that Israel broke international law by \nattacking the flotilla bringing humanitarian assistance \nto Gaza last spring. \n Iceland has strongly condemned the raid. It drew \na strong reaction from Icelandic society at large. I can \ntell the Assembly that the Icelandic nation is deeply \nsympathetic to the plight of the Palestinians, held in \noccupation by an oppressing Power. As I speak, we \nhave Icelandic humanitarian workers being held up in \nIsrael, trying to bring prosthetic feet to people in Gaza \nwho have lost their limbs, people that urgently need \nassistance. This is not acceptable to Iceland. This is not \nacceptable to the world. This is inhuman and unjust, \nand we urge Israel not to prevent humanitarian \nassistance from reaching the needy in Gaza. \n Yesterday, we heard President Obama urge \npatience, but we also heard a hidden hope in his words. \nWell, we know that sometimes dreams come true. \nSometimes the unexpected happens. Sometimes we \neven have miracles. We in Iceland will, of course, \nstrongly support the resumed direct talks, and let us all \nhope and pray for a solution that will allow us, as soon \nas possible, to welcome the independent State of \nPalestine as the 193rd member of the United Nations \nfamily. \n In the meantime, all of us should use every \npossible, sensible way to demonstrate our solidarity \nwith the people of Palestine. My country, Iceland, was \nnot afraid to stand up and be counted on behalf of the \npeople in the Baltic States almost 20 years ago, when \nIceland was the first country to break the ice and \nrecognize their independence. The same happened with \nregard to Croatia, Slovenia and later Montenegro. And \ntoday Iceland is not afraid to stand up for the \nPalestinian people either. Every nation has a duty to \ndefend human rights. Every nation has a duty to speak \nup. That is no less true for Palestine, where human \nrights are broken \u2014 especially in Gaza \u2014 every day."

        "file_text": "As an engaged member of the \nUnited Nations, Hungary wishes to play its part in \ninternational efforts aimed at building our common \nfuture. In this spirit, we do our utmost to contribute to \nthe crisis-management and peacekeeping operations of \nthe international community, and we seek to deliver \nspecial added value to international development and \nhumanitarian activities. I can assure the Assembly that \nas a candidate country for Security Council \nmembership for the period 2012-2013, Hungary stands \nready to work vigorously to overcome divisions and to \nstrengthen global partnerships in today\u2019s interdependent \ninternational environment. \n The Preamble of the Charter states that we the \npeoples of the United Nations are determined, \ninter alia, \u201cto promote social progress and better \nstandards of life in larger freedom\u201d and, for this end, \n\u201cto employ international machinery for the promotion \nof the economic and social advancement of all \npeoples\u201d. \n In the year 2000, the United Nations exhibited \nleadership in the articulation and adoption of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Contributions \nmade at the MDG summit a few days ago reassured me \nthat, although most of us are suffering from the fallout \nof the recent global crises, none of us would readily \naccept the vision of a bleak future that would result \nfrom slowing down the concrete actions we take. \nHungary remains determined to take on its share of \nresponsibility in realizing the MDGs on a global scale, \nand we will continue to implement donor programmes \nin various parts of the world. \n The effects of the recent global financial and \neconomic crisis have thrown millions of people into \npoverty, especially those who are most vulnerable in \nthe developing world. The food, water and energy \ncrises and humanitarian disasters such as the \nearthquake in Haiti and floods in Pakistan have also \ntaken their toll on the lives of people. The growing \nnumber of disasters emphasizes the great need for \nprevention, preparedness and disaster risk reduction, as \nwell as for development activities centred on the \npromotion of sustainable economic growth. Hungary \nbelieves that, in order to achieve success and \neffectively meet the needs of vulnerable or \ndisadvantaged groups in these turbulent times, a \n  \n \n10-54959 2 \n \npartnership-based approach needs to be adopted in this \nregard. \n Similarly, climate change figures high among the \npre-eminent challenges of the twenty-first century that \nthreaten our well-being, security and economic \ndevelopment. The international community should pay \nparticular attention to the well-founded and legitimate \nconcerns of the small island States of the Caribbean \nand the Pacific in this regard. Our primary goal should \nnow be the adoption of a series of ambitious, action-\noriented decisions at the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change negotiations to be held \nin Canc\u00fan, Mexico, later this year. Such decisions \nwould prepare the ground for the adoption of a \ncomprehensive and legally binding global framework \nnext year in South Africa. \n As a State member of the European Union, \nHungary is committed to reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions by 20 per cent by 2020. Moreover, we are \nalso ready to undertake further emissions reductions if \nour partners make similar commitments, taking into \naccount their different capabilities. \n The promotion and protection of human rights \nconstitute the cornerstone of Hungary\u2019s foreign policy. \nHungary acts at the forefront of international efforts to \nfight all forms of discrimination, including \ndiscrimination based on national or ethnic origin. We \nare of the view that the rights of minorities, with \nspecial regard for the preservation of their cultural \nidentities and linguistic heritage, should be high on the \nagenda of the international community. We believe that \nflourishing minority communities do not weaken a \nsociety but, on the contrary, contribute to the cultural \nenrichment of a country. Fruitful relationships between \nthe majority and minorities can only be pursued if \nhuman rights are not being infringed and if tolerance \nprevails at all levels of society. This is one of the \nreasons that Hungary has decided to establish the \nBudapest-based Tom Lantos Institute, an international \ncentre for promoting human rights and spreading the \nvalue of tolerance. \n Hungary also feels compelled to raise the issue of \nwomen worldwide. The possible role played by women \nin accelerating the achievement of the MDGs and in \nreducing tensions and hostilities around the world \nshould not be neglected. We are confident that the \nrecent establishment of the United Nations Entity for \nGender Equality and the Empowerment of Women \n(UN Women) marks significant progress in this regard \nand will make a great contribution to the elimination of \nthe disadvantages facing women. \n Let me express Hungary\u2019s sincere gratitude to the \nSecretary-General for convening, on this very day, a \nHigh-level Meeting on the disarmament machinery. \nNew dynamism in this area was also clearly \ndemonstrated at the Review Conference of the Parties \nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons earlier this year, and we are hopeful that the \nrenewed international commitment to nuclear \ndisarmament and non-proliferation will lead to success. \n We note with great concern, however, that the \ngrowing consensus around the ultimate goal of a \nso-called global zero of nuclear weapons is being \noffset by overt and covert attempts at the proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction and missiles by certain \ncountries. Hungary fully supports the statement made \nin New York on 22 September by the High \nRepresentative of the European Union, Catherine \nAshton, on the negotiations conducted between the \nE3+3 Governments and Iran. \n International terrorism is another of the most \nserious threats to international peace and security. \nHungary strongly condemns this phenomenon in all its \nforms and manifestations and underscores the pivotal \nrole of the United Nations in counter-terrorism. We \nwelcome the fact that the recently concluded second \nreview of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy reinforced the consensus among Member \nStates to foster a global counter-terrorism alliance. \nAnd, expressing our full solidarity with the victims of \nterrorism, we lend our unequivocal support to all \nUnited Nations efforts in this regard. \n Almost a decade ago, this city of New York \nsuffered one of the most horrendous terrorist attacks in \nhuman history. The appalling statement made by one of \nthe speakers yesterday concerning this tragic event is \nunacceptable and is detrimental to the noble cause of \npromoting mutual understanding and dialogue among \nreligions and civilizations. \n The United Nations was created, and I shall again \nquote from the Preamble of the Charter, in order to \n\u201cpractice tolerance and live together in peace with one \nanother as good neighbours\u201d. Coexistence and \ncooperation would serve regional stability in the \nWestern Balkans, a region which, due to its proximity \n \n \n3 10-54959 \n \nto Hungary\u2019s borders, has great importance in our \nforeign policy. \n In our view, progress towards the stabilization of \nthe region and resolution of its persisting problems \nshould be the result of an essentially internally driven \nprocess, with the unwavering support of the \ninternational community. \n Hungary respects the recently issued advisory \nopinion of the International Court of Justice on \nKosovo, and our country remains strongly committed \nto encouraging direct dialogue between the countries \nand communities of the region. \n In Afghanistan, the international community in \ngeneral, and the countries in the region in particular, \nshould assist efforts towards reconciliation, good \ngovernance and sustainable development. Strengthening \nState institutions at all levels, improving the security \nsituation and effectively implementing civilian \ndevelopment programmes are all essential for \ndecreasing tensions and transferring responsibility and \nleadership to the Afghan Government. Hungary \nremains committed to supporting Afghanistan \npolitically, and we will do our best to provide \nassistance to the country through both bilateral and \nmultilateral channels. \n We envisage the establishment of an independent, \ndemocratic and viable Palestinian State living side by \nside in peace and security with Israel and its other \nneighbours. We also believe that the Middle East peace \nprocess should and can lead to overall Arab-Israeli \nreconciliation. We all know that it takes brave men to \nstart a war, but it takes statesmen to finish it. In this \nspirit, Hungary welcomes and strongly supports the \nfact that the proximity talks have recently transformed \ninto direct talks between the Government of Israel and \nthe Palestinian Authority. We commend the personal \ncommitment of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and \nthe efforts made by the Quartet, including the \nEuropean Union, as well as the valuable contributions \nmade by a number of outstanding Arab statesmen in \nthis regard. \n Acting on its own, as well as within the United \nNations framework, Hungary is a partner of African \ncountries in enhancing development and establishing \npeace and security on the continent. We also encourage \nAfrica\u2019s voice to be heard in relation to compelling \nglobal questions such as water management, poverty \neradication and the empowerment of women. Still, we \nonce again emphasize the significance of the role of \nAfrican countries themselves and the importance of \ndialogue and negotiations in this process. \n In conclusion, let me, on a personal note as the \nonly Olympic champion in the Hall, emphasize my \nstrong belief that multilateral partnerships can only be \nenhanced by respecting the jointly established rules, \nwith special regard to the rules of fair play with other \nteams and players on the field. I am confident that, \nduring the coming session of work, the noble principles \nof the United Nations will continue to guide all \ndelegations in strengthening the kind of global \ncooperation within the United Nations machinery that \nis so strongly needed to tackle the challenges facing us \ntoday. I wish to assure the Assembly that Hungary \nstands ready to do its utmost to contribute to those \nnoble goals."

        "file_text": "I have the honour to join \nprevious speakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your \nelection to the post of President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session; I wish you every \nsuccess in that highly responsible post. I would like as \nwell to thank your predecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam \nTreki, for his productive work. I also express my \nprofound respect and gratitude to the Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his \nleadership and dedication in reviving the Organization. \n Azerbaijan recognizes the central role of the \nUnited Nations in maintaining international peace and \nsecurity, promoting sustainable development and \nadvocating fundamental freedoms for the people of the \nworld. Azerbaijan believes that the United Nations has \nto be stronger and more capable in engaging in a range \nof global issues in every part of the world, as well as in \naddressing the aspirations and concerns of each \nMember State. \n As a country suffering from the devastation of \nwar and occupation, Azerbaijan strongly believes that \nfaithful observance of universally accepted norms and \nprinciples of international law concerning good-\nneighbourliness, friendly relations, cooperation among \nStates and the fulfilment in good faith of the \nobligations assumed by States are of the greatest \nimportance for the maintenance of international peace \nand security. The ongoing armed conflict between \nArmenia and Azerbaijan still represents a major threat \nto international and regional peace and security. The \nconflict has resulted in the occupation of one fifth of \nthe territory of Azerbaijan and has made approximately \none out of every nine people in my country an \ninternally displaced person or a refugee. \n It has been internationally recognized that the \nRepublic of Armenia bears the primary responsibility \nfor occupying Azerbaijan\u2019s territories, committing the \nmost serious international crimes during the conflict, \ncarrying out ethnic cleansing and trying to create a \nmono-ethnic culture in the captured Azerbaijani \nterritories. The Security Council has adopted four \nresolutions and has expressed its full support for the \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and \nthe inadmissibility of the use of force for the \nacquisition of territories. It has also recognized that \nNagorny Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan and has called \nfor the immediate, full and unconditional withdrawal \nof the occupying forces from all occupied territories of \nAzerbaijan. The General Assembly and other \ninternational organizations, including the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the \nCouncil of Europe, the European Parliament and the \nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, have adopted \nsimilar positions. Unfortunately, despite the \nconsolidated position of the international community, \nAzerbaijani territories continue to remain under \noccupation. \n Armenia so far, instead of negotiating in good \nfaith with a view to finding a durable solution to the \nconflict as soon as possible, has preferred escalation, \nwith unpredictable consequences. Despite ongoing \npolitical efforts towards the earliest possible resolution \nof the conflict, activities in the occupied areas of \nAzerbaijan are in gross violation of international law \nand serve to further consolidate the current status quo \nof the occupation, securing the results of ethnic \n \n \n19 10-54833 \n \ncleansing and colonization of the captured territories, \nand causing serious obstruction to the peaceful \nresolution of the conflict. \n Thus, over the period since the beginning of the \nconflict, significant numbers of settlers have been \nencouraged to move into the occupied areas \ndepopulated of their Azerbaijani inhabitants. In 2005 \nOSCE dispatched a fact-finding mission to the \noccupied territories of Azerbaijan, which found \nevidence of the presence of settlers there and made a \ncall to discourage any further settlement of the \noccupied territory of Azerbaijan. Measures are also \nbeing consistently undertaken by Armenia with the \npurpose of altering the historical and cultural features \nof the occupied areas in an attempt to remove any signs \ntestifying to their original Azerbaijani cultural and \nhistorical roots. As a result, not a single Azerbaijani \nhistoric or cultural monument has been left undamaged \nand no sacred site has escaped vandalism in the \noccupied territories. Implantation of settlers as well as \ndestruction and appropriation of the historical and \ncultural heritage in the occupied areas, along with \nvarious other forms of illegal activity there, directly \naffect the property rights of internally displaced \npersons. \n The lack of agreement on political issues, the \nprotracted nature of the conflict and prolonged \nnegotiations should not be used as pretexts for not \naddressing other problems deriving from continued and \ndeliberate disrespect for international humanitarian law \nand international human rights law in connection with \nthe conflict. \n The earliest possible resolution of the armed \nconflict in and around the Nagorny Karabakh region of \nAzerbaijan remains a primary task for us. The OSCE \nMinsk Group Co-Chair countries are engaged in efforts \nto bring peace and stability to the region. Resolution of \nthe conflict envisages the withdrawal of Armenian \nforces from the occupied Azerbaijani territories within \na fixed time framework, restoration of all \ncommunications, return of all refugees and internally \ndisplaced persons to their places of origin, international \nsecurity guarantees, including peacekeeping forces, and \ninterim status for Nagorny Karabakh. We are ready to \ncontinue the talks in good faith for finalizing the status \nof Nagorny Karabakh within the Republic of \nAzerbaijan. \n The step-by-step approach introduced to Armenia \nand Azerbaijan in December 2009 by the OSCE Minsk \nGroup Co-Chairs is accepted by Azerbaijan in principle \nas a basis for achieving a lasting resolution of the \nArmenia-Azerbaijan Nagorny Karabakh conflict. \nUnfortunately, Armenia is still delaying a definite \nanswer to the Co-Chairs\u2019 proposal. \n Azerbaijan highly appreciates the principled \nstand of Member States on issues of vital importance \nfor Azerbaijan pertaining to its sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity. We rely on the continued solidarity \nof the international community with the just position of \nAzerbaijan and on valuable support for our initiatives \nwithin the United Nations, aimed at addressing the \nexisting challenges in an impartial, open and \ncomprehensive manner. \n Despite the unresolved conflict over Nagorny \nKarabakh and occupied territories, the Government of \nAzerbaijan has succeeded in guaranteeing political \nstability, democratic development, economic prosperity \nand social welfare in the country. Today, Azerbaijan is \none of the most rapidly developing economies in the \nworld. Within the last five years alone, Azerbaijan has \nnearly tripled its gross domestic product. The strategic \ngeographic location of Azerbaijan at the intersection of \nmajor trade routes along the emerging East-West and \nNorth-South transport and energy corridors provides an \nimportant asset to turn the country into an energy and \ninfrastructure hub. \n Azerbaijan possesses considerable proven oil and \nnatural gas reserves and has good prospects for new \ndiscoveries. Modern infrastructure for transporting \nhydrocarbons to international markets has already been \ncreated in Azerbaijan and has been used for exporting \noil and natural gas, which can diversify supply sources \nand strengthen international energy security. This is \nparticularly crucial for gas supplies. With proven \nreserves of 2 trillion cubic metres of natural gas and a \npotential of up to 5 trillion cubic metres or, and \nperhaps even more, Azerbaijan is ready to provide its \nown contribution to ensure the stable development of \nthe world natural gas market. \n Another globally important project, on which \nAzerbaijan is working very intensively with its \nneighbours is building and enhancing the regional \nrailroad infrastructure. This railroad connection will \nopen an enormous opportunity for transporting all \nkinds of cargo between Asia and Europe. \n  \n \n10-54833 20 \n \n As a very active member of the Extractive \nIndustries Transparency Initiative, Azerbaijan, in an \nopen and transparent manner, uses its energy revenues \nfor the development of the country, particularly in \nbuilding human capital and working to eradicate \nreducing poverty. Thus, we were able to achieve a \ndramatic poverty reduction, from 49 per cent in 2003 \nto 11 per cent in 2009. And I strongly believe that \nthrough sustainable development Azerbaijan will attain \neven more in this field in upcoming years. \n Azerbaijan has always been a place of \ncoexistence and tolerance among different faiths, \nethnic groups and philosophies. As an active member \nof the Group of Friends of the Alliance of \nCivilizations, Azerbaijan contributes to the promotion \nof inter-religious and intercultural dialogue based on \nmutual respect and understanding. Azerbaijan hosted \nthe World Summit of Religious Leaders, with \nparticipants from 32 States, in the spring of this year \nand has put forward an initiative to host a world forum \nfor intercultural dialogue in April 2011. \n One of the most serious and long-term challenges \nthat can affect every part of the globe is climate \nchange. We in Azerbaijan proclaimed 2010 a year of \necology and adopted various special programmes in the \nfield of environmental protection. \n Azerbaijan demonstrates full support and \nundertakes ceaseless efforts for the promotion of \nsustainable development and global prosperity for all, \npaying particular attention to addressing the special \nneeds and vulnerabilities of the developing and least \ndeveloped countries, as well as of those who are \nrecovering from natural disasters. Azerbaijan will \ncontinue to contribute to the realization of the \nMillennium development goals and objectives agreed \nwithin the United Nations."

        "file_text": "I would like to thank the \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \nsession, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki of Libya, for his \ntireless efforts in taking forward the Assembly\u2019s work \nand to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as \nPresident at the sixty-fifth session. \n I would also like at this point to fully align my \ncountry\u2019s positions with those expressed in the \nstatement of the European Union (EU). It is my firm \nbelief that the General Assembly would greatly benefit \nfrom arrangements that would allow EU \nrepresentatives to fulfil their responsibilities in an \neffective manner at formal meetings. \n We can all agree that the United Nations is the \nonly global entity that commands universal legitimacy \nand is the Organization to which we should all look, \nand actively support, in order to provide collective and \ntherefore optimal solutions to the ever-growing array \nof multifaceted issues confronting us. It is a fact that \nmeeting the needs of our peoples increasingly \ntranscends the abilities of individual nation-States. \nThat is where the role of the United Nations comes to \nthe fore, and it is why our discussions on reforming \nand revitalizing the Organization are of paramount \nimportance. \n Climate change is the world\u2019s greatest \nenvironmental challenge. We all know that it will \nincreasingly affect all aspects of our lives, including \npeace and security. We now need to focus all efforts in \norder to secure a successful outcome of the upcoming \nsummit in Canc\u00fan. \n The Greek Government is proposing a new \nMediterranean Climate Change Initiative, in close \ncollaboration with Mediterranean countries that are \nstrongly committed to climate and energy security. A \nformal launch of the Initiative is planned on \n22 October in Athens, ahead of the Canc\u00fan summit. In \nthe same vein, the central theme of our Chairmanship-\nin-Office of the Organization of the Black Sea \nEconomic Cooperation is \u201cthe Black Sea turns green\u201d. \n The recent global economic and financial crisis \nhas left few countries unaffected. Greece was no \nexception, despite the tough and radical reform agenda \nwe are implementing that is setting the country steadily \nback on its feet. Efforts for a more efficient and \nconcrete global financial regulatory framework are \nnecessary. In that regard, I welcome the results of the \nHigh-level Meeting on the Millennium Development \nGoals, and I commend the Secretary-General for his \ntimely initiative. \n Greece continues to support all efforts for an \neffective and efficient Human Rights Council with \nenhanced status, mandate, structures and membership. \nGreece will actively defend the relevance of the \nHuman Rights Council through its candidacy for the \nyears 2012 to 2015. \n Promoting effective interaction and coordination \nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations \nmust be one of our key priorities. We consider the \nupcoming 2010 summit of the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) a major \n \n \n27 10-55264 \n \nmilestone in the European security dialogue \u2014 the \nwell-known Corfu Process, launched by the Greek \nOSCE Chairmanship in 2009. \n Greece has made a commitment especially to our \nregion and its people. A key factor for bringing \nstability and development to our region is good-\nneighbourliness, a fundamental principle that together \nwith the other principles set out in the Charter of the \nUnited Nations constitutes the cornerstone of \ncontemporary international legal order. \n The Balkans \u2014our immediate neighbourhood \u2014 \nis still a sensitive area in terms of stability. The dust \nfrom the dissolution of Yugoslavia has not yet settled. \nGreece\u2019s vision for the Balkans is of a region in which \ndemocracy finally becomes the norm, where citizens\u2019 \naspirations can finally be realized through peaceful and \ndemocratic practices, where the rights of minorities are \nrespected, and where Governments are accountable, \neconomies are transparent and politics allow for the \nfullest participation of all elements of society. \n In order to breathe new life into the prospect of \nthe Balkans\u2019 integration into the European Union, \nGreece has put forward a new initiative known as \nAgenda 2014. There are still open wounds in our \nregion \u2014 Kosovo being the most pressing \u2014 and we \nmust ensure that this time the European Union will be \npresent with a strong voice. The European prospect for \nour entire region can boost the political process that is \nabout to begin on Kosovo. At the same time, we need \nto keep an open and clear path for Serbia to begin \naccession negotiations with the European Union. \n Another open issue in the Balkans revolves \naround the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of \nMacedonia. That is not a bilateral, pedantic dispute \nabout historic symbols, as some may try to portray it, \nbut a regional question with deep historical roots \nrelated to good-neighbourliness. A compromise on the \nname issue is needed. Greece has already done its part. \nA fair and lasting solution can be based only on a name \nwith a geographic qualifier to be used for all purposes, \nerga omnes. Let me explain why. \n Macedonia is a large geographic region, most of \nwhich lies in Greece. A small part is in the former \nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia and a smaller part in \nBulgaria. The part cannot represent the whole, and the \nexclusive claims of the former Yugoslav Republic of \nMacedonia to the name \u201cMacedonia\u201d cannot be \nallowed to fuel nationalism. Any solution must be \nuniversally implemented, because otherwise today\u2019s \nsituation will simply be perpetuated. We have \nintensified our efforts to reach a settlement in the \ncontext of the established United Nations negotiating \nprocess, led by Mr. Nimetz. \n I chose the General Assembly, which is the \nnatural forum for solving international disputes, to \ndeclare once again Greece\u2019s readiness to reach a \nsolution, even tomorrow, and to call upon Prime \nMinister Gruevski to display leadership and become \nour partner for progress, progress that will result in a \nbright and prosperous future for our neighbours in the \nEuropean Union \u2014 a future we wish to see become a \nreality soon. Greece is extending a hand of friendship \nand cooperation. The time has come for our neighbours \nto take that hand. \n The Arab-Israeli conflict is again at a turning \npoint. The resumption of direct talks was a significant \nachievement, but only the beginning. Now our number \none priority is to sustain that dialogue and for it to bear \nfruit. Both sides have an obligation to show respect for \nthat fragile diplomatic process. Actions that threaten its \nvery existence, like Israeli settlement construction, \nmust be avoided in order to prevent the negotiations \nfrom becoming one more exercise in futility. \n I would like to thank the Secretary-General and \nall those who labour with him for a just solution in \nCyprus, a solution based on United Nations resolutions \nfor a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation with one \ninternational personality, one citizenship and one \nsovereignty, a solution in full conformity with the \nacquis communautaire. \n Cyprus is a tragic example of where our shared \nsense of justice \u2014 our shared code of values \u2014 has \ngone astray. Cyprus is the victim of military invasion \nand remains occupied by foreign troops. That is the \ntruth; that is reality, and it must end. We need to move \nbeyond that situation. It will take courage from \neveryone involved. It is a matter of political will, \nresolution and determination, such as that displayed by \nPresident Christofias. \n I extend my appeal to the Turkish Cypriots. We \nwant you near us, in our wider European family. The \nparticipation of a reunited Cyprus in the European \nUnion means that every Cypriot enjoys safety, equality \nunder the law, protection of their human rights, \nappropriate representation and security under a \nEuropean roof. Let me be clear: in the modern \n  \n \n10-55264 28 \n \nEuropean environment, relics of the past, such as \nguarantor Powers, seem and sound anachronistic and \ncompletely out of touch. \n Turkey can prove its commitment to a lasting \nsolution to the Cyprus issue by withdrawing its \noccupation forces from the island, thus boosting both \nthe negotiation process and its own European \nperspective. \n Greek-Turkish relations are an important \nparameter for the stability of the region. Burdened by a \nheavy historical past as we are, it is not an easy task to \nchange course and turn a long-standing rivalry into \ngood-neighbourliness, free from the threat of the use of \nforce or unfounded territorial claims. Respect for \ninternational law is the sole basis for a healthy and \npeaceful relationship between our two countries. \n We have opened a dialogue, one that is honest, \nand although we may and do differ on many issues, \nsuch as how we see Cyprus and how we approach our \nbilateral relations, this open approach can only lead to \na progressive resolution of our problems. The Turkish \nleadership and the people of Turkey know we are \nhonest in what we say and in our desire for a new and \npeaceful relationship. I strongly believe our mutual \ninterests can outweigh our political differences. We can \nand must resolve these differences through peaceful \nmeans, and a possible way to go is through the \nInternational Court of Justice. \n I do not want to give the false impression that all \nour problems have suddenly been resolved. It is most \ndistressing that a variety of statements and acts still \nundermine this very genuine and difficult effort. The \nlong-standing threat of war, the casus belli against my \ncountry, is unacceptable and has no place in our \nEuropean and global family of values and principles. \n There are those who certainly may wish that our \nefforts fail, but it is our historical duty to overcome \nthose difficulties and maintain the momentum in \nresponse to our peoples\u2019 mandate and their desire for \npeace. \n We look forward to the day when Belgrade and \nPristina will be an easy bus ride away, when Jerusalem \nand Damascus, Athens and Ankara and, of course, the \ntwo parts of divided Nicosia will no longer be \nseparated by fear and suspicion, but will be joined in \npeace. Those were the words used and the vision \nexpressed by George Papandreou, today\u2019s Prime \nMinister of Greece, in his very first address to the \nGeneral Assembly as Greek Foreign Minister in 1999 \n(see A/54/PV.9). Allow me repeat those words and \nvision in my first address to this body in the same \ncapacity. This is a wish and vision that, I think, we all \nshare. \n "

        "file_text": "I wish to \ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. We are \nconfident that your considerable expertise in the field \nof foreign policy and economics will be decisive for \nthe success of all sectors of United Nations activity. I \nalso wish to thank the outgoing President, His \nExcellency Ali Abdussalam Treki, for the excellent \nwork carried out during the Assembly\u2019s sixty-fourth \nsession. \n I would like to express special thanks to the \nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \nfor his energy and extraordinary determination in \nleading this Organization. In particular, San Marino \nappreciates the interest he has shown towards all \nMember countries, without any distinction, regardless \nof their size. My Government has particularly \nappreciated the Secretary-General\u2019s commitment in the \nfield of reforms and his constant presence in all \ninternational politically relevant situations and in \nemergency situations. His presence in Haiti and \nPakistan in the days following the terrible events that \nwe all witnessed demonstrates not only the \ndetermination to affirm United Nations presence during \ncrises, but also a personal and particular sensitivity \ntowards tragedies deeply affecting people. \n At a time characterized by major global \nchallenges that the international community is called \nupon to face, the United Nations reform process \n \n \n29 10-55122 \n \nbecomes fundamental for future world stability and \nmust remain the target of all our efforts. We have the \nduty to guarantee the full effectiveness of the \nOrganization\u2019s activities, with a view to preserving and \nstrengthening its essential value as a point of reference \nfor the international community and for any individual. \nWe cannot afford to see the role of the United Nations \nweakened through inability to reach agreement on the \nmeasures to be taken to improve its functioning. \n I have the pleasure to reiterate again this year the \nsupport San Marino grants to the revitalization process \nof the General Assembly. In that regard, I wish to thank \nArgentina and Slovenia, Co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc \nWorking Group on the revitalization of the General \nAssembly, for the Group\u2019s recently approved report \n(A/64/903), which is the outcome of considerable \nefforts and many informal meetings with the States \nMembers of the United Nations. \n This reform is particularly important for my \ncountry, since the General Assembly is the most \ndemocratic body of the United Nations and, as such, \nthe most effective and sometimes the only forum where \na small State can express its opinions. San Marino \ntherefore hopes that through this reform, the Assembly \nmay work more efficiently and improve its relations \nwith the other main bodies of the United Nations to \navoid duplication of activities and effectively \nimplement its resolutions. \n The Republic of San Marino has been following \nwith interest the Security Council reform process since \n1994, and it is grateful to the Afghan Chair of the \nintergovernmental negotiations on Council reform for \nthe important work he has carried out this year and for \nthe wisdom and impartiality with which he has \npresided over negotiations aimed at reaching the \nbroadest possible agreement. San Marino believes that \nthe reform should lead to a more democratic, \nresponsible, transparent and efficient Security Council. \nThe reform should also bring about a more balanced \nrelationship between the Security Council and the \nGeneral Assembly, as well as more effective \ncooperation with the Secretariat. Those objectives can \nbe achieved only through a permanent dialogue among \nStates and increased flexibility in the respective \npositions. \n I wish to congratulate you, Mr. President, on the \nchoice of the theme for this year\u2019s session \u2014 the role \nof the United Nations in global governance. That is a \nparticularly complex subject, since it concerns the \nglobal threats that affect the destinies of our peoples in \nan increasingly direct way: climate change and \nbiodiversity, the economic, financial and employment \ncrises, food security, public health, disarmament and \nthe proliferation of weapons, and the fight against \nterrorism. \n Today, the theme of global governance is \ninevitably linked to a new way of conceiving \nmultilateralism and to a new form of international \ncooperation, one that acknowledges the interdependence \nof the problems we face at the international, national and \nregional levels. We have learned from the crises of the \nlast few years that it is necessary to adopt an integrated \nand comprehensive approach, more efficient \nmechanisms for coordinating our policies, and a global \nand coordinated course of action. \n San Marino believes that the United Nations has a \nduty to be at the core of that process and to play a \nleading role in managing global governance, not only \nbecause of its deeply democratic nature, with universal \nparticipation and undisputed legitimacy, but also \nbecause \u2014 thanks to the richness and diversity of \ncultures and traditions represented here \u2014 it can adopt \nan approach that harmonizes the interests of the entire \ninternational community and aims at sustainable \ndevelopment for all peoples. \n Last year, the world economy suffered a \ndevastating financial crisis, the consequences of which \nare still evident to all. Today, unemployment has \nreached extremely high levels in many countries. \nIncreases in the prices of food products and persistent \ninequalities contribute to higher poverty rates and \ncause high social tensions and violence. The global \neconomic and financial crisis has severely hit every \ncountry in the world, with no distinctions, thus \nbecoming one of today\u2019s major challenges for our \nOrganization as well. Some have been able to \nwithstand the crisis, while for many others it is \nunfortunately still a very immediate problem, \ninfluencing all decisions. \n Despite the gradual recovery of the global \neconomy this year, it is fundamental that we always \ncoordinate policies, and coordinate them effectively, \nwith a view to guaranteeing balanced, inclusive and \nsubstantial growth. In that regard, San Marino \nrecognizes the essential role played by the Group of 20 \n(G-20), which in 2009 was able to prevent a global \n  \n \n10-55122 30 \n \neconomic depression by taking coordinated and timely \naction. However, the G-20 decision-making process \nshould be even more inclusive and transparent, so that \nits decisions can translate into effective action at the \nglobal level. That requires developing specific \nmechanisms through which the interests, concerns and \naspirations of countries outside the G-20 can be taken \ninto account, with particular reference to developing \ncountries, in order to favour G-20 actions \ncomplementary to those of the United Nations. \n Over the last two years, the Republic of San \nMarino, well aware of the interconnectedness of global \neconomic and financial policies, has intensified its \nefforts to make its legislative instruments and practices \nrelating to transparency and international cooperation \ncompliant with international standards established by \nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment and MONEYVAL. Within a short period, \nlaws to combat money-laundering and terrorist \nfinancing were adopted, banking and financial \nsupervision services were reorganized and amendments \nwere made to company legislation, eliminating \nanonymous companies. \n The San Marino Government expresses its \nsatisfaction with resolution 64/289, on United Nations \nsystem-wide coherence, which the General Assembly \nunanimously adopted on 2 July. That resolution, the \nresult of year-long negotiations, is an historic \nachievement for the reform process of the United \nNations, in particular for strengthening the entire \nsystem. It provides for a higher degree of coordination, \nefficiency and transparency, while avoiding \nfragmentation, waste, duplication of tasks and effort. \n A fundamental element of that resolution is the \nestablishment of the new United Nations Entity for \nGender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, to be \nknown as UN Women, which will become operational \non 1 January 2011. The mandates of four existing bodies \nconcerned with the promotion of women\u2019s rights will be \ntransferred to this new entity, which will strengthen, in \nterms of capability, efficiency and responsibility, the \nUnited Nations system in the field of gender equality \nand the empowerment of women. \n The Republic of San Marino pays special \nattention to this subject and over the last few years has \npromoted several national initiatives making women in \nSan Marino aware of their rights and of the State \nprotection mechanisms available to them. At the \ninternational level, San Marino has joined several \ncampaigns aimed at raising awareness of women\u2019s \nrights among the public and national authorities, such \nas the Unite to End Violence Against Women \ncampaign, launched by the Secretary-General in 2008. \n I would like to underline on this occasion the \nfundamental importance of the efforts of the \ninternational community, as well as pressure exerted by \ncivil society, to achieve higher standards of human \nrights protection. Moreover, we cannot forget that \nwomen and children are always the most vulnerable \nsection of society in situations where rights and \nfundamental freedoms are violated. In several \ncountries, women have to face very difficult situations: \nmany of their rights are often violated and the authors \nof the violations go unpunished. The international \ncommunity must spare no effort to ensure that the \ndignity, rights and fundamental freedoms of all human \nbeings are duly protected. \n San Marino also believes that the international \ncommunity should be responsible for working as \neffectively as possible to combat human trafficking. \nToday that modern form of slavery still affects millions \nof people, the majority of whom are also women and \nchildren. The Republic of San Marino attaches the \nutmost importance to the adoption last July of \nresolution 64/293, which contains the United Nations \nGlobal Plan of Action against Trafficking in Persons. \n The collective commitment to combating \ntrafficking in persons led to the adoption of that \nresolution, the result of long consultations and complex \nnegotiations. San Marino guarantees its support for this \ninitiative and will cooperate with all Member States in \norder to implement the Plan of Action. This initiative is \nparticularly important to us, since this year we ratified \nthe United Nations Convention against Transnational \nOrganized Crime, its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and \nPunish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and \nChildren, and its Protocol against the Smuggling of \nMigrants by Land, Sea and Air. \n As underlined in the Secretary-General\u2019s report \n\u201cKeeping the promise\u201d (A/64/665), the Millennium \nDeclaration and the Millennium Development Goals \nhave brought about a slow but progressive \nimprovement in the fight against extreme poverty, \nhunger and disease and in the promotion of gender \nequality, education and environmental sustainability. \n \n \n31 10-55122 \n \nHowever, the report outlines that progress has been \ndiscontinuous and uneven from one region to another. \n We have recently witnessed a series of severe and \nunprecedented crises, including the world economic \nand financial crisis, the food and energy crisis, the one \nrelated to climate change, humanitarian crises \u2014 \nincluding the recent earthquake in Haiti and the huge \nfloods in Pakistan \u2014 and those caused by the increased \nnumber of conflicts. After having obtained good \nresults, we are now experiencing a severe setback, and \nan even more structured commitment will be necessary \nto overcome those obstacles and achieve the Goals by \n2015. \n The Republic of San Marino expresses its \nsatisfaction with the General Assembly\u2019s High-level \nPlenary Meeting on the Millennium Development \nGoals, which recently concluded. The outcome \ndocument of that meeting (resolution 65/1) aims at \ndeveloping effective strategies for action and, most of \nall, at renewing the commitment and responsibility of \neach country to achieving the Goals set. \n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the strong \ncommitment of the Republic of San Marino in favour \nof the implementation of the ideals of the United \nNations and of the principles enshrined in its Charter. \nWe will guarantee our support to all initiatives \nnecessary to reach such an aim."

        "file_text": "I \nbegin by congratulating Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \nelection to preside over the sixty-fifth session of the \nGeneral Assembly, and I also congratulate his entire \nBureau on their election. I also congratulate the \nPresident\u2019s predecessor, Mr. Ali Treki, on the devotion \nand skill with which he carried out his mandate, to \ngreat general satisfaction. \n Finally, I pay a heartfelt tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his praiseworthy, tireless \nefforts to uphold and promote the purposes and principles \nof the Charter. The Democratic Republic of the Congo \nthanks him for having agreed to be present in Kinshasa \nduring the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of our \naccession to independence. This is proof of his \ncommitment and that of the United Nations, together with \nthe Congolese people, in the search for peace, stability \nand development. My country reaffirms its determination \nto support him in his efforts to bring about a world that is \nsafer for all of us. \n This session is being held at a time of particular \ndifficulty for all humanity, which is in crisis, marked \nby challenges to the basic principles of international \nrelations, worsened by the self-interest of nations. The \noutcome document adopted yesterday on accelerating \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals, \nwhile being a message of hope, nevertheless gives a \nsense of the gap separating the wealthy countries from \nthe poor countries as we seek better living conditions \nfor our peoples. \n The food crisis and famine afflict many peoples \nof the planet. Endemic diseases that had almost \ndisappeared are now resurfacing, and new scourges are \nappearing. In particular, we see a plethora of natural \ndisasters in the wake of climate change, which is \nproving to be even more devastating. \n The grim picture that I have just painted should \nmotivate us to be more united in mobilizing our efforts \nin a spirit of constructive solidarity in order to find \nagreed, comprehensive solutions measuring up to the \nvast challenges that we must meet. \n The Democratic Republic of the Congo makes a \npressing appeal to all States to work together at long \nlast for a better world, while tirelessly trying to bring \npeace wherever areas of tension persist. \n The Democratic Republic of the Congo also \ncommends all the efforts made by a number of States \nunder the auspices of the United Nations to restore \npeace, security, democracy and development to certain \nregions of the Middle East, the Balkans, the Horn of \nAfrica, Central Africa and other regions of the world. \n My country is emerging from a multifaceted \ncrisis worsened by the various wars that ravaged it \nuntil recently. Like many other African nations, it also \nsuffers from the harmful consequences of the global \neconomic and financial crisis. As I told my people on \n30 June, on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of \nour independence, poverty and a precarious situation \nare neither inevitable nor irreversible. \n The Democratic Republic of the Congo wants the \nnext 50 years to be much brighter and more promising. \nIt undertakes, to that end, to make its contribution to \nthe forward march of humankind towards a better \nworld. \n With respect to the global challenges of \npreserving the planet, my country, wondrously \nendowed and blessed by nature, reaffirms its solemn \ncommitment to defend its biodiversity in its policies \nand its national development plan. \n The Government of my country, whose forests \nprovide the world with its second set of \u201clungs\u201d, \nbelieves that the issue of climate change and the \nenvironment will require the establishment of a global \nenvironment authority, which should involve both \npublic and private institutions, civil society and \nscientific circles. \n With respect to establishing and consolidating \npeace, my country welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s \nacceptance of our request to establish in Libreville in \nthe Republic of Gabon a United Nations office for \nCentral Africa, which clearly will help bring the United \nNations closer and ensure better coordination between \nit and the countries of the region. Issues of peace, \nsecurity, humanitarian assistance and development will \nbe considered speedily, and implementation of \nmeasures adopted will receive the necessary urgency. \n It is up to us to consolidate peace everywhere, \nthrough international and regional mechanisms and \n \n \n17 10-54833 \n \ninstruments for the maintenance of peace and the \nprevention and settlement of conflict. \n The Democratic Republic of the Congo is \nresolved to eradicate the phenomenon of foreign armed \ngroups in its national territory. This is the framework in \nwhich should be understood the military operations \nthat we have carried out systematically since 2009 to \nforce such groups to lay down their arms for good. Due \nto military pressures and awareness-raising and \noutreach campaigns, and also because the were \ndisplace far from their own borders of origin, the \nvolunteer repatriations have intensified and will \ncontinue to do so. \n The question of the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army is no \nlonger a matter of defence; rather, it is now a matter of \npublic order. Nevertheless, given the crimes and \natrocities that it still commits against our civilian \npopulations, we shall remain mobilized and vigilant. \nThe ultimate aim is to put that group in a situation in \nwhich it can no longer do any harm. \n Together with our efforts to eradicate the \ninsecurity in the eastern part of our national territory, \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo is working to \nstrengthen the rule of law, democracy and good \ngovernance. \n With respect to justice in particular, I should like \nto dwell a little on the ordeal of Congolese women in \nthe Provinces of North and South Kivu. The lack of \nsecurity is the primary cause of the tragedy. Armed \ngroups, which benefit from the illegal exploitation of \nraw materials, are at the very root of the scourge. We \nhave decided upon appropriate measures to address this \nunacceptable situation. \n The Democratic Republic of the Congo is now \naddressing the causes of the violence against women \nand the causes of recurrent conflict. At the same time, \nit is enhancing its judiciary in order to address together \npeace, justice and security. The fight against impunity \ncontinues to be of prime importance in Government \nactions. \n My Government is working within the framework \nof achieving the Millennium Development Goals to do \nits utmost to meet the basic needs of our people: \nhealth, education, food self-sufficiency, basic \ninfrastructures, electricity and drinking water for all, \nnot to mention fighting malaria, HIV/AIDS and \npoverty. I appreciate the commitment of our partners \nwho are supporting us in achieving my country\u2019s \ndevelopment priorities. \n Because of the complex nature of the various \ntasks that need to be carried out on our territory of \nmore than several million square kilometres, the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo is a vast building \nsite, requiring multiple contributions for reconstruction \nand modernization. Such contributions are welcome, \nparticularly in the framework of a partnership that we \nwant to be respectful and proactive with the private \nsector. \n Today the economic indicators are changing in a \npositive manner. Several key actions have been \nsuccessfully taken. The credit for this success, which \ngives us the means for a new start, lies above all with \nthe Congolese people. It also stems from the valuable \ncontributions and cooperation of our partners. \n With regard to political and administrative \nmanagement, we plan to hold presidential and \nlegislative elections in 2011. My Government is \nmaking it a point of honour to consolidate democracy \nby respecting electoral time frames, ensuring \naccountability of the highest order and completing the \nestablishment of the institutions provided for by the \nConstitution within the framework of the \ndecentralization process. \n My country supports the process of reforming our \nuniversal Organization. The Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo reaffirms that the Member States should \nwork resolutely within that trend. United Nations \nreform, including Security Council reform, should \ntherefore be undertaken without delay, because that \nwould support the achievement of our dreams, given \nthe new challenges and changes that affect our planet. \n Expansion of the Security Council is a democratic \nrequirement. This vision needs to be strengthened by \naffirming the authority of the General Assembly, in order \nto enable its President to play a key role in the quest for \nsolutions to the problems of our time. \n It is said that nature will give man only those \nchallenges that are within the reach of his creative \npotential, which has produced tremendous inventions. \nDespite our diversity, the time has now come to put our \nhuman resources at the service of our collective \ncreativity. \n We should not leave the controls of the global \neconomy to unbridled capitalism, which recognizes no \n  \n \n10-54833 18 \n \nregulation of movements of capital, and is motivated \nonly by the profit motive. It is our duty also to \nglobalize the universal values of justice, solidarity and \naltruism that contribute to international peace and \nsecurity. \n Together we can give humanity better times, if \nday after day we work to achieve the ideals of our \nOrganization."

        "file_text": "I congratulate \nMr. Joseph Deiss on his assumption of the presidency \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. \n It is commonly acknowledged that the \ninternational community faces challenges that are \nmultiplying in scope and magnitude. This raises a \nquestion about whether our ability to respond to these \nchallenges grows in tandem. We have recently \nwitnessed climatic and natural disasters on a scale \nnever experienced in recent history, such as the floods \nin Pakistan, the fires in Russia, the earthquake in Haiti \nand the landslides in China. \n Environmental degradation and climate change; \nrising poverty, food insecurity and the lack of basic \nhealth care for so many of our fellow human beings in \na world with deep social disparities; terrorism; the \nvisible threat of nuclear proliferation, especially in the \nMiddle East; and the continuing economic crisis of the \npast few years, which has primarily affected millions \nof working people and the poor, require effective \nregional and global action through the United Nations \nand other multilateral organizations. \n \n \n21 10-54959 \n \n Turning our attention to my own neighbourhood, \nthe Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East, I \nwould like to welcome the relaunching of negotiations \nbetween Israel and the Palestinian Authority and to \nexpress hope for a successful outcome. We all know \nthat it is a difficult task, but there is no alternative to \ndialogue. We express the hope that no unilateral \nmeasure will be taken that would create more obstacles \nto the negotiations to reach an agreement. The solution \nshould lead to the creation of an independent and \nsovereign Palestinian State living side by side with the \nState of Israel. \n Cyprus, together with Greece, has proposed the \ncreation of a humanitarian sea corridor to the people of \nGaza, utilizing our proximity to the area and our good \nrelations with all sides. \n This year, Cyprus is celebrating the fiftieth year \nsince the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus and \nits participation as a full Member of the United \nNations. The Republic of Cyprus became a Member of \nthe Organization as soon as it gained its independence \nin the hope and with the aspiration of contributing to \nthe work of the Organization and playing a \nconstructive role in international affairs through the \npromotion of the implementation of the principles of \nthe Charter of the United Nations. With its unique \ngeographic position at the crossroads of three \ncontinents, Cyprus held the noble goal of serving as a \nbridge for peace and cooperation in its neighbourhood \nand beyond. \n Having gained its independence at a difficult \nperiod in world politics, Cyprus took a clear and \nconscious decision to join the Non-Aligned Movement. \nAs a founding member of the Movement, Cyprus \nplayed an active role in the work of the United Nations \nand in resolving international problems. We have \nalways held the view that problems cannot be resolved \nthrough military confrontation but must be solved \nthrough dialogue, diplomacy and respect for the \nterritorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of \nall countries and peoples, whether great or small, rich \nor poor. \n In 2004, the Republic of Cyprus joined the \nEuropean Union (EU) as a full member. Proud of its \ntraditions, Cyprus preserves its neutrality and seeks to \nplay an active and constructive role as an EU member \nState. \n After Cyprus won independence in 1960, the road \nfor Cypriots has not, unfortunately, been without \nproblems. Despite many difficulties and misfortunes, \nwe have managed to achieve economic growth and a \nsatisfactory standard of living for our people. In the \npolitical field, however, the first years of independence \nwere marked by difficulties and a lack of the necessary \npolitical cooperation between the two communities of \nthe island, which were called to govern the country \ntogether under the Constitution. Those early \ndifferences and difficulties were exacerbated by \nforeign interference. The culmination of these \ninterventions was the military coup of the junta that \nruled Greece at the time, and the illegal Turkish \ninvasion of July-August 1974. The military occupation \nby the Turkish Army of 37 per cent of the territory of \nthe Republic of Cyprus continues today, as does the \nviolation of the human rights of all Cypriot citizens, \nGreek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. \n The people of Cyprus have suffered enough. It is \ntime to overcome the problems, to achieve \nreconciliation between the two communities and to \nreunite our country and our people for the sake of \npeace and future generations. \n The General Assembly and Security Council have \nbeen addressing the Cyprus problem since the 1960s. A \nnumber of resolutions have been adopted by both the \nSecurity Council and the General Assembly aimed at \nsafeguarding the independence, territorial integrity, \nsovereignty and unity of the Republic of Cyprus. I take \nthis opportunity to express the appreciation of the \npeople of Cyprus to the Secretary-General, the Security \nCouncil and the United Nations as a whole for their \ncontinued and unwavering interest in Cyprus. \n In 1977, Archbishop Makarios, the President of \nCyprus at the time, accepted the evolution of the \nunitary State into a bicommunal, bizonal federation. \nThat historic compromise was a brave concession by \nthe Greek Cypriot community towards their Turkish \nCypriot compatriots. It sought to bring an end to the \nforeign occupation and to restore the unity of the \nRepublic of Cyprus. The composition of the population \nand the human geography of Cyprus were such that \nconditions for a federation did not exist. The two \ncommunities lived intermingled throughout the island. \nIt is for that reason that the acceptance of the \nbicommunal, bizonal federation by the Greek Cypriots \nconstituted a historic compromise and a concession \ntowards our Turkish Cypriot compatriots. \n  \n \n10-54959 22 \n \n After 1977, the Security Council through its \nresolutions endorsed the evolution of the Republic of \nCyprus into a bicommunal, bizonal federation with \npolitical equality, defined not as numerical equality but \nas the effective participation of both communities in all \norgans of Government. The united federal State would \nbe one, with a single sovereignty, a single citizenship \nand a single international personality. The federal State \nwould respect fundamental human rights and basic \nfreedoms in accordance with Security Council \nresolutions. The principles and values of the European \nUnion would also be observed. \n Since my election in 2008, I have actively \nengaged with the leadership of the Turkish Cypriot \ncommunity in a Cypriot-owned process within the \nframework of the Good Offices Mission of the \nSecretary-General in order to reach a mutually \nacceptable agreed solution on the constitutional and \nother internal aspects of the problem. Two years into \nthe process and despite the difficulties, some progress, \nalthough not as much as anticipated, has been achieved \non certain issues. At the outset of this process, we \nagreed with the Secretary-General that there would be \nno artificial deadlines or outside intervention in the \nform of arbitration or the submission of ready-made \nsolutions. \n With the new leader of the Turkish Cypriot \ncommunity, we worked through the summer and, in the \npast few weeks, have further intensified our meetings. \nIn order to achieve results soon, I have submitted a \npackage consisting of three proposals. First, I have \nsuggested linking the negotiation of the chapters of \nproperty, territorial adjustments and settlers in order to \ngive impetus to the process. I have also proposed that \nwhen we are close to reaching an agreement on the \ninternal aspects of the problem, we could hold an \ninternational conference under the auspices of the \nSecretary-General and with the participation of the \npermanent members of the Security Council, the \nguarantor Powers, the European Union, the Republic of \nCyprus and the two communities to discuss the \ninternational aspects of the problem.  \n The third element of my proposal concerns \nFamagusta. My series of proposals would benefit all \nsides and could create the necessary political climate to \ndrive the entire process forward. Unfortunately, the \nnew Turkish Cypriot leader and the Turkish leadership \nhave rejected these proposals. \n I would like to make a special reference here to \nour proposal on Famagusta. In 1974, Famagusta was a \ncity with a population of both Greek and Turkish \nCypriots. As the Turkish Army advanced towards the \ncity, the Greek Cypriot population was forced to flee. \nThe town of Varosha has been a ghost town ever since. \nThe Security Council considers the Government of \nTurkey responsible for the area, and in 1984, under \nresolution 550 (1984), demanded the return of the town \nto the United Nations in order that it might be \ninhabited by its legal inhabitants. Even before the \nadoption of resolution 550 (1984), the leaders of the \ntwo communities had agreed in 1979 to settle the issue \nof Famagusta as a matter of priority, notwithstanding \nany political negotiations on other issues.  \n My proposal, if accepted, would have benefits for \nall sides. In addition to the return of the fenced city to \nrightful inhabitants under United Nations control, my \nproposal includes the restoration of the medieval part \nof the city where our Turkish Cypriot compatriots live, \nas well as the opening of the port of Famagusta to \nexternal trade under EU supervision \u2014 a measure \ndirectly aimed at benefiting the Turkish Cypriots. Such \na development would also benefit Turkey\u2019s accession \nnegotiations with the EU and provide an excellent \nexample of harmonious coexistence and cooperation \nbetween the two communities. From this rostrum, I \nwould also like to propose that the National Guard and \nthe Turkish Army again cancel their annual military \nexercises this autumn.  \n Turkey\u2019s leadership has assured the international \ncommunity that it wants a solution of the problem by \nend of 2010. We are still waiting for its words to be \ntransformed into action. The same expectation was \nrepeatedly voiced by the European Council and in a \nrecent resolution of the European Parliament. The \nEuropean Union calls on Turkey to work on the basis \nof United Nations resolutions and to meet its \nobligations towards the European Union and the \nRepublic of Cyprus, which Turkey still fails to \nrecognize. \n Turkey must respect the independence and \nterritorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and \ncontribute to the achievement of an agreement that \nwould reunite Cyprus and its people. Our vision is of a \nreunited Cyprus, common homeland of Greek and \nTurkish Cypriots, without any foreign troops or settlers \non its territory and with full respect for the human \nrights and fundamental freedoms of all its people: \n \n \n23 10-54959 \n \nGreek and Turkish Cypriots, Maronites, Armenians and \nLatins. I would like to reiterate my commitment to \ndoing my utmost to that end. \n From this rostrum, I repeat my call on the Turkish \nleadership to meet with me, in parallel to the \nnegotiating process, so that I can share with them my \nvision for a solution of the Cyprus problem, which \nwould serve the interests of the Cypriots, Turkey and \nGreece, as well as of peace and security in the region. \n The challenges faced by the international \ncommunity are increasing. Climate change, poverty, \nmalnutrition and lack of access to basic health care, \nterrorism, wars, the threat of further nuclear \nproliferation and nuclear terrorism, the economic crisis \nand political instability in many regions of the world \nrequire us to undertake a renewed and more effective \neffort to protect humankind\u2019s achievements. The future \nis in our hands. We will succeed only if we achieve a \nmore just distribution and better redistribution of the \nworld\u2019s natural resources and wealth."

        "file_text": "As we \nopen this session of the General Assembly the world is \nstill facing problems of peace and security, crises, \nconflicts, inequality among States, poverty, hunger and \ndisease. To those recurrent problems are added new \nchallenges, such as climate change, natural disasters, \nterrorism, piracy, transnational organized crime, human \ntrafficking, nuclear proliferation and the world \neconomic and financial crisis. All these many issues by \ntheir very nature call out to the whole of the \ninternational community and demand global, \ncollective, coordinated solutions. \n The United Nations because of its global nature \noffers now more than ever the best framework for \nfinding lasting solutions. To do that, we need a strong, \nreformed Organization that can respond to the new \ndemands of our time. In this connection, my delegation \nwelcomes the new entity UN Women and the \nappointment at its head of the former President of \nChile, Michelle Bachelet \u2014 a brilliant woman, to \nwhom I wish every success. \n We will need to work with determination to bring \nabout the reforms necessary to restore to the United \nNations its operation as a global Organization and to \nmake it a real instrument of world governance. The \nprocess must continue with reform of the Security \nCouncil, both in its membership and its working \nmethods. Also we should continue to deal with the \nmatter of how to strengthen the General Assembly and \nits role. \n The High-level Plenary Meeting on the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) that ended \n22 September culminated in the adoption of an \noutcome document (resolution 65/1) that exhorts us to \nkeep our promises. We welcome it. Indeed, we must \nunite to attain these Goals. As I said at that time, just \ntwo days ago, Congo\u2019s commitment to reaching the \nMDGs remains firm. \n While ten years after the Goals were announced \nthe overall results in achieving them are mixed, \nespecially in Africa, it is nevertheless undeniable that \nmajor advances have been made in Africa during that \nsame period in such other essential areas as peace, \nsecurity and democracy. Africa as a whole is \nincreasingly emerging from a cycle of armed conflicts \nthat have greatly worked against its forward progress \ntowards development and prosperity. Today, thanks to \nthe efforts of the African Union, the backing of the \ninternational community and the involvement of \nAfrican leaders themselves, many conflicts have been \nor are being resolved. With that in mind, 2010 has been \nnamed a year of peace and security in Africa. \n Despite difficulties encountered here and there in \ncarrying out electoral processes, in a general way \ndemocracy is undeniably making a home in Africa. In \nGabon and Burundi, to mention only those two \ncountries, the popular will has expressed itself freely. \nWe nurture the hope that the elections upcoming in the \nnext months, notably in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Guinea, the \nNiger, Nigeria, the Central African Republic and the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, will play out in a \nclimate of calm. That is likewise our hope for the \nreferendum to be held in South Sudan, as called for in \nthe Comprehensive Peace Agreement. In this \nconnection we call on the international community to \ncontinue supporting that process until it is completed. \n On the subject of Central Africa, the United \nNations Office about to open will provide an additional \ntool, besides existing mechanisms, to promote good \ngovernance and build peace, cooperation and \ndevelopment. In the same vein of building confidence \nand peace in our subregion, from 15-19 November \nBrazzaville will be hosting the thirty-first meeting of \nthe United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on \nSecurity Questions in Central Africa. On that occasion \nthe States of the subregion will seal their commitment \nto fight the traffic in small arms and light weapons, by \nsigning the Kinshasa Convention. \n Since the tragic events that brought such \nsuffering to my country in the 1990s and early 2000s, \nthe Congolese Government has invested in the quest \nfor peace and national reconciliation, and works to \npreserve that precious accomplishment. Moreover, our \ngood neighbour policy \u2014 a policy we have always \nadvocated \u2014 is one of the pillars of our foreign policy. \nIt is evident today in the way in which we are handling \nthe humanitarian crisis resulting from the arrival in our \nterritory of over 100,000 nationals from \u00c9quateur \nProvince in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \nThe signing this past 10 June of the tripartite accord \namong the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo and the Office of the United \nNations High Commissioner for Refugees should make \npossible an imminent resolution of the problem and \ncontribute to stabilizing the situation in our brother \ncountry so in need of peace and security, especially on \nthe eve of its elections. \n  \n \n10-54965 56 \n \n Here I would like to thank the all the bilateral and \nmultilateral partners, namely France, Italy, the United \nStates of America, the World Food Programme and the \nOffice of the High Commissioner for Refugees, for all \nthe assistance they have graciously given us. \n We have just dedicated a high-level segment to \nbiodiversity in this year 2010, which has been \nproclaimed the International Year of Biodiversity. Yet \nanother new challenge of our age, biodiversity is \ncrucial to life on earth and holds especial interest for \nthe Congo, since we are one of the countries that \nhouses the Congo Basin, a major carbon sink. We have \nno doubt that the results of this segment will resonate \ninto the upcoming meetings in Nagoya, Japan, in \nOctober and in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, in November and \nDecember. \n The President of our Republic, Denis Sassou \nNguesso, holds the question of biodiversity to be of \ncritical global importance, because tropical forests play \na vital role in regulating and stabilizing the global \nclimate and generally in providing environmental \nservices. In this context, the Copenhagen Agreement, \nwhich took into account the process of reducing \nemissions from deforestation and degradation, known \nas REDD-plus, represented the culmination of major \nefforts deployed by the three forest basins, the Amazon \nBasin in South and Central America, the Congo Basin \nin Central Africa and the Mekong Basin in South-East \nAsia.  \n With our partners in dialogue and cooperation of \nthe Forest eleven tropical rainforest countries, the \nRepublic of the Congo reaffirms its will and \ndetermination to meet the challenges of conservation \nand the promotion of biodiversity. Such an effort can \nbring about lasting results only if it is supported by \nadditional financing that is sustainable and predictable. \n The question of human rights is also on the \nagenda for this session. My Government promotes \nhuman rights because they are so closely related to \npeace and development. With regard to human rights, \nthe Congo has always acted within the process of \ninternational legitimacy. That is evident in the \nphilosophy underpinning our Constitution, in what we \ndo on a day-to-day basis and in our extensive \nparticipation in the relevant international instruments.  \n Domestically, besides promulgating a law on the \nprotection of the child in the Republic of the Congo, \nour Parliament will shortly adopt a bill on promoting \nand protecting the rights of indigenous peoples, which \nthe Government has just submitted to it. The Republic \nof the Congo has undertaken a number of initiatives in \nthis field, thus taking an important step towards \nrecognizing, defending and protecting the rights of \nminorities. Next November, the Special Rapporteur on \nthe situation of human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms of indigenous people will visit Brazzaville. \nThat will be an opportune moment for dialogue and \nconsultations on matters related to indigenous peoples. \nIt should also help us speed up the implementation of \nrecommendations of the universal periodic review, a \nHuman Rights Council mechanism of which my \ncountry was the subject from 6 to 8 May 2009 in \nGeneva.  \n My country is a candidate for membership in the \nHuman Rights Council for the period from 2011 to \n2014, and we thus reaffirm our commitment to \nfulfilling our international commitments and to \nsupporting efforts of the international community to \nstrengthening those rights. I therefore take this \nopportunity to appeal for the Assembly\u2019s support for \nour candidacy in the elections, which will be held in \nMay 2011. \n On 15 August 2010, my country celebrated the \nfiftieth anniversary of its independence. The day was \ndevoted to the theme of remembering, but also and \nabove all, of responsibilities and action. On that \noccasion, the Government announced a number of \nsocio-economic measures to benefit our people. Those \nmeasures were made possible by the release of \nadditional financial resources following the significant \nforeign debt relief because of Congo\u2019s accession to the \nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. \nThose measures are part of the Government\u2019s resolve \nto move towards attaining the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals.  \n Such an enabling situation will allow my country \nto lay the foundations for an emerging economy. \nIndeed, it is President Denis Sassou Nguesso\u2019s \nambition to make Congo a modern and prosperous \nState that plays its part in the family of free modern \nnations. But that ambition, however legitimate, can be \nachieved only in a world that is safer, more just and \nwith more solidarity.  \n More than ever before, we must return to the \nideals that inspired the founding fathers of the League \nof Nations and the United Nations. We must place the \n \n \n57 10-54965 \n \nmoral values and the deep aspirations of our peoples at \nthe heart of our work. This is the world that we all \naspire to. This is the world that we should strive to \nbuild in this Hall."

        "file_text": "Let me \nbegin by conveying the warm congratulations of the \ndelegation of Mexico to Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \nelection as President of the General Assembly at this \nnew session. I also wish to express our appreciation to \n \n \n27 10-55276 \n \nhis predecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, for his \nwork, and our appreciation and support to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his efforts for peace and \ndevelopment. \n The recent high-level meetings have shown the \nmagnitude of the challenges that confront the \ninternational community and thus the United Nations. \nThe obstacles to achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, the economic crisis in all its \nmanifestations, the disasters associated with climate \nchange, the continuing threats to peace and security \u2014 \nin either their traditional or new forms \u2014 and the \ndifficulties in effectively addressing nuclear \ndisarmament and non-proliferation define the agenda \nof multilateral institutions and of the policies of our \nGovernments.  \n Nevertheless, the primary responsibility of this \nOrganization is the maintenance of international peace \nand security. Years of war and conflict on every \ncontinent, with enormous loss of lives and significant \neconomic and social costs, have tested the ability of the \nUnited Nations to prevent, contain and reverse armed \nconflicts.  \n That is the case in Afghanistan and Iraq, where \nafter years of conflicts and interventions there is still \nhope that those countries will be able to fully assume \ntheir own destiny without outside interference. In \nSomalia and the Sudan the prospects for peaceful \nsettlements and reconciliation still seem to be distant, \nrequiring the will of the parties and careful monitoring \nby the international community to prevent the \nescalation, the extension, of the crises and to ensure the \nprotection of the civilian population. \n In the Democratic Republic of the Congo \nimpunity prevails, and despite the presence of United \nNations forces, outrageous and unacceptable crimes are \ncommitted against civilians, particularly women and \nchildren. The reconstruction of Haiti after the terrible \nearthquake last January, which even affected United \nNations personnel, is taking place under dramatic \nconditions. \n The list of challenges is endless, and indeed there \nis the risk of a backsliding and escalation of violence \nin several critical regions of the world. \n In the Middle East, despite 60 years of conflict \nand scepticism due to past failures, there is renewed \nhope for peace, thanks to the resumption of direct talks \nbetween the Government of Israel and the Palestinian \nAuthority. The creation of a politically and economically \nviable Palestinian State, living in peace side by side with \nIsrael, within secure and internationally recognized \nborders, is an essential condition for the establishment \nof lasting peace in the Middle East. We particularly \nwelcome the efforts of the Administration of President \nBarack Obama to achieve that goal. \n Mexico expresses its strong support for the \nongoing negotiations. Nonetheless, the hope of a \ndefinitive agreement is marred by the threats and \nprovocations of extremist forces that seek to derail \ndirect negotiations. The leaders of Israel and the \nPalestinian Authority have an appointment with \nhistory. Let us hope that they are up to the challenge. \nTo that end they can count on the unstinting support of \nStates genuinely committed to the peace process. \n The existence of weapons of mass destruction \nremains a threat to humanity and increases global \ninsecurity. In 2010, significant progress has been made \nin the areas of disarmament and non-proliferation, and \nthe international community has renewed its \ncommitment to nuclear safety. The signing of the new \nstrategic arms reduction treaty between the United \nStates and Russia, the nuclear summit held in \nWashington and the outcome of the Review Conference \nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons (NPT) are achievements that must be \ncommended. We cannot ignore that the credibility and \nviability of the disarmament agenda depend on the \nuniversalization of the NPT and the entry into force of \nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The \ncreation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East \nwould constitute a parallel and decisive step in that \nregard. \n With regard to the cases of the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea and Iran, it will be \nnecessary to move forward through dialogue and \nnegotiation in order to resolve the controversies arising \nfrom their nuclear programmes. The adoption of \nsanctions is not incompatible with the recourse to \ndiplomacy, which is still ongoing. \n However, international security does not depend \nexclusively on the elimination of weapons of mass \ndestruction. It is also threatened by the existence of \nsmall arms and light weapons and their illicit \ntrafficking, which fuel conflicts, claim the lives of \nthousands of people and destabilize our societies. It is \n  \n \n10-55276 28 \n \ntime to tackle that challenge head on, implementing the \nProgramme of Action on illicit trafficking in small \narms and light weapons and progressing towards the \nadoption of an arms trade treaty. \n With regard to development, the consequences of \nthe recent international economic and financial crisis, \ncaused largely by the failure of the regulatory \nmechanisms and the excessive indebtedness of the \nworld\u2019s major economies, are still being suffered \nworldwide. \n The failures that led to this crisis must be \naddressed, and the United Nations must be able to play \na significant role in that undertaking. The crisis \ndemonstrated the need to promote international \ncooperation schemes that would allow us to act \neffectively and efficiently to meet the challenges \narising from it. In particular, it is worth highlighting \nthe positive work of the Group of 20 in this regard. \nHowever, we also believe that the United Nations \nshould play a more relevant role in the discussions on \nnecessary international economic governance reform. \nIn this sense, we share the objectives set by the \nPresident of the General Assembly. \n In this context, the prospects for achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals have been severely \nhampered by the crisis. Thus, the commitments in \nofficial development assistance made at the Monterrey \nInternational Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment and endorsed at the 2008 Doha Follow-\nup Conference have been jeopardized. These \ncommitments must be honoured. The Millennium \nDevelopment Goals can be attained in all countries if \nwe take appropriate individual and collective action, as \nindicated in resolution 65/1, adopted at the High-level \nPlenary Meeting held here at Headquarters last week. It \nis also indispensable that we progress towards the \nsuccessful conclusion of the Doha Round of trade \nnegotiations, fully respecting its linkage with the \ndevelopment agenda. \n In addition to the traditional challenges, our \nOrganization faces new challenges that test its ability \nto react and adapt. Terrorism, on the one hand, and the \nglobalization of transnational organized crime on the \nother, including drug trafficking, pose new threats to \npeace and security that destabilize entire countries and \nregions, modifying the traditional notion of \ninternational security. The fight against these \nphenomena is not the exclusive responsibility of one \nparticular country or region; these are global \nphenomena that must be addressed and resolved by the \ninternational community based on the fundamental \nprinciple of shared responsibility. We cannot ignore the \nfact that the permissive social behaviour in some \ncountries stimulates illicit activities in others. \n The Government of Mexico has assumed full \nresponsibility for meeting the challenges posed by drug \ntrafficking and activities related to organized crime, \nrestoring State authority in areas where impunity had \nprevailed. This fight requires an increased investment \nof resources and has unfortunately also led to the loss \nof lives. The cost is high, but would be even higher for \nour society if the authority of the State remained \nimpassive in the face of violence, corruption and the \naccompanying impunity. Compliance with international \ncommitments in the area of drug trafficking is \nindispensable in order to meet this challenge. \n Migration is a reality of our contemporary world \nthat cannot be ignored by our Organization. Its \nmultidimensional nature obliges us to consider its \ncauses and effects from an international perspective. \nThe migratory phenomenon should be addressed \nthrough a holistic approach that recognizes the \ncontribution of migrants to the countries of origin and \nof destination alike, among other factors. In November, \nMexico will host the fourth meeting of the Global \nForum on Migration and Development, the outcome of \nwhich will be duly reported to this Assembly. \n The Government of Mexico is committed to the \npromotion of human rights of all migrants, irrespective \nof their migratory status. We call on all Member States \nto ratify the International Convention on the Protection \nof the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of \nTheir Families. Unfortunately, the tendency to criminalize \ninternational migration has prevailed. Legislative \ninitiatives and actions singling out minorities in various \ncountries unacceptably codify racism and xenophobia, \nestablishing new barriers between communities and \nnations. This is unacceptable. \n Mexico, a country of origin, transit and \ndestination for migrants, has experienced within its \nborders the consequences of the exploitation and \nviolence perpetrated by organized criminal gangs that \nnot only smuggle people from different countries, but \nhave not hesitated to cruelly threaten their lives, as was \nthe very regrettable case in our country in August. The \ncompetent authorities, in coordination with the \n \n \n29 10-55276 \n \nGovernments of which the individuals concerned were \nnationals, are investigating this case and establishing \nthe necessary coordination mechanisms to prevent \nsimilar events in the future and to attend more \neffectively to the protection of migrants, regardless of \ntheir origin and legal status. \n Nature also poses new challenges. We cannot \nafford to remain idle in the face of the adverse effects \nof climate change. The economic and human costs of \nnot addressing this problem are enormous and \nnegatively affect the welfare and well-being of present \nand future generations. As host of the sixteenth \nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change and of the \nsixth Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, \nto be held later this year in Canc\u00fan, Mexico is making \nevery possible effort in a transparent, inclusive and \nresponsible manner to achieve concrete and operational \nresults. In Canc\u00fan, we will be able to adopt a broad and \nbalanced set of decisions for immediate \nimplementation. One single action or agreement is not \nenough to address such a complex phenomenon. The \ninternational regime on this matter should evolve \nconstantly in response to technological and socio-\neconomic developments and on the basis of common \nbut differentiated responsibility. \n The main advantage of our Organization among \nthe multilateral institutions is its universal character. \nIts Charter enshrines the commitments that States have \nmade in all these aspects. Thus, United Nations actions \nare fully legitimate, in accordance with international \nlaw. However, we cannot ignore the difficulties that the \nOrganization faces without running the risk of its \nbecoming increasingly less capable of addressing the \nenormous challenges facing the international \ncommunity. Its decisions, including those that are \nlegally binding, are difficult to implement and its \nresources fall short of meeting the many needs that \narise in the maintenance of peace and in addressing \nnatural and humanitarian disasters. The Organization\u2019s \nbudget and scale of assessments do not reflect the \nrealities of our countries. \n As a result, the comprehensive reform of the \nOrganization can be put off no longer; if it is, alternative \nforums or more selective groups will fill the vacuum \ncreated by our Organization\u2019s lack of effectiveness. Our \nOrganization requires comprehensive reform, ranging \nfrom the adaptation and representativeness of the Security \nCouncil to greater coherence in activities for sustainable \ndevelopment. In 2011, the General Assembly will \nconsider the status of the Human Rights Council, while \nthe Council itself will review its own working methods. \nWe must ensure that the outcome of both processes \nresults in the increased effectiveness of its work. \n With respect to peacekeeping, difficulties on the \nground and the need to adapt operation mandates \nrequire the Security Council and the Organization as a \nwhole to elaborate pragmatic actions and strategies that \nwill produce results in the short term. Security Council \nreform may be the most urgent. Mexico has \nparticipated in the process of intergovernmental \nnegotiations, convinced of the need for comprehensive \nreform to improve the Council\u2019s representativeness, \ntransparency, democracy and accountability. This \nprocess is relevant to all States, and Security Council \nreform can be neither determined nor addressed in \nalternative forums that have an eminently financial \npurview. This much-needed and urgent reform will not \nbe achieved by imposing the aspirations of a few on \nthe collective will. \n As an elected member of the Security Council for \nthe biennium 2009-2010, Mexico has been able to \nappreciate the constructive role that non-permanent \nmembers can play through their contributions to the \nwork of the Council and its subsidiary bodies. \nNevertheless, we are also aware of their limitations. \nThe short duration of their mandates impedes the \nconsolidation of achievements and affects the \ncontinuity of the work of the Council itself. We are \ntherefore convinced that the principle of immediate  \nre-election or of longer-term seats for non-permanent \nmembers are the best options for pragmatic and viable \nSecurity Council reform in the short term.  \n Mexico\u2019s participation in the Security Council \nhas been guided by its conviction of the importance of \nthe contribution that elected members can make to the \nmaintenance of international peace and security, in the \nunderstanding that this is a shared responsibility in \naccordance with obligations under the United Nations \nCharter and not the monopoly of a few. In this sense, \nwe have been able to encourage mediation and the \npeaceful settlement of disputes; promote disarmament \nand non-proliferation; preserve respect for \ninternational humanitarian law; ensure the protection \nof the civilian population in armed conflicts, with \nspecial emphasis on children; strengthen the rule of \nlaw; and foster activities to promote stability and \nreconstruction in States emerging from conflict. \n  \n \n10-55276 30 \n \n This year, Mexico celebrates its bicentennial as \nan independent nation and the centenary of its \nrevolution, the first of the great social revolutions of \nthe twentieth century. From our own experience, we \nare well aware of the difficulties and obstacles facing \nthe construction of any nation-State in a complex and \nchanging world. Throughout its history, our country\u2019s \ninteraction with the world at large has been fraught. \nOur country has experienced external interventions, \noccupations and even losses of its territory during \nperiods of political instability. We have been able \nnonetheless to forge a national identity and unique \nprofile in contemporary international relations. \n Today, Mexico is a constructive and open \ncountry, peaceful and fully committed to forging \nagreements for a better world. As a founding Member \nof our Organization, we have been loyal to its \npurposes, consistent with the principles of foreign \npolicy enshrined in our Constitution. Our adherence to \ninternational law and the contributions of Mexican \nforeign policy to various fields are well known. We \nhave also learned to appreciate the importance of \ninternational cooperation inasmuch as there is no \nchallenge on the United Nations agenda that can be \ntackled in isolation. The survival of humankind, given \nthe dangers of nuclear war, combating the effects of \nclimate change, overcoming social regression, and the \nrelentless fight against new threats to international \nsecurity and to our own societies require our greatest \nindividual efforts as well as coordination among States. \nMexico will therefore remain deeply committed to \nmultilateralism, of which this universal forum is the \nfirst and foremost expression."

        "file_text": "The tragic \nearthquake in Haiti, the devastating floods in Pakistan \nand the financial crisis have reminded us that the \nglobal challenges of the twenty-first century require \nconcerted action. The United Nations needs to be at the \ncentre of our activities. It is the forum of today\u2019s \nmultilateral system that enjoys the highest degree of \nlegitimacy. Inclusiveness is its key comparative \nadvantage. \n However, this moral authority must be matched \nby mechanisms and resources to ensure its \neffectiveness. Adherence to the rule of law is \nfundamental. All multilateral efforts and activities need \n \n \n23 10-55109 \n \nto operate on the basis of clear and predictable rules \nthat apply equally to all Member States. Member \nStates, as well as men and women around the globe, \nmust be able to trust in the United Nations capacity to \nturn the promises of the Charter into reality. \n Cooperation with other international actors is \nindispensable to the United Nations efforts to deal with \nthe complex challenges of today. Austria and the \nEuropean Union (EU) stand ready as reliable partners \nfor the United Nations in areas ranging from \ndevelopment cooperation and humanitarian aid to the \nmaintenance of international peace and security and to \npromoting the respect for the rule of law and human \nrights. In this context, we hope that our initiative to \nobtain modalities for the EU\u2019s participation in the \nGeneral Assembly, reflecting the changes provided for \nin the Treaty of Lisbon, will soon be adopted. This \nwould greatly help to reinforce the productive \npartnership of the United Nations with an organization \nthat is fully committed to the principles and objectives \nenshrined in the Charter. Austria is proud to contribute \nto the work of the United Nations by hosting the \nUnited Nations Office at Vienna. We will continue to \noffer Vienna as a platform for dialogue and \ncooperation. \n In our view, good governance is an inherent \nelement of global governance. The Vienna-based \nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime is central to \nthe United Nations efforts to combat corruption and \norganized crime by supporting Member States in \nimplementing international standards, including the \nUnited Nations Convention against Corruption. \nCorruption presents one of the major challenges with \ndire consequences for the international community\u2019s \nefforts to reduce poverty. The recent founding of the \nInternational Anti-Corruption Academy in Austria is an \nimportant step towards addressing this challenge. That \ninstitution aims to provide a tool for research, \neducation and training for professionals from all fields, \nincluding law enforcement officials, judges and \nprosecutors. \n The fight against climate change is one of the \ncentral issues of the twenty-first century. Climate \nchange has a far-reaching impact on the economic and \nsocial development of the entire international \ncommunity. We need global consensus now if we want \nto achieve the goal to limit global warming to 2\u00b0C and \nto reverse the trend of rising greenhouse gas emissions \nby 2020. Nobody should underestimate the difficulty of \nthis task. However, the fight against climate change is \nalso an opportunity. We have the chance to create a \nframework for sustainable, qualitative growth at the \nglobal level. Austria is committed to contributing to \nthis endeavour. \n This week, leaders agreed on concrete actions to \nget the Millennium Development Goals back on track \nin the fight against world poverty. We now need to \nmobilize all our efforts to live up to this renewed \ncommitment, particularly in addressing the special \nneeds of Africa in this regard. The Governments of \ndeveloping and developed countries, as well as the \nprivate sector and civil society, need to work together \nto achieve our ambitious goals by 2015. \n Let me now turn to one of the most urgent threats \nto peace and security. These days, our attention is \nfocused on the recently initiated direct talks between \nPrime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas. We \nwelcome the leadership and commitment of President \nObama, who made this development possible. These \ntalks offer the first concrete prospects for a sustainable \npeace in the Middle East in many years. An agreement \nbetween Israel and Palestine would not only radically \nimprove the lives of the peoples concerned, but would \nalso provide the key to a more stable region and a more \npeaceful world. We hope that both sides are aware of \ntheir enormous responsibilities. \n The process is still fragile. We believe that the \nextension of the settlement moratorium is fundamental \nto keeping the talks on track and creating an \nenvironment in which the core issues can be tackled \nsuccessfully. It is equally important that the efforts of \nthe Palestinian authorities to build up functioning \ninstitutions for a future Palestinian State move forward \ndynamically. It is ultimately up to the parties to bring \nthe peace process to a positive conclusion. However, \ninternational actors, in particular the members of the \nQuartet, have an important role to play. As a member \nof the European Union, Austria is ready to fully play \nits part. \n In order to ensure that the United Nations \ncontinues to play a central role in global governance, \nwe must continue with our efforts towards internal \nreform of the United Nations, including the reform of \nthe Security Council. Both an enlargement of the \nSecurity Council that reflects today\u2019s political, \neconomic and social realities and a reform of the \nCouncil\u2019s working methods will enhance the Council\u2019s \n  \n \n10-55109 24 \n \nlegitimacy and the acceptance of its decisions. As an \nelected member of the Security Council, we participate \nin its work with great commitment and are doing our \nbest to promote effectiveness and transparency. \n Significant efforts are under way to ensure and \nsustain United Nations peacekeeping as an essential \ntool for achieving the goals of the United Nations. \nConfronted with limited financial and human resources \nand the increasing complexity of peacekeeping \noperations, the United Nations has started a review of \nthe whole United Nations peacekeeping system with a \nview to adjusting it to the needs of the twenty-first \ncentury. It is of vital importance for the Council to \neffectively monitor and oversee the implementation of \npeacekeeping mandates, in close cooperation with \ntroop and police contributors, the Secretariat and \nUnited Nations missions. Austria fully supports the \nongoing peacekeeping reform and stands ready to play \nits part in a renewed global peacekeeping partnership. \n We also have to work on making peace \nconsolidation irreversible. The United Nations \nPeacebuilding Commission, together with integrated \npeacebuilding support offices, has a key role in \nfostering sustainable peace. If we use the \npeacebuilding architecture optimally, lasting peace can \nbe achieved with determination and the political will of \nthe country concerned, as well as the support of the \ninternational community. Since peacekeeping and \npeacebuilding must be approached in an integrated \nmanner, we strongly support the enhanced interaction \nof the Security Council with the Peacebuilding \nCommission throughout the conflict cycle, as was \naffirmed at the Security Council summit this week. \n Due to the changing nature of conflict and an \nincrease in the activities of non-State actors, the \nprotection of civilians in armed conflict constitutes a \ncore task of a large number of United Nations \npeacekeeping missions. The effective protection of \nthose affected by hostilities and violence has become a \nyardstick for the success and credibility of United \nNations missions in the field and the United Nations at \nlarge. Security Council resolution 1894 (2009), \nunanimously adopted in November last year, was a \nmajor step forward in the Council\u2019s efforts to better \nprotect civilians from physical violence, displacement \nand violations of their rights. \n However, resolution 1894 (2009) has not yet had \nits full impact on the ground. Violations of \ninternational humanitarian and human rights law and \nimpunity for such crimes continue to pose a major \nthreat to the rule of law and lasting peace in post-\nconflict situations. \n Austria acknowledges the primary responsibility \nof States to ensure the protection of civilians, including \nthe credible prosecution of those responsible for war \ncrimes, genocide, crimes against humanity or other \nserious violations of international law. We support the \nuse and promotion of mechanisms such as the \nInternational Criminal Court, commissions of inquiry \nor panels of experts. Such tools should be seen as a \nviable complement and reinforcement of steps taken at \nthe national level to ensure accountability. The \nSecurity Council has a central role in this endeavour. \nEnsuring the implementation of resolution 1894 (2009) \nwill be one of the key priorities of Austria during the \nremainder of its term on the Council. \n Austria also attaches utmost importance to \nenhancing the role of women in conflict and post-\nconflict situations. Even 10 years after the adoption of \nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women \nand peace and security, we can still witness major gaps. \nWomen continue to be largely absent from peace \nprocesses and conflict-resolution efforts, and crimes \nagainst them all too often remain unpunished. The \nlatest, shocking mass rapes in the Eastern Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo demonstrate more than ever that \nthere is urgent need for action. We cannot afford to \nignore those gaps. The occasion of the tenth \nanniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) \nwill therefore provide a crucial opportunity to work \ntowards more consistent implementation in promoting \nwomen\u2019s issues in all aspects of international peace \nefforts. Those efforts are fully supported by our \ndevelopment cooperation. \n Austria warmly welcomes the milestone decision \nof the General Assembly to establish UN Women, \nwhich will make the United Nations a stronger and \nmore effective partner in the advancement of women \nworldwide. We look forward to working with Michelle \nBachelet towards our common goals. \n Children in armed conflict deserve special \nprotection. I am very satisfied that the United Nations \nsystem has made concrete progress in combating \nserious child rights violations and in fighting the \nrecruitment and enlisting of child soldiers. \n \n \n25 10-55109 \n \n Austria reiterates the pivotal role of the United \nNations at the centre of our counter-terrorism efforts. \nRespect for human rights and the rule of law is a \nfundamental basis of the fight against terrorism. As \nChair of the Security Council Committee established \npursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) concerning Al-\nQaida and the Taliban, Austria is committed to \nenhancing due process in the Council\u2019s sanctions \nregimes. We therefore welcome the substantial \nimprovements of the listing and de-listing procedures \nand the recent appointment of Ms. Kimberly Prost as \nOmbudsperson. \n The Austrian candidature for the Human Rights \nCouncil for the period 2011-2014 is a logical \ncontinuation of our long-term work and engagement in \nensuring the respect for human rights, including in the \nSecurity Council. Dialogue and partnerships are crucial \nfor turning the promises of the Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights into a reality for all people around \nthe globe. Austria has consistently worked with all \nactors towards narrowing the gap between standards \nand their implementation at the national and \ninternational levels. \n To end on a positive note, this past year saw the \nmost positive developments towards nuclear \ndisarmament in a decade. Security Council resolution \n1887 (2009), adopted just a year ago, provided a \npowerful impetus. Although many issues are still \nunresolved and require our close attention, the Review \nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in May \nproduced an outcome that restored confidence in the \nTreaty. For the first time, a comprehensive action plan \ndealing with all three pillars of the Treaty was agreed. \nLet me stress here that Austria is honoured to have \ncontributed to that success. For the first time, a world \nwithout nuclear weapons was accepted as the goal of \nall parties, who pledged to ultimately eliminate all \ntypes of nuclear weapons. For the first time, the \ncatastrophic humanitarian consequences of the use of \nsuch weapons were recognized \u2014 an important step \ntowards the eventual legal ban of nuclear weapons by \nmeans of a nuclear weapons convention or framework \nof legal instruments. \n Although the results of the Conference are \npositive, much remains to be done. The action plan \nneeds to be implemented. The nuclear-weapon \nStates \u2014 which promised to engage among themselves \non a number of vital issues and report by 2014 \u2014 must \nlead by example. The international disarmament \nstructures must be reformed. I am grateful for \nSecretary-General Ban\u2019s initiative in this respect. \n Finally, we must learn from successful \ndisarmament initiatives. Let me underline that Austria \nis delighted that the Convention on Cluster Munitions \nentered into force last month. The Convention is a \npositive example of how committed Governments, \ninternational organizations and civil society can work \ntogether to achieve real progress. In order to promote \ninteraction in this respect in the nuclear field as well, \nAustria supports the establishment of a competence \ncentre for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation in \nVienna early next year. Conceived as a platform for \nopen discussion and independent expertise, monitoring \nand advocacy, the centre shall facilitate understanding \nand cooperation among all entities involved. I hope \nthat it will contribute to further progress in nuclear \ndisarmament and non-proliferation. \n We, the United Nations, have shared \nresponsibility to move forward jointly in order to reach \nour common goal of international peace, security and \ndevelopment for all.

At the Meeting, \nworld leaders not only reaffirmed their strong \ncommitment to the implementation of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) laid down in the \nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2), but also \nannounced specific new decisions on their practical \nimplementation.  \n The leaders who demonstrated their renewed \npolitical will availed themselves of a very important \nand timely opportunity for accelerating the \nenhancement of concerted efforts at ensuring \nsustainable progress in the implementation of the \nMDGs. Further advancement in this area depends on \nconcerted, coordinated and consistent actions by the \nentire international community, with the United \nNations playing a central and coordinating role. \n We believe that this firm commitment must be \nbuttressed in every possible way by specific practical \nmeasures that will contribute to the full and timely \nachievement of all MDGs without exception. Against \nthe backdrop of the energy and financial and economic \ncrisis of recent years and the ever-growing impact of \nclimate change, our actions should be supported with \nadequate financial resources. In this regard, the appeal \nto double official development assistance, an important \ncomponent of financing for development, remains \nurgent. Allocation of additional external funds for \ndevelopment should not aggravate the burden of debt \nof developing countries whose financial situation has \nbeen exacerbated by the world economic crisis.  \n Strengthening the global partnership is essential \nif we are to provide an environment conducive to \nsustainable economic growth and job creation. First \nand foremost, it is necessary to revitalize global trade \nand investment, which are the driving force behind \nindustrial growth. Such an approach is of vital \nimportance for landlocked countries, whose \nparticipation in global trade is hampered by their \ngeographical location and existing barriers to \nexpanding trade relations, which, in turn, affect \nindustrial growth and the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals in these countries. \n  \n \n10-54827 32 \n \nEfforts should be focused on creating new international \ntransport systems and corridors as well as promoting \nthe efficient use of existing ones, as this will help to \nend the marginalization of landlocked countries in \nglobal trade.  \n Tajikistan advocates the speedy completion of the \nDoha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which \nwill contribute to the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Our view is that the international \ntrade system must remain open, equitable, predictable, \nnon-discriminatory and based on agreed rules, \nespecially in a time of crisis.  \n Our current stage of development is characterized \nmost notably by the fact that we have attained \nmaximum quantitative growth, which must now be \nfollowed by new qualitative development. Such a \ntransformation requires an entirely new conceptual \napproach to development which takes into account the \ninterests of both the present and future generations.  \n Governed by the principles of sustainable \neconomic development, the Government of Tajikistan \nhas identified three strategic goals, namely, freeing the \ncountry from communications isolation, ensuring \nenergy security, and ensuring food security.  \n In order to achieve the Millennium Development \nGoals, my country adopted and has been implementing \nthe National Development Strategy of the Republic of \nTajikistan for the period up to 2015 and the Poverty \nReduction Strategy. As the country\u2019s major strategic \ndocument, the National Development Strategy \nidentifies priorities and the principal lines of \nGovernment policy aimed at achieving sustainable \neconomic growth, improving access of the population \nto basic social services and reducing poverty.  \n Despite enormous difficulties associated with the \nglobal financial and economic crisis and natural \ndisasters, the aforementioned strategies have in the last \nfive years contributed to progress in the achievement \nof the MDGs.  \n To accelerate progress towards the \naforementioned strategic targets, the Government of \nTajikistan intends to address sustainable \nmacroeconomic growth issues, improve the system of \ngovernment management, develop real sectors of the \neconomy, and rehabilitate and diversify industries, as \nwell as to strengthen the country\u2019s export capacity, \nimprove the investment climate, support trade renewal \nactivities, ensure social protection of the population, \ndevelop the labour market and strengthen human \nresources.  \n We need to make the transition to sustainable \ndevelopment in order to address such long-term issues \nas climate change, preservation of biodiversity and \nprevention of desertification. Finding solutions \nrequires comprehensive and concerted actions. Our \nefforts to address global climate change need to \nexamined critically, especially in light of last year\u2019s \nUnited Nations Climate Change Conference in \nCopenhagen.  \n The lessons drawn from that meeting should \nencourage us to take more resolute measures towards \nmitigation of harmful gas emissions, adaptation to \nreduce the adverse impact of climate change, and the \ntransfer of technologies that promote transition to a \nlow carbon economy. We are convinced that at the \nforthcoming meeting in Canc\u00fan the parties to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange will be able to agree upon those and other \ndimensions of a new global agreement that will \nbecome an important milestone in the post-Kyoto \nperiod.  \n It is known that climate change affects freshwater \nresources and increases the probability of floods, \nmudflows, landslides, droughts and other water-related \nnatural disasters. Furthermore, climate change \naggravates an acute scarcity of freshwater in certain \nregions of our planet. For example, in Tajikistan, which \nis the source of about 60 per cent of the water \nresources for the entire region, during the last 30 years \nover a thousand glaciers disappeared, out of a total of \n13,000. I will add that Tajikistan\u2019s share of gas \nemissions is very low. All the electricity in Tajikistan is \ngenerated by hydropower stations.  \n The depletion of groundwater in the world \nremains a serious problem. According to the available \nforecast, by 2025 more than one third of the Earth\u2019s \npopulation will experience water shortages, and by \n2050 the planet will not be able to fully meet its water \nneeds. \n Tajikistan, as the initiator of the International \nYear of Freshwater 2003 and the International Decade \nfor Action, \u201cWater for Life\u201d, 2005 to 2015, actively \npromotes the water agenda in the United Nations. We \nact not only as the initiator of discussions on water \nissues in the international arena but also as the initiator \n \n \n33 10-54827 \n \nin adapting specific measures on the sustainable use of \nthis vital resource. All these steps are aimed at an in-\ndepth study of water issues and the development of \nrelevant coordinated actions by the international \ncommunity.  \n In that context, the high-level international \nconference on the midterm comprehensive review of \nthe implementation of the International Decade for \nAction, held in Dushanbe and organized in cooperation \nwith the United Nations and in compliance with the \nGeneral Assembly resolution 64/198, has made an \nimportant contribution. The conference confirmed once \nagain that further strategies for water use, irrespective \nof the level at which they are developed, should be \nbased on the principles of sustainable management of \nfreshwater resources. The universal introduction of \nsustainable development is important for achieving \nprogress in all fields of economic growth and the \nstrengthening of human potential. Those and other \nrecommendations are highlighted in the Dushanbe \nDeclaration on Water (A/65/88, annex), the outcome \ndocument of the conference.  \n The efforts of Tajikistan in matters of water are \naimed at the sustainable and efficient use of the \ncountry\u2019s potential and at strengthening mutually \nadvantageous and equitable regional cooperation. We \nbelieve that water cooperation should strengthen rather \nthan undermine interaction in other areas. It should \nincreasingly build confidence among all water users \nand contribute to the introduction of integrated \nmanagement of water resources at the local, national \nand regional levels.  \n With that in mind, we proposed proclaiming the \nyear 2012 as the International Year of Water \nDiplomacy. We are convinced that the adoption of a \nrelevant resolution by the General Assembly will \ncontribute to overcoming competing interests in the \nmanagement of freshwater resources through such \ndiplomatic means as early warning, preventive \ndiplomacy and confidence-building measures, mutually \nadvantageous and mutually acceptable regional \ncooperation, and a dialogue on these issues. \n A worldwide move towards the development and \nuse of renewable energy, which considerably reduces \nharmful gas emissions, is an important component of \nefforts to address climate change. It is essential to \nencourage and support in every possible way projects \naimed at increasing the proportion of renewable energy \nused globally, the transfer of new and advanced \ntechnologies and enhancing the efficiency of energy \nsupply and energy conservation.  \n Tajikistan fully supports the initiative on ensuring \nuniversal access to advanced energy services and \nconsiders it a prerequisite for the successful \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \nFor this reason, Tajikistan has been developing its \nenergy potential in a consistent and planned manner on \nthe basis of the integrated development of renewable \nenergy sources. Alongside the construction of small \nand medium-scale hydropower stations, we are \nconsidering the implementation of large-scale projects \nof regional significance and exploring the possibility of \nusing solar and wind energy. \n Effective regional cooperation plays a significant \nrole in establishing a global partnership for sustainable \ndevelopment. The specific feature of our region is that \ndevelopment of comprehensive cooperation depends in \nmany respects on the success of the process of \nstrengthening peace and overall stability in \nAfghanistan. \n Counteracting terrorism is a long-term objective \nbecause of the multifaceted nature of this phenomenon, \nwhich is alien to humanity, and because of its deep \nroots. It is essential to intensify the concerted struggle \nfor uprooting terrorism by applying the entire range of \npolitical, economic, financial and humanitarian \nmeasures. We consider it important to speed up the \nagreement on and adoption of a comprehensive \nconvention on combating international terrorism. \n While combating terrorism, one should take into \naccount that terrorism cannot exist without financial \nand logistical support. It is no secret that today illegal \ndrug trafficking has become one of the major sources \nof financing for international terrorism. The urgency \nand magnitude of problems related to drugs and illicit \ndrug trafficking are clear evidence of the global \nmenace that threatens international stability and \nsecurity at large. \n Currently, Tajikistan finds itself between the \nmajor world producer of opium and heroin and the \ncountries that consume those drugs. Given that our \nborder with Afghanistan, with a very complex \nmountain terrain, is almost 1,500 kilometres long, we \nhave to act as a buffer blocking the ever-increasing \nflow of this \u201cwhite death\u201d. \n  \n \n10-54827 34 \n \n We are absolutely confident that the success in \ncombating narcotics aggression, which yields \nmultimillion-dollar profits to the countries far from \nTajikistan, can be achieved only through consolidated \nand collective efforts. We consider it necessary to get \nAfghanistan involved in the processes of multifaceted \nregional cooperation.  \nIn that regard, I would like to underline the efforts by \nthe Quadripartite Group \u2014 comprising Afghanistan, \nPakistan, Russia and Tajikistan \u2014 which is gaining in \nstrength. Within that new format of multilateral \ncooperation our efforts are aimed at counteracting the \nterrorist and narcotics threats, which are difficult to \nuproot unless the problems of poverty, unemployment \nand other urgent social issues are dealt with. All those \nefforts will help to strengthen specific global measures \nto reinforce the peace process. We hope that objectives \nand goals recently voiced at the Kabul Conference will \nbe put into practice.  \n Intellectual and creative efforts over recent \ndecades have brought about new principles and norms \nfor sustainable development, set out in Agenda 21, the \nProgramme for the Further Implementation of \nAgenda 21 and the Johannesburg Plan of \nImplementation. Those historic documents laid down a \nsound foundation for transition from existing patterns \nof production and consumption to a sustainable \npattern \u2014 the paradigm of today.  \n The whole range of long-term objectives that we \nconfront today demands a clear and sound \nreconsideration of the actions by the international \ncommunity in favour of sustainable development. We \nare convinced that the United Nations should remain \nthe centre for coordination and harmonization of the \nefforts in this area. At the same time the consolidating \nrole of the United Nations itself should be enhanced by \nstrengthening its capacity to respond to problems in an \nefficient and appropriate way and to efficiently meet \nnumerous global challenges and the threats of the new \nmillennium. Tajikistan confirms its willingness and \ncommitment to contribute to this process as far as it \ncan."

        "file_text": "Let me at \nthe outset commend you, Sir, on your unanimous \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fifth session. I pledge my delegation\u2019s support for \nyour efforts to successfully move forward the agenda \nof this session. I also wish to commend your \npredecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session, for his \nstewardship, and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \nhis leadership of the Secretariat. \n Your choice of theme for our general debate \u2014\n\u201dReaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \nglobal governance\u201d \u2014 is both appropriate and timely. \nAfter 65 years of operations, there is sufficient history \nto provide material for objective review and enough \nfuture to justify such a rigorous assessment. \n  \n \n10-55128 8 \n \n In my own view, arising from the many successes \nof the United Nations in a wide range of areas, one of \nthe most enduring lessons the past 65 years have taught \nus as a global community is the wisdom and supremacy \nof multilateralism. Even where multilateralism has \nfailed to secure lasting solutions to some of the world\u2019s \nproblems, it has laid unshakable foundations on which \nbilateral understanding can be built. \n The resolution of the conflict in the Middle East, \nfor example, has long eluded the international \ncommunity. This is why we are hopeful with regard to \nthe latest efforts at peaceful negotiations between \nIsrael and Palestine being brokered by the current \nUnited States Administration. If there is to be lasting \npeace in the Middle East, there must be two States, \nIsrael and Palestine, living side by side in peace and \nsecurity. There must be direct negotiations with both \nparties, Israel and Palestine, at the same table. Israel \nmust heed the international community\u2019s unanimous \ncall to extend the moratorium on disputed settlements, \nwhich would contribute positively to the negotiations. \nAnd all the countries of that region must commit to and \nwork towards a lasting and durable Middle East peace. \n Today, global governance relates not only to \nconcerns about peace, security and political self-\ndetermination. Importantly, global governance \nembraces such imperatives as the elimination of \nhunger, disease and ignorance; administering a stable \nand robust international financial system; and ensuring \nfair trade, adequate shelter and the preservation of our \nvery delicate environment. \n Never in the history of human existence has our \nplanet been faced with a greater urgency to meet these \nobjectives. The scale of poverty, conflicts, global \nwarming, the economic and financial crisis, migration, \npandemics, terrorism and international crime demands \na collective global effort employing common and \ncoordinated strategies. The extent of these problems \nand the enormity of their consequences are clearly \nbeyond the resource and management capabilities of \nany one nation. \n I believe that our United Nations, with its near \nuniversal membership, is the only global body that has \nthe legitimacy and operational structures to undertake \nthe task of forging the necessary political and \neconomic consensus to effectively tackle these \nproblems. \n A mere three years ago, we heads of Government \ndescribed climate change as the defining challenge of \nour era. Three years on it remains so, especially for \nthose countries that are particularly vulnerable. And yet \nwe hear from some who have a responsibility to act \nthat they will only do so when others have taken \naction. While everybody waits for somebody else to \nact, the peoples of the world are made to suffer. \n If ever a challenge requires an urgent global \nsolution, this one does. Small island developing States \nsuch as Antigua and Barbuda face a unique set of \nvulnerabilities related to our small size: relative \nisolation, narrow resource base and high exposure to \nglobal environmental threats. To compound this, over \nthe last five years we have suffered disproportionately \nfrom the financial, food and energy crises. Our \neconomies have been battered and many of our \nproductive sectors wiped out. \n But the hardship that has ensued for our people \nfrom all this, will pale into insignificance, if the \ninternational community does not quickly address the \nlooming threat of climate change, which is already \nhaving a devastating impact all over the world. We, the \nsmall island developing States, have already experienced \nloss of agricultural land and infrastructure \u2014 so too have \nmany countries in Africa. \n Our fishing and tourism industries are being \nimpacted negatively. There has been considerable loss \nof our biodiversity, saltwater intrusion and devastation \nof terrestrial and wetland habitats and the destruction \nof human settlements. Even the once-distant threat of \nrising sea-level is now a reality, forcing some of our \npeople to emigrate and rebuild their lives elsewhere. \n The most notable action, so far, has been repeated \npromises of abundant financing to address the most \nurgent problems. Sadly, most of these remain just that: \npromises. There are too many commitments to \nundertake aggressive greenhouse gas emissions \nreductions with the caveat of \u201conly if others do so as \nwell\u201d. This approach has created a dangerous stalemate \nthat can only be to the further detriment of small island \ndeveloping States, such as my own. \n Not willing to allow this dangerous situation to \ncontinue forever, my own country of Antigua and \nBarbuda has pledged to reduce its already miniscule \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 25 per cent below 1990 \nlevels by 2020. \n \n \n9 10-55128 \n \n This is within the range specified by the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which \nhas recommended that overall reductions should be \nwithin the range of 25 per cent to 40 per cent below \n1990 levels by 2020. We have also declared that we \nwill work towards making Antigua and Barbuda a \ngreen economy by 2020. \n However, much remains to be done, and we are \npainfully aware that we cannot do it alone. I therefore \ncall on all countries, both developed and developing, to \njoin us in this endeavour by announcing real, \nmeaningful emission reductions targets, so that we can \nmove this seemingly endless debate forward and reach \na comprehensive, binding agreement in the very near \nfuture. \n The year 2010 has not been without its share of \ncatastrophes. The year began with a devastating \nearthquake in Haiti \u2014 one of the worst disasters in \nhistory. The death toll has been put at some 220,000 \nout of a population of around 9 million. The earthquake \nhas been estimated to cost $8 to $14 billion, according \nto the Inter-American Development Bank. Against this \nbackdrop, many countries pledged assistance \u2014 up to \n$1.5 billion. Sadly, only 10 per cent of the amount \npledged has been received by Haiti. In the midst of \nthese unfulfilled commitments, the humanitarian needs \nof our sister island remain dire. \n Since charity begins at home, we, the member \nStates of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), of \nwhich Haiti is a member, have been contributing within \nour very limited capacity our fair share of assistance to \nHaiti, including direct budgetary support. I call on \nthose nations that pledged assistance to Haiti, to \nhonour their commitments. Those pledges are needed \nurgently, now that the rebuilding phase is getting under \nway in that devastated country. \n In Chile, a huge earthquake moved the city of \nConcepci\u00f3n at least 10 feet, or 3 metres, to the west. \nBetween 500 and 700 persons were killed. Total \nrecovery costs could exceed $15 billion. In the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, a series of snowstorms and \nfreezing weather have affected the western region of \nthe country since December 2009. The storms have \naffected millions and resulted in 30 deaths. This year \nalone, severe flooding and a major earthquake killed \nhundreds of people and rendered thousands more \nhomeless. \n In Pakistan, devastating floods have resulted in \nover 1,600 deaths and more than 6 million people have \nbeen affected. That country has sought international \nassistance to cope with the catastrophe. Despite mass \nevacuations, there are fears that the death toll will rise \nas flooding reaches the southern parts of the country \nand the risk of an outbreak of waterborne diseases \nincreases in many areas. These disasters and their \naftermaths serve to reaffirm the need to ensure that \naddressing the humanitarian consequences of today\u2019s \ndisasters and emergencies remains a United Nations \npriority. And those countries in a position to do so \nshould pledge their support to assist Pakistan and to \nhonour their pledges. \n Antigua and Barbuda continues to commiserate \nwith the Governments and people of these and other \nnations, who have been affected by natural and other \ndisasters. \n In my region of Latin America and the Caribbean, \nour Governments are taking bold steps to overcome \nsome of our inherent economic and social \nvulnerabilities by forging economic partnerships \ndesigned to help lift our people out of poverty. The \nSingle Market and Economy being developed at the \nlevel of the 15-member Caribbean Community is one \nsuch valiant initiative. \n At the subregional level of the Organization of \nEastern Caribbean States (OECS), economic \nintegration is proceeding at an even more rapid pace \nwith our commitment to creating an economic union by \nnext year. \n Both the CARICOM Single Market and \nEconomy, as well as the OECS Economic Union, are \nenormous undertakings by small island nations with \nvery limited resources. We therefore invite the support \nof our development partners to assist us with the \ntechnical and financial resources necessary to move \nthese economic initiatives forward. The leaders of our \nregion see the building of strong economic alliances as \nbeing vital to the creation of wealth and prosperity for \nour people. \n We are convinced that the capacity of our \nnational Governments to deliver critical social services \nfor our populations can be improved through greater \neconomic and technical cooperation at the regional \nlevel. It is for that reason, and with the interest of our \npeople in mind, that the countries of Latin America and \nthe Caribbean agreed at our meeting in Mexico earlier \n  \n \n10-55128 10 \n \nthis year to create the Community of Latin American \nand Caribbean States, which will unite members of the \nRio Group and the Caribbean Community. This \nCommunity of nations will coexist with the \nOrganization of American States, in which we \nparticipate along with our North American partners. \n The economic challenges facing all the people of \nour hemisphere are too many and their implications too \ngreat for us to contemplate the creation of any \neconomic community of Latin America and the \nCaribbean that excludes any one country of our region. \nIt is in that spirit that Cuba remains, and will always \nremain, a vibrant participant in any broad economic \narrangement for Latin America and the Caribbean. \n We may not all share similar political views and \npolitical systems. However, the right of all the people \nof Latin America and the Caribbean to an equal chance \nat survival, economic development and social \nadvancement is absolute and non-negotiable. For that \nreason, the Governments and the people of Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean continue to regard as \nunjust, counterproductive and reprehensible the \nmaintenance of the ongoing economic embargo against \nCuba. As a political strategy or economic manoeuvre, \nthat act of economic strangulation is unjustifiable. We \ncondemn the embargo in the strongest possible terms, \nas its continued enforcement by the United States \nseverely hampers the development of Cuba and its \npeople. \n Antigua and Barbuda therefore reiterates its call \nfor the United States to immediately end its economic \nembargo against the Cuban people. \n More than 20 years after the fall of the Berlin \nWall, democracy has emerged as the preferred form of \ngovernment all over the world. And people everywhere \nhave strongly opposed attempts to seize Governments \u2014 \nany Government \u2014 through undemocratic means. Such \nattempts, whenever and wherever they occur, must be \ncondemned in the strongest possible terms. We \ntherefore condemn the undemocratic moves such as the \nrecent coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Honduras and call for the \nunconditional return of former President Zelaya \nwithout harm to his physical person. That is a sine qua \nnon for the full normalization of relations between \nHonduras and most of the countries of the region. \n As I said in my statement during the review of \nthe Millennium Development Goals (see ), a \nrenewed emphasis on trade is a critical pillar on which \ndeveloping countries are seeking to rescue their \nbattered economies and lift their people out of poverty. \nIn that respect, it is essential that all participants in the \nglobal trading system, including our partners in the \ndeveloped countries, adhere to their international \nobligations. If that is not done, the people of our small \ndeveloping countries, despite the encouragement of \ntheir leaders, will have no faith in the international \nsystem. They will have no reason to believe that the \nmultilateral system is just and that it works for them in \nthe same way it does for large, powerful, developed \nnations. \n The non-resolution of the ongoing gaming matter \nwithin the World Trade Organization (WTO), despite \nrepeated rulings in favour of Antigua and Barbuda by \nthe Dispute Settlement Body of WTO, is a case in \npoint. Let us not forget that, like the United Nations, \nWTO and other bodies such as the Bretton Woods \ninstitutions are essential elements of the multilateral \nsystem and vital pillars of the accepted architecture of \nglobal governance. In the spirit of preserving that vital \narchitecture of global governance, Antigua and \nBarbuda reiterates its call for our friend and partner, \nthe United States, to work with us to quickly resolve \nthe situation and reach a settlement that is fair and just \nto both parties. \n Trade is a critical engine of economic growth. If \nfor no other reason but that, we must complete the \nDoha Round of trade negotiations so as to ensure a \nbalanced outcome. Now more than ever, after some 10 \nyears in the making, Doha must lead to economic \nexpansion, development in the poorest countries, and \nan end to distorting subsidies and protectionist barriers. \n A number of the countries classified as middle- \nand upper-middle-income countries are in dire need of \nsubstantial amounts of debt relief in order to create \nfiscal space for spending targeted towards their \ndevelopment. Many of those countries now have debt-\nservicing obligations that are comparable in size to \ntheir gross national product or, in some cases, dwarf \nthe value of their total output. For them \u2014 my own \ncountry included \u2014 the need for urgent debt relief is a \ntop priority. \n For many of those countries the debt distress has \nbeen caused by global crises not of their making. The \nglobal financial and economic tsunami, the likes of \nwhich has not been seen since 1929, has impacted \nnegatively on every sphere of life for about 90 per cent \n \n \n11 10-55128 \n \nof humankind. In some instances, entire national \neconomies collapsed and commercial and private \nsectors have been decimated. For some, the downward \nspiral has no end in sight. Many countries are \nstruggling to maintain a minimal level of normalcy. For \nothers, attempting to stave off financial collapse, the \nsocial upheaval and chaos are unravelling the very \nfabric of modern societies and jeopardizing sanity, \nsovereignty, independence, and the dignity and pride of \ntheir people. \n The effects of the global financial and economic \ncrisis on the larger territories of the Caribbean \nCommunity are evident in their economic, fiscal and \nsocial statistical data. For the smaller territories of the \nEastern Caribbean, the situation is even more \ndevastating. Permit me to relate the facts pertaining to \nmy own country, Antigua and Barbuda. \n In addition to the direct and indirect impact that \nthe global economic contagion has had on our \neconomy, we have had to endure the collapse of two of \nthe leading insurance companies, which not only held \nnormal policies but also annuities and life savings for \nindividuals, as well as large cash investments for \nnational statutory corporations totalling approximately \n$150 million. At the same time, the leading private-\nsector employer and second largest employer in the \nnation after the Government has collapsed. \n All that was added to a financial sector that has \nbeen suffering from a sustained campaign by the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment (OECD) to reduce competition in \ntaxation, an area into which we had diversified our \neconomy, which was previously dependent almost \nentirely on tourism. That action by OECD resulted in \nthe loss of hundreds of the most lucrative jobs and an \nestimated loss of hundreds of millions in direct revenue \nto our economy. \n We note the recent removal of Antigua and \nBarbuda from the so-called Grey List. Our current \nlisting among the countries that have substantially \nimplemented internationally agreed taxation standards \nis a belated recognition of the steps taken by the \ncurrent Government of Antigua and Barbuda, over \nseveral years, to be in full compliance with all \ninternational standards in this respect. \n In the light of those realities of substantial \nrevenue decline and severe economic dislocation, \nAntigua and Barbuda recently engaged the Paris Club \nin discussions on our country\u2019s $133 million \noutstanding debt to that group of creditors. Our \nengagement with the Paris Club was assisted by a \nstand-by arrangement previously approved by the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF). We have reached \nan agreement by which some 90 per cent of that debt \nwill be restructured. Our next step will be to enter \nbilateral negotiations with Paris Club member \ncreditors. \n With the economic challenges I have outlined, \nour efforts to meet human development needs are \nseverely strained and challenged in unprecedented \nways. That makes our attainment of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, though possible, extremely \ndifficult without a more realistic and flexible direct \ncommitment from our development partners. I \ntherefore call on the Group of Seven, the Group of 20, \nIMF and the World Bank, in their bilateral and \nmultilateral commitments to the Caribbean, to give a \nmore compassionate and favourable response to the \nNew Arrangement to Borrow, with specific focus on \nthe Group of 20 agreement of 2 April 2010. That \nagreement was to triple the fund\u2019s lending capacity to \n$750 billion. This approach has already been taken \nwith some other regions and nations. The institutions \nare being called on, too, to accord to our region \nconsideration of broader and more comprehensive debt \ncancellation to spur economic revival and, in some \ncases, survival. \n The General Assembly meets once again as the \nchief deliberative, policymaking and representative \norgan of the United Nations. We meet in this unique \nforum, which bestows equality on each of its 192 \nMembers, in order to engage in multilateral discussions \nto advance the interests of all peoples of the world. But \nreaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \nglobal governance cannot be done without due regard \nto the myriad challenges facing all its Members. \n For us to achieve that reaffirmation \u2014 which most, \nif not all, of us believe is a very notable objective \u2014 I \nbelieve we must act now. I therefore call on the \nAssembly to develop at this session the modalities that \nwill enable our nations to be able to resolve conflicts \nand promote peace and stability, foster a more \nprosperous world through balanced growth and \nprosperity among developed and developing countries, \nencourage all Member States to pursue a cleaner, \ngreener, more sustainable world for our children, and \ncreate a safer world, free of nuclear weapons. \n  \n \n10-55128 12 \n \n The 65-year history of this noble institution \nestablishes beyond a doubt that we can. And the future \nof our generation and generations of our peoples to \ncome behoves us to embark on that mission with \nurgency and immediacy. "

        "file_text": "It is indeed an \nhonour for me to congratulate you, Sir, on behalf of the \nGovernment and people of Solomon Islands, as \nPresident of the General Assembly at our sixty-fifth \nsession. Your term in office coincides with economic \nturmoil, the impacts of climate change, growing social \nand security concerns and threats of unilateralism that \nare challenging multilateralism from all fronts. My \ndelegation is pleased with the manner in which you \nhave convened and concluded three high-level \nmeetings, on the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs), biodiversity and the Mauritius Strategy. That \nis a clear indication of why we are confident in you and \nof your vast experience as you oversee this principal \nbody of the United Nations for the next 12 months. \n My delegation takes this opportunity to \nacknowledge as well the leadership and contributions \nof your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki. His support for multilateralism has \nplaced us on firm footing in preparing for this session. \n We see around us the growth of democracy, \ncorporate power and the emergence of new powers, all \noffering new perspectives and opportunities. New \ninternational cooperation is linking development, \nfinance, raw materials and markets. That development \ncalls for increased collaboration and a new framework \nto facilitate the emergence of a new economic order. \nSolomon Islands, under its new foreign policy, will \nestablish relationships with all six regions of the \nUnited Nations. \n Solomon Islands believes in multilateralism and \nacknowledges the importance and value of having a \ncloser working relationship between the United \nNations and Member States. My Government stands \nready and committed to work with the United Nations \nin enhancing its presence in my capital. In that \nconnection, we renew our call to upgrade the United \nNations Sub-office in Honiara and appoint a resident \nrepresentative as its head. \n My delegation acknowledges United Nations \noutreach to Solomon Islands this year by convening the \n \n \n33 10-55128 \n \nUnited Nations national competitive recruitment exam \nin December. We welcome that engagement, as it \nprovides an opportunity for successful citizens to fill \nour national quota of international civil servants \nserving our family of nations. \n Democracy is one of the core principles of the \nUnited Nations Charter. People continue to be the \nsource of the legitimacy of this Organization and \nremain the basis of authority of this Assembly. \n Solomon Islands registers its appreciation of the \nSecretariat\u2019s Department of Political Affairs and the \nUnited Nations Development Programme for their role \nin coordinating some 400 local and international \nobservers who monitored last month\u2019s general election. \nWe are equally pleased to note the positive \npronouncement by the various local and international \nmonitors that Solomon Islands\u2019 national election was \nconducted in a free and fair manner. A number of \nelectoral reform recommendations were made, and my \nGovernment will act on them with a view to improving \nour national electoral system. \n The essence of progress and prosperity lies in \nhaving a clear and firm leadership, an obedient \nbureaucracy and a sense of vision. My Government is \ncommitted to providing those, and we will work \ntirelessly to offer our people a life of normality, dignity \nand freedom. \n The challenge of nation-building is huge and \ncostly for any developing country. For that reason, \neach country has to define for itself the type and form \nof democracy it wants to adopt, for democracy cannot \nbe imposed. In that connection, Solomon Islands \ncontinues to advocate genuine dialogue and \nengagement with Fiji over confrontations and sanctions \nand to support Fiji\u2019s effort to determine its destiny. \n Solomon Islands joins the international \ncommunity in calling for the lifting of the 49-year-old \neconomic embargo against Cuba. Such an embargo \nbelongs to a different time and era. It is our hope that \nthe power of reaching out to our neighbours will break \ndown artificial ideological barriers. \n Solomon Islands will be undergoing the universal \nperiodic review during this session. My delegation \ntakes this opportunity to reaffirm the commitment of \nSolomon Islands to the principles and purposes of the \nUnited Nations Charter, including respect for human \nrights and fundamental freedoms for all. Solomon \nIslands finds it regrettable to see those principles \nsacrificed by some who continue to divide this \nAssembly. Solomon Islands recognizes the Geneva-\nbased Human Rights Council and its role and \nimpartiality as the appropriate institution to deal with \nissues of human rights. \n This year marks the seventh anniversary of my \ncountry\u2019s relationship with the Regional Assistance \nMission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). The current \npartnership framework promotes greater coherence and \npredictability in enhancing the quality of the \ncooperation to meet the country\u2019s development needs. \nThe relations between Solomon Islands and RAMSI \nhave brought political and financial stability. However, \nthe underlying causes of conflict remain unaddressed. \nIssues of tolerance and respect for our diverse cultures \nhave placed much stress on our road to peace. My \nGovernment remains committed to addressing those \nissues. \n In June this year, the Foreign Minister of the \nUnited Arab Emirates, His Highness Sheikh Abdullah \nBin Zayed Al Nahyan, brought together Pacific small \nisland developing States and our Middle East brothers \nto discuss cooperation, including the Arab Peace \nInitiative in the Middle East. Solomon Islands supports \nall peace initiatives, including proposals to normalize \nrelations between the entire Arab region and Israel. The \ncomplexity of the Middle East conflict needs a regional \nsolution, and we strongly feel that parties to the \nconflict will need to sow conditions for peace as we \nwork to have a two-State solution. We are heartened to \nsee negotiations proceeding. However, we would like \nto see all stakeholders involved in the process. \n My delegation welcomes the outcome of this \nsummer\u2019s Non-Proliferation Treaty Review \nConference. The existence of nuclear weapons \ncontinues to pose a significant threat to humanity. \nHistory has shown the deep horror and devastation of \nnuclear weapons. Solomon Islands supports the total \nelimination of all nuclear weapons as the only absolute \nguarantee for a safe and secure world. \n The urgency of agreeing to a legally binding \nagreement on climate change in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, \ncannot be overemphasized. It is a common concern that \nbinds the world together. Our planet is already \nabsorbing more heat and getting warmer. The global \ntemperature has risen by 0.7\u00b0C in the past century. \nUnder current trends, science tells us that the \n  \n \n10-55128 34 \n \ntemperature will further increase by 4 to 7\u00b0C by the \nend of this century, threatening the survival of many \nStates, including Solomon Islands. It is critical that we \nhave a clear plan for stabilizing greenhouse gas \nemissions. Solomon Islands supports the call of the \nsmall island developing States to restrict the \ntemperature rise to below 1.5\u00b0C and to bring down \ngreenhouse gas concentration to well below 350 parts \nper million. \n Noting that there is limited atmospheric carbon \nspace left, a carbon-budget approach is an option for a \njust and fair way to prevent the global temperature \nfrom reaching irreversible levels. It takes into \nconsideration the development needs and space \nconcerns of developing countries and our shared \nresponsibilities and rights in meeting the demands of \nthe health of our atmosphere. \n On the issue of United Nations system-wide \ncoherence, the General Assembly in July established a \nnew gender entity, UN Women. That body will further \nstrengthen United Nations capacity and effectiveness in \nadvancing the status of women worldwide. Solomon \nIslands looks forward to cooperating with the new \nentity. \n As regards Security Council reform, my \ndelegation is pleased to see informal intergovernmental \nnegotiations carried forward into this session. \nNegotiations are now focused on a common text, which \nwe hope will be further streamlined in achieving our \ngoal of making that principal United Nations organ \nmore representative, efficient and responsive to the \nemerging global threats of this century. \n The Pacific Ocean covers a third of the world\u2019s \nsurface and accounts for a quarter of the world\u2019s tuna \nindustry. In May this year, eight Pacific small island \ndeveloping States, including Solomon Islands, set up \nthe secretariat of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement \n(PNA) in the Marshall Islands. The PNA countries \nagreed to coordinate the management and conservation \nof their tuna resources, so as to guarantee sustainability \nand greater economic benefits from their resources. \nThe closing off of the high seas pockets within the \nrespective countries\u2019 exclusive economic zones is to \nprevent illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and \nto provide a safe haven for fish to breed. \n On the issue of the establishment of a regional \nmarine scientific centre, in accordance with the United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, my \ndelegation is pleased to note that the matter is reflected \nin the Secretary-General\u2019s report. The Pacific \nsubregion values such a centre, which my Government \noffers to host. We will pursue this regionally and \ninternationally, in the spirit of the Convention and the \nMauritius Strategy Initiative. \n This year Papua New Guinea, the Federated \nStates of Micronesia and Solomon Islands made a \npresentation on our joint submission to the \nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. We \nhope to do the same with our remaining submissions at \nan appropriate time. \n Solomon Islands is encouraged by the further \ngrowth of positive developments and engagements \nwith regard to the Taiwan Strait. That must be \ninternationally recognized, commended and supported. \nThe moderate and pragmatic path adopted by both the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and Taiwan about the \nTaiwan Strait contributes to international peace and \nsecurity. \n Solomon Islands continues to support Taiwan\u2019s \nmeaningful participation within the United Nations \nsystem. My delegation is heartened to note Taiwan\u2019s \nparticipation as an observer at the World Health \nAssembly in both 2009 and 2010. That is a gesture of \nthe improved cross-Strait relations. Taiwan has \nregistered its interest in participating in two United \nNations treaty organizations this year: the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \n(UNFCCC) and the International Civil Aviation \nOrganization. My country supports such participation. \nThe two organizations deal with two global issues that \nare of common concern to all the world. Climate \nchange and aviation issues need the participation of all \ncountries for aviation safety and the health of our \natmosphere. My delegation finds it regrettable that the \nUNFCCC secretariat has adopted a narrow position on \na matter that requires the parties to the Convention and \nto the Kyoto Protocol to decide on. \n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are \ninternationally agreed development benchmarks. The \nSolomon Islands scorecard remains mixed, uneven and \ngenerally off track in terms of meeting our 2015 Goals. \nThe international programme for the Solomon Islands \nfor achieving the MDGs is defined in the Mauritius \nStrategy and the Brussels Programme of Action. Both \nframeworks outline the Solomon Islands\u2019 special \n \n \n35 10-55128 \n \nsituation, one that requires special international \nattention. \n The review of the Mauritius Strategy held last \nweek revealed that international commitments to the \nBarbados Programme of Action remain wanting and \ndisappointing. The vulnerability of small island \ndeveloping States (SIDS) has worsened. To address this \npartnership gap, Solomon Islands calls for a special \ncategory for SIDS within the United Nations system. \nThere is also a need for a firmer link between the SIDS \nProgramme and the United Nations Development \nAssistance Framework, to ensure that support is \nreceived from within our Organization. \n This session will also see the convening of the \nFourth United Nations Conference on the Least \nDeveloped Countries, in May 2011. We are equally \npleased that the General Assembly launched a process \nof national, regional and global reviews during the last \nsession. We look forward to working with all in \nachieving a comprehensive, action-oriented and \nmeaningful outcome to the Conference. My delegation wishes to acknowledge our new \npartners Luxembourg and Portugal, for their support, \nrespectively, for the Melanesian Spearhead Group and \nSolomon Islands external students. We remain grateful \nto all partners from the South and North, including \nCuba, Italy, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan and our \ntraditional partners the European Union, Australia, \nNew Zealand, Japan and my regional neighbours. \n In conclusion, I would like to assure the President \nof the support and cooperation of the Solomon Islands \nduring his term in office."

        "file_text": "\nI would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on \nyour election. I also thank Mr. Treki, the outgoing \nPresident, for his strong leadership in support of \nUnited Nations reform. \n I would also like to express our great sympathy to \nthe Government and people of Pakistan and to our \nfellow United Nations Members whose people have \nsuffered the terrible effects of natural disasters over the \npast year. I also thank the Secretary-General and his \nstaff for coordinating international relief efforts. \n We have had a long week of formal meetings and \nsideline discussions, and there is still much more to be \ndone before we all go home. So, at this time, I would \nlike to be brief and offer a statement of support for \nwhat our people regard as the most important aspect of \nthe work of the United Nations. By this I mean the \nwork of our United Nations agencies, their experts, \n  \n \n10-55128 48 \n \ntheir advisers and above all their volunteers in the \nfield. \n I think the theme for this year\u2019s debate underlines \nthe importance of their work. It asks us to recognize \nthe central role of the United Nations in global \ngovernance and I have no difficulty in doing this. \nAchieving security, progress and development is, of \ncourse, our own individual responsibility. But as last \nweek\u2019s high-level discussions on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals made extremely clear, many of the \nchallenges we face reach beyond single nations and \neven single regions. They are international in the full \nsense of the word. \n So we need help, experience and expertise and \nfor me, this is what the United Nations agencies offer. \nAs we all know, their support continues all year, every \nyear. In my own country it is taking place right now as \nwe speak, through the United Nations Development \nProgramme, the United Nations Environment \nProgramme, UNESCO, UNICEF and the World Health \nOrganization and we are most grateful for their help. \nThey work in vital areas of national development, \neducation, health, agriculture, communications and \ninfrastructure. They meet with people directly, they \nlisten, they discuss, and they teach, train and \nencourage. They work closely with our local \nauthorities and sometimes they do even more than that. \n I think that we learned this during last year\u2019s \ninfluenza A (H1N1) health crisis. As the Assembly can \nimagine, for a small nation like ours this was very \nserious indeed. It could have almost closed us down \nand could have certainly caused widespread panic. But \nit did not. I think this was very largely due to one fact: \nour people knew that they were not alone. They had the \nguidelines given to us by the World Health \nOrganization and this gave them the confidence they \nneeded during that extremely worrying time; we could \nnot have made it without them. \n Returning to our theme this year: it invites us to \nreaffirm and, as I have said, I am happy to do this and I \ndo it without reservation. I reaffirm our respect and \ndeep appreciation for the work of all United Nations \nagencies. We are delighted to be working with them \nand we warmly congratulate the Secretary-General on \ntheir work. \n In the words of our theme, the United Nations \ndoes indeed play a central role. In my view, without its \nagencies the concept of global governance can only be, \nat best, an idea and, most of the time, only words. It is \nthe agencies that help us turn ideas into real substance \nand to change words into actions that our people \nunderstand, respect and welcome. \n In fact, I would like to end by saying that they are \nmuch more than agencies. For countries such as ours, \nthey can help us to become far more than small \ndeveloping nations. I think this can be summed up \nsimply: they make us part of a United Nations that is \ntruly united."

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to \ncongratulate Mr. Deiss on his election as the President \nof the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I am \nconfident that under his very able and astute \nleadership, the sixty-fifth session will be able to \ncomplete its proceedings successfully. Let me assure \nhim of Malaysia\u2019s full support for his presidency. \n Let me reaffirm Malaysia\u2019s unwavering and \ncontinuing support for the United Nations and the \nmultilateral principles, based on international law, that \nit embodies. Let me also reiterate Malaysia\u2019s \ncommitment to doing our part in our collective \nendeavour. We do so in the strong belief that all \nnations, no matter how large or small, rich or poor, \nstrong or weak, have a common responsibility towards \ncreating a better world for tomorrow. \n It is my firm belief that in order to create a better \nworld for our future generations, we need to take into \naccount today\u2019s realities and learn from the lessons of \nyesterday. \n Among the most important challenges \nconfronting the international community today that \nneed to be addressed collectively is that of ensuring a \njust, equitable and durable peace \u2014 peace not just \nduring our time, but peace for all times. It is imperative \nthat we achieve peace based on a covenant of the \nwilling, and not one enforced by way of hegemony \nthrough fear and coercion. Such peace can be achieved \nonly if we are willing to constructively engage with \neach other through dialogue. Such discussions would \nhelp in creating a deeper understanding as well as \nappreciation of and respect for each other in our \ndetermination to create a better future for all citizens of \nthe world. \n As a trade organization, the World Trade \nOrganization remains relevant in today\u2019s economic \nclimate. Malaysia believes that the Doha Round must \nreturn to its original objective of ensuring free, fair and \nequitable trade. Let us join efforts and focus on moving \nthe process forward and building on the progress and \nachievements to date. It is urgent that we conclude this \nmatter as soon as possible. \n Since the adoption of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals a decade ago, which galvanized \nthe world into collective action, there has been a lack \nof efforts on joint endeavours towards the betterment \nof humanity. The missed opportunity at last year\u2019s \nclimate change meeting in Copenhagen is a wake-up \ncall for all of us. We need to bridge the gaps in \nresolving and addressing the issue of climate change, \nwhich affects the lives and livelihoods of the peoples \nof the world and our future generations. \n On 7 June 2010, the Malaysian Parliament \nunanimously passed a resolution condemning the brutal \nIsraeli attack on the humanitarian convoy in \ninternational waters. That resolution was based on \nhumanitarian grounds and demanded that the \nPalestinians be given their basic rights, and that was \nwhy the members of the Parliament, regardless of their \n  \n \n10-55122 20 \n \npolitical alignment, stood together in full support of it. \nWe reaffirm today our solidarity and sympathy with the \npeople of Turkey and the families of the victims for \ntheir tragic loss. \n Malaysia understood the necessity of letting the \nmultilateral system work. We were happy to see the \nestablishment of the United Nations panel of inquiry \nand the international fact-finding mission of the \nHuman Rights Council. We are pleased with the \nfindings of the fact-finding mission, whose report \n(A/HRC/15/21) has found that the conduct of the \nIsraeli military and other personnel towards the flotilla \npassengers was not only disproportionate but also \ndemonstrated levels of totally unnecessary and \nincredible violence. That inhuman attack constituted a \ngrave violation of human rights law and international \nhumanitarian law. The Malaysian Parliament feels \nvindicated by those findings. \n We are now waiting for the panel of inquiry to \ncomplete its work. We want to see the perpetrators of \nthe attacks brought to justice and adequate \ncompensation provided to the innocent victims of the \nattacks. We want the United Nations to act justly and \ndecisively, without fear or favour, in a manner that \nwould ensure that transgressions of blatant \ninternational laws are dealt with and that justice is \ndone and seen to be done. \n On the Middle East peace process, Malaysia is \nencouraged by the recent developments, especially the \nactive role by the Obama Administration and the \nQuartet in seeking a comprehensive and lasting \nsolution, a solution not only to the problem between \nPalestine and Israel, but also in the wider region. We \nwelcome the recent initiative by the United States to \nhost direct peace talks between Palestine and Israel. \nWe also call on all parties to support, and not to be \ndistracted from, these efforts to achieve the aspiration \nof creating two sovereign States, living side by side in \npeace, within secure and recognized borders. For this \nto happen, the following prerequisites should be \naddressed. \n First, Israel must heed the high expectations of \nthe international community to end this long-standing \nconflict. We call on the United States and other \nmembers of the Quartet to persuade Israel to end the \nconstruction of new settlements in the West Bank and \nJerusalem. \n Secondly, reconciliation efforts must bear fruit. \nThe achievement of political unity among the \nPalestinians is vital in moving the peace process \nforward and in the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip. \n Thirdly, both parties must eschew violence and \nensure the protection of civilians and respect for \ninternational humanitarian and human rights law. \n While harnessing our efforts to promote \ninternational peace and harmony, we are concerned \nabout the growing trend in some parts of the world to \nperpetuate or even fuel Islamophobia. Attempts to \ndemonize Islam offend the one and a half billion \nadherents of the religion. It widens the divide between \nthe Muslim world and the West. \n The real issue is not between Muslims and \nnon-Muslims, but between the moderates and the \nextremists of all religions, be it Islam, Christianity or \nJudaism. In all religions, we have inadvertently \nallowed the ugly voices of the periphery to drown out \nthe many voices of reason and common sense. I \ntherefore urge us to embark on building a global \nmovement of moderates from all faiths, moderates \ncommitted to working together to combat and \nmarginalize the extremists who have held the world \nhostage with their bigotry and bias. We must \u2014 I \nrepeat, must \u2014 urgently reclaim the centre and the \nmoral high ground that has been usurped from us. We \nmust choose moderation over extremism. We must \nchoose negotiation over confrontation. We must choose \nto work together and not against each other, and we \nmust give this effort top priority, for time is not on our \nside. \n In this regard, we are heartened to note that a \ngroup of American evangelical Christians worked \ntirelessly to prevent the threatened burning of the \nKoran, with the compelling argument that it is in fact \nun-Christian to burn the Koran. This is a clear example \nof what can be achieved when moderates in each faith \nstand up to the extremists who are trying to hijack the \nuniversal values of our religions.\n We commend President Obama and Mayor \nBloomberg for rising to the challenge by affirming the \nrights of supporters of the Cordoba House to be located \nnear the site of the World Trade Center. This project \nwill include a mosque and a multi-faith community \ncentre open to all. We support the objectives of the \n \n \n21 10-55122 \n \nCordoba Initiative, an organization that focuses on \npromoting peace, understanding and moderation, both \nbetween Muslims and non-Muslims and within the \nMuslim community. \n All countries should encourage and support \ninitiatives that promote mutual respect and peaceful \ncoexistence and reject the extremists who divide us all \nwith issues that have in the past brought about untold \nmisery and hatred. \n Allow me to share my own country\u2019s experience \nin managing issues of diversity. Malaysia is a \nmultiracial, multi-religious, multicultural and \ndemocratic society that has benefited from positive \ninteraction and synergy between the various \ncommunities. Mosques, temples, churches and other \nplaces of worship coexist in harmony. Although Islam \nis the official religion, we honour other religions \u2014 \nBuddhism, Christianity and Hinduism \u2014 by making \ntheir religious and cultural celebrations national \nholidays and celebrating them as national events. It is \nthis equilibrium that leads to moderation or what is \ncalled wasatiyyah in the Islamic tradition of mutual \njustice. \n Malaysia stands at the geographical crossroads of \nthe major civilizations and religions of the world. We \nare therefore well poised to play our part in promoting \nreligious understanding, harmony and tolerance. To \nfurther strengthen our process of national unity, I have \nintroduced a philosophy known as One Malaysia. One \nMalaysia is a vision that seeks renewal and \nrejuvenation to bring all our people together in a just \nand harmonious relationship. One Malaysia calls for \nthe acceptance of diversity as a source of greater unity. \nWe seek to celebrate our multiethnic and \nmulti-religious society for strategic strength and \nharmony. \n It is time for the moderates in all countries and in \nall religions to take back the centre, to reclaim the \nagenda for peace and pragmatism and to marginalize \nthe extremists. This global movement of the moderates \nwill save us from sinking into the abyss of despair and \ndepravation. This is an opportunity for us to provide \nmuch-needed leadership, to bring hope and to restore \ndignity for all. With greater will and collective \ndetermination, we will build a more peaceful, secure \nand equitable world."

        "file_text": "The Central African Republic would like, \nthrough me, to commend Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-fifth session. We congratulate him and offer \nhim our support in fulfilling his great responsibility. \nHis predecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki of the \nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, also deserves our heartfelt \ncommendation and gratitude for the outstanding \ncontribution he made during his term of office in \nrevitalizing the General Assembly. Lastly, on behalf of \nHis Excellency Army General Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9, \nPresident and Head of State of our country, allow me to \nconvey our sincere congratulations to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, who has been tireless in \ncarrying out his extremely important role to promote \nthe ideals of the Organization. \n The sixty-fifth session is taking place at a time \nwhen the world faces many challenges. In addition to \nthe armed conflicts that affect almost every continent, \nthere are also the food, energy and financial crises, \nwhich have made the lives of the most vulnerable \npeople increasingly precarious. There are also \nchallenges when it comes to respect for human rights, \nthe rule of law and good governance, which are the \nfoundations of lasting peace and security and a healthy \nenvironment. Today, we are aware that systematic \nviolations of human rights and the glaring absence of \nthe rule of law are often the root causes of conflicts \nand other social crises. States and non-State actors \nconfront each other. Warlords, terrorists and criminal \ngangs dictate their own rules. Civilians, rather than \nsoldiers, become the first targets. Security policy can \nno longer be confined to the traditional framework of \nthe State; it must be focused first and foremost on the \nsecurity of individuals. \n As the President rightly said in his opening \nspeech to this session of the General Assembly by way \nof referring to the special theme for the sixty-fifth \nsession, \u201cwe must reinstate the United Nations and the \nGeneral Assembly at the centre of global governance. \nThe challenges we face today have acquired a global \ndimension and require global solutions.\u201d (A/65/PV.1)  \n The Central African Republic continues to \nbelieve that preventing and peacefully resolving \nconflicts are the best way to maintain international \npeace and security. Many other challenges also require \nthe attention of the international community. We \nshould provide responses tailored to those challenges \nin order that together we can build a better world, \nstarting with the issue of climate change. \n Today more than ever before, the survival of the \nplanet is threatened by changes to the climate that have \na serious impact on living conditions in developing \ncountries \u2014 owing mainly to desertification, the silting \n  \n \n10-55128 46 \n \nup of rivers, ecosystem deterioration, shortened winters \nand floods. Faced with that danger, it is not a matter of \nraising questions about respective responsibilities; we \nmust rather, first and foremost, put in place suitable \nemergency measures to confront the challenge. \n In that connection, the outcomes of the Bali \nConference are as relevant as ever and they should be \nimplemented. Although, unfortunately, the Copenhagen \nsummit was the scene of selfishness and inconsistency \non the part of States vis-\u00e0-vis international cooperation \nand climate policy, we hope that the upcoming meeting \nat Canc\u00fan, Mexico, will find appropriate answers to \nthose worrying issues. \n The HIV/AIDS and malaria pandemics are \nanother challenge to which we must give particular \nattention, as they pose a serious threat to the survival \nof humankind, in particular on the African continent. \nWith regard to HIV/AIDS, we must truly redouble our \nefforts and determination to implement the 2001 \nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS and the \noutcomes of the high-level meetings on AIDS. Child \nand maternal mortality rates in Africa, whose increase \nis yet another cause for concern, should also enjoy the \nsame attention as the other issues. All of those \nmeetings have emphasized the gravity of the situation, \nunderscoring the importance of acting and the need to \nmobilize resources accordingly to fight those health \nthreats. \n Achieving Millennium Development Goal 1 on \ntime \u2014 namely, reducing by half the number of people \nwho suffer from hunger by 2015 \u2014 compels us to put \nin place a new approach and policy towards \ninternational cooperation that is based on support for \nagriculture, rather than on providing food assistance, \nwhich should only be provided in exceptional \ncircumstances, and then in a timely manner. \n Developing agriculture in Africa so that it \nprovides for lasting food security also necessarily \nentails controlling water, the availability of equipment, \naccess to raw materials for producers and proper \norganization of the means of producing, storing, \ntransforming and marketing agricultural products. The \nCentral African Republic, a country endowed with \nabundant natural resources, would easily be able to \ntake its place as an agricultural country, were it not for \nthe handicaps it faces owing to its landlocked status \nand the scarcity of means at its disposal. \n Agriculture in my country is essentially a \nsubsistence affair that performs poorly despite the \ncountry\u2019s enormous potential. That includes 15 million \narable hectares, of which only 600,000 are cultivated \nannually, as well as 16 million hectares of range land \nfor a herd of 2 million animals. We also have at our \ndisposal a vast network of rivers and streams, as well \nas abundant rainfall amounting to 1,200 to 1,800 \nmillimetres per year. Agriculture employs more than 75 \nper cent of working people in our country, contributing \nabout 53 per cent of our gross domestic product. \n In the Central African Republic, about 72 per cent \nof the poor and hungry live in rural areas, where \nagriculture plays a crucial role, feeding communities \nbut providing employment that offers only meagre \nincomes. Nevertheless, in spite of the enormity of the \nneed and the growing food insecurity, assistance to \nagriculture continues to decrease, having dropped \nsignificantly in the past 20 years. \n The Central African Republic has maintained the \nstrengthening of human capital as one of its priorities \nunder the fourth pillar of its national poverty-reduction \nstrategy. Under that pillar, education, health and \nemployment are considered priority sectors, in line \nwith the Millennium Development Goals. Assessments \nof the programmes that have been launched seem to \nreveal shortcomings in the results. For instance, adult \nliteracy rates are poor, at 57 per cent, while the overall \nprimary school attendance rate is also low, at 55 per \ncent. \n The Central African Republic is among the \ncountries of the world most affected by the HIV/AIDS \npandemic, even though we are continuing efforts to \nbring its prevalence under control. \n Given those outcomes, it is clear that, if our \ncountry is to pursue the implementation of the \npriorities of our development plan, we need significant \nsupport from our development partners. \n With regard to nuclear disarmament, the \nproliferation crisis we are experiencing constitutes the \ngreatest threat to international peace and security \ntoday. Nuclear disarmament and nuclear proliferation \nin all their aspects should be at the centre of our \ndebate. We should resolve to prioritize the use of \nnuclear energy for peaceful civilian purposes. \n Today more than ever before, the \ninterconnectedness of the crises faced by the \n \n \n47 10-55128 \n \ninternational community underscores the need to inject \nnew impetus into efforts to achieve international peace \nand security, including collective efforts at the \ninternational level. \n With regard to reforming the United Nations \nsystem, the Central African Republic shares the view \nthat the current system no longer reflects the ambitions \nof the founders. Our country therefore once again calls \nfor full representation for Africa in the system\u2019s \ndecision-making bodies, in particular the Security \nCouncil. Whatever the outcome of the ongoing \nnegotiations on this matter, my delegation continues to \nbelieve that any viable reform of the Security Council \nmust take into account Africa\u2019s numerical and political \nsignificance in the General Assembly, especially given \nthe two types of situations considered by the Council. \n The Central African Republic held elections in \n2005, which were heralded by the international \ncommunity for having met all the necessary standards. \nIt should be pointed out that those held in 2010 \nexperienced various difficulties that need to be \nexamined. Therefore, on the basis of a political \nconsensus, the National Assembly adopted a law based \non a constitutional court opinion. This constitutional \narrangement extends the term of office of our country\u2019s \nPresident, as well as those of members of the \nAssembly, until the holding of elections, now set for  \n23 January 2011. \n In another area, the programme for the \ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration of \nformer combatants has made considerable progress in \nthe central and north-western parts of our country. \nNevertheless, the Central African Republic continues \nto face security problems in the north-east of the \ncountry, as a result of the consequences of the conflict \nin Darfur, as well as in the south-east, owing to the \nraging Ugandan rebellion by the Lord\u2019s Resistance \nArmy (LRA). \n This alarming situation has resulted in a growing \nnumber of refugees and internally displaced persons \nfrom various areas, who have fled to the cities from the \nfighting. Having been pushed out of Uganda, LRA \nrebels have regrouped in the south-east of our country, \nwhere they carry out all sorts of violence and spread \nterror among the people. It is important to point out \nthat the Central African Republic does not have any \nborders with Uganda. \n The Central African Republic therefore welcomes \nthe decision by the United States Government with \nregard to disarming the LRA. Nevertheless, we hope \nthat the United States Administration will focus in \nparticular on the case of the Central African Republic, \nwhich is a post-conflict country that still needs United \nStates assistance, given the danger posed by the LRA \non the ground in our country and the disastrous social \nconsequences it has already had.\n The United Nations Mission in the Central \nAfrican Republic and Chad, whose mandate will expire \non 31 December 2010, requires particular attention. \nThe Central African Republic\u2019s defence and security \nforces will take over from international forces in order \nto ensure the continuity of operations. However, they \nare in desperate need of military equipment and \nsupplies. The Government of the Central African \nRepublic therefore appeals to the international \ncommunity for assistance in strengthening the \noperational capacities of our armed forces. \n I cannot conclude without once again thanking all \nthose whose commitment, courage and determination \ncontinue to be of assistance in helping my country to \nemerge from crisis to lasting peace and development. \n "

        "file_text": "I warmly \ncongratulate Mr. Deiss on his well-deserved election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \nsession. I believe his wise and experienced leadership \nwill bring great success to the Assembly\u2019s proceedings. \nI also congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his \nlaudable contribution as Assembly President in its \nsixty-fourth session. I also thank Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon for his tireless service to the United \nNations and to world peace. \n Bangladesh is a secular, progressive nation \nfulfilling the promise of democracy, good governance, \nhuman rights and the rule of law that were made by my \nfather \u2014 the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu \nSheikh Mujibur Rahman, the greatest Bengali of all \ntimes \u2014 from this podium 36 years ago (see \nA/PV.2243). That has also been in consonance with the \nobjectives of the United Nations, which remains the \nlast abode where the hopes and aspirations of the \nhapless people of the world can be fulfilled. \n Bangladesh has also been supporting United \nNations efforts to establish democracy, human rights, \npeace and security, as well as taking effective steps to \ncombat terrorism and external threats worldwide. I, \ntoo, am committed to ensuring this continuity. \n Bangladesh has established an international \ncrimes tribunal to try persons responsible for war \ncrimes and crimes against humanity, including \ngenocide, arson and rape, committed during our war of \nliberation in 1971 and immediately thereafter. That \naction is in accord with the rule of law as reflected in \nthe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, \nwhich we have ratified and which is aimed at bringing \nperpetrators of war crimes, genocide and crimes \nagainst humanity to justice. I believe that only justice \ncan heal the unforgivable, deadly wrongs of the past. \n Here, I sadly recall the evil act of terror on \n15 August 1975 that took the life of my father and the \nFather of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur \nRahman, and 18 members of my family, including my \nmother, sisters-in-law and my three brothers, one of \nwhom was only 10 years old. Even I have been a target \nof a series of assassination attempts ever since my \nreturn home from exile in 1981. \n The most horrendous period was when our \nsecular democratic party, the Awami League, was in \nopposition, from 2001 to 2006. At that time thousands \nof our party workers, supporters and followers of the \nreligious minority who voted for our secular party were \nmercilessly killed in systematic terrorist acts of the \nBNP/Jamaat-e-Islami alliance Government. The most \naudacious act was the dastardly open grenade attack on \n21 August 2004 directed against me at a public rally \nbeing held to protest those terrorist attacks and killings. \nBy the time a dozen grenades had taken their toll, \n24 innocent people, including our party\u2019s Secretary for \nWomen\u2019s Affairs, Mrs. Ivy Rahman \u2014 the wife of our \ncurrent President \u2014 lay dead, and over 500 people \nwere seriously injured. \n There have also been attempts on members of my \nfamily, but never have we bowed before the forces of \nterror. As victims of repeated terrorist attacks, my \nfamily and I know this menace well. Clearly, our \nrejection of terrorism is total, as is our determination to \neliminate it in all its forms. I want to unequivocally \nstate that terrorism will not be allowed on the soil of \nBangladesh, and that is precisely why we are a party to \nall terrorism-related United Nations conventions and \naccord them our full support. \n Our firm policy against terrorism and our love for \npeace led me to negotiate the 1997 Chittagong Hill \nTracts Peace Accord, thus ending decades of internal \nconflict, and a peaceful resolution of the violent \nuprising of our paramilitary border forces in 2009. In \nthe international sphere, our commitment to peace, \nwhich is essential for development, is reflected in our \nunflinching support for United Nations peacekeeping \nmissions. Since 1988 Bangladesh has sent 97,000 \ntroops to 24 countries as part of 32 such missions. In \nthat period we have lost the precious lives of 92 valiant \nsoldiers. \n Our present troop contribution has made \nBangladesh number one among countries contributing \ntroops to United Nations peacekeeping operations. \nSadly, despite that involvement, our presence in the \nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) \n \n \n15 10-55109 \n \nremains negligible, as is our voice in planning \nstrategies of peacekeeping missions. In all fairness, we \nshould have proportionate representation in DPKO. \n Bangladesh has been adversely affected by global \nwarming, food insecurity, population displacement and \ndiminished biodiversity, among other problems, and is \nfaced with serious threats caused by climate change \nand global warming. Although our share of carbon gas \nemissions is negligible, we are their worst victim. The \nincreasing frequency and ferocity of floods, cyclones, \ndroughts and other natural disasters caused by that \nphenomenon continue to create havoc through the lives \nlost and the resources destroyed. \n Consequently, attaining the Millennium Development \nGoals is becoming a more difficult challenge. Climate \nmigrants are already overcrowding our cities, putting \ngreat stress on our limited infrastructure facilities and \ncausing social disorder. The situation could become \ncatastrophic with a one-metre rise in the sea level due \nto global warming. That would inundate one quarter of \nBangladesh, impacting 11 per cent of our population \nand leading to mass migration. \n To meet those challenges, we have adopted a \n134-point adaptation and mitigation action plan. Those \npoints include dredging major rivers to restrict \nflooding, recovering cultivable lands for settling \ndisplaced people and increasing capacity to produce \nmore grain foods. Other plans include afforesting \n20 per cent of the land area by 2015, creating a huge \ncarbon sink; protecting biodiversity; strengthening \ncoasts and river banks with green belts; modernizing \ndisaster management with community participation; \ndeveloping crop varieties attuned to climate change; \nchanging agricultural practices; using clean coal \ntechnology; and adopting nuclear power and renewable \nenergy. Meanwhile, over 14,000 shelters for cyclone \nvictims have been strategically located to cope with \ncyclonic disasters. \n Implementing the action plan requires enormous \nfunds. An immediate measure has been the \nestablishment of a Climate Change Trust Fund with our \nown resources, and a Climate Change Resilience Fund \nwith assistance from development partners. At the \ninternational level, at the fifteenth Climate Change \nConference of Parties \u2014 COP 15 \u2014 last year, we \nworked hard for a legally binding agreement and for an \ninternational climate fund to assist countries most \nvulnerable to climate change. The compromise was the \nCopenhagen Accord, which has so far failed to deliver \nits promises. \n Therefore, I urge the world leaders at the \nsixteenth Conference \u2014 COP 16 \u2014 this year to \nconclude, in their wisdom, a positive agreement based \non the Bali Plan of Action, with agreed cuts in \ngreenhouse gas emissions and real contributions to the \ninternational climate fund. I also urge them to adopt, at \nCOP 16, measures to ameliorate the adverse impacts of \nclimate change on the most vulnerable countries, like \nBangladesh, small island developing States like the \nMaldives, and landlocked countries like Bhutan and \nNepal, among other least developed countries (LDCs). \n The world is yet to recover from the world \neconomic crisis, and LDCs as well as developed \ncountries are suffering from reduced exports. Those \ncrises are due to inequity and injustice resulting from \nan unfair international structure, which remains mostly \nunchanged. The Bretton Woods institutions must now \naccommodate a greater presence of developing \ncountries, especially least developed countries. While \nthe Bretton Woods institutions can deal with long-term \ndevelopment assistance, Bangladesh proposes the \nestablishment of a special fund under United Nations \nauspices to deal exclusively with Special Drawing \nRights and grants. We also propose that all \nstakeholders respect country-led ownership of all \ndevelopment projects, as enshrined in the Accra \nAgenda for Action. \n The least developed countries surely welcome the \ndevelopment assistance they receive from developed \ncountries. They would, however, benefit more through \nreceiving liberal trade concessions such as duty and \nquota-free market access, trade capacity-building, et \ncetera. Least developed countries also seek a speedy \nend to the World Trade Organization\u2019s Doha Round of \nthe World Trade Organization trade negotiations and \nfulfilment of the commitments by the countries of the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment to provide 0.7 per cent of gross national \nincome to official development assistance, of which \n0.2 per cent will be directed at least developed \ncountries, as affirmed in the Brussels Programme of \nAction. \n The least developed countries have also been \naffected by unemployment at home and by obstacles to \nmigration for jobs abroad. Since remittances form a \nsignificant part of their gross domestic product, \n  \n \n10-55109 16 \n \neconomic recovery measures should assure \nemployment opportunities and all rights of migrant \nworkers, especially those from least developed \ncountries. \n However, amid the travails of the past years, \nBangladesh has fared reasonably well in maintaining \nan annual GDP growth rate of 6 per cent. That was \npossible due to our pragmatic policies on food \nproduction, agriculture, rural development, inflation \ncontrol and keeping food and essentials prices within \nreach of the poor. During our previous Government, \nfrom 1996 to 2001, our policies on food security made \nBangladesh self-sufficient in food, which led to our \nwinning the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited Nations Ceres Award. This time around, with \nthe implementation of the national food policy, aimed \nat stable prices of fuel, fertilizer, seeds and other farm \ninputs, our Government has succeeded again in \nensuring sustained food supply to all. \n Our Government\u2019s aim is also to use information \nand communications technology (ICT) to accelerate \nour socio-economic development. Therefore, we are \nimplementing ICT Act 2009 and ICT Policy 2009 to \nbuild the requisite infrastructure and extend ICT to \nevery nook and corner of Bangladesh. Already, \neducational institutions, local government institutions \nand rural communities are being connected to Internet \nservices. The process includes an e-centre for rural \ncommunities, connecting 8,500 post offices; a high-\ntech park; a network of e governance; and efforts to \nstrengthen the telecommunication network and satellite \ncommunication. \n Our e-services are now focused on improving \nagricultural information delivery, market access, \neducation, health care, early warning systems for \ndisasters, law and order, and social safety net \npayments. Also being implemented is an aggressive \ne-leadership programme among members of \nParliament, top policymakers, field administrators and \nlocal administrators. We had already transformed \n100 Union Parishads to host e-centres in 2009, and we \nare now expediting the process to cover all 4,500 \nUnion Parishads by the end of this year. In short, our \nGovernment is determined to achieve a digital \nBangladesh and transform it into a middle-income \ncountry by 2021, the golden jubilee year of our \nnation\u2019s independence. \n Simultaneously, our Government\u2019s aim is to \nattain 100 per cent primary school enrolment by 2011 \nand 100 per cent literacy rate by 2014. Our highest \nbudget allocation goes to education. Tuition and books \nare now free for students up to grade 12. Computer and \nInternet facilities are being provided free of charge to \nschools in order to familiarize students with their use. \nTo encourage school attendance, we have started \nproviding lunch to students and cash incentives to \nparents. \n Though Bangladesh has achieved the Millennium \nDevelopment Goal target of gender equality at the \nsecondary level, our plan is to provide free tuition to \ngirls up to the undergraduate level. This is because we \nfirmly believe that women\u2019s equal involvement is vital \nfor a nation\u2019s development. Gender equity and human \ndevelopment are our top priority concerns. \n Our Government has revived the national \nwomen\u2019s development policy, adopted during our last \ntenure of office, that is, 1996 to 2001. At present, \nbesides the Prime Minister, the leader of the \nopposition, the deputy leader and a whip, there are five \nother women Cabinet ministers and 45 members of \nParliament in reserved seats. Moreover, 19 women \nmembers of Parliament have been directly elected. \nWomen also occupy 30 per cent of reserved seats in all \nlocal governments. They are encouraged to participate \nin politics and administration, and are recruited in all \nprofessions, including the armed services. They are \nalso serving in United Nations peacekeeping \noperations. \n We have made arrangements to provide pensions \nto distressed and widowed women, as well as \nresidential accommodation for both men and women in \nold peoples\u2019 homes. Our social safety nets also include \nprogrammes for minorities, the marginalized, the \ndisabled and the mentally challenged; ashrayan, or \nhomes for the homeless; the \u201cone home, one farm\u201d \npolicy to alleviate poverty; and cash and food transfer \nprogrammes. \n A new policy provides for the employment of one \nmember from every poor family. Another new initiative \nis the national services policy for providing youth and \nwomen with employment and skills development. \nMoreover, research opportunities have led to new \ndiscoveries, particularly with respect to climate-\nchange-resilient crops. A recent success is genome \nsequencing of the jute fibre, ensuring improved quality \n \n \n17 10-55109 \n \nof jute products, a biodegradable option to hazardous \nsynthetic products. \n Health is another area receiving special attention, \nwith the implementation of the national health policy \nadopted during our previous term of office. This policy \nprovides for the establishment of one community clinic \nfor every 6,000 people. Our plan is to locate 18,000 \nsuch clinics in the first phase, to extend basic health \nservices into people\u2019s homes. For safe motherhood, a \nnational strategy for maternal health has been adopted, \nwith a programme to reduce the infant mortality rate to \n15 from the current 54 per 1,000 live births. \n Our target is to complete 100 per cent \nimmunization by the end of our present tenure of \nGovernment. Since my Government assumed office, \nthe maternal mortality rate has been reduced from 2.9 \nto 2.6 and infant mortality to such a significant extent \nthat our successes have been recognized with an award \nby the United Nations. \n Indeed, despite the recent world food, energy, \neconomic and climate change crises, Bangladesh, with \nthe support of United Nations agencies and bilateral \nand multilateral partners, has made satisfactory \nprogress. In fact, our achievement with respect to \nMDG 1, on poverty alleviation, MDG 2, on universal \nprimary education, and MDG 3, on gender equality and \nwomen\u2019s empowerment, are encouraging and on track. \nOur Government, through its sincere efforts, intends to \nraise 12 million people out of poverty, which would \nhalve the number of people now living in that sad state \nby the MDG deadline of 2015. \n Our unflinching commitment to peace finds \nexpression in our annual flagship Assembly resolution \non the culture of peace (see resolution 64/80). Recent \nyears have shown an extraordinary record of \nsponsorships because of the reference to the \nInternational Mother Language Day. Ever since the \nDay was adopted by UNESCO in recognition of the \nlanguage martyrs who gave their lives in 1952 for \nBangla, their mother tongue, it has been celebrated \nthroughout the world with growing fervour every year. \nSince Bangla is spoken by nearly 300 million people \nworldwide and has a rich heritage in literature, history \nand other fields, our Parliament adopted a resolution \nrequesting the United Nations to declare Bangla as one \nof its official languages. I fervently appeal to Member \nStates for acceptance of our very legitimate request. \n Every passing day, the peoples of the world are \nbeing drawn closer together, as one village, with \nquickly developing technologies and new challenges \nsuch as climate change, terrorism and economic \ninterdependence. Indeed, our destiny is now one, as are \nour burdens and responsibilities. It is now obvious that \nonly by mobilizing and optimizing our synergies will it \nbe possible for us to create a world of shared peace and \nprosperity. We have no alternative but to discard our \nself-centred, short-sighted interests and work in unison \nfor a world that our children, and theirs, will inherit, so \nthat they will remember us with fondness and in \ngratitude. \n May Bangladesh live forever. Long live the \nUnited Nations. "

        "file_text": "\nChina is a member of the big family of the United \nNations, and China\u2019s development and changes have \nattracted worldwide attention. I wish to take this \nopportunity to share with the Assembly my \nobservations on how one should get to know the real \nChina. \n Since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic, and \nespecially since the start of reform and opening up \nmore than 30 years ago, profound changes have taken \nplace in China, a big, ancient country in the East. Its \neconomic and overall national strength has \nsubstantially increased. The lives of its people have \nmarkedly improved. Its social and cultural programmes \nhave made considerable progress, and its exchanges \nand cooperation with the outside world have continued \nto expand. In sum, my country has made an historic \nleap from mere subsistence to moderate prosperity. \n  \n \n10-54827 42 \n \n We in China are proud of our achievements, \nwhich were made through strenuous efforts. At the \nsame time, we are clear-headed about our place and \nrole in today\u2019s world. \n China\u2019s gross domestic product is the third largest \nin the world, but in per capita terms it is only one tenth \nof that of developed countries. China has enjoyed more \nthan 30 years of rapid growth, but its further \ndevelopment faces energy, resources and \nenvironmental constraints. It is a leading producer of \nmany important products, but it remains at the lower \nend of the global industrial chain. China is a big \ntrading nation, but its exports are low in technology \ncontent and value added. In many cases, we have to \nrely on imports to meet the demand for core \ntechnologies.  \n China\u2019s coastal areas and some of the large and \nmedium-sized cities are thriving after modernizing, but \nmany places in the central and western regions and the \nvast rural areas are still rather backward. Moreover, we \nhave 150 million people living below the poverty line \nset by the United Nations.  \n The life of the Chinese people has improved \nsignificantly, but we do not yet have a full-fledged \nsocial security system. Moreover, we are confronted \nwith high employment pressure. Our people are more \nand more actively engaged in the country\u2019s social and \npolitical development, and citizens\u2019 basic rights and \ninterests are better protected, yet our democracy and \nlegal system still have room for improvement and such \nsocial ills as inequity and corruption still exist. \n China has come a long way in modernization. It \nis fairly advanced in some areas of development but \nremains backward in others. And it faces \nunprecedented challenges brought by problems both \nold and new.  \n Taken as a whole, China is still in the primary \nstage of socialism and remains a developing country. \nThose are our basic national conditions. That is the real \nChina. \n China has set the strategic goal of achieving \nmodernization by the middle of this century. As they \nlook to the coming decades, the Chinese people will \ncontinue to advance along the path of reform, opening \nup and peaceful development. That path has changed \nChina\u2019s destiny and has benefited people throughout \nthe country. We must stay on that path and make \nfurther improvements. There is no reason whatsoever \nfor us to deviate from it. \n China will continue to focus on developing the \neconomy. Development is our top priority, as it \nconstitutes the basis for addressing all issues. We will \nrely mainly on our own efforts in pursuing \ndevelopment. \n As China\u2019s industrialization and urbanization \nprogress, hundreds of millions of farmers will move to \ntowns and cities, which will create more domestic \ndemand than ever, open up broad market and \ndevelopment space and serve as a powerful engine for \nsustaining the growth of the Chinese economy as well \nas the world economy at large. We will work hard to \ntransform the economic development pattern, \nrestructure the economy and set out on a path of \nbalanced and sustainable development. \n China will continue to deepen institutional \nreform. We will make consistent efforts to improve the \nsocialist market economy. We will unswervingly \nstrengthen and develop the public sector side of the \neconomy and also unswervingly encourage, support \nand guide the development of the non-public sector. \nWe will pay greater attention to ensuring and \nimproving people\u2019s well-being. We will further reform \nthe income distribution system and improve the social \nsecurity system, including old-age support, medical \ncare and unemployment benefit programmes. We will \nendeavour to narrow the gap between urban and rural \nareas, between different regions and between the rich \nand the poor. We want to ensure that each and every \ncitizen shares the benefit of China\u2019s reform, opening up \nand development.  \n While deepening economic restructuring, we will \nalso push forward with political restructuring. \nOtherwise, we cannot achieve the ultimate goal of \neconomic reform and we will lose what we have gained \nfrom our modernization drive. We respect and protect \nhuman rights, uphold social equity and justice and \nstrive to achieve free and all-around development for \nour people. That is the important hallmark of a \ndemocratic country under the rule of law and a basic \nguarantee for any country\u2019s lasting peace and stability. \n China will be even more open to the world. \nMutually beneficial cooperation for win-win progress \nis a long-term strategy that we will stick to in opening \nup to the world. We will follow established \ninternational rules in expanding business ties with \n \n \n43 10-54827 \n \nother countries. We will continue to improve the \nenvironment for foreign investors, optimize the \nstructure of foreign capital utilization and explore new \nways for overseas investment and cooperation.  \n We are committed to promoting the establishment \nof a fair, equitable, inclusive and well-managed new \ninternational financial order and an open and free \ninternational trading regime. We are against \nprotectionism in all its manifestations. In the course of \nmodernization, we will not only continue to bring in \nand utilize advanced achievements from the rest of the \nworld in the economic, scientific and technological \nfields, but also boldly draw upon the achievements of \nhuman civilization in the fields of social management \nand cultural development. \n China will continue to develop education, science \nand technology. How can China narrow the \ndevelopment gap with the advanced countries and \nenhance the sustainability of its strong growth? I \nbelieve two things are of fundamental importance: first \nis education, and second is science and technology. \nChina has formulated medium- and long-term \ndevelopment programmes on education and on science \nand technology. Going forward, we will focus our \nefforts on implementing those two programmes and \nbuilding China into a country strong in human \nresources and innovation by 2020. \n China will continue to carry forward its fine \nculture. The development of a country and rejuvenation \nof a nation require not only great economic strength, \nbut, more importantly, great cultural strength. The \nmoral values and wisdom drawn from the 5,000-year-\nold Chinese civilization do not belong to China alone \nbut also to the world. We will vigorously develop \ncultural programmes and accelerate the development of \na moral and ethical code that is commensurate with our \nsocialist modernization drive and consistent with the \ntraditional virtues of our nation.  \n We respect the diversity of civilizations and will \nincrease dialogue and exchanges with other \ncivilizations to forge a common cultural bond for \nhumanity. The Chinese nation, which has created an \neconomic miracle, will create a new cultural splendor \nas well. \n The world of the twenty-first century is far from \ntranquil, but gone are the days when problems were \nultimately settled by war. Peace and development \nremain the defining features of our time.  \n China will stay firmly committed to peaceful \ndevelopment. One may ask what the essence of \npeaceful development is. It is to foster a peaceful \ninternational environment for our development and, at \nthe same time, contribute to world peace through our \ndevelopment. That is something inherent in the concept \nof socialism with Chinese characteristics. \n In the course of development, China will continue \nto take upon itself the duty of promoting the common \nprogress and prosperity of mankind. We will seek and \nexpand converging interests with other countries. \nChina\u2019s development will not harm anyone or pose a \nthreat to anyone. There have been Powers who sought \nhegemony once they grew strong. China will never \nfollow in their footsteps. \n China values friendship and also adheres to its \nprinciples. It firmly upholds its core interests. When it \ncomes to sovereignty, national unity and territorial \nintegrity, China will not yield or compromise. \n China will continue to firmly support the leading \nrole of the United Nations in international affairs. We \nwill, as always, abide by the United Nations Charter \nand fulfil in good faith our obligations under \ninternational conventions. We will intensify \ncooperation with fellow developing countries and \nsupport their having a greater say in international \naffairs. We will remain forever a good partner of and \nbrother to developing countries. \n China\u2019s stability and development is conducive to \na more peaceful international environment, a more \ndemocratic international order, a more prosperous \nglobal economy and a more harmonious and civilized \nworld. China\u2019s development is an opportunity for the \nworld, and the world stands to gain from a China that \nis better off. History will continue to prove that. \n A China that develops peacefully, a China that is \nfull of vigour and vitality and a China that is willing \nand ready to fulfil its responsibilities will always move \nforward together with the world. Let us join hands to \nwork for a world of enduring peace and prosperity."

In the same vein, Ecuador has \nfostered South-South cooperation as a mechanism for \ndevelopment, encouraging cooperation among the \nlegitimate representatives of States parties. We believe \nthat countries must be heard and their requirements and \nrealities addressed, and that cooperation should be a \nreality over the medium term. \n I should stress that one of the most important \nendeavours developed within this space was the \nsolidarity extended to the sister country of Haiti and its \nlegitimate Government for its reconstruction, to attain \nthe development it yearns for and to strengthen its \ninstitutions as it deserves. \n I wish to place special emphasis on the \nimportance we accord to the issue of climate change. \nEcuador is one of world\u2019s 19 megadiverse countries. Its \nAmazon forest boasts the Yasun\u00ed Park, declared by \nUNESCO as a world biosphere reserve in 1989. \nScientists agree on the unique value of this park, for its \nextraordinary biodiversity and state of conservation \nand for the cultural heritage it holds. The park \nconcentrates Amazonia\u2019s highest densities of \namphibian, mammal, bird and plant species. Yasun\u00ed is \nalso a Pleistocene reserve. There, species were not \n  \n \n10-55122 2 \n \naffected by glaciation, which preserved a process of \ndifferentiated evolution of new species. Moreover, the \nYasun\u00ed National Park is the home of two indigenous \npeoples that have opted to live in voluntary isolation \nwith respect to Western culture: the Tagaeri and the \nTaromenane. Both belong to the Huaorani culture, \npossessing age-old wisdom and cultural heritage. \n The wealth of the park also extends underground. \nIn Yasun\u00ed there are oil resources from which Ecuador \ncould obtain 846 million barrels of heavy crude. Three \nyears ago, the President of Ecuador, the economist \nRafael Correa, launched the Yasun\u00ed-ITT Initiative \nbefore this forum (see A/62/PV.7), which proposed \nkeeping that oil underground, unexploited. If we fulfil \nthis aspiration, we will prevent the emission of \n407 million tons of carbon, the main cause of climate \nchange, and we will leave intact the planet\u2019s richest \nworld biosphere reserve. To do this, we need to raise \nglobal awareness and gain the relevant international \ncontribution, equivalent to at least half of the total \nrevenue of $3.6 billion that the State of Ecuador would \nearn if it were to exploit the oil reserves. \n Ecuador is a country that is making major efforts \nto achieve development. But, as an act of generosity, \nthe people of Ecuador have decided not to receive \n50 per cent of the income that this oil would generate, \nso long as the international community makes the same \neffort. \n The Yasun\u00ed Initiative, as President Correa himself \nhas said, is not just symbolic. It is the most important \ninitiative for our country and for the entire planet. It \nwould protect one of the areas richest in biodiversity \u2014 \nperhaps the richest in the world \u2014 and there is no \ndoubt that it would contribute to mitigating climate \nchange. The world will be able to assess the way of life \nof Amazon peoples, in particular that of the most \nvulnerable among them: the indigenous peoples in \nvoluntary isolation. \n We have already created a capital fund \nadministered by the United Nations Development \nProgramme with the participation of the Ecuadorian \nState, our civil society, and representatives of our \nfellow contributing countries. \n I call upon our brother countries throughout the \nworld, especially the industrialized countries, to \nsupport the Yasun\u00ed Initiative and, acknowledging the \nresponsibility we all share for climate change, to seek \noriginal solutions to a problem that threatens the very \nsurvival of the human species. Ancestral Amerindian \nwisdom teaches us that the Earth was not inherited \nfrom our parents; rather, this magical creation is lent to \nus by our children. \n Ecuador has reached its targets related to the \nMillennium Development Goals, and it continues to \npromote them, including by setting an example for the \ninternational community. However, I wish to state very \nfirmly that the Millennium Development Goals left out \na very significant segment of the population and that, \nsoon, they will reveal deficiencies in the social policies \nof countries. I am speaking here of the excluded among \nthe excluded, the forgotten among the forgotten. I am \nreferring to people with disabilities. \n Let us be clear: disability is not incapacity, but \nrather diversity. As there is geographical, cultural or \nbioclimatic diversity, there are also diverse capacities, \nand that is where talent, heart, dedication, perseverance \nand willingness lie. Ecuador has undertaken a \nbio-psychosocial, clinical and genetic study of all \npersons with disabilities in the country. We never in \nour wildest dreams imagined what we would find in \nthat study: human beings left in holes in the ground, in \ncages, with silence as their only company and death as \ntheir only hope, human beings ashamed and shaming \nothers. \n That situation no longer exists in Ecuador. \nAlthough much remains to be done, we have already \naccomplished much. As of now, we can locate via \nsatellite every person with disabilities in Ecuador who \nneeds help and provide them with the technical \nassistance they need, accessible and dignified housing, \nmedical care, rehabilitation and integration in the \nworkforce and the education system. In addition, we \nhave created a subsidy, equivalent to a minimal living \nwage, to acknowledge the work and the dedication of \nthose who care for persons with severe physical or \nmental disabilities. \n The expertise of the sister Republic of Cuba \nplayed a significant role in the execution of this \ndetailed study. Cuba is perhaps the country that shows \nthe greatest solidarity in Latin America because, when \nthe time to help comes, they do not take into account \nthe fact that they still suffer under the most infamous, \nillegal and illegitimate blockade in human memory, \nand which Ecuador condemns with all the energy of a \ngrateful people. \n \n \n3 10-55122 \n \n I must highlight the inescapable urgency of \naddressing the subject of human migration. Allow me \nto make an appeal to all countries, especially \ndeveloped ones, to sign the International Convention \non the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers \nand Members of Their Families, which was opened for \nsignature 20 years ago: 20 years ago. What, I ask \nmyself, are we not one single race? Have we not \nsimilar problems? \n I also ask myself: do we not share the same \nevolution? Do we not have the same hopes for the \nfuture? Let us share the realization of the dream of \nuniversal citizenship. Let human beings travel \nwherever they want, whenever they want, as they do \nwhen they are at home and among family, and as \nshould be the case around the world. \n I want to reiterate the Ecuadorian position \ncondemning all forms of colonialism and occupation of \nterritories by foreign forces. We reaffirm that dialogue \nmust always be the mechanism of choice for the \nsettlement of conflicts. \n We believe in the sovereign right of all countries \nto development and to the peaceful use of nuclear \nenergy. We want a world without nuclear weapons. We \ntherefore recommend preaching by example. I will \nrepeat that: we want a world without nuclear weapons, \nbut our approach is to preach by example, so that that \nwhich we demand from others also becomes first and \nforemost a requirement for ourselves. I call for a \ndefinitive decision. Let us dismantle nuclear arsenals, \nso that just as we criminalize the manufacturing and \nmarketing of illegal drugs, we would also criminalize \nthe manufacturing and marketing of weapons of mass \ndestruction \u2014 and if only that could be done for all \nweapons. \n There can be no world governance without peace. \nNature is the best teacher of peace. I was born in the \nEcuadorian Amazon basin. We call Earth our Pacha \nMama. She and we are the same. The travelling poet \nWalt Whitman said, referring to all human beings, to \nall other beings on Earth and to the Earth itself, \u201cevery \natom belonging to me as good belongs to you\u201d (Song of \nMyself). We are made of the same atoms, which we \nshare. We come from dust, we whirl around for some \ntime and then we return to dust, to our Pacha Mama, to \nMother Nature. But she has been abused and \ndisrespected. Even so, in her agony, she is still \ngenerous. Rabindranath Tagore said that the Earth has \nbeen insulted and reviled, but in return offers her \nflowers and her fruits. \n I call on Member States, our brother countries, to \nshare this revolutionary vision, to find peace and to \nmake it everlasting, to change the history of the \ninvaded, the polluted, the humiliated and the forgotten \nof the Earth. \n Let us create an army of warriors that carry no \nweapons on their shoulders or ammunition in their \npacks, but whose weapons are ecology, medicine, the \ndefence of human rights and human solidarity, an army \nthat fights the only disability that truly exists, which is \nthe human disability. The only disability that exists is \nthat of the heart. The enemy is inequality, which, \nalthough fierce, will be defeated. We will succeed, of \ncourse. Of course we will succeed."

        "file_text": "From this universal podium I convey a warm \ngreeting to the Assembly and the whole of humanity. I \nespecially commend my fellow Costa Rican citizens \nfor their free and sovereign decision, which has given \nme the great honour to represent them before you all. \n I begin my remarks with renewed support for the \nUnited Nations, for its contributions to human rights, \npeace, security, comprehensive sustainable development, \ntolerance, solidarity and respect for diversity and for \ninternational law. It is without doubt an organization of \nStates, but more, it is an organization of peoples, who \nfrom their differences embrace and take shelter in the \nhumanistic and universal values that support the United \nNations.  \n At this moment, around the world those values \nand their implied commitments are flourishing, but \nthey are also suffering. \n We can congratulate ourselves on the children \nwho are receiving a good education and on the parents \nwho see them grow up without fear that they will be \nconsumed by war. We are inspired by young people, \nworkers and peasants with opportunities for a worthy \nlife, and by the women who benefit from full equality. \nIn that context, we welcome the appointment of \nMs. Michelle Bachelet as Under-Secretary-General for \nGender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.  \n However, at the same time we also are concerned \nabout those women who as heads of households can \nbarely feed their children. We are worried about the \nadults who grow old in poverty and loneliness and \nabout children whose lives lack affection and \nstimulation. The catastrophic effects of climate change \ndemand our immediate and determined attention. And \nit offends us that even today, there are women awaiting \nexecution by stoning, populations stifled by brutal \ngenocide, and nuclear weapons that are being \nstockpiled while granaries are being depleted. \n When we refer to the United Nations and global \ngovernance, we must remember that such governance \nstarts with good national government. But at the same \ntime, the success of our domestic administrations \ndepends upon an international system that is fair, \nefficient, open and responsible and that is capable of \ndealing with the great challenges of our time. \n As President, I am subject to the constant \nscrutiny of my people, from whom I came and to \nwhom I am accountable. I am aware that the best \nsermon comes from example. Thus my Government \nstrives to represent the values, promote the \ndevelopment and increase the integral welfare of all \nCosta Ricans. We are promoting economic growth, the \nopening of trade, solidarity, environmental \nresponsibility and political transparency in the \nframework of civil liberties. That course of action is \nrooted in our history. It is why we introduced free \ncompulsory primary education in 1870, abolished the \ndeath penalty in 1877, disbanded the army in 1949, \npreserved 25 per cent of our land in the 1960s and \ncreated universal access to health in the mid-1970s. \n My Government stands on that legacy in order to \nact in the present and to construct the future. We strive \nfor attention to and early stimulation of our children \nand for care of adults and the elderly. We fight \ninequality, strive to improve education and health, and \nfoster economic development increasingly based on \nclean energy, a sustainable economy and creative \nintelligence. I mention all these things as humble \nnational experience, not as a pretentious global lesson. \n History, geography and circumstances frequently \nshape us \u2014 but only up to a point, because individual \nand collective will, responsibility, and constructive \nleadership can break down the obstacles and trace \nbetter paths. Thus we must pull back the curtains of \nprejudice that dim reality, exchange the echoes of the \npast for the sounds of the future, and bury \nrecrimination of others as an excuse to avoid our \nduties.  \n Beyond the national sphere, good governance \nmeans that there are responsibilities incumbent on all \nworld leaders with regard to the peoples of the United \nNations. The starting point must be respect for \ninternational law and multilateral organizations. For an \nunarmed and peaceful country such as Costa Rica, \nthose are the main instruments for our security, the \nindispensable requirement for living in peace and \nfostering development. \n Last Tuesday we celebrated, with profound \npersonal and national conviction, the International Day \nof Peace, in whose creation our country played a key \nrole. It is significant that, through the initiative of \n  \n \n10-54827 20 \n \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, its theme was \u201cYouth \nfor Peace and Development\u201d. That triad \u2014 youth as \nincentive, peace as a framework, and development as a \ngoal \u2014 is critical to building a better world. But that \ntriad would be truncated without freedom as \nopportunity, human dignity as an inescapable \ncommitment and tolerance as a habit of coexistence.  \n For the countries and leaders committed to those \nfundamental values, the main question is how to \nadvance them in today\u2019s world. I propose to empower \neven further the concepts, organisms and instruments \nfor the promotion and protection of human rights. It is \nin our interest to participate constructively as members \nin the activities of the Human Rights Council. Here \nalso lies our adherence to the main covenants and \nprotocols on the subject, our insistence on the \nresponsibility to protect civilians and our commitment \nto human security. \n Costa Rica, besides hosting the conference that \napproved the American Convention on Human Rights \nin 1969, was the first country to ratify it. Today it is \nhome to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. I \nam convinced that respect for human rights depends to \na great extent upon international justice. Its most recent \nand innovative manifestation, thanks to the Treaty of \nRome, is the International Criminal Court, for which \nwe reaffirm our support after a decade of contributions. \nTo use the weapons of the law actively is another \nunavoidable responsibility of global governance. \n In the area of peace and security, Costa Rica \nadheres to the five points on arms control advocated by \nthe Secretary-General. In particular, we insist on the \nnecessity for starting negotiations for an arms transfer \ntreaty, while at the same time progressing with the \nmodel convention for the prohibition of nuclear \nweapons and completing ratification of the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The \naccumulation and transfer of weapons, especially \nnuclear, chemical and bacteriological weapons, is not \nonly a threat to humanity\u2019s peace and survival; it is \nalso an assault on development. Every soldier who \nenlists, every missile that is activated, every isotope \nenriched for military purposes means fewer schools \nand hospitals, fewer food programmes, fewer roads, \nfewer wireless networks, fewer seeds for farmers and \nfewer good judges to administer justice. \n But peace must go beyond action; it should \nbecome embedded in the minds and imaginations of \nhuman beings. To educate for peace is to vaccinate \nagainst war. Thirty years ago, our country launched, \nand the United Nations supported, a pioneer and \nvisionary institution for this area: the University for \nPeace. Today its contribution reaches every continent \nof the world, and our commitment to it increases day \nby day. For this reason we proudly celebrate its \nanniversary. \n It is a paradox that while many countries waste \nresources on weapons, the international community has \nbeen incapable of dealing effectively with the scourges \nof drug trafficking, organized crime, terrorism, arms \ntrafficking, and the perverted exploitation and \ntrafficking of human beings. My country and Central \nAmerica suffer increasingly from the aggressions of \nthe drug cartels. We risk being virtually taken over by \ntheir gangs, with consequences that will go beyond our \nborders and become a clear threat to international \nsecurity. \n My Government has made its citizens\u2019 security \none of its chief goals. Our people demand it, and we \nwill never fail them. We are fighting crime with energy \nand determination, as well as with full respect for \nhuman rights, intelligent policies and the supremacy of \nlaw.  \n But the great battle against transnational crime \ndemands much more from us all. Today drug-related \nactivity is endangering the improvements in \ndevelopment achieved in Central American countries. \nFrom being merely a transit zone, due to our \ngeographic location between the great drug producers \nto the south and the great consumers to the north, our \ncountries have, to different degrees, been becoming \nproducers, traffickers and consumers of drugs.  \n Today we are free of none of the manifestations \nof the drug trade, which has extended its tentacles into \nmany areas of our social life. Young people in their \nschools and neighbourhoods see their future menaced \nby the easy offer of drugs, our health-care systems are \nalmost overwhelmed by the problem of addiction, the \nintegrity of our institutions is menaced by corruption \nand coercion, and violence is reaching levels never \nseen before. \n The battle against the drug trade can be won only \nwith coordination, global cooperation and a major \nrevision of the strategies pursued so far, many of them \nincomplete or failed. From this rostrum I call on the \ncountries with the highest rates of drug consumption to \n \n \n21 10-54827 \n \ntake more effective action against this enormous \nproblem, and to cooperate with the countries suffering \nfrom a problem we did not create. I also call urgently \nfor global solidarity in this task, and for multilateral \norganizations to increase their activity by developing \nan agenda with more comprehensive strategies, with a \nbetter balance of resources and responsibilities, and \nwith more focused goals. If new and good efforts are \nnot vigorously initiated, we will soon regret our \ninaction. \n If Costa Rica, a middle-income country, has \nachieved human development rates comparable to \nthose of high-income countries, it is because, among \nother things, our social investment has replaced \nmilitary spending. That is why we insist that \ninternational aid should not ignore the ethical \ndimension of development. We support preferential \nallocation of such aid to countries in the most \nprecarious situations. But countries like mine that, \nthanks to good investments and astute political \ndecisions, have improved our conditions of life, should \nbenefit from innovative technical cooperation schemes, \nproductive financing and public-private alliances. \nAbove all, we must successfully complete the Doha \nRound of international trade negotiations, an essential \nengine for economic growth. \n We must also establish peace with the \nenvironment and development. Organizing the \neconomy in a sustainable manner in order to produce \nmaterial and social well-being is a task we cannot \navoid. Today we have high hopes for the next \nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \nin Cancun. We hope that all countries, but in particular \nthe big polluters and generators of carbon emissions, \nwill shoulder their responsibility towards humanity. In \nCosta Rica, we have shouldered ours by setting the \ngoal of becoming one of the first carbon-neutral \ncountries in the world. We are also advancing in the \napplication and development of clean energies and the \nprotection of our watersheds and biodiversity.  \n Let us not forget, however, that sustainability, \nabove all, must be human; hence the importance of the \nMillennium Development Goals. Attaining them in five \nyears\u2019 time is an unavoidable goal for this \nOrganization. \n The challenges of global governance are many, \nand they are overwhelming, but the possibilities to \nconfront them exist. Their promotion is part of our \nresponsibility as leaders. This also requires that the \nUnited Nations improve its own governance. If it does \nnot respond to new realities and if its Member States \ndo not help with the task, the Organization runs the risk \nof sinking into irrelevance. The adaptation of the \nUnited Nations to the challenges of global governance \ndemands greater effectiveness, efficiency and \ntransparency in its administration, its decision-making \nprocesses and its field operations.  \n In this universal Organization, we must also \npreach through example. That is why Costa Rica has \nstrived to collaborate in an active and constructive way \nin the reform process. And, like many other countries, \nwe still need the help of the world. The world needs \nthe help of all countries. That is the only way to \nadvance the causes of our peoples. Costa Rica \nmodestly offers its contribution, its effort and its voice. "

        "file_text": "I \nwish to begin by congratulating you, Sir, on your \nelection as President of the General Assembly. The \nAssembly is the central body of the United Nations \narchitecture. Here, all Member States are truly \nrepresented and each has a vote, irrespective of its size, \npopulation or economic power. Here is where the \ncentral decisions that determine the functioning of the \nother bodies are made. Here, we are all permanent \nmembers, embodying the principle of the sovereign \nequality of all States. \n Here in the General Assembly, Portugal is guided \nby the objective of doing its best to strengthen the \nUnited Nations. There are no true alternatives to the \nOrganization. Its unique role in managing international \nrelations is more evident than ever, and it is our duty to \nfurther enhance this role in order to attain a progressive \nand solid strengthening of the United Nations. I repeat, \nthere are no alternative mechanisms to the United \nNations. For this reason, all Member States should \nwork to reinvigorate the Organization. \n Portugal is guided by the principles of national \nindependence, respect for human rights, equality \namong States, peaceful solutions to conflicts and \ninternational cooperation as the main elements that \ndrive development and the progress of humankind. \nThese principles are all inscribed in the Portuguese \nConstitution. \n These are also the purposes and principles of the \nUnited Nations Charter. Allow me to underline some of \nthem, which today are more important than ever: \nmaintaining international peace and security, the \ndevelopment and progress of all peoples, friendly \nrelations among all nations based on sovereign \nequality, international cooperation in solving \neconomic, cultural and humanitarian crises and the \npromotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. \n The maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity, is surely one of the noblest of our objectives. \nThe Charter defines the way we, the United Nations, \nshould act together to prevent or remove threats to \npeace and how to respond to acts of aggression or other \nviolations of our universal principles. \n Portugal has been an active contributor to United \nNations peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations in \nEurope, Asia, Africa and Oceania. Our efforts have \nalways been global and generous. Tens of thousands of \nPortuguese have participated in peace operations. We \nare now present in places as diverse as Afghanistan, \nSouth Lebanon, Timor-Leste, the Western Balkans, \nChad and the Democratic Republic of Congo. \n We participate in United Nations peacekeeping \noperations and other missions according to our means \nand, quite frequently, above and beyond what our size, \nwould require. Nevertheless, we continue doing it with \nthe firm conviction that collective security calls for \ncollective efforts. Moreover, the United Nations can \ncontinue to count on the Portuguese contribution to this \ncollective endeavour. \n Looking at the present challenges to international \npeace and security, allow me to refer to the situation in \nthe Middle East, a conflict involving many negative \ninfluences in the relations between several peoples and \ncultures. The coming year will be critical to the peace \nprocess. The choice is clear: peace or a return to \ninstability. \n We welcome the return to direct negotiations \naimed at reaching a two-State solution. We all have to \n \n \n25 10-55103 \n \njoin efforts for the creation of an independent, \ndemocratic, contiguous and viable Palestinian State \nliving side by side, in mutual peace and security, with \nthe State of Israel. \n I would also like to mention Afghanistan where \nthe international community has assumed a firm \ncommitment to support reconstruction and \ndevelopment. The results of the Kabul Conference will \nhave to be complemented at the upcoming NATO \nsummit in Lisbon, with a view to ensuring a \nsustainable transition process, mainly led by the \nAfghans themselves. \n International peace and security require effective \nmultilateral action among United Nations bodies. \nEffective multilateralism needs to be based on working \nstructures with which every Member State feels \ncomfortable. The United Nations is indispensable. It \nalone is capable of confronting global threats, it alone \nhas the capacity to respond to acute natural disasters, \nas we have seen in several recent situations, like the \nHaitian earthquake or the Pakistan floods, and it alone \ncan effectively shelter and feed millions of refugees \nworldwide, thanks to the outstanding work of the \nOffice of the High Commissioner for Refugees, led by \nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres, one of the most distinguished \nPortuguese political leaders. \n It is especially urgent to reform the United \nNations and to adapt it to today\u2019s international realities. \nAny reform must be based on the objectives that \ninspired its creation. Its pivotal place at the centre of \nthe international architecture has to be preserved, for \nthe United Nations is the only forum where no one \nfeels excluded, the only body where all States, \nincluding small and medium-sized countries, have their \nown voice and their own say in solving global \nproblems. \n The establishment of the Peacebuilding \nCommission \u2014 an idea put forward by Portugal \u2014 was \na significant step in the reform process. But we also \nhave to look at the Security Council with a view to its \nenlargement. I sincerely believe that we can all succeed \nin reshaping the Council and making it more \nrepresentative, more efficient and more transparent. \n  Mr. Ould Hadrami (Mauritania), Vice-President, \ntook the Chair. \n \n In our view, it is illogical that countries like \nBrazil or India, which have an irreplaceable role in \ntoday\u2019s international economic and political life, are \nstill not permanent members of the Security Council. \n Africa, as well, has to be considered in this \nenlargement of the permanent membership. It is of the \nutmost importance that Africa be fairly treated, given \nthe remarkable political and economic progress we all \nhave witnessed on that vast continent \u2014 continent with \nwhich Portugal feels a permanent affinity. It is only \nnatural that we have been so closely linked to the \nstrengthening of relations between Africa and the \nEurope Union (EU), having hosted the summit in \nLisbon where the Joint Africa-EU Strategy was \ndesigned. We are now looking forward to the third \nAfrica-EU summit. \n The implementation of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) is urgent. Let me \ncongratulate the Secretary-General and the members of \nthe General Assembly on the results achieved at the \nrecent High-level Meeting. We are firmly committed to \napplying the agreed political vision to mobilize efforts \nto meet the targets over the next five years. \n International stability cannot be achieved and \nmaintained without economic and social prosperity \nworldwide. The present economic and financial \nsituation shows that we all benefit from common \nsolutions to global problems. In this context, I call for \na reinforced participation of developing countries and \nregional groupings and communities in ongoing \ndebates, including the reform of the international \nfinancial organizations and their interaction with the \nUnited Nations system. \n Another field where interdependence urges us to \nact jointly is climate change. It is a matter of survival. \nWe shall do our part to ensure that the Canc\u00fan summit \nis a step in the right direction. Portugal has consistently \nworked to reduce its carbon footprint by investing \nsolidly in renewable energy. I am proud to be able to \nannounce that we have already met the target that my \ncountry announced here last year. Portugal is already \nproducing 45 per cent of its electricity from local \nrenewable sources, and by 2020 it intends to reach \n66 per cent. It now holds the fifth place in Europe \u2014 \nand in the world \u2014 in terms of use of renewable \nenergy. It has the largest wind park in Europe \u2014 and \nthe second largest in the world \u2014 and it holds the \nrecord for the highest amount of wind energy \n  \n \n10-55103 26 \n \ngenerated. It has the largest photovoltaic park in the \nworld and is a leader in the area of electric vehicles. \nPortugal is now considered one of the 10 most \npromising countries for energy investment. \n Portugal has been sharing this experience and this \nknowledge with a number of developing countries, and \nwe continue to intensify this cooperation through \nconcrete partnerships and technology transfer and \nknowledge, supporting efforts towards adaptation and \nmitigation, in accordance with the commitments made \nin Copenhagen. Some of our partners are least \ndeveloped countries and small island developing \nStates. They are among those that pollute the least but \nsuffer the most from climate change. It is urgent that \nthe international community take the necessary \nmeasures to reduce their vulnerability. \n This year marks the beginning of the United \nNations Decade for Deserts and the Fight Against \nDesertification. Portugal recognizes the right to water, \nas well as the right to education, adequate housing and \nhealth. Ensuring that every human being has access to \ndrinking water and adequate sanitation is also a good \nway of accelerating the implementation of the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n My country, an independent State for almost \n1,000 years, commemorates this year the centennial of \nthe Portuguese Republic. We are today a democracy \nwith solid credentials in terms of human rights and \ntheir promotion worldwide. We firmly believe in the \nrule of law and have learned through our own \nexperience that peace and prosperity are attainable only \nwhen they are truly and freely shared by all States. \n Portugal is also a country that is accustomed to \nlistening to its partners. We are members of the \nEuropean Union, the Atlantic Alliance, and the \nCommunity of Portuguese-speaking Countries, \ncurrently presided over by Angola, which I \ncongratulate. Portuguese is the fifth most widely \nspoken language in the world and is present on all \ncontinents. Portugal also participates in the Alliance of \nCivilizations, a forum that is at the forefront of the \nmuch-needed intercultural dialogue among regions, \nwhich is ably led by Jorge Sampaio, former President \nof my country. \n Portugal\u2019s action at the United Nations is rooted \nin our capacity for open dialogue with every Member \nState and in our ability to build bridges and forge \nconsensus. We always seek to defend our values \nthrough dialogue, not by imposing our views. Our \nattitude is not driven by any temporary need to please \nsome constituencies. We aspire to be judged by our \nactions. This is our motivation for seeking active \nparticipation in all United Nations bodies for which the \ncomposition is rotational. \n This universal vision of dialogue and openness to \nthe world characterizes our current candidature for a \nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council. \n We belong to the United Nations because we \nstrongly believe in its values, objectives and \nuniversality; because we maintain that mutual respect \nshould be the cornerstone of international action; and \nbecause we think that the strengthening of the United \nNations and its activities is surely one of the most \nnoble and idealistic objectives of all those who, like \nthe Heads of State and Government participating here, \nstrive each and every day to achieve a better world."

        "file_text": "At the outset, may I, on behalf of my delegation, \ncongratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss sincerely and warmly on \nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly \nat this sixty-fifth session. I assure him of our support to \nensure a successful session. May I also extend my deepest \ngratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Ali Treki, who so \neffectively led the work of the sixty-fourth session. I extend \nmy thanks to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for \nhis commitment and resolve in defending the ideals of the \nCharter. \n The sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly is \ntaking place in a difficult international environment, \ncharacterized by multiple crises of all kinds \u2014 \neconomic, financial, food, energy, and so forth. This is \nalso a time when the international community is \nwondering whether it really will be able to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. \nFrom that standpoint, fortunately, the recent High-level \nPlenary Meeting on the MDGs held here gives hope \nthat the commitments made to the poorest populations \nwill be implemented so that the world can take on a \nmore human face and focus on social and economic \nwell-being, particularly of the most disadvantaged. \nHowever, that will be possible only in a healthy and \ncalm environment.  \n We therefore welcome once again the Climate \nChange Conference held in Copenhagen in December \n2009. Even if it was not able to agree on a figure for \nreducing greenhouse gases, it nevertheless pushed \nforward the debate on providing assistance to the most \nvulnerable countries and on measures to reduce \ndeforestation. We only hope that the commitments \nmade, particularly in the financial area, will be \nhonoured, and we ardently hope that the forthcoming \nmeeting in Canc\u00fan will yield a viable environmental \nagreement. Such an agreement is all the more urgent in \nthat flooding and other climate disasters occurring \nthroughout the world with unbridled cruelty remind us \nof the great fragility of the environmental balance.\n Turning to peace and security, conflict resolution \nthroughout the world and particularly in Africa, which \nis most directly concerned, remains a major challenge \nfor the international community. While some crises \nhave been more or less overcome, for example in West \nAfrica, others continue to be a matter of serious \nconcern. In Togo, open, free and transparent elections \nwere able to be held this year to everybody\u2019s \nsatisfaction. Burkina Faso welcomes the ongoing \npolitical openness and appeals to that country\u2019s \npartners to continue providing it with the necessary \nsupport. In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, major progress was made \nwith the effective disarmament of the Forces nouvelles, \nthe publication of the electoral list and the scheduling \nof the first round of presidential elections for 31 \nOctober. We trust in the ability of all the people of \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to overcome the few remaining obstacles \nand to take up the challenge of achieving peace and \nlasting development. In Guinea, we still hope that the \nremaining obstacles that led to the postponement of the \nsecond round of presidential elections will soon be \novercome. We call on all Guinean political actors to act \nin moderation so as to enable their country to open up \nquickly to democracy and to build a prosperous \neconomy for the benefit of all. \n I take this opportunity to convey once again \nBurkina Faso\u2019s gratitude to the United Nations and the \nregional and subregional organizations that put their \n  \n \n10-55276 34 \n \nconfidence in the facilitation and mediation of His \nExcellency Mr. Blaise Compaore, President of Burkina \nFaso, and that continue to support his many efforts for \npeacebuilding, security and the rule of law in West \nAfrica. \n In Darfur, the results of the Doha negotiations are \nencouraging and should persuade the international \ncommunity to use its influence to speed up political \ndialogue and strengthen the operational capacity of the \nAfrican Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in \nDarfur. Burkina Faso is naturally concerned over the \ninsecurity and instability in Somalia, with ongoing \ninsurgent attacks on the Federal Transition Government \nand the African Union Mission in Somalia. We urge the \nSecurity Council and donor countries to fulfil their \ncommitment to supporting the rehabilitation process \nfor the Somali State. The results of our efforts to put an \nend to the reprehensible acts of piracy on the high seas \nwill have no effect or sustainability unless we \neliminate their root causes, including extreme poverty, \nwhich provides the most fertile soil. \n My country is carefully following political \ndevelopments in Madagascar and Niger. We welcome \nthe initiatives taken by the transitional authorities in \nthe two countries to organize free and transparent \nelections that will ensure a return to constitutional \norder. Turning to Western Sahara, we welcome the \nimpetus given to the negotiations by the Secretary-\nGeneral, and we call on the protagonists to pursue \npolitical dialogue with a view to a peaceful and \nrealistic settlement of the dispute.  \n One cannot speak of peace and security in Africa \nwithout mentioning drugs and narcotics trafficking and \ntheir clear link with armed conflicts, the proliferation \nof light weapons, money-laundering, the financing of \norganized transnational crime and terrorism. The need \nto pool our efforts to deal with all this is essential and of \nconcern to every country. The open debate of the Security \nCouncil organized by Burkina Faso on 8 December 2009 \nto address this scourge (see S/PV.6233) was a \ncontribution to that effort. We hope that there will be \nappropriate follow-up so as to keep the international \ncommunity mobilized. \n The Sahelo-Saharan region has for many years \nbeen subject to recurrent terrorist attacks. Collective \nand cooperative efforts must be taken quickly at all \nlevels to ensure peace and security in that part of Africa. \n The situation in the Near and Middle East is \nstrongly marked by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and \nthe Iranian nuclear question. Burkina Faso welcomes \nthe easing of the Gaza blockade and reiterates its call \nfor a total lifting of the embargo. We welcome the \ndirect talks under way between the parties to the \nconflict. A comprehensive and lasting peace is the only \nway to ensure the freedom of the Palestinian people in \nan independent State with secure and recognized \nborders, the security of Israel, and regional stability.  \n On the Iranian nuclear question, Burkina Faso \nhopes that common sense will prevail by reconciling \nIran\u2019s rights to acquire civilian nuclear power and the \nlegitimate fears of the international community over \nmilitary nuclear proliferation. \n United Nations reform has been on our agenda \nfor several years and some progress has been made, \nincluding the adoption on 2 July of resolution 64/289 \non system-wide coherence, which, inter alia, \nestablished UN Women. We trust that other aspects of \nthe reform, particularly of the Security Council, will be \nachieved within a reasonable time frame in order to \ncorrect historic injustices \u2014 particularly vis-\u00e0-vis \nAfrica, which is the only continent not to have a \npermanent seat \u2014 and to create a more democratic \nUnited Nations able to take up the challenges of the \nworld today more effectively. \n We trust that this reform dynamic will promote a \nnew spirit that will open the way to participation by the \nRepublic of China on Taiwan in the activities of \ninternational bodies, particularly the International Civil \nAviation Organization and the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change.  \n Burkina Faso reiterates its faith in multilateralism \nand solidarity among peoples, and to that end we stand \nready to make our modest contribution to building a \nworld of peace and justice.

        "file_text": "Every year we come \ntogether in this great Hall of the United Nations, to \n  \n \n10-55264 32 \n \nreaffirm our commitment to multilateralism. Nations \nbig and small, rich and poor, gather from the four \ncorners of the world here at the United Nations, driven \nby the conviction that, if we work together, we will \nfind solutions to the challenges of today and tomorrow. \nAs these challenges grow and become more \ninterconnected, so grows our conviction that only \nthrough cooperation and dialogue can we resolve them. \nThis is the fundamental belief with which, for 55 years, \nthe Bulgarian delegation, like many others, has come \nto the United Nations. \n Like every day, today will be unique, because our \nactions on this day will forge our tomorrows. We can \nspend our time dwelling on the past, or we can invest \nour time in the future that we will all face together. \nToday, our world faces a complicated web of \nchallenges, but also of opportunities. We face the \nchallenge of addressing global climate change by \ncreating opportunities for sustainable development. We \nface the challenge of reducing the conflicts and \nopportunities that come from providing sufficient clean \nwater to millions of people. We face the challenge of \ndeveloping an ethical market economy and the \ncountless opportunities that will emerge from reducing \nthe poverty gap. We face the challenge of reducing \nethnic conflicts, terrorism and the spread of weapons of \nmass destruction and the opportunities that come from \ngood governance, democracy and freedom. We may \nalso, perhaps, address the most paramount challenge of \nour time: to prove wrong all those who believe that the \nworld is heading towards an irreversible clash of \ncivilizations \u2014 because none of the global challenges \nthat we face today can be understood, tackled or \naddressed without respect for different opinions, \nwithout dialogue between faiths and without adherence \nto the global values enshrined in the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. On behalf of the Government of Bulgaria, I \ncongratulate Mr. Deiss on the assumption of the \npresidency of this Assembly at this sixty-fifth session. \nOur appreciation also goes to Mr. Ali Treki for his \nleadership during the previous session, and to Mr. Ban \nKi-moon for his efforts to strengthen and promote the \nUnited Nations. \nLet me begin by welcoming the results of the \nHigh-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly \non the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \nRegardless of the fact that efforts to achieve the MDGs \nhave not stayed on course, their attainment is still \nwithin our reach. Reaffirming the principle of \nsolidarity between those who have and those who need \nis of the essence. My country faces challenges imposed \nby the global economic and financial crisis. We have, \nhowever, committed ourselves to develop our own \ndonor capacity, and so we shall. We shall do so, \nbecause Bulgaria \u2014 like a number of countries that \nhave joined the European Union (EU) since the fall of \nthe Berlin Wall \u2014 understands that the solidarity that \nwas extended to us now needs to be extended by us to \nthose less fortunate. To be effective, we shall work in \nclose coordination with our partners, avoid duplication \nand aim at addressing the root causes \u2014 not the \nsymptoms \u2014 of today\u2019s problems. Otherwise, we will \nnot be building a better tomorrow. In this effort the role \nof the United Nations will always remain vitally \nimportant, particularly in helping to mitigate the \ndevelopment impact of the crisis on the less developed \nand most vulnerable countries. \n As dangerous as the current global crisis is, it \nalso gives us a chance to green our economies, \nparticularly by putting them on a sustainable and \nlow-carbon path. This year, 2010, has been proclaimed \nas the International Year of Biodiversity. Economic \ngrowth and the preservation of the environment must \ngo hand-in-hand across the globe. Today there can be \nno excuses \u2014 neither in developed countries, nor in \ndeveloping countries \u2014 because any excuse that we \nfind today will cost us more tomorrow. That is why \nBulgaria believes that the United Nations must be \ngiven the tools to respond adequately to the increasing \nchallenges of environmental protection. \n Today, much more so than in the past, we see \nincreased demand and pressure on international \nhumanitarian efforts. The devastating earthquake in \nHaiti last year killed hundreds of thousands and left a \nstaggering 20 per cent of the population homeless. \nHaiti\u2019s call was, however, heeded throughout the globe. \nAllow me to praise the work of the United Nations and \nits agencies in responding quickly, but also pay tribute \nto all of the countries, non governmental organizations \nand individuals who came quickly to Haiti\u2019s assistance. \nThe Bulgarian Government and people were quick to \nrespond by providing financial and in kind assistance, \nincluding educational opportunities to young Haitians \nwhose universities had been destroyed. \n \n \n33 10-55264 \n \n This year we have to help in the struggle of the \n20 million people in Pakistan who have been affected \nby the terrible floods that have wrecked lives, ruined \ncrops and destroyed economic opportunities. The \nSecretary-General and the United Nations were swift to \nreact and deserve praise for their efforts, as does the \nrapid reaction of the European Union, the United \nStates, India and other partners around the world. \nAllow me to use this forum to call on all to strengthen \ntheir efforts in assisting the people of Pakistan. \nHowever, I also call on Governments across the globe \nto help in removing barriers, so as to assist the \nPakistani economy in its recovery. Helping today and \ncreating opportunities tomorrow \u2014 that should be our \ngoal in a country that is vital to global stability and \nsecurity. In this, let me assure you that Bulgaria will \nalso shoulder its share of the needed solidarity. Already \nthe Government and the Bulgarian Red Cross have \nlaunched a nation-wide campaign to raise funds and \ncontribute to the rebuilding efforts in Pakistan. \n No matter how successful we are in our \ndevelopment and humanitarian efforts, the benefits \ncannot fully be borne in an insecure and unstable \nenvironment. Allow me to briefly look closer to home \n\u2014 the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean. The \nEuropean Union was created to make war impossible in \na continent that has seen at least a century of conflicts. \nIn Europe, however, we have unfinished business. \nEurope will not be whole and complete until our \nneighbours in the Balkans join our Union. It falls on \nus \u2014 those who joined the European Union late, not by \ntheir own choice, but because of the ideological \ndivisions of the cold war \u2014 to say it loud and clear: to \nmake war impossible in the Balkans we must see all \ncountries that have emerged from the former \nYugoslavia become part of the European Union. This is \nour historic mission. It is our destiny. \n Bulgaria, which has struggled with its own \ntransition and accession to the European Union, knows \nthe benefits and the challenges best. That is why today \nI am proud to stand here and commend the General \nAssembly for unanimously adopting resolution 64/298, \napproving the joint EU Serbia compromise text on the \nadvisory opinion of the International Court of Justice \non the declaration of independence by Kosovo. \nBulgaria supported it wholeheartedly, because we \nfirmly believe that dialogue between Belgrade and \nPristina is key, both to the stability of the region and to \nthe European perspective of our neighbours. It will be \na difficult process, charged with emotion and scarred \nby history, but it will be a process that can today lay \nthe foundations of a better tomorrow for all. It is a \nprocess that the Bulgarian Government is not just \nwilling, but eager to support, and will lend all \nnecessary assistance to the efforts of the High \nRepresentative of the European Union for Foreign \nAffairs and Security. \n In Bosnia and Herzegovina the international \ncommunity faces many challenges, but the struggle \nbetween the fears of yesterday and the opportunities of \ntomorrow can be resolved today by the people of \nBosnia themselves. Bulgaria will, more actively than \never, contribute to this reconciliation, because we \nbelieve that our role in South-Eastern Europe and \nbeyond is to bring people together, not divide them; to \nseek solutions, not to watch from the sidelines. \n We must constantly reaffirm our commitment to \nbring our neighbours in the Western Balkans into the \nEuropean Union when they meet the criteria for \nmembership. But our neighbours also must reaffirm \ntheir own commitment to undertaking often very \ndifficult reforms and strengthening regional \ncooperation and good-neighbourly relations. \n There are cynics who say that the world cannot \nlive together, that for peace to exist we must build \nwalls of separation between peoples, religions and \nethnic communities; cynics who say that civilizations \nmust clash. I come from a country that is in a turbulent \npart of the world, yet we have managed to prove that \npeople of different religions \u2014 Christians, Muslims \nand Jews, and of different ethnicities \u2014 Bulgarians, \nTurks and Armenians, can live together. \n Bulgaria has seen stellar moments in its history, \nfor example, when civil society rose during the Second \nWorld War and refused to allow its Jewish population \nto be sent to concentration camps, or when it integrated \nits Turkish population after the end of communism. \nBut, it has also seen its dark moments \u2014 when it failed \nto save the Jewish populations of occupied Northern \nGreece and Vardar Macedonia, or when the Communist \nregime expelled a large part of our Muslim citizens to \nTurkey. Our history has taught us to be able to \ndistinguish between good and bad. Our history proves \nthat the cynics are wrong, that people can live together \nin peace. \n That is why Bulgaria cannot remain uninterested \nin the Middle East. We believe that, just as the Jewish \n  \n \n10-55264 34 \n \npeople have a homeland in the State of Israel, so the \nPalestinian people have the right to an independent \nState of Palestine that lives in peace with its \nneighbours. During the past months we have all \nwitnessed the efforts of the United States \nAdministration to restart the direct negotiations \nbetween the Israelis and Palestinians. Many of us have \nmade passionate speeches on the need and urgency of \npeace. Today, the Palestinian and Israeli leaders face \nthe historic challenge of looking to tomorrow and not \nbeing tied down by yesterday. The Middle East cannot \nafford a failed peace process. The world cannot afford \na peace process that does not have a comprehensive \nend goal in sight. \n Today we must all recognize that hard decisions \nare called for and lend our full support to President \nAbbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu to help them \nwalk the hard road to peace. Obstacles should be \novercome and preconditions should be removed. If the \nleaders of Palestine believe that settlement policy is an \nobstacle to peace, the leaders of Israel must refrain \nfrom such activities in order to give peace a chance. If \nthe leaders of Israel believe that no preconditions to a \nfinal settlement should be put in place, then the \nPalestinian leaders must refrain from such actions in \norder to give peace a chance. \n The choice today is not between peace \nnegotiations and economic development, because peace \nand prosperity go hand in hand. No one should feel \nsingled out or left behind, because the enemies of \npeace are many \u2014 those who feel that walls are safer \nthan bridges and those who feel that religions cannot \ncoexist. You can take away a man\u2019s life, but you \nultimately cannot take away his faith or dignity. \n This is why I call on all Members of the United \nNations to stand firmly behind the efforts of the Israeli \nand Palestinian leaders to achieve peace. In doing this, \nwe must recognize the legitimate concerns of both \nsides \u2014 Israel\u2019s security and the viability of a \nPalestinian State. \n In this effort we should not forget the 1.5 million \npeople who live in Gaza \u2014 Palestinians who have the \nright to a better life, just like the children of Sderot \nhave the right to go to school without the threat of \nrockets. We have an obligation to help open up access \nto Gaza without compromising the security of Israel. \nHistory has proven that isolation and deprivation breed \nradicalism, and it is in the interest of peace that more \nopportunities be created. \n Today the world faces other grave security \nchallenges that will shape our tomorrow. We must \nreconfirm our commitment to halting the spread of \nnuclear weapons. This mission is above politics, \ndiplomacy, national ambitions and personal egos. It is \nour universal obligation and a joint commitment that \nwe undertook 40 years ago. Bulgaria believes that \nevery nation must put a strengthened Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) at the \ncentre of its national diplomacy. The uncovering of \nclandestine nuclear networks has brought the spectre of \nnon State actors equipped with weapons of mass \ndestruction closer. We must not allow this to happen. \nAll nations must recognize that the nuclear non \nproliferation regime is undermined if violators are \nallowed to act with impunity. We consider all States \nparties, including the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea, to be bound by their NPT obligations. \n Leaving the NPT cannot be without \nconsequences. Justified concerns, however, remain also \nabout the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic \nof Iran. We call on Iran to deploy the necessary \nconfidence-building measures to provide for greater \ntransparency on its nuclear activities. Bulgaria believes \nthat it is important to find a diplomatic solution. The \nrecent efforts by Turkey and Brazil illustrate that there \nis will in the international community for dialogue. \nTherefore, a swift return to the negotiation table and \nfull compliance with United Nations Security Council \nresolutions, as well as International Atomic Energy \nAgency (IAEA) standards and safeguards is a must. \n International terrorism is one of the most serious \ncontemporary threats to global peace and security. It \ncannot be justified by any political, philosophical, \nideological, racial or ethnic considerations, nor by any \nideology. The end goal of terrorism is to hinder our \nefforts to guarantee human rights, basic freedoms and \ndemocracy. Within the framework of the European \nUnion, Bulgaria has endorsed the implementation of \nthe United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. \nI appeal for a prompt finalization of the negotiations to \nreach a comprehensive convention on counter-\nterrorism. \n An old nefarious practice has re-emerged on the \nhigh seas \u2014 piracy. Bulgaria has been directly affected \nby the escalating activities and audacity of the pirates \n \n \n35 10-55264 \n \nin the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia. The \nfight against piracy leaves much to be desired, \nhowever. We need a firm international legal framework \nfor the trial, detention and imprisonment of persons \nsuspected of having committed acts of piracy. We need \ncoordinated actions on the high seas to protect our \nshipping. Perhaps most of all, we need to address the \nroot causes of piracy \u2014 poverty, isolation and lack of \nopportunity. \n In Afghanistan, we face a threat that demands the \ncontinued military and civilian commitment on the part \nof the international community, which hinges on two \nimportant factors. Firstly, the ability of the Afghan \nGovernment to pave the way for reconciliation, tackle \ncorruption and deliver services to its people and the \nrenewed commitment of the international community \nand regional neighbours to strengthen the Afghan \nNational Security Forces, while maintaining the \npressure on radicals and insurgents and limiting their \nscope of action. \n In these tasks the coordinated efforts of all, but \nforemost of the United Nations, NATO and the \nEuropean Union, are vital. I would like to strongly \nsupport the work of the United Nations Assistance \nMission in Afghanistan and the Special Representative \nof the Secretary-General, Staffan de Mistura, in \nAfghanistan. Their efforts should be appreciated and \nfully supported by the international community. I want \nto also pay tribute to the brave men and women of all \nInternational Security Assistance Force (ISAF) \ncontributing nations, including the roughly 600 \nBulgarian troops, who risk their lives to bring security \nto the people of Afghanistan. \n Bulgaria\u2019s commitment to the future of \nAfghanistan is unfaltering, because we understand that \nit is our joint obligation to bring security to that \ntortured country, whose people deserve to be able to \nenjoy the freedoms and opportunities that many of us \nhave. Bulgaria has increased its input to ISAF, \nincluding through more training units, which will work \nto build the capacity of the Afghan security forces. We \ncontinue to support the European Union Police Mission \nin Afghanistan, which, jointly with NATO\u2019s Training \nMission, plays an important role. We support the \nAfghan Government\u2019s peace and reintegration \nprogramme, in which the key role should be played by \nthe Afghan State. Our commitment to Afghanistan is \nbased on our firm belief that, if we succeed today, we \nwill all live safer tomorrow. \n A comprehensive security system can rest only on \na robust partnership between the United Nations and \nregional organizations. This is why Bulgaria believes \nthat the partnership between the European Union and \nthe United Nations is a strategic one. As the EU High \nRepresentative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, \nCatherine Ashton, put it, \u201cOur commitment to the \nmultilateral system of global governance through the \nUN and other bodies is clear\u201d and we work \u201cwith \nconviction and clarity on the major challenges that face \nus, be they climate change, poverty, conflict or \nterrorism\u201d. \n The transformation of the EU into a legal subject \nof international relations after the entry into force of \nthe Treaty of Lisbon has to be adequately reflected in a \nresolution of the General Assembly regarding the \nrepresentation of the EU at the United Nations. \n In closing, let me briefly touch on the reform of \nthe United Nations. Bulgaria is convinced that if we \nare to effectively tackle the challenges of tomorrow, we \nmust continuously adapt and improve the United \nNations system. Therefore it is imperative that we \ncontinue the course of reforms initiated by the 2005 \nWorld Summit. \n We believe that the reform of the Security \nCouncil is part of a comprehensive agenda for change \nat the United Nations. Bulgaria declares itself in favour \nof an enlargement of the Security Council capable of \ngenerating the largest possible consensus. In that \ncontext, Bulgaria has endorsed the enlargement of the \nCouncil in its two categories \u2014 permanent and non \npermanent members. \n I started by reiterating our firm commitment to \nmultilateralism. The agenda of the United Nations is \nbroad and diverse, and I have attempted, on behalf of \nthe Government of Bulgaria, to briefly touch on just \nsome of the issues that ought to be discussed in this \nforum. \n Our commitment to multilateralism can be \nequalled only by our unfaltering belief that dialogue \nand diplomacy can achieve more than can \nconfrontation and war. More than half a century ago, \nthe United Nations came together and enshrined those \nprinciples as the cornerstones of international law. \nSince then, with varying degrees of success, we have \nattempted to live by them. It is time for us to realize \nthat the global challenges of tomorrow can be tackled \nonly by collective action today. Nothing is impossible, \n  \n \n10-55264 36 \n \nbut only if we work together, discuss, disagree and \nagree, but share a goal \u2014 a peaceful and prosperous \nworld that is safe for all. "

        "file_text": "The nations \nrepresented here know how deeply the world has \nchanged in the six and a half decades since the United \nNations was formed; since the spirit of international \ncitizenship, of peoples and nations combining their \nenergies to solve our shared problems, gave birth to the \nUnited Nations. Today, that spirit is needed more than \never. \n All of us have to respond to a world that is \nprofoundly altered. As a community of nations, we face \nthree profound challenges: a redrawing of the map of \npower, including a big shift in economic power; the \nglobalization of problems, not least terrorism and \nclimate change; and increasingly fluid forms of identity \nand the rapid circulation and potency of new ideas. \nTaken together, these mean that we are in a new world. \nAll three demand matching responses. So we must \nreform and renew our multilateral institutions in line \nwith the changing map of power, strengthen our actions \non international peacebuilding, climate change and \ndevelopment, and promote liberal values and human \nrights to win the conflict of ideas. \n The truth is that in all three of these areas we are \nnot doing anything like as well as we must. The \neffectiveness of multilateral approaches is in question \nin the wake of the financial crisis, the failure of the \nclimate change talks in Copenhagen and the stalling of \nthe Doha Trade Round. And too many nations and \ninternational institutions have been too reticent about \npromoting enlightened human values. We need to inject \nnew life into our institutions and new confidence into \nthe expression of our ideals. \n Turning first to the altered geography of power, it \nis an often-stated fact that the old economic order is \nbeing transformed and that what were once labelled \nemerging economies are now, in many cases, global \neconomic players. The distribution of military power, \ntoo, is altering, so power is being wielded in different \nplaces and in different ways. This power shift requires \nus to reform our international institutions, to reinforce \nthe rule of international law, and to free up \ninternational trade. \n In recent years, our multinational institutions \nhave sometimes struggled to adapt to the new \ncircumstances, so reform is essential. And a good place \nto start is right here at the United Nations. The Security \nCouncil must be reformed to reflect the new geography \nof power. The United Kingdom is clear and \nunambiguous in our support for permanent seats for \nBrazil, India, Germany and Japan, and for African \nrepresentation. Put simply, the United Nations cannot \nspeak for the many if it only hears the voices of the \nfew. We welcome the priority that the President has \npromised to give to the Assembly\u2019s continuing \nnegotiations on this issue. \n Closer cooperation on counter-terrorism is also \nvital, and we welcome the Assembly\u2019s affirmation of \nthe United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. \nWe must stand shoulder to shoulder in the struggle \nagainst terrorism. \n The United Kingdom will always champion the \nUnited Nations. If it did not exist, we would have to \ninvent it. But let us be frank. Without a radical \noverhaul, the United Nations will not provide the \nleadership the world seeks from it and needs from it. It \nis also important that the vital role of the European \nUnion in promoting development and prosperity be \nadequately represented in the Assembly. \n The redrawing of the power map also makes it \neven more important that the writ of international law \nextend across the world. Laws are the solid \nrepresentation of our collective values. That is why it is \nso important that we uphold and reinforce the \ninstruments of international justice, including the \nInternational Criminal Court and specific tribunals, \nsuch as those for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.  \n I strongly welcome the comments of President \nObama yesterday on the vital importance of the Middle \nEast peace process. I can assure the Assembly that the \nUnited Kingdom is committed to helping lead to the \nend of hostilities that have been so profoundly \ndamaging for all sides. \n The prevention of nuclear-weapons proliferation \nis another huge priority for the international \ncommunity. The United Kingdom welcomes the \nsuccess of the Review Conference of the Parties to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \nthis May, and I can assure the Assembly that we will \ncontinue to play our part in making the world safer \nfrom the threat of nuclear weapons. \n I was ready today to welcome the progress made \nin this week\u2019s meeting of the E3+3 group on Iran. I \nwas ready to also straightforwardly reiterate our \n \n \n27 10-54959 \n \nconcerns about Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. But instead, \nonce again, an issue of grave global concern has been \novershadowed by the bizarre, offensive and attention-\ngrabbing pronouncements by President Ahmadinejad \nfrom this rostrum yesterday. His remarks were intended \nto distract attention from Iran\u2019s obligations and to \ngenerate media headlines. They deserve to do neither. \n The reshaped world of power also increases the \nneed to open our borders to free trade. A trading world \nis a safer world. A world trade deal, which is within \nreach, would be worth $170 billion annually to the \nworld economy. Two years ago we were very close, but \nwe failed to seal the deal. We simply cannot afford \nprotectionism. Today, we have to recognize that we \nwill need an even more ambitious deal than we \nenvisaged then if we are to get an agreement. Greater \naccess to markets, particularly for least developed \ncountries\u2019 exports of agriculture, supports growth and \nreduces poverty. \n The second of the three big shifts we have to \nadapt to is the globalization of many of our problems \nand of many of the solutions to those problems. Our \neconomies are, of course, tied ever more closely \ntogether, as recent events have dramatically proven. \nProsperity and poverty in one part of the world impact \non economic activity and security elsewhere. \n Diseases can span the globe in a matter of days. \nTerrorism is conducted by international networks \nacross the world. Environmental threats do not respect \nborders. We are used to thinking about stateless people. \nWe have to get used to the idea of stateless problems, \ntoo. Conflict takes place between, across and within \nnational boundaries, but wherever it takes place it can \nthreaten the interests of all nations. Conflict \nundermines our collective prosperity and destroys \ndevelopment. We must work harder to prevent conflict \nby tackling the sources of violence. And where conflict \ndoes break out, we must be ready to help resolve it.  \n So let me take this opportunity to acknowledge \nthe invaluable contribution of United Nations \npeacekeepers to laying the foundations for sustainable \npeace around the world. We owe them all, and the \nGovernments that provide them, a great debt of \ngratitude. The United Kingdom, along with France and \nother partners, has been at the forefront of supporting \nand encouraging United Nations efforts to deliver more \nstrategic and effective peacekeeping. We will continue \nto provide that support.  \n But peacekeeping alone is not the answer. We \nneed peacebuilding, too. The United Nations is \nuniquely placed not only to keep the peace, but also to \nmake it last. Effective peacebuilding can address the \nunderlying causes of conflict and strengthen local, \nregional and national capacity to contribute to long-\nterm stability in fragile States. \n The coming year will see some significant \nchallenges to the United Nations efforts to promote \ninternational peace, justice and security: in the Sudan, \nwhere we will see a referendum on the future of \nSouthern Sudan, while continuing to look for progress \non justice in Darfur and more widely; in Somalia, \nwhere the African Union peacekeeping mission is \nplaying a brave and crucial role, and where the \nleadership of the United Nations could be decisive; and \nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where much \nprogress has been made but where we have seen again \nin recent weeks how much more remains to be done to \nachieve real security and stability for many of its hard-\npressed people. \n The United Kingdom remains fully committed to \nthe mission to bring peace and prosperity to \nAfghanistan. Afghans are increasingly taking \nresponsibility for their own affairs. This year\u2019s Kabul \nConference and, most recently, parliamentary elections \nhave demonstrated Afghan commitment. Challenges \nremain, but progress is being made. The United \nKingdom will continue to work with its international \npartners to support Afghans to build a better \nAfghanistan. \n The United Kingdom is wholehearted in our \nsupport for international development. Like many \nnations, we are having to take tough action to reduce \nour financial deficits, but we are not budging a \nmillimetre from our commitment to development. We \nare standing by our promise to devote 0.7 per cent of \ngross national income to international development \nassistance from 2013, and we will enshrine this \ncommitment in law. \n When disaster strikes, we must respond quickly \nand generously. Right now, Pakistan faces a \nhumanitarian disaster of unimaginable proportions. As \nthe Secretary-General has said, this is the largest \ndisaster in the 65-year history of the United Nations. \nSo we must ensure that the United Nations appeal is \nproperly funded to cover both humanitarian relief and \nreconstruction, and we must ensure that there is enough \n  \n \n10-54959 28 \n \nsupport over the long term, not least in helping \nPakistan to achieve the levels of economic growth that \nwill allow the country to rebuild itself. I am very \nproud, as the representative of a European Union (EU) \nmember State, that the EU has recently shown real \nleadership in promising to look at improving trade \naccess for Pakistan in response to the disaster. I very \nmuch hope that others can follow suit. \n So, economic power has shifted and problems \nhave globalized, but at the same time the power of \nideas has grown enormously. Identities have become \nmore fluid. It is not possible to put people into neatly \nlabelled national boxes any more. This means that \nwinning the battle of ideas is as important as military \nprowess. \n The work of international institutions must \ncontinue to be guided by the values on which those \ninstitutions were founded: the rule of law, both \ndomestic and international; the right to freedom of \nexpression and belief; democracy; and equality before \nthe law. These values are sometimes described as \nWestern values, but only by people who do not know \ntheir history. Four centuries ago, the great Mughal \nemperor Akbar was legislating for religious freedom \nand equality in what is now India, while in parts of \nEurope heretics were being burned at the stake. The \ntruth is that these liberal values of equality, law and \nself-determination cannot be claimed by any nation or \nhemisphere. They are global values with global force. \nThey are also the values at the heart of the United \nNations Charter. \n We should never apologize for promoting the idea \nthat women and men are equal; never flinch from \ninsisting that Governments chosen by their people are \nbetter; never shy away from our insistence that nobody \nshould be silenced because of their religion or beliefs. \n The United Kingdom will therefore continue to \npush for human rights across the world. Since the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in \n1948, the United Nations has developed a global legal \nframework of human rights standards. We want to see \nthe Human Rights Council do more to ensure that \nStates implement their obligations and use the 2011 \nreview to improve the Council\u2019s ability to respond \neffectively to situations of concern, such as the \noutrageous abuse of democracy and human rights in \nBurma. \n United Kingdom foreign policy will be shaped by \nthe three big challenges I have set out today: a power \nshift, the globalization of problems, and the rapid \ncirculation and potency of ideas. The United Kingdom \nGovernment will fearlessly promote our ideals and \ninterests while remaining realistic in our approach. \n This is the spirit in which the United Kingdom \nGovernment is conducting a root-and-branch review of \nour own strategic defence and security policy. Our last \nreview took place in 1998, but the world has changed, \nalong with the character of the threats we face. This is \nnot to say that we did not face grave threats before, but \nthey were more fixed, more visible and more \npredictable. Today, the threats to our security are not \nrooted in specific States. They are more fluid and often \nless visible: terrorism, organized crime, or attacks from \ncyberspace. We must judge our security not by our \nability to deal with what we know, but how able we are \nto respond to unpredictable threats. \n The United Kingdom will also show leadership \nby example. As fierce advocates of the international \nrule of law, we will practice what we preach. No nation \ncan insist on the law and then act as though it is above \nit. But our approach will also be hard-headed and \nrealistic. In recent years we have learned \u2014 in same \ncases the hard way \u2014 that democracy cannot be \ncreated by diktat. Freedom cannot be commanded into \nexistence. \n The new coalition Government, now five-months \nold, will restore Britain\u2019s international reputation by \npursuing a hard-headed foreign policy based on liberal \nvalues.  \n The world has changed, but the values that should \nguide us have not. We have to renew our international \ninstitutions in line with the new realities of world \npower and influence, and fearlessly project the ideals \nof democracy, equality and freedom. Great things are \ndemanded of us. Great things are necessary from us. It \nfalls to our generation of leaders to meet these \nchallenges together."

        "file_text": "First, I congratulate \nMr. Joseph Deiss on his election to preside over the \nAssembly at this sixty-fifth session. I am convinced \nthat our work will be crowned with success thanks to \nhis proven competence and experience. \n To the former President, Mr. Ali Treki, I express \nmy recognition of the wise manner in which he \nconducted the Assembly\u2019s work during its sixty-fourth \nsession. \n My compliments also go to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and the entire United \nNations team, the women and men who, on our behalf \n \n \n15 10-55103 \n \nand on behalf of the nations and peoples of the world, \nwork throughout the four corners of the planet to \npreserve human dignity, in which are expressed the \nvalues of peace and security, resulting in the \ndevelopment of friendly relations among nations and in \ninternational cooperation. To them all I express our \nrespect and admiration for their courage and \nselflessness. \n Similarly, I congratulate the Assembly on the \nrecent adoption of resolution 65/1, on the achievement \nof the Millennium Development Goals, 10 years after \ntheir adoption. This important document will certainly \ncreate a new climate for the achievement of the eight \nGoals by 2015. \n My compliments to all those present are also \nextended on behalf of the people of my country, which \njust yesterday, 24 September, celebrated its thirty-\nseventh year as a sovereign, independent State. The \ncountry has undergone a series of transformations, but \nwe must recognize that there remains much to be \ndesired in terms of meeting legitimate aspirations for \nsocial and economic progress. Such progress would \ntranslate into improved quality of life and well-being \nfor our combatant people, on whose behalf Am\u00edlcar \nCabral spoke from this rostrum more than 40 years \nago, in an historic statement in the fight against \ncolonial domination. \n Thus at the present session, when the peoples of \nthe world meet to evaluate the fulfilment of the \nMillennium Development Goals and to define new \nstrategies to achieve them by 2015, Guinea-Bissau is \nstill dealing with essential, basic factors for the \nachievement of goals that are so fair and that everyone \ndeserves: stability, peace and security. \n Less than a year ago we dealt with tragic events \nthat had a major impact on Guinea-Bissau\u2019s internal \nand external image and led to early presidential \nelections, which exactly a year and seven days ago \nresulted in my starting to guide the country\u2019s destiny. \nThe heinous acts to which I refer were unanimously \ncondemned. The international community supported \nthe country in its efforts to prepare and hold elections \nwhich ultimately were considered to be free, fair and \ntransparent, and at the same time to consolidate peace \nand internal security, particularly with reforms of \npublic administration, of defence and security and of \njudicial power, and with support for the State budget. \n There was a positive trend in projecting the \nimage of the country and dealing with new challenges: \nthe promotion of internal and institutional dialogue; the \nmobilization of development partners; the organization \nof a high-level meeting in New York; and the \npreparation of a planned donors\u2019 round table, scheduled \nto be held before the end of this year, to discuss the \ndevelopment of Guinea-Bissau. \n Unfortunately, that trend contrasted with the \nincident of 1 April this year, which of course was to be \ncondemned. The handling of the incident and its \nconsequences did not receive the understanding of all \nthe partners of Guinea-Bissau, despite the country\u2019s \nauthority having been maintained with a dynamic \nharmonization at the local, bilateral, regional and \ninternational levels. In this world body, let me appeal \nto all our partners to proceed in the same spirit of \nfriendship, solidarity, assistance and cooperation with \nour people and their democratically elected \ninstitutions, because it is now, in our current \ncircumstances, that our country most needs such \nsupport. \n The reform that we desire in our defence and \nsecurity sector, for which we have sought international \nassistance, has become a matter of prime urgency and \nextreme sensitivity. The main target is the very men \nand women who 40 years ago bartered their youth and \neducation \u2014 in other words, their future \u2014 for our \nnational liberation: the same armed forces who were \nthen so applauded and admired for their determination \nand courage in forging the freedom and independence \nof the peoples of Guinea and Cape Verde, as well as for \ntheir intervention in other theatres of war, following \ntheir international vocation. Today, an appropriate \nstructure to attend to their basic needs is lacking, \nresulting in an erosion of dignity already won, and thus \nin a threat to the peace, stability and well-being of our \npeople. \n Another consideration is that Guinea-Bissau has \nan insular platform comprising more than 80 islands \nand reefs, where a confluence of favourable waters and \nwinds creates an ideal microclimate for much of the \nworld\u2019s fauna, in what could and should be a true \nparadise. Instead, due to an assumed inability of the \nauthorities to exercise effective control, there is a risk \nthat it may become a sanctuary of evil-doers who use \nand abuse the space and the local people, leading to a \nregrettable situation, giving us a terrible reputation and \n  \n \n10-55103 16 \n \npotentially compromising the proper functioning of \nGovernment institutions. \n The Assembly may find those facts frightening \nand deserving of condemnation. They are tragic and \ncompletely alien to the people of my country. A \ncoordinated regional and global response is needed in \norder to take advantage of all the synergies that can be \nmobilized. \n However, to this body of nations, of which we are \nproud to be an integral part, we bring more than a \nlament in the hope of an appropriate response not only \ncommensurate with the problems but at the level of the \ncapacity that mankind has already demonstrated. We \nare making our contribution as a people that is \nconfident, mobilized and determined, a people proud of \nits past and determined to reverse the current situation. \nWe bring a guarantee of multifaceted involvement in \nharmonizing an extensive internal dialogue, whose \nfoundations we have just laid jointly with the Guinean \nparliament: an initiative on ways to consolidate peace \nand development. This will culminate with a \nconference on national reconciliation, to restore the \npromise of a positive and lasting commitment. \n Despite the current serious situation, for which \nwe take full responsibility, we have never confused our \ninternal problems with those of our friends, and we \ntake great pride in our present stable relations with our \nneighbours. Similarly, we are proud of the peaceful \nspirit of our people, who never blame others for our \nown problems and do not feel any animosity towards \nthe thousands of world citizens who continue to choose \nour country as a place in which to settle. \n During the period of instability we have \nnonetheless preserved some 15 per cent of our territory \nas a protected area and nature reserve, as has been \nhighlighted in particular by international organizations \nsuch as UNESCO, the International Union for \nConservation of Nature and others. That is a major \ncontribution to meeting the universal concern for the \npreservation of biological and ecological balance in \nthis International Year of Biodiversity, within the \ncontext of severe climate change that affects us all. \n So, we call urgently for the solidarity and support \nthat Member States can give my people. We appreciate \nand express the warmest gratitude for the attention we \nhave received from our regional organization, the \nEconomic Community of West African States \n(ECOWAS), headed by Nigeria, in the form not only of \nstabilization initiatives, but also of concrete support for \nGovernment programmes. We similarly salute the \nfollow-up and attention provided by the Community of \nPortuguese-speaking Countries, which shows a spirit of \ndetermination at the bilateral and multilateral levels, as \nevidenced by the restoration of a climate of trust \nconducive to peace, stability and development. \n Within the same framework, we salute the \ncontribution of Portugal and Brazil, again at both the \nbilateral and multilateral levels, to keeping the world\u2019s \nattention focused on giving Guinea-Bissau another \nchance. This extends to various other countries and \ninstitutions that maintain with us a relationship based \non partnership and cooperation. I think particularly of \nSenegal, Libya, China, Cuba, the United States, \nFrance, Algeria, Morocco and South Africa, among \nothers, as well as ECOWAS, the African Union and the \nEuropean Union, along with the United Nations itself, \nthrough the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding \nOffice in Guinea-Bissau. \n The unstable internal socio-political environment \nthat I have outlined has a negative impact on \nmanagement of my country\u2019s public finances, despite \nthe Executive\u2019s great and broadly acknowledged \nefforts. This means that our financial situation is very \ndifficult, despite some recovery in our growth rate, \nwhich stood at 2.7 per cent in 2007 and 3.5 per cent in \n2008. \n The international crisis of 2009 had a small direct \nimpact, and the country registered growth of 3 per cent \nthanks to a good agricultural year. The increase in \ninternational basic commodity prices in 2008 \naccelerated inflation, which reached an annual average \nof 10.4 per cent, though it retreated in 2009. The good \nperformance in 2008-2009 in the export of cashew \nnuts, representing 90 per cent of exports, led to an \nimprovement in the balance of payments, including \ndonations. \n However, the external debt burden continued to \nbe unsustainable. At the end of 2009 it was equivalent \nto 126 per cent of the corrected gross domestic product \nand 640 per cent of exports of goods and services. The \nfact that we were unable to complete the Heavily \nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative resulted in \nan accumulation of delays in paying the external debt. \n In 2008 the Government concluded with the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) a post-conflict \nprogramme, later extended to 2009, which successive \n \n \n17 10-55103 \n \nIMF missions evaluated as being broadly satisfactory. \nHence, on 7 May this year the IMF Executive Board \napproved a three-year agreement with my country \nbased on a credit facility which will cover the period \n2010-2012. \n The public administration of Guinea-Bissau has \nearned a very positive evaluation by the IMF and the \nWorld Bank, which reflects the extraordinary effort in \nfulfilling the programmatic targets set with regard to \ncleaning up public finances and regularizing major \nexpenses. Therefore, it is essential that partners show \nno hesitation that might jeopardize the fulfilment of the \ndecision-point requirements of the HIPC Initiative. \n We are coming to the end of the first decade of \nthe millennium, which had been declared a decade of \nglobalization, with the promotion of a lasting peace \nand aimed at a new international order. We cannot slide \nbackwards, nor can we show weakness in the face of \nthe challenge that we have set ourselves in addressing \nproblems such as migration, human trafficking and the \ntrafficking of organs and trying to find ethically \nacceptable responses to them. \n We support the efforts being made to resolve the \nconflicts in the Middle East, through coexistence of a \nPalestinian State with the State of Israel. Our \nmembership of the Alliance of Civilizations and of the \nCommunity of Democracies in particular is based on \nthe rules of peaceful coexistence among ethnicities and \nreligions, and on the promotion of human rights. \n We support global efforts to rehabilitate Haiti and \nwe also follow with great attention and interest the \nprocess that will lead to the restructuring of the \nSecurity Council. We hope that this will result in a \nmore equitable representation of the world and be a \nfactor in the ascent of the African continent towards \npeace, democracy and development."

        "file_text": "Allow me to convey the \ngreetings of the Filipino people to the President of the \nGeneral Assembly and the representatives gathered \nhere for the sixty-fifth session of the Assembly. \n The United Nations was founded on the belief \nthat in collective action lies collective security. It is \nwhen nations reach across their borders that the \nimmense problems of our age begin to be manageable. \nIn a world that has become increasingly globalized, the \nchallenges that we face have become globalized as \nwell. Climate change; pandemics; terrorism and \nweapons of mass destruction; transnational organized \ncrime such as human trafficking and the illicit drug \ntrade; the continuing vulnerability of migrants, women, \npersons with disabilities and the poor; and the \nchallenges posed by increasingly interconnected \neconomies \u2014 all call for a further strengthening of \ninternational cooperation. \n All of us here, representing our respective \nnations, are stewards entrusted with the well-being of \nour respective peoples. We are also required to be \nresponsible and responsive members of the community \nof nations. Clearly, we are already aware that the \nproblem of one poses a problem for all. Any solution, \nthen, depends on us recognizing that each one of our \nnations exists, not in a vacuum, but rather in an \nincreasingly interdependent global milieu. \n The central revelation here is that for humanity to \nprogress, all nations must progress as one. The quest \nfor universal human dignity should not be defined by \ngeographical, racial or cultural boundaries, nor should \nit be set back by our desires to move our own nations \nforward. Global progress means equitable progress. \nThe industrialized nations of the world can look with \npride on the living standards their peoples enjoy. But, \nas one of my distinguished predecessors once said: \n\u201cThose who have less in life should have more in law\u201d.  \n This basic principle of social justice is also the \nmost basic humanitarian challenge of our times. The \nwealth of nations must become an instrument to move \nthe world further along the straight and righteous path \nof compassion and communal responsibility. The \nmessage is clear: there are those who need help, and \nacting with compassion towards those who need help is \na response that is both humane and necessary. This idea \nhas been trumpeted for decades, and yet combating \ninequality remains one of the greatest challenges of our \ntimes. The chasm between the powerful and the \npowerless, the haves and the have-nots remains to be \nbridged. The past century has demonstrated, in terms \nso stark that it inspired the creation of this \nOrganization, that when the mighty clash, those who \nhave less end up trampled. This is true where conflict \nexists and true where markets exist; true in our nation \nand true in an international context.  \n The concept of vulnerability and inequality is all \ntoo clear in the global effort to address climate change. \nThose who stand to lose much, if not everything, from \nthe effects of man-induced climatic conditions are \nthose who did little to cause it. There is an enormous \nneed to ensure, as a matter of justice, that countries, \nparticularly those that are vulnerable, are assisted in \ntheir adaptation and disaster risk-reduction efforts and \nare provided the necessary resources to build climate-\nresilient communities. This should go hand in hand \nwith ambitious commitments by major economies to \nsignificantly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. \n Many of you may say that you have already given \nmightily of your resources. But surely we do not need \nflood and famine to remind us that there is so much \nmore that must be given, because there are so many \nmore who deserve the hope of a better life. \n The most immediate focus of cooperation \ndemanded of us today is to collectively ensure that the \neight Millennium Development Goals will be achieved \nby all in the remaining five years. That is a daunting \ntask, and we are all aware that national resolve has to \nbe complemented by bilateral, regional and multilateral \ncooperation. \n Rising to the challenges of our era requires, \nwithin each of our countries, a strengthened regulatory \nsystem. This does not mean a cumbersome, intrusive \nGovernment, but rather a Government that allows \nprivate enterprise to thrive, while ensuring that it \nremains cognizant of its social responsibilities and \nempowers it, in turn, to fulfil those responsibilities. \nMany Governments are tackling this challenge, \nincluding the Government of the Philippines. Our \nAdministration pledges to channel any gains we reap \n \n \n27 10-54965 \n \nfrom public-private partnerships into social services, \nlike those in health, education and poverty alleviation. \n Across boundaries, the battle against inequality \nrequires a balanced approach from those in authority. \nWe should be conscious of our responsibilities to our \nown people and of our duties to regions and the globe. \nAlready we are witnessing a rethinking of traditional \nparadigms, a shifting of our focus towards ensuring \nthat the global system does not leave anyone behind. \n And while my nation continues to benefit from \nthe compassion of those who are able to help, this does \nnot mean that we or our friends in the developing \nworld will be entirely dependent on the largesse of the \ndeveloped world. We will not be passive players in our \nquest for development. My nation remains active in the \nGroup of 77 and in other efforts aimed at enhancing \nSouth-South cooperation and articulating and \npromoting our collective economic interests. \n This is what our people put us in power for. This \nis what the world expects of us as leaders \u2014 to be \nexemplars of what it is to be compassionate human \nbeings and vanguards of hope for our common \nhumanity. For is not this hope also the hope that unites \nus as human beings? It is the same hope that allows us \nto break down walls of mistrust, which may take the \nform of intolerance, fear or violence. It is the same \nhope that leads us to gather in this Hall as our \npredecessors did. It is the same hope that will give our \ngeneration of leaders the strength to elevate this global \nAssembly to a place where, collectively, the nations of \nthe world are able to find ways to make a better life \npossible for all. \n There have been many times in our history when \nmy people have shown that, united, nothing is \nimpossible. We call it \u201cpeople power\u201d. It is my earnest \nhope and in the greatest interests of humanity that we \nharness the energies of dialogue, solidarity and \ncommunal responsibility so that a global \u201cpeople \npower\u201d towards equitable progress may be achieved."

        "file_text": "I wish you success during \nyour presidency, Sir. \n This year began with a tragic earthquake in Haiti \nthat took the lives of more than 200,000 people, \nincluding United Nations staff and peacekeepers. \nUnfortunately, several months later, Pakistan was \naffected by floods with catastrophic effects. I would \nlike to pay tribute to those women and men who lost \ntheir lives while working for the United Nations. I \nwould also like to salute those who provided assistance \nto the victims. Those dramatic and very painful events \nhighlighted the essential role that the United Nations is \ncapable of playing in our lives and the extraordinary \nperformance of an Organization that many seem to take \nfor granted. \n The universal character of the United Nations \nenables Member States to carry out activities and \nachieve agreed goals, regardless of their form of \nGovernment or culture. One cannot underestimate the \ncontribution of the United Nations to peacekeeping and \npeacebuilding, its role in the promotion of the rule of \nlaw and human rights, or its contribution to the \ncodification of international law. \n Poland has always been a firm and reliable \nsupporter of the United Nations. Effective \nmultilateralism is an objective reflected in the policies \nof my Government and a guiding principle of the \nEuropean Union (EU). We note both the heightened \nexpectations and the criticism with respect to the \nUnited Nations and other international organizations. \nWe are therefore raising the issue of reform, as we \nwant the United Nations to be more efficient and better \nadapted to the new global environment. If it fails to \nmeet the hopes and expectations of its Members, it will \nsuffer marginalization, which might negatively affect \nmultilateralism, as well as certainty and predictability \nin international relations. \n Poland has been participating in the ongoing \nprocess of reflection on the accommodation of the \nUnited Nations to contemporary and foreseeable risks \nand challenges. In our opinion, the United Nations \nshould improve its ability to cooperate with other \ninstitutions and organizations, particularly on a \nregional basis. \n Poland supports efforts aimed at reforming the \nSecurity Council, an organ tasked with preserving \npeace and security. We need to take into account \nchanges in the international system brought about after \nthe end of the cold war and, at the same time, preserve \nthe Council\u2019s cohesion and the feasibility of its \ndecision-making process. We favour an additional  \nnon-permanent seat for the Eastern European group. \nWe also find interesting and worth discussing the idea \nof EU representation. In general, we attach much \n \n \n17 10-55408 \n \nimportance to the role of the EU in the United Nations \nsystem. That is why we would encourage non-EU \nMember States to support our efforts to ensure a proper \nplace for the EU, an observer in the General Assembly, \nin the form of a resolution. \n We attach great importance to the enhancement of \nthe credibility of United Nations action in the field of \ndemocracy and human rights. Let me remind the \nAssembly of the successful meeting of the Community \nof Democracies in Krakow in July 2010. Poland is \nconvinced that promoting universal respect for human \nrights throughout the world contributes to security and \nto social and economic progress. \n In this respect, we applaud the establishment of \nthe new consolidated gender entity of the United \nNations, UN Women. We also believe that the review \nand reform of the Human Rights Council, of which we \nare a member, will strengthen the effectiveness of that \nbody. \n Our planet is exposed to an increasing number of \nexistential threats. Experience shows that no country \ncan solve the world\u2019s problems alone. A global \nresponse is therefore necessary to meeting global \nchallenges. The United Nations has the capacity to \njustify and, in many instances, generate such a \nresponse. We expect excellence as a standard feature of \nthe United Nations. In the final analysis, it is only with \nthe consent and support of its Member States that the \nUnited Nations can deliver such excellence. \n The latest world economic crisis demonstrated \nthe need for globally coordinated economic and \nfinancial policies. These are currently being debated by \nthe General Assembly\u2019s Second Committee and by the \nspecialized agencies and United Nations-related \norganizations, such as the International Monetary Fund \nand the World Bank. Poland expects the United \nNations to be the key forum for multilateral debate on \nthe issues pertaining to the crisis. We hope that the \ncurrent crisis will not hinder United Nations Member \nStates from achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). \n Various political, economic, social and \nenvironmental problems are making States increasingly \nopen to deepened cooperation. The complicated nature \nof new challenges demands sophisticated expertise and \nthe integration of efforts. The United Nations \nsafeguards both. Poland deems the United Nations to \nbe an appropriate body to address the global issues of \nsecurity and economy. \n Peace and security are a fundamental issue. Our \ngoal is a world without nuclear weapons and other \narms of mass destruction; a world without terrorism; \nand a world capable of diffusing the threats of war and \nconflict. The United Nations should strengthen its \ninvolvement in meeting these objectives, anticipate and \nprevent conflicts, where possible, and develop the \ncapacity to resolve them effectively once they break \nout. \n The engagement of the United Nations in \npeacekeeping operations continues to produce visible \nand desirable effects, especially in its political and \nhumanitarian dimensions. The experience we have \ngained from the increased engagement of recent years \nallows us to better understand its complexity and \nlimitations and the challenges ahead. We believe that \npeacekeeping reform must continue. We support efforts \nthat will bring new quality to peacekeeping, and in this \nregard we are committed to working towards achieving \na wider consensus on its strategic aspects through a \nrenewed partnership among all stakeholders. \n This year will, we hope, be associated with major \nprogress in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation. \nThe success of the Review Conference of the Parties to \nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons (NPT) proved that a consensus is possible in \nthis specific area of international cooperation. Efficient \nand practical implementation of the outcome of the \nNPT Review Conference remains a crucial task. We are \nconvinced that the initiative launched recently by \nAustralia and Japan, which involves the participation \nof Poland and 10 other countries, will contribute to this \ngoal. \n We perceive the NPT Review Conference, the \nNew START treaty and the Nuclear Security Summit as \nsignificant steps forward, but regard the \nimplementation of their decisions as a challenge. \n Among issues related to nuclear disarmament, \nthere is one that clearly stands out: the status of  \nsub-strategic nuclear weapons, the reduction and \nelimination of which have not yet been covered by any \nlegally binding international instrument. A world \nwithout nuclear weapons cannot be achieved if this \nchallenge is not dealt with. \n  \n \n10-55408 18 \n \n The Conference on Disarmament requires our \nspecial attention. We applaud the efforts of the \nSecretary-General, who convened a few days ago a \nspecial summit devoted to disarmament. Poland \nattaches considerable importance to that body and calls \non all States to redouble their efforts to invigorate the \nConference as a platform for multilateral disarmament \nand non-proliferation negotiations. \n The impact of the economic and financial crises \ncontinues to affect most countries. The scarcity of \nhigh-quality jobs has become an issue of primary \nimportance. Efforts are necessary to mobilize resources \nand provide opportunities for the benefit of the most \nvulnerable segments of society. Satisfying basic needs \nis once again at the forefront of global concerns. \n The energy sector has become an area of major \nattention. Costs, security of supplies and reducing \npollution are some of the sensitive issues. We face the \nchallenge of making clean energy not only a social \npreference but also a market choice.  \n We need a shift in our thinking about the North-\nSouth dichotomy in order to allow the international \ncommunity to move effectively forward. Allowing \nourselves to be defined by our differences is a recipe \nfor disaster. It is therefore important to focus on \ncommon elements and on the diversity of conditions \nand situations of States and to move away from a \nclaims mentality. \n The pace of market globalization exceeds the \ncapacity of many Governments to ensure global \neconomic stability. The growing interdependence of \nnational economies increases the risk of the \ntransmission of destabilizing shocks between countries. \nEconomic activities within the United Nations are \ntoday scattered among many institutions. This often \nleads to overlapping powers between them. The role of \nthe United Nations might be to coordinate the \nobjectives and ensure coherence between the activities \nof major international organizations, to provide the \nnecessary political leadership and long-term strategic \npolicy framework, and to promote stable and \nsustainable development. \n The High-level Plenary Meeting on the MDGs \nthat ended on 22 September reconfirmed the \nimportance of development cooperation and restated \nthe commitment of the international community to \nattaining the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. \nThe Meeting recognized the crucial role of the United \nNations and the United Nations system in the field of \ndevelopment cooperation and commended their \ncontinued engagement and efforts. \n Poland reiterates its support for implementing the \nMDGs. They constitute a primary point of reference for \nour programme of foreign assistance. We are also \nbound by the provisions of the Paris Declaration and \nthe principle of aid effectiveness expressed therein. We \nstrongly support coordination among all development \npartners. \n Our official development assistance is oriented to \nserve the pro-growth policies of our partners. The \nmobilization of domestic resources, foreign direct \ninvestment and good economic policy are the basic \ndrivers of development. Development policies should \ntherefore be implemented in accordance with the \nprinciples of sustainable development and good \ngovernance. We welcome the progress on the MDGs, \nwhich is largely a result of continued efforts by \ndeveloping countries. With regard to development \nassistance, it is extremely important that the principles \nof national ownership and leadership, as well as of \nmutual accountability, be strengthened and fully \nrespected. Poland is actively involved in promoting \nglobal development cooperation.  \n We are committed to United Nations activities in \nthe field of poverty reduction and the promotion of \nsustainable development. We note with satisfaction the \npositive results of the One United Nations reform and \nthe increased efficiency of assistance provided by the \nUnited Nations. We support the activities conducted by \nthe agencies of the United Nations agencies, in both \nthe development and the humanitarian fields. \n Poland expects an ambitious, forward-looking \nand action-oriented outcome of the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development in 2012. We \nlook forward to attaining all the principal aims of the \nConference, which should also bridge the trust gap \nbetween developed and developing countries evident in \nthe climate change negotiations. Its outcome should be \na focused political document, universal in nature, \naimed at identifying concrete actions for all countries. \nIt should be linked to the MDGs, taking into account \nthe specific needs of developing countries. We call for \na redoubling of the efforts to ensure that institutions \ninvolved in implementing the sustainable development \nagenda become more effective and efficient through \n \n \n19 10-55408 \n \nimproved synergies and the provision of adequate \nresources. \n Poland, which played host to the fourteenth \nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \n(UNFCCC) and the fourth meeting of the Parties to the \nKyoto Protocol, will continue its efforts aimed at \nbuilding international consensus on a comprehensive \nglobal post-2012 agreement. The role of the United \nNations system is essential to maintaining an effective \nand efficient response to challenges posed by climate \nchange. \n In this regard, we would like to thank the \nSecretary-General for putting climate change at the top \nof the agenda of the United Nations system and for his \nnumerous efforts to address the negative impact of \nsuch change. Climate change is a global challenge that \ncan be addressed effectively only through a global \neffort within the UNFCCC framework. \n Poland believes that the international community \nshould continue to focus its attention on improved and \nenhanced implementation and monitoring of the three \nRio Conventions, developing synergies among them, \nand on increasing the efficiency and coherence of the \nUnited Nations system. The consultative process \ninaugurated at the eleventh special session of the \nGoverning Council of the United Nations Environment \nProgramme on the reform of the international \nenvironmental governance system was an important \ncontribution to the debate on environmental \ngovernance in the context of the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development. While being \nrealistic and pragmatic, we should also be ambitious. \n In conclusion, I wish to say a few words about \nsolidarity. It is necessary to understand the relevance of \ninternational solidarity, working closely together, \nbuilding new coalitions and bridging old divides to \narrive at common objectives. Our common future is at \nstake. There is no guarantee of success, but surely we \nrisk failure if we do not take action. New partnerships, \nbuilding confidence in policy objectives, and positive \nengagement among partners are the necessary \nelements. "

        "file_text": "I have great pleasure in \ncongratulating His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-fifth session. I also take this opportunity to \nextend our appreciation to the President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session, His Excellency \n  \n \n10-54827 22 \n \nMr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, for his effective stewardship \nof the General Assembly. \n That the United Nations is now in its sixty-fifth \nyear serves to underline the durability of this \nOrganization. It is an important mechanism in ensuring \ncooperation between States and a forum for discussion \nbetween sovereign nations. We must never \nunderestimate the importance of this Organization, \nbased as it is on the principle of equal treatment of \ncountries big and small. \n It is in this spirit that I address the Assembly at a \ncrucial juncture in the history of my own country. In \ntwo months, I will be assuming office for my second \nterm. My mandate will be very different from my last \none. For my second term as President, my promise to \nmy people is to deliver sustainable peace and \nprosperity to all and to ensure that terrorism will not be \nable to raise its ugly head again. \n In 2005, I was elected by my people on a promise \nto rid my country of the menace of terrorism. I say that \nSri Lanka is now at peace: peace that was only a dream \na few years ago. Over the past year, much has been \nreported and much has been said regarding my \ncountry\u2019s liberation from terrorism. However, far less \nhas been said of the suffering we had to undergo and \nthe true nature of the enemy we have overcome. \n The rapidly forgotten truth is that we had to face \none of the most brutal, highly organized, well funded \nand most effective of terrorist organizations, one that \ncould even spread its tentacles to other countries. Many \nof the atrocities of terrorism that the West has come to \nexperience in recent times, the people of Sri Lanka \nwere themselves the victims of for nearly 30 years, \nlosing almost 100,000 lives, among them a President of \nSri Lanka, a visionary leader of India and scores of \nintellectuals and politicians. The Liberation Tigers of \nTamil Eelam (LTTE) was an organization so brutal that \neven those it claimed to represent, the Tamil \ncommunity of Sri Lanka, were as much victims of its \nterror as the rest of the population of our country. \nThose who observed from afar and suggested that the \nSri Lankan Government should have conceded to the \ndemands of the terrorists need to be reminded that \nterror is terror, whatever mask it wears and however it \nis packaged. To all those, I say this: My responsibility \nis to the entire nation. My responsibility is to the lives \nof millions of men, women and children, and those yet \nto be born. My responsibility is to the peace and \nprosperity of the nation and the right to a peaceful life \nfor all who live there. \n In this context, it is worth examining the capacity \nof current international humanitarian law to meet \ncontemporary needs. It must be remembered that such \nlaw evolved essentially in response to conflicts waged \nby the forces of legally constituted States, and not \nterrorist groups. The asymmetrical nature of conflicts \ninitiated by non-State actors gives rise to serious \nproblems which need to be considered in earnest by the \ninternational community. \n As we close a sad chapter in our country\u2019s \nhistory, I would like to remind the Assembly that we, \nalong with many others, made repeated attempts to \nengage the LTTE in constructive dialogue. I still \nbelieve that dialogue is the best way to resolve any \nconflict. It is much to be regretted that all these \nattempts were rejected with reckless arrogance and \ncontempt. It was in those circumstances that we were \ncompelled to mount a humanitarian operation, with the \nblessing of many international friends, to neutralize \nacts of terrorism and restore peace and security. \n The entire focus of our nation is now on building \na lasting peace, healing wounds, ensuring economic \nprosperity and guaranteeing the right of the whole \nnation to live in harmony. We are mindful that in order \nto fulfil these aspirations, economic development and \npolitical reconciliation must go hand in hand. Towards \nthis end, constitutional changes which appropriately \nreflect the aspirations of our people will be evolved \nwith the full participation of all stakeholders. \n We are pursuing a nationwide agenda of renewal. \nSri Lanka has already returned over 90 per cent of the \ninternally displaced persons to their original villages, \nwhich were previously riddled with landmines, and has \nprovided the essential infrastructure necessary for them \nto resume normal life. We have helped bring back the \nvitality of youth to former child soldiers. We have \nrebuilt the eastern province and have begun the same \ntask in the north. Sri Lanka\u2019s armed forces now have \nthe role of delivering essential services, rebuilding \nhomes, clearing mines and restoring vital infrastructure \nto whole tracts of formerly decimated land. \n Despite the lingering dangers that have remained, \nSri Lanka has nevertheless repealed a substantial part \nof the emergency regulations that were so necessary \nduring our conflict situation and plans to repeal a good \npart of the remainder in the coming months. \n \n \n23 10-54827 \n \n A great deal has been said by those beyond our \nborders about our Tamil community. Let me be clear: \nno nation on Earth can wish Sri Lanka\u2019s Tamil \ncommunity more good fortune than Sri Lanka itself. To \nthe misguided few, I say do not allow yourselves to \nbecome an instrument of division, hate and violence, to \nbe used as an enabler for hatred to be reborn in another \nform. Rather, come, let us join together and break the \nbonds of mistrust to rise to meet new horizons. \n Sri Lanka recognizes the challenges we face, \namong the greatest of which is healing the wounds of \nthe recent past. To that end, earlier this year, a lessons \nlearned and reconciliation commission was established, \nwhich gives full expression to the principles of \naccountability. This independent commission, comprising \neight Sri Lankans of eminence and stature, has already \nbegun its work. Recently, the commission handed over \nto me an interim communication recommending certain \nadministrative steps that may need to be taken in the \nreconciliation process. \n We believe that for the rebuilding and healing of \nour nation to succeed, the process must evolve from \nwithin. If history has taught us one thing, it is that \nimposed external solutions breed resentment and \nultimately fail. Ours, by contrast, is a home-grown \nprocess which reflects the culture and traditions of our \npeople. \n We certainly welcome the support of the \ninternational community as we rebuild our land and our \neconomy. We sincerely hope that its members will be \nprepared to take a practical approach to developing \npartnerships with Sri Lanka through international trade, \ninvestment and capacity- building. \n Our economy is well on the way to realizing the \ndividend of peace. We are experiencing steady and \nsustained growth, including during the last quarter, of \nover 8 per cent, moderate inflation and low interest \nrates. During the past five years, we saw our per capita \nincome double. It is our ambition to take this further, to \ndouble yet again the present per capita income by 2016 \nand also to become one of the top 30 countries in \nwhich to do business by 2014. \n \u201cMahinda Chinthana \u2014 Vision for the Future\u201d, \nmy election manifesto, articulates my vision of having \nsound infrastructure at the national, provincial and \nrural levels, which is vital for the inclusive growth that \nwill make development meaningful to the whole of \nsociety. I can also proudly claim that my country, \nthrough this economic strategy, is comfortably \nrealizing the Millennium Development Goals well in \nadvance of the target set by the United Nations. We are \nat present strongly focusing on putting in place the \nnecessary public infrastructure while strengthening the \nenabling policy environment for the private sector to \ninvest even more in my country. \n In order to achieve the full realization of our \npotential, we desire a supportive external environment. \nTo that end, we will always seek constructive \nengagement and partnerships. For our part, we will \ncontinue to contribute, as we have always done, to the \ncause of multilateralism and a principled global order. \nIn this regard, I am happy to note that 2010 marks the \nfiftieth anniversary of our first contribution to a United \nNations peacekeeping mission. Our armed forces and \npolice are today combat-tested, with the capacity to \ncarry out their duties in the most challenging of \nconditions.  \n The world as never before in the past has become \nseverely vulnerable to natural disasters. Almost every \nday we see millions of people becoming victims of \nsevere floods, landslides, volcanoes, cyclones, \nearthquakes and the like. It has become increasingly \ndifficult for affected countries to manage post-disaster \nrecovery programmes unassisted. The recent natural \ncalamities in our region underline the crucial need for \neffective action in which there is collective \nparticipation to reduce human suffering. Without \ndoubt, climate change and global warming are today \nissues which demand the urgent attention of all nations. \n Among the political issues that have continued to \nfester for too long is the continued denial of the right \nof the Palestinian people to a State of their own within \nrecognized and secure borders. It is the fervent hope of \nthe people of Sri Lanka that this most tragic of \nsituations will be resolved without delay and in a \nsustainable manner. We also hope that Palestine will be \na Member of the Organization by this time next year. \n Our guiding principle must always be that of \nmutual respect in international discourse, even as we \ndisapprove of and condemn measures such as unilateral \nembargoes. Experience in the recent past amply \ndemonstrates that these embargoes have an impact not \non Governments, but rather on the most vulnerable \nsectors of the community. In the same spirit, I would \ncall for the empathy of the international community \ntowards the aspirations of the Cuban people. \n  \n \n10-54827 24 \n \n I also wish to urge with all the emphasis at my \ncommand the need for greater concern and \ninvolvement on the part of the international community \nto assist the people of Africa in their efforts to raise the \nquality of life on their continent. \n Leaders who have been chosen by their people \noften face difficult decisions. They must be entitled to \nthe good will and confidence of the international \ncommunity with regard to the heavy burdens they are \nrequired to shoulder. The results of their decisions must \nbe evaluated objectively and they must be allowed to \nspeak for themselves. \n That is not to say countries should operate in \nisolation. In this globally interdependent world, we \nmust work together where we can and constructively \ncounsel each other where appropriate. The United \nNations forms the bedrock of this interaction, and in \nthat role it will always receive the support of Sri \nLanka."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on behalf of the \ndelegation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea, I would like, first of all, to congratulate you on \nyour election to the presidency of the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. In the same \nvein, I believe that your able leadership will bring \nsuccess to this session. \n This year marks the sixty-fifth anniversary of the \nfounding of the United Nations. The founding of the \nUnited Nations laid down an international legal basis \nfor preventing the recurrence of catastrophes, such as \nthe two World Wars that inflicted immeasurable \nsufferings on humankind, for safeguarding world peace \nand security and for achieving socio-economic \nprogress. The most important meaning of the founding \nof the United Nations is the establishment of the \nprinciple of sovereign equality in international \nrelations, which has enabled all States on this planet, \nlarge and small, to join their efforts for peace and \ndevelopment. \n The history of the United Nations, spanning 65 \nyears, is the history of continued challenges to the \npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. \nThe logic and politics of power, which seek to negate \nsovereign equality, still remain in sight in international \nrelations, even today after the turn of the century. \nInternational law and order are trampled on by the \narbitrariness and high-handedness of individual \nPowers. Military invasions of sovereign States, arms \nbuild-ups and threats of use of force continue \n  \n \n10-55396 28 \n \nunchecked and, what is more, a series of pretexts are \nused to justify them. \n Despicable trickery and attempts to overthrow \nother countries\u2019 socio-political systems have become \never more rampant. The banner of human rights \nprotection and the institutional mechanism of the \nUnited Nations General Assembly are abused to that \nend. To deny the right of other countries to choose their \nown systems constitutes in itself a violation of the \nhuman rights of their people. The Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea is one of those victimized countries. \n That reality requires a strengthening of the role of \nthe United Nations, in conformity with the changed \ntimes and situation, which, in our view, is possible only \nafter a more dynamic and appropriate reform of the \nUnited Nations. The composition and the rules of \nprocedure of the Security Council should be \nrestructured and revised in such a way that the \nrepresentation and will of the entire United Nations \nmembership are correctly reflected, in particular, by \nthe full representation of the non-aligned countries and \nother developing countries. The representation of a \nnew group of United Nations Member States that \nachieved independence after the founding of the United \nNations should also be ensured. \n The authority of the General Assembly should be \nenhanced decisively. The General Assembly, which is \nthe most democratic organ in the United Nations, has \nless power than the undemocratic Security Council. \nThat abnormal situation should no longer be allowed to \ncontinue. In addressing key issues such as peace and \ndevelopment, the broad and active participation of the \ndeveloping countries and their interests should be duly \npromoted. \n The Korean peninsula, like the Middle East, has \nlong been a chronic hot spot seriously affecting world \npeace and security. The United Nations has included \nthe Korean issue as a major item on its agenda for over \n30 years. This led to the adoption of resolution  \n3390 (XXX) in 1975, calling for the dissolution of the \nUnited Nations Command in South Korea, the \nwithdrawal of all foreign forces there and the \nreplacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peace \nagreement, as a measure to reduce tension and \nmaintain lasting peace on the Korean peninsula. \n Another 35 years have elapsed since then. The \nKorean peninsula is nevertheless still in a state of \narmistice, which means that there is neither war nor \npeace. While the aforesaid resolution is yet to be \nimplemented, the sovereignty and the efforts of the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea towards \npeaceful development are constantly threatened and \nundermined, as explosive situations leading to the \nbrink of war are created periodically on the Korean \npeninsula. The most recent example is the farcical huge \nsabre-rattling arms build-up and threat of use of force \nwaged on a massive scale by the United States and \nSouth Korean authorities on the Korean peninsula and \nits surroundings by taking advantage of the Cheonan \nincident. \n The touch-and-go situation created some time ago \nin North-East Asia, including the Korean peninsula, \nproved once again without a doubt that the United \nStates is not a defender, but a disruptor of peace. As \nlong as the United States nuclear aircraft carriers sail \naround the seas of our country, our nuclear deterrent \ncan never be abandoned, but should rather be \nstrengthened further. That is the lesson we have drawn. \n The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \nregards it as its noble duty as a Member State to safeguard \npeace and security and promote socio-economic \ndevelopment and common prosperity in and around the \nKorean peninsula. Had it not been for the powerful war \ndeterrent built by the Songun politics of the great \nleader of our people, General Kim Jong Il, the Korean \npeninsula would have already been turned into a \nbattlefield scores of times, thus destroying regional \npeace and stability. \n A peaceful environment is most urgently needed \nfor the Government and people of the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea, as they are now \nconcentrating all efforts on economic development in \norder to open the gate for a powerful and prosperous \nState in 2012, which marks the centennial anniversary \nof the birth of the great leader, President Kim Il Sung. \nThis year, which falls on the sixtieth anniversary of the \noutbreak of the Korean War, the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea again proposed respectfully to the \nparties to the Armistice Agreement to begin talks as \nearly as possible with a view to replacing the Armistice \nAgreement with a peace agreement. If that proposal is \nrealized, the General Assembly will see the \nimplementation of its historic resolution adopted 35 \nyears ago. The conclusion of a peace agreement will \nrepresent the most effective confidence-building \nmeasure for removing distrust among the parties to the \nArmistice and serve as a powerful driving force \n \n \n29 10-55396 \n \nguaranteeing the denuclearization of the Korean \npeninsula. \n There is no change in the position of the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea in its \nopposition to nuclear war, the nuclear arms race and \nnuclear proliferation. The denuclearization of the \nKorean peninsula is the policy goal maintained \nconsistently by the Government of the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea for peace and security in \nNorth-East Asia and the denuclearization of the world. \nThe denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, referred \nto in the Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks issued \non 19 September 2005, means the process of turning \nthe whole Korean peninsula into a nuclear-weapon-free \nzone by completely eliminating the real external \nnuclear threats on the Korean peninsula in a verifiable \nmanner. As already clarified, our nuclear weapons do \nnot serve as a means to attack or threaten others, but as \na self-defensive deterrent, for all intents and purposes, \nto counter aggression and attacks from outside. \n As a responsible nuclear-weapon State, we are \nwilling to join in the international efforts for nuclear \nnon-proliferation and the safe management of nuclear \nmaterial on an equal footing with other nuclear-weapon \nStates. It is the long-cherished desire of the entire \nKorean nation to put an end to the history of \ndisgraceful division forced upon it by foreign forces \nand to live peacefully on a reunified land. \n In the new century, important progress towards \nreconciliation, common prosperity and reunification \nhas been achieved in inter-Korean relations. The \nhistoric inter-Korean summit between the North and \nthe South in 2000 and its resultant adoption of the joint \ndeclaration of 15 June, followed by another inter-\nKorean summit in 2007 and the publication of the \ndeclaration of 4 October, constitute a good programme \nfor reunification, unprecedented in our national history. \nThose historic declarations were welcomed and warmly \nsupported by the United Nations General Assembly.  \n Unfortunately, the present South Korean \nauthorities reject this grand reunification programme \nand are driving inter-Korean relations towards a \nrupture by bringing forward the so-called \u201cthree-phase \nunification proposal\u201d, which is anti-reunification and \nconfrontational. They are stepping up an atmosphere of \nwar against their fellow countrymen in collusion with \nforeign forces with a view to rationalizing their \nconfrontational policy against the North. The  \nanti-reunification forces have no place on the Korean \npeninsula and, as such, the anti-peace forces should not \nbe offered a place in the international community. In \nthe future, the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea will thoroughly implement the joint \ndeclaration of 15 June and the declaration of 4 October, \nand thus achieve the reconciliation and unity of the \nnation, which will surely open a new era of \nindependent reunification, peace and prosperity. \n The ideal of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea\u2019s foreign policy is independence, peace and \nfriendship. It accords with the ideas of the United \nNations. In accordance with that ideal, the Government \nof the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea will \nfurther strengthen and develop friendly and cooperative \nrelations with all Member States and fully discharge its \nresponsibilities for ensuring peace and security in the \nKorean peninsula and the rest of the world. \n In conclusion, my delegation totally rejects the \nprovocative statement delivered by the South Korean \ndelegation on 25 September (see ), which \nreferred to the Cheonan incident again and distorted \nthe presidential statement of the Security Council of  \n9 July 2010 (S/PRST/2010/13 and S/PV.6355). The \ntruth of the Cheonan incident is still under cover. The \nresults of the unilateral investigation of South Korea, \nhave raised one doubt after another since its release, \nfollowing scientific military analysis and growing \nmanifold criticism inside and outside South Korea. The \nSouth Korean authorities have persistently refused to \naccept our proposal to send a field inspection group for \nscientific and objective verification of the truth of the \nincident. \n The Security Council, in its presidential statement \ndated 9 July 2010, took note of responses from other \nrelevant parties, including the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea, which has stated that it had nothing \nto do with the incident and encouraged the settlement \nof all outstanding issues by peaceful means to resume \ndirect dialogue and negotiations. South Korea is \nadvised not to create tension on the Korean peninsula \nby waging war exercises with outside forces and \npursuing a confrontational approach in defiance of the \nconcerns of the international community. It should \nimmediately embark on North-South dialogue so as to \nfind solutions to all outstanding issues, as \nrecommended by the presidential statement of the \nSecurity Council."

Your character, distinguished career \nand knowledge of current international affairs will \nsurely contribute to the management and success of our \nwork. I would like to convey Algeria\u2019s full support for \nyour efforts in the course of your term of office. I also \npay tribute to your predecessor, my brother Ali \nAbdussalam Treki, for his efforts and commitment to \nthe principles of multilateralism and respect for the \nfounding values of the Charter. Additionally, I wish to \nexpress our satisfaction and gratitude to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for the breadth and quality of \nthe efforts which he has tirelessly exerted to add to the \nrole of the Organization in our joint quest to achieve \nand strengthen its ideals. \n Despite the recent emergence of some \nencouraging signs of economic recovery, the world \ncontinues to suffer from the aftermath of the financial \nand economic crisis. The steps taken thus far to address \nits most devastating effects and to relaunch the global \neconomic engine lead us to believe even more firmly \n \n \n39 10-55122 \n \nthat the best way to prevent worse crises from \noccurring is to rethink global financial and economic \ngovernance in a rational manner that leaves no room \nfor speculation and the vagaries of the market and that \nserves as a fair model for developing countries. \n The main trends in the world since the last \nsession have led us to examine the depth of the \neconomic crisis in the poorest countries, especially in \nAfrica. Crises such as this hamper progress in the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs), notably in the areas of maternal and child \nhealth and in combating poverty. It is important that \nthe international community respect its commitments \nin the area of official development assistance and \nprovide recipient countries with additional assistance \nso that they can achieve the Millennium Development \nGoals. Several options could be explored in that \nregard, some of which seem very promising to us. They \ninclude debt moratoriums for developing countries that \nhave difficulty in paying their debts and easier access \nto the markets of developed countries. \n The fact that a high-level meeting on biodiversity \nwill take place in a few weeks\u2019 time in Nagoya, Japan, \nprovides us with a valuable opportunity to launch an \nurgent appeal requesting the international community \nto mobilize to preserve the biological resources of our \nplanet, which are being threatened by unbridled \neconomic development that does not take future \ngenerations into account. In that context, I would like \nto stress the need to strengthen the role of the United \nNations in protecting biodiversity in developing \ncountries and in promoting North-South cooperation \nthat is mutually beneficial. \n The issue of climate change presents another \nconsiderable challenge for the international \ncommunity, given the manifold threats it poses to \necosystems and economies. The limited and modest \nresults achieved in Copenhagen should serve to \nencourage all States to redouble their efforts to make \nprogress at the next meeting of the Conference of the \nParties, to be held in Canc\u00fan, towards establishing a \nlegally binding agreement based on the Kyoto \nProtocol\u2019s Framework Convention. \n No doubt due to climate change, the extreme \ngravity of the natural phenomena that have lately \nplunged Pakistan, Russia, China, India and other \ncountries into disaster means that we need to \nrestructure international mechanisms to respond to \nnatural disasters of this kind. On the basis of humanism \nand solidarity, Algeria launches an appeal for a joint \ninternational reflection on the best way to achieve \ngenuine comprehensive natural disaster management. \n Countries that do not possess nuclear weapons, \nsuch as Algeria, have the right to ask nuclear States to \ntruly embrace nuclear disarmament. The results of the \n2010 eighth Review Conference of the Parties to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \nconstitute a positive step in that regard, thanks in \nparticular to the launching of a process that should give \nrise to a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. \n In order to rise to the multiple challenges \nconfronting international peace and security, the \nConference on Disarmament should make the most of \nthe favourable international circumstances and the \npositive momentum generated by the results of the \n2010 Review Conference to restart its work and \ncomply with its mandate. To that end, Algeria \ncontinues to be committed to the effective relaunching \nof the work of the Conference on Disarmament. \nAlgeria believes that the goals and contents of the \nprogramme adopted in 2009 continue to be valid today \nand could be the basis for the work of future sessions. \n The issue of peace and security is also linked to \nthe exacerbation of terrorism and its links with \ntransnational organized crime, the taking of hostages \nand trafficking in arms, drugs and human beings. My \ncountry welcomes the adoption of resolution 1904 \n(2009), on criminalizing the payment of ransoms to \narmed groups based on the principle that this \ncondemnable practice is a significant source of \nfinancing for terrorism. Nevertheless, the international \ncommunity must still make considerable efforts to \neradicate this transnational threat, not just in the \ncontext of comprehensive and systematic \nimplementation but also in the light of the increase in \nhostage-taking by terrorists and the payment of \nransoms to them. This is an issue that must be \naddressed with determination, strength and \nresponsibility. \n Algeria calls on the international community to \nact to prevent the criminal use of international satellite \nimages via the Internet. We believe that the \ncomprehensive treaty to combat terrorism, which \nAlgeria fully supports, will be a main factor in \nchecking piracy, once it has been adopted. \n  \n \n10-55122 40 \n \n With regard to respect for the principles \nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, Algeria \nfully participates in regional integration attempts as a \ncrucial element in combating international terrorism. \nAlgeria has launched several recent initiatives, \nincluding an initiative to strengthen bilateral and \nregional cooperation among States in our region in \norder to bolster peace, security and development. It is \ncommitted to pursuing common efforts to build the \nArab Maghreb union and endow it with dynamic \ninstitutions to ensure that the project comes into being \nas the ideal framework for economic cooperation and \ncomplementarity in the region. It has also launched \nMaghreb-wide economic and social programmes and \ndevelopment projects to encourage regional \nintegration. \n The Palestinian people, who continue to aspire to \nbuild a viable State, are still held hostage by the \nindecision of certain parties. That is being aggravated \nby policies of aggression and unjust siege. We reiterate \nour call to the international community to show resolve \nand unity with regard to this conflict by bringing \npressure to bear on the occupation forces. We believe \nthat a definitive, comprehensive and just solution \nrequires the implementation of the Arab Peace \nInitiative. In that context, on behalf of the Algerian \npeople and Government, I should like to express our \nfriendship and support to our Palestinian brothers. \n Algeria would like to see an immediate halt to \nsettlements, the return of Palestinian refugees, the \nreturn of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians as the \ncapital of a Palestinian State and a return to the borders \nof 4 June 1967. The other occupied Arab territories in \nLebanon and the Golan should also be returned. \n As we mark the fiftieth anniversary of the \nadoption of resolution 1514 (XV), which enshrined the \nprinciple of freeing oppressed people from the yoke of \ncolonialism, we unfortunately continue to see that there \nstill exist Non-Self-Governing Territories whose \npopulations continue to aspire to self-determination. To \nthat end, and in keeping with our duties and \nresponsibilities, Algeria is willing to extend its full \nsupport to the efforts of the United Nations and of \nSpecial Envoy of the Secretary-General Christopher \nRoss in order to resolve the Western Sahara conflict. \nWe express our adherence to the human rights \ndimension of the issue and the need for it to be taken \ninto account by the Human Rights Council and other \ninternational mechanisms in that area, in line with the \nrelevant provisions of the United Nations Charter, so as \nto reach a just political solution that allows the people \nof Western Sahara to exercise their right to self-\ndetermination through a referendum. I reiterate my \ncountry\u2019s belief, in line with the view of the African \nUnion Summit held in Kampala, that there cannot be \nan international justice system that operates at two \ndifferent speeds and focuses on a single region of the \nworld, for this issue poses a threat to regional peace \nand security. \n Algeria also rejects the imposition of \nextraterritorial laws and rules and all forms of coercive \neconomic measures, including unilateral sanctions \nagainst developing countries. In that regard, Algeria \nreiterates the need to end the economic, commercial \nand financial embargo that has been imposed against \nthe Cuban Government and people for more than half a \ncentury. \n The African Union has proclaimed 2010 the Year \nof Peace and Security in Africa, as an expression of the \nwill of its member States to make every peaceful effort \nto resolve all ongoing and new conflicts and crises on \nour continent. We encourage the African Union to \nintegrate economically and politically so that it can \nbecome a partner to reckon with in international \naffairs. "

        "file_text": "I am pleased to address the \nGeneral Assembly. This year, I shall focus on three \npressing global matters: the progress in achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), promoting \npeace and security, and humanitarian affairs. \n During the first decade of this millennium, the \nMDGs have triggered a level of global commitment \nand wide-ranging partnership that the world has never \nseen before. Along the way, there have been setbacks, \nof course. One thing, however, is certain \u2014 achieving \nthe MDGs is an attainable reality with concrete targets \nand deadlines. \n We have set a clear goal, but we must keep in \nmind that we shall reach our objective only if we share \nthe weight of responsibility and all of us pull in the \nsame direction. The political will expressed by a \nmajority of stakeholders at the recent MDG summit \nand in its outcome document (resolution 65/1) needs to \nbe implemented promptly, in accordance with the \nagreed action agenda. Only five years, after all, remain. \nEstonia is ready to provide continuous contributions to \nthe success of our common endeavour. \n Estonia contributes towards the achievement of \nthe MDGs through focused development cooperation \npolicy and respective activities in our main partner \ncountries, one of which is Afghanistan. Alongside with \nproviding security through the International Security \nAssistance Force (ISAF), we are carrying out long-\nterm health care and education projects in Helmand \nprovince. We also offer our best practices in \n  \n \n10-54965 24 \n \nestablishing standards of good governance, including \nthe creation of an electronic voting system for the \nnewly elected Parliament. \n Estonia supports the transition process, including \nthe gradual transfer of security responsibilities to the \nAfghan authorities. This process should be term-based \nand irreversible, and carried out according to the \nagreement reached at the ISAF meeting in Tallinn last \nApril. Ownership of the process on the part of the \nAfghan Government is crucial in taking forward the \npledge it made at the Kabul Conference with regard to \nstrengthening the electoral framework. This, along with \nthe endorsed reform agenda, demonstrates the Afghans\u2019 \ndesire to develop their nation. \n For my country, Estonia, the development of \ninformation and communications technology has been \na crucial engine of economic development and \nmodernization throughout the past 20 years. This is \nwhy our experts advise Governments on information \nand communications technology solutions in many \nparts of the world. In cooperation with the United \nNations Development Programme and the Open \nSociety Institute, we have established a special \nacademy to assist Governments in developing countries \nwith advice and training in electronic governance and \nthe use of information and communications technology \nin public services. I am convinced that the more \nsuccessful we are in reducing the digital divide, the \nmore accelerated and more sustainable overall \neconomic progress will be. \n I commend United Nations efforts in paving the \nway towards a more efficient operational system, \nespecially the long-awaited outcome of the four-year \nsystem-wide coherence negotiations. As the \nimplications of gender inequality affect all the \nMillennium Development Goals, the consensus \nagreement on establishing the United Nations Entity \nfor Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women \n(UN Women) will serve as an extra boost for meeting \nthose Goals. \n Estonia contributes to the achievement of the \nMillennium Goals through the respective United \nNations agencies, funds and programmes, and we \npledge our support to UN Women as well. \n Ever since the United Nations Charter was \nsigned, 65 years ago, the United Nations has stood for \nglobal peace and security. The United Nations \npeacekeeping budget has increased more than 15-fold \nsince 1991. It is difficult to imagine the situation in \nmajor crisis areas, such as the Sudan and the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, without the active, \nmultifaceted engagement of the United Nations. With \nits 15 military and 12 political operations, however, the \nUnited Nations peacekeeping force is clearly stretched \nthin. We need further reforms in order to enhance the \neffectiveness of peacekeeping operations and to \nencourage regional actors to assume a stronger role. \nEstonia contributes to the United Nations peacekeeping \nbudget at a voluntarily enhanced rate. We have done \nthis for 10 years now and will continue to do so. \n The credibility of the United Nations in the \npromotion of peace and security depends on the \ncommitment of all Member States. We all share equally \nthe responsibility to apply the principles enshrined in \nthe Charter, including the duty to refrain from any \nthreat or use of force against the territorial integrity or \npolitical independence of any State. \n Estonia reiterates its firm support for the \nsovereignty, territorial integrity, security and stability \nof Georgia, on the basis of full adherence to \ninternational law. For the peaceful resolution of that \ndrawn-out conflict, it is necessary to continue the \nGeneva talks in their initial format. Humanitarian \nissues, in particular ensuring the safe and dignified \nreturn of refugees and internally displaced persons, and \nthe question of increased access to the conflict zone, \nespecially for humanitarian workers and international \nobservers, need to be seriously addressed now. \nFurthermore, the free movement of people living \nwithin the internationally recognized borders of \nGeorgia must be ensured. \n Without justice, efforts to ensure sustainable \npeace might easily be wiped out. I would like, \ntherefore, to emphasize the importance of the adoption \nby consensus of a package of amendments on the crime \nof aggression by the Review Conference of the Rome \nStatute of the International Criminal Court, held in \nJune 2010. Estonia strongly supports an international \ncriminal justice system in which an independent and \neffective International Criminal Court plays a central \nrole. \n It is also of crucial importance to support the \nactivities of the International Criminal Tribunal for the \nFormer Yugoslavia during its final years of existence. \nEstonia is doing its share with respect to the \nenforcement of sentences. \n \n \n25 10-54965 \n \n Success in confronting the security challenges of \nthe twenty-first century, including cyberthreats, \ndepends on close cooperation among all States and \ninternational and regional organizations. Estonia urges \nbroad cross-border and cross-sector capacity-building \nin protecting critical information infrastructure, the \nimportance of which was highlighted in the report of \nthe high-level panel of experts on information and \ncommunication technology (A/55/75). The necessity of \ncloser cooperation among States, between the private \nsector and civil society, is critical, since during a cyber \nattack all traditional security measures may be \nrendered useless. I can assure you that all-\nencompassing preparedness will pay off when a real \ncrisis strikes. \n Estonia remains actively engaged in areas where \nour contribution can make a difference, particularly in \nhumanitarian affairs and human rights issues. In this \ncontext, I would like to draw attention to the tenth \nanniversary of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) \non women, peace and security, which must be a \nstepping stone towards further action at the United \nNations, regional and national levels. Establishing \noperational guidelines for the protection of women and \ngirls, strengthening accountability mechanisms and \nenhancing women\u2019s participation in peace negotiations \nand post-conflict peacebuilding should be part of these \nefforts. To this end, Estonia is finalizing a national \naction plan to enhance our activities. \nEstonia is a strong and principled advocate of \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, including the \nfreedom of expression. Estonia supports the \nstrengthening of the Human Rights Council and its \ncapacity to promote and protect human rights around \nthe world. We aspire to join the Human Rights Council \nin 2012. \n Estonia has also continuously increased its \ncontribution to United Nations humanitarian activities, \nboth through work in the field and financially. The \nUnited Nations coordination capability was crucial \nmost recently in Pakistan and at the beginning of the \nyear in Haiti, where it saved lives, and where Estonian \nlogistics experts have been supporting United Nations \nactivities on the ground for more than six months now. \nOur experience has made clear the need for more \ncombined efforts in securing the link between relief \nefforts and development work. \n Estonia is concerned about increasingly frequent \nviolations of humanitarian principles in conflict zones. \nAlas, humanitarian emblems and flags no longer \nprovide the shield of protection they used to. We must \nstep up our efforts and press for increased security for \nhumanitarian aid workers. After all, it is the \nresponsibility of Governments to ensure the safety and \nsecurity of humanitarian personnel working on their \nterritory. \n The effectiveness of humanitarian aid and \nupholding good humanitarian principles are other \nconcerns of ours. Advocating these principles was one \nof the activities Estonia pursued during our recent co-\nchairmanship of the Good Humanitarian Donorship \ninitiative. \n Finally, I would like to underline one simple \ntruth. The United Nations, like any other organization, \nis only as strong and effective as the political will and \ncommitment of its members. Big or small, we all bear \nresponsibility. As a member of the European Union, \nEstonia firmly believes that the Treaty of Lisbon \nfundamentally enhances the ability of the Union to be a \nsignificant global actor, securing peace, stability and \nprosperity for all. With our shared commitment, I \nexpect the vital and prominent role of the United \nNations in the global arena to be further reinforced."

        "file_text": "I would like to offer my \nheartfelt congratulations to the President of the \nAssembly on his assumption of the presidency of this \nbody at its sixty-fifth session. Also, allow me to \ncommend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki, for his capable leadership during \nthe sixty-fourth session. \n This week is vitally important for my island \nnation of Nauru and for small island developing States \ngenerally. This week we will complete the high-level \nreviews of the Millennium Development Goals and the \nMauritius Strategy, two programmes that are central to \nthe sustainable development prospects of my country.  \n We gather here on this occasion to reaffirm the \ncentral role of the United Nations in global \ngovernance. However, the centrality of the United \nNations system must derive from its ability to help \nbring about positive outcomes for all of its \nmembership. In that regard, the United Nations report \ncard is mixed. \n While this body and others have brought attention \nto the unique and particular vulnerabilities of small \nisland developing States, they have not always \nsucceeded in delivering concrete benefits. There is a \nproliferation of global action plans but a paucity of \naction. For this reason, Nauru has relied more on its \ndomestic institutions and bilateral partners than on \nmultilateral governance solutions. \n Nauru turned a corner in 2005 when it adopted its \nNational Sustainable Development Strategy, commonly \nknown to us as our NSDS. Under that plan we have \nmade significant progress across most sectors. Our \nfinancial system is now more transparent and \nGovernment more accountable. Most importantly, we \nhave restored some measures of security for our \ncitizens: expanded public health programmes, new and \nrefurbished schools, updated curriculum and more \nteachers. Power is more reliable and its usage more \nefficient. Regular air and maritime travel has been \nrestored, and we have seen major improvements in our \ncommunications system. \n Most of the gains in the past five years have been \nthe result of our own efforts, largely supported by \nbilateral development partners targeting our national \nplans. However, our journey is far from over. Our \nNSDS lays out a clear path forward to aid \nindependence based on our national circumstances and \ncapacity. Its medium- and long-term milestones are \nfully consistent with, and complementary to, the \nMillennium Development Goals and Mauritius Strategy \nprogrammes. It is my hope that the United Nations can \nplay a more significant role in this next phase of our \ndevelopment.  \n Five years after our initial request, I am pleased \nthat the United Nations has opened its joint presence \noffice in Nauru. It is my hope that that will enable \nUnited Nations agencies to be more familiar with, and \nresponsive to, our unique development challenges. \n The future of all my people depends on an \neffective United Nations system, but none more so than \nthe future of our youth. Not long ago, my country \n  \n \n10-54965 34 \n \nsuffered a devastating economic crisis. It was followed \nby the explosion in global fuel and food prices and \nthen by the global economic downturn, which many of \nus are still grappling with today. Those crises were \nexacerbated by virtue of Nauru being a small and \nisolated island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. As a \ncountry, we will overcome. However, some impacts \nwill be felt longer than others. \n Perhaps the cruellest legacy of our economic \ncrisis is the impact it had on the youth who grew up \nduring that trying time. Advantages that my generation \ntook for granted \u2014 a good education, basic health care \nand abundant job opportunities \u2014 were simply not \navailable for many of our youth during a critical period \nin their lives. In the absence of such advantages, \nsubstance abuse, illiteracy, delinquency and lifestyle-\nrelated illnesses became commonplace. As we progress \nas a nation, we must ensure that we do not leave one \nsegment of our community behind. Our collective \nfuture will not be secure unless we invest in the \ncommunity and business leaders of tomorrow. \n It is for this reason that Nauru appreciates the \nimportance of the International Year of Youth, which \ncommenced in August 2010. This United Nations \ntradition began 25 years ago when this body \nrecognized the profoundly important role that youth \nshould have in shaping a new international economic \norder based on equity and justice. \n My Government has made investing in our youth \na top priority. Nauru is on track to reach our \nMillennium Development Goal of universal primary \neducation by 2015. We have been successful despite \nthe significant shortage of quality Nauruan teachers.  \n Of equal importance to the development of our \nprimary and secondary education systems is the need to \ndevelop technical and vocational training, recognizing \nand certifying skills and job-oriented training. Only by \ncontinued investment in human resource development \nwill the next generation of Nauruans be prepared for \nthe challenges of the twenty-first century. \n Our health sector, too, has made gains in curative \nservices and preventative health programmes. \nHowever, around 75 per cent of people in the Pacific \nsuffer from non-communicable diseases. That is not \nsustainable. Investments in public health must be \naccompanied by investments in improving food \nsecurity. It will be difficult to change that alarming \nstatistic for the better unless my people have a reliable \nsupply of affordable and nutritious food. Health \neducation must also receive more emphasis in our \neducational programmes. \n Education and public health are obviously two \nareas that are fundamental for the well-being of our \nyouth, but alone they are not enough. Our youth must \nalso be given the opportunity to use their skills in \nproductive ways, lest those skills wither on the vine. \nFor that we need a growing economy, and for a \ngrowing economy we must look to our development \npartners and multilateral institutions for assistance. \n Aid should be deployed so as to build a \nfoundation for sustainable development in all economic \nsectors, including basic infrastructure, in which to date \nthere has been less progress than in health and \neducation. The re-establishment of banking and \nfinancial services continues to elude us despite all our \nurgent efforts to obtain assistance. Nation-building and \nyouth development must run parallel to each other if \neither is to succeed. Investments in basic infrastructure \nwill enable us to expand our economic base, increase \nexports and also reduce the costs of imports. \n The United Nations system must also be \nenhanced in order to avoid the mistakes of the past. \nThat is why we are joining others in calling for the \ncreation of a formal small island developing States \n(SIDS) category within the United Nations system.  \n The international community has consistently \nrecognized the unique vulnerabilities of the small \nisland developing States, yet that recognition has not \nbeen translated into effective action. The preparatory \nwork for the five-year review of the Mauritius Strategy \nfor the Further Implementation of the Programme of \nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small \nIsland Developing States found that the vulnerabilities \nof SIDS remain and that progress towards sustainable \ndevelopment is far below expectations. It is clear that \nbusiness as usual is not working and that a new \napproach is long overdue. \n The creation of a new SIDS category would make \nthe United Nations more responsive to the particular \nneeds of small islands. This new category should be \naccompanied by structural support mechanisms in the \nareas of development assistance, financial support and \ntrade. Only by dealing with the vulnerabilities of SIDS \ncan there be any realistic prospect of SIDS attaining \nsustainable economic growth. \n \n \n35 10-54965 \n \n The most important test of our commitment to \nour youth is the state of the world that we leave to \nthem. We have long been aware of the environmental \ncrises currently facing our oceans and our climate, but \nwe have done precious little to address them. Without \nimmediate and aggressive international action on both \nfronts, we will bequeath to our children a world that is \nfar poorer than the one we ourselves inhabited. \n Nauru takes these threats very seriously, which is \nwhy my country, along with other island countries in \nthe Pacific, recently strengthened the Nauru \nAgreement. That multilateral agreement on oceans \ngovernance is a major step in strengthening an \neffective regime for managing and protecting regional \ntuna stocks. The preservation of that resource is \nessential to our region\u2019s food security and to our \neconomic development. Regrettably, the sustainability \nof the tuna stocks and other marine resources that we \nrely on is threatened by actions beyond our control. \nIllegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and \noverfishing by large fishing nations is rife in the \nPacific, and we lack sufficient resources to respond to \nthat criminal activity. One of the pillars of our \neconomic future is literally being stolen from our \nchildren. \n With regard to climate change, my island and \nmany others like it face an existential threat far beyond \nour capacity to adapt. Rising sea levels and extreme \nweather may one day render my home uninhabitable. \nBut an island can die long before it has disappeared \nbeneath the sea. All that is required is to deprive its \nyouth of hope. What incentive will they have to invest \nin their home if it will not be there for when they are \nolder? We have an opportunity to change course later \nthis year at the United Nations Climate Change \nConference to be held in Canc\u00fan. We must act as if our \nchildren\u2019s future depended on the decisions we make. \n Climate change is a global issue and demands the \nfull participation of all. We therefore call on the \nimmediate inclusion of Taiwan in the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) \nprocess. We must also recognize that climate change \nposes many threats \u2014 security threats \u2014 that are not \naddressed under the UNFCCC process. That is why the \nPacific small island developing States introduced in the \nGeneral Assembly a resolution on climate change and \nits possible security implications (resolution 63/281). \nThe Security Council, as the primary body of the \nUnited Nations entrusted with preserving international \npeace and security, must also play its role. \n Lastly, we must ensure that the views and \nperspectives of all nations and peoples are incorporated \ninto the decision-making of the United Nations system \nand its specialized agencies. In that context, Nauru \nstrongly supports Taiwan\u2019s campaign for meaningful \nparticipation in the International Civil Aviation \nOrganization. \n I would like to conclude by thanking our \ndevelopment partners for their long-standing \ncommitment to Nauru, particularly our major \npartners \u2014 Australia, Taiwan, the Russia Federation, \nNew Zealand, the European Union and Japan \u2014 as \nwell as our many other active partners, including Cuba, \nItaly, India, the Republic of Korea and Israel. We \nfurther recognize the international and regional \norganizations that have continued to stand by our side \nduring a difficult period in our history, and I look \nforward to our continuing cooperation. \n I would also like to commend the United Nations \nfor beginning a difficult process of reflection and \nreform so as to be able to more effectively respond to \nthe global challenges we all face. Nauru looks forward \nto participating in this important discussion so that the \nUnited Nations can continue to play a central role in \nglobal governance. \n May God bless the Republic of Nauru and may \nGod bless the United Nations."

        "file_text": "First, \nSir, I warmly congratulate you and the friendly Swiss \nConfederation on your election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session, and wish \nyou every success in your noble mission. We are \nconvinced that your great political and diplomatic \nexperience will provide the best conditions for the \nsuccess of this session and enrich its contents. This will \nhelp achieve the objectives and aspirations we all \ncherish, especially as regards the theme of the general \ndebate: \u201cReaffirming the central role of the United \nNations in global governance\u201d. \n I take this opportunity to renew my congratulations \nto Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki and to the sisterly Great \nSocialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, for his \nvaluable efforts as President at the sixty-fourth session, \nhis deep knowledge of international affairs and his \nwise approach in dealing with crucial, complex and \ndelicate issues, thus serving the interests of our peoples \nand nations and enhancing the role of the General \nAssembly in international relations. \n I also wish to express my great respect to Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, the Secretary-General, for his commendable \nefforts at the head of the Secretariat to further enhance \nthe position of our prestigious Organization and \npromote its performance, so that it can meet the many \nchallenges posed on the international scene. In this \ncontext, Tunisia reaffirms its support for all the efforts \nof the Secretary-General, and of the United Nations in \ngeneral, to promote peace, stability, security and \ndevelopment in all countries of the world. \n Tunisia highly values the important historic step \nmade during the previous session in the process of \nreforming the United Nations. I refer to the adoption of \nresolution 64/289, which reaffirms the importance we \nall attach to the development of the United Nations \nsystem and the promotion of complementarity between \nits activities and programmes. That applies especially \nto those pertaining to women, for whom a new unified \nEntity has been created to deal with all issues related to \ngender equality and the empowerment of women. I \ntake this opportunity to renew our congratulations to its \nhead, Ms. Bachelet. We wish her every success. \n Under the leadership of President Zine El Abidine \nBen Ali, Tunisia attaches crucial importance to these \nissues. Women, in fact, have a strategic role in our \ncivilizational project, and are considered a partner in \nmaking all our national choices. Tunisia strongly believes \nthat democracy cannot be built, and comprehensive \ndevelopment cannot be achieved, without the active \ninvolvement of women in public life, and that promoting \nsociety to higher levels depends on enhancing the \nconditions of women in all fields. This conviction \nstems from our vision of human rights in their \ncomprehensiveness, inseparability and complementarity. \n The prestigious status that Tunisian women enjoy \ntoday is confirmed by figures and indicators pertaining \nto human development and women\u2019s involvement in all \nfields. They now represent 30 per cent of the country\u2019s \nworking population. They hold 30 per cent of decision-\nmaking positions and other positions of responsibility. \nThey represent 33 per cent of the judicial corps \u2014 \njudges and lawyers \u2014 and 42 per cent of the medical \ncorps. In higher education, girls account for 60 per cent \nof the total number of students. In the legislative \nbranch, women\u2019s presence has been reinforced to reach \n30 per cent in the Chamber of Deputies and 16 per cent \nin the Chamber of Advisers. \n It is indeed a source of pride for Tunisia to be \nranked first internationally in terms of fighting \nviolence against women and guaranteeing their right to \nfree movement and ownership of property, to be ranked \nfirst in the Arab world in terms of offering women \nopportunities for economic participation, and to be \nranked first in Africa in terms of women\u2019s per capita \nincome. \n The Tunisian presidency of the Arab Women \nOrganization (AWO), in the person of Tunisia\u2019s first \nlady, is in line with that approach. Mrs. Leila Ben Ali \n \n \n7 10-55276 \n \nhas endeavoured to spread the culture of gender \nequality, to further improve the condition of women in \nArab societies, to allow them to enjoy their rights and \naccomplish their duties, and to preserve their dignity. All \nthis, in fact, constitutes a civilizational and strategic stake \nand an integral part of the concept of Arab national \nsecurity and human security in all its dimensions. \n As part of the various pioneering initiatives and \nactivities of the Arab Women Organization, Tunisia \nwill next month host the third AWO Conference, with \nthe theme \u201cThe Arab woman, a partner in sustainable \ndevelopment\u201d. \n Since the change of 7 November 1987, Tunisia \nhas adopted a comprehensive and balanced development \npolicy based on the inseparability of the economic and \nsocial dimensions, a policy that reconciles the \nrequirements of an economy based on the principles of \nprofitability and efficiency and an equitable social \npolicy in which there is no room for exclusion or \nmarginalization, guaranteeing a decent life for all \ncitizens. \n The electoral programme of President Zine El \nAbidine Ben Ali for the 2009-2014 term of office, \n\u201cTogether we meet the challenges\u201d, and the five-year \ndevelopment plan for the period 2010-2014 have both \nmade a reality of those choices, reflecting a \ndetermination to further enhance the process of \ndemocracy and pluralism, to move political life in \nTunisia towards further modernity and continuous \nreform, and to launch a new process of development \nbased on the economy of knowledge and intelligence. \n As part of that ambitious, future-oriented plan, \nTunisia has attached crucial importance to youth as the \npillar of the present and the builder of the future, \nthrough regularly organizing national youth \nconsultations to explore the concerns, expectations and \nviews of young people. The results of those \nconsultations are taken into consideration in preparing \ndevelopment plans. Furthermore, Tunisia proclaimed \n2008 the Year of Comprehensive Dialogue with \nTunisian Youth. That event, with massive participation \nby different youth categories, was crowned with the \nadoption of a Youth Pact signed by all the national \norganizations concerned and the elite of Tunisian youth. \n Keen on consecrating this policy at the \ninternational level and on involving the world \ncommunity in supporting it, our country launched \nduring the previous session of the General Assembly an \ninitiative to proclaim 2010 International Year of Youth, \nto consolidate the position of youth in all societies of \nthe world, youth being at the forefront of the forces of \nprogress embracing noble universal values. Tunisia \nexpresses its deep pride over Member States\u2019 \nunanimous support for this initiative, which the \nGeneral Assembly adopted in resolution 64/134.  \n Tunisia also takes pride in the fact that on \n12 August the Secretary-General himself chaired the \nlaunch of the festivities celebrating the International \nYear of Youth; he did so at Headquarters, in the presence \nof hundreds of representatives of the world\u2019s youth. \n Tunisia calls on all Governments, international \nand regional organizations, and youth institutions, to \nestablish adequate plans of action, programmes and \nactivities to celebrate the International Year of Youth in \na way that makes a reality of its motto, \u201cDialogue and \nmutual understanding\u201d, and leads to the adoption of an \ninternational pact to bind the world\u2019s youth to common \nuniversal values. I take this opportunity to express \nTunisia\u2019s appreciation for the initiatives of Turkey, \nSingapore and Mexico in organizing important \ninternational youth events last August. \n Throughout its modern history, Tunisia has \nremained committed to the principles and values of \npeaceful coexistence, good-neighbourliness, fraternity \nand mutual support. It has tirelessly endeavoured to \npromote relations of fraternity, friendship and cooperation \nwith all peace-loving countries, and has invariably \nadvocated peace, security and justice in the world. \n Since the change of November 1987, Tunisia has \ngiven particular attention to the promotion of relations \nof fraternity and cooperation with Arab Maghreb \ncountries, based on its strong belief in the unity of \ndestiny and the inevitability of Maghreb integration. \nWhile reaffirming its adherence to the Arab Maghreb \nUnion as a historic gain and an irrevocable strategic \nchoice, Tunisia is committed to pursuing efforts jointly \nwith sisterly Maghreb countries to realize the aspirations \nof the Maghreb peoples for complementarity, \nintegration and solidarity. This commitment stems from \na deep common civilizational, historic and geographic \nbelonging, and is imposed by the successive economic \nfluctuations and the deep and ever-accelerating \nchanges taking place in our world today in all political, \nsocial and cultural fields. \n At the Arab level, Tunisia will firmly pursue its \nefforts to promote joint Arab action and establish solid \n  \n \n10-55276 8 \n \nfoundations for an efficient inter-Arab economic \ncomplementarity. \n Tunisia has continuously played an efficient role \nin dealing with Arab causes, in the forefront of which \nis the Palestinian cause, through its firm and \nunwavering position supporting the brotherly \nPalestinian people at all stages of their legitimate \nstruggle, and calling for a fair, durable and \ncomprehensive solution that can put an end to the \nsuffering of our Palestinian brothers and allow them to \nrecover their legitimate national rights and establish \ntheir independent State on their land. \n In this context, Tunisia expresses its deep concern \nabout the situation in the Middle East, as a result of \nIsrael\u2019s disrespect for international legality and the \nbasic principles of the peace process, its persistence in \nthe settlement policy and its attempts to obliterate the \nArab-Muslim identity of the city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif.  \n Tunisia expresses its hope that the resumption of \ndirect peace talks, launched on 2 September in \nWashington under the sponsorship of the United States, \nwill meet the legitimate aspirations of the brotherly \nPalestinian people.  \n We also call on all the influential parties on the \ninternational scene, particularly the Quartet, to act to \nbring Israel to adhere to the requirements of peace, on \nthe basis of international legality, the principles of the \npeace process, and the Arab Peace Initiative, and in \naccordance with a specific time schedule that covers all \nthe relevant main points. \n Tunisia also reiterates its call for an end to the \nIsraeli occupation of the Syrian Golan and the remaining \noccupied Lebanese territories, in accordance with \ninternational legality, so that all the peoples of the region \ncan enjoy security and peace, and devote their efforts \nto construction and development for a better future. \n Moreover, Tunisia hopes that the efforts made \nwill promote peace and security in Iraq, Yemen, the \nSudan and Somalia, within a climate of unity and \nnational harmony. \n Tunisia attaches particular importance to its \nbelonging to Africa, based on its belief in the \nimportance of its integration in its geographic \nenvironment and the expansion of the fields of \ncooperation and solidarity with sisterly African \ncountries. Since the 7 November change, our country \nhas endeavoured to realize this policy by reaffirming \nits commitment to the principles of the African Union, \nand continuously supporting all initiatives aimed at \npromoting the continent, achieving development for its \npeoples, and preserving its potentialities, within a \nclimate of security and stability. \n Tunisia has spared no effort to contribute to the \npromotion of peace and security in the African \ncontinent, through participating in United Nations \npeacekeeping operations, supporting conflict-\nprevention mechanisms, and continuously acting for \nthe eradication of hotbeds of tension. \n Moreover, our country has continuously called on \nAfrican countries to play an active role and to find \nadequate solutions to their problems through activating \nthe central organ of the Mechanism for Conflict \nPrevention, Management and Resolution, the first \nregional experience of preventive diplomacy, then \nthrough the African Peace and Security Council, which \nhas helped re-establish stability in a number of sisterly \nAfrican countries. \n We reaffirm Tunisia\u2019s support for all the efforts of \nthe African Union, which proclaimed 2010 the Year of \nPeace and Security in Africa, so that peace and stability \nwould reign all over the continent, which is a \nresponsibility of the international community as a whole. \n In line with those principles and with the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), Tunisia calls \non developed nations to act promptly to meet the needs \nof the African continent and of developing countries in \ngeneral, by using the existing international and \nregional mechanisms to ensure decent living standards \nfor African peoples. \n I take this opportunity to stress the need to \nactivate the World Solidarity Fund, created by the \nGeneral Assembly in 2002, upon Tunisia\u2019s initiative, to \nserve as an efficient international mechanism for \nsustainable development, capable of achieving the \nMDGs, particularly the Goal of reducing the poverty \nrate by half by 2015. \n At the Euro-Mediterranean level, Europe is \ncurrently an essential partner of Tunisia in various \nfields. Our country has time-honoured historic relations \nwith Europe. Yet we consider that our relations still \nneed to be further enhanced and developed, through an \nequitable, solidarity-based partnership that rests on \nmutual respect and is in line with our strategic and \ncivilizational choices in terms of political reform and \n \n \n9 10-55276 \n \neconomic, social and cultural development. This will \nstrengthen the ties of cooperation and solidarity, and \nhelp reduce disparities between the countries and \npeoples of the two shores of the Mediterranean. On the \nbasis of those principles Tunisia supported the \nestablishment of the Union for the Mediterranean, a \npromising initiative that can create a new dynamism in \nEuro-Mediterranean relations, promote a positive \ninteraction to meet the coming challenges, and enhance \nsecurity and stability in our Mediterranean region. \n Tunisia is endeavouring to respond positively to \nthe huge changes occurring on the international scene, \nby developing the mechanisms of consultation and \ncooperation with all the American and Asian countries. \nOur country attaches great importance to the promotion \nof its relations with large regional blocs in the \nAmerican and Asian continents, so as to enrich \ncooperation and explore new fields for a strong \npartnership serving mutual interests. In this context, at \nthe end of this year Tunisia will host the Japan-Arab \nEconomic Forum. It will also host, in 2012, the Fifth \nMinisterial Meeting of the China-Arab Cooperation \nForum. \n Tunisia is also keen on promoting rapprochement \nwith South American countries, within an Arab or \nAfrican framework. \n The values of mutual support and solidarity, \nwhich constitute the pillar of our country\u2019s policy and \norientation, and which have now become a deeply-\nanchored tradition, demand that we give immediate \nassistance to countries stricken by natural disasters, \nwhich cause thousands of deaths in many countries of \nthe world. Tunisia has responded promptly to the \nurgent calls by the Secretary-General to help disaster-\nstricken countries, such as Pakistan, which was \nrecently ravaged by floods, and Haiti, which early this \nyear was hit by a devastating earthquake, in which \nTunisia and the United Nations lost one of their \neminent diplomats, known for his great competence \nand generous devotion, the late H\u00e9di Annabi, head of \nthe United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. \n Today, the world urgently needs to adopt an \nefficient policy to protect the environment, so as to \nspare humanity the adverse consequences of climate \nchange, which over the past three decades has caused \nthe international community huge economic losses.  \n The Assembly is certainly aware that climate \nchange has a serious impact on stability in many \ncountries, given the many problems caused, especially \nby global warming, drought and floods, and the resulting \ndegradation of harvests and scarcity of water resources. \nOnce again, Tunisia underlines the need to accelerate the \npace of international talks on climate change, while \ngiving priority to human interests over economic \nbenefits, so as to reach an agreement guaranteeing that \na minimum of measures will be taken to meet the huge \nchallenges posed by climate change, particularly in the \ndeveloping and the least developed countries. \n Tunisia calls for the establishment of a decisive \nintervention programme to help remedy the effects of \nclimate change and the problems it causes in terms of \necosystems, farming policies, and international food \nsecurity in general. In this context, Tunisia reiterates its \nsupport for the African position and underlines the \nimportance of helping African countries to face the \neffects of climate change. Tunisia commends the \nattention given by Japan and Korea to this issue. We \nhope that the forthcoming Mexico summit will produce \npositive results that can help achieve the objectives in \nthis vital field. \n At the present session the Assembly has devoted \na large part of its agenda to the evaluation of our \ncountries\u2019 achievements in the implementation of the \nMDGs, five years before 2015. Implementing the \nGoals and meeting the challenges resulting from the \nnew world order, with the deep changes that it has \ngenerated, require that we step up action to embody the \nprinciples of the Charter in international relations, and \nto anchor the culture of dialogue and the values of \ntolerance, civilizational communication and solidarity \namong peoples. \n Tunisia reaffirms its determination to continue \nactively contributing to joint international action to \nfind adequate, fair and durable solutions to current \nproblems, through joining in all efforts based on \ndialogue, mutual respect, consensus and mutual \nsupport within the framework of the United Nations. \nThat is the ideal framework for international action to \npromote security, peace and stability in the world, so \nthat our peoples can apply all their efforts and capacities \nfor comprehensive and sustainable development and for \nrealizing their legitimate aspirations for prosperity and \na decent standard of living. \n The current international situation can only \nstrengthen our adherence to the United Nations and its \nfounding principles, and bolster our determination to \n  \n \n10-55276 10 \n \nreaffirm its central role in meeting challenges and to \nconfer more efficiency on its activities and programmes, \ngiven its pivotal role in global governance.  \n In this regard, Tunisia hopes that Member States \nwill reach the largest possible consensus for \nintroducing the necessary reforms into the United \nNations system, especially as regards the composition \nof the Security Council, and for giving more \ntransparency and efficiency to the Organization\u2019s \nperformance; that is in addition to further enhancing \nthe role of the General Assembly, which includes all \nthe Member States, and that of the Economic and \nSocial Council. \n To conclude, I once again wish all success to the \nAssembly at the current session, at which we hope it \nwill make constructive recommendations that serve all \nthe peoples of the world, promote peace and stability, \noffer wider prospects for progress and prosperity, and \nhelp meet challenges with confidence and efficiency."

        "file_text": "Last week we reaffirmed \nour commitment to the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). We agreed to accelerate our efforts. \nDeveloping countries themselves have the main \nresponsibility for achieving the MDGs, and the \ninternational community has the responsibility to assist \nby means of development and debt relief where \nappropriate. Norway is and will continue to be a solid \nand reliable partner in development. We will keep our \ndevelopment aid at its present substantial level, \nincluding our significant support to United Nations \nfunds and programmes. \n This year in particular, we are heartened to see \nstrong support for improving maternal health and \nreducing child mortality, the Goals on which we are \nlagging behind the most. Norway will work with the \nSecretary-General to ensure that his Global Strategy \nfor Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Health is transformed into \naction on the ground. \n The many successful and inspiring meetings last \nweek also illustrate that the challenges facing the \nworld, which are increasingly global in character, \nrequire inclusive global forums to address them. That \nmeans engaging in dialogue with others, often with \nthose who have different views. The United Nations is \nnot designed to comfort different leaders in their own \nconvictions; it is the place to confront and surpass \ndifferences. It is therefore highly inappropriate when \nthis rostrum is abused to promote extreme views or \nunfounded claims. The challenges before us are too \ngreat to allow us to be derailed by attempts to incite \nconflict. We must never forget that we are a global \ncommunity by virtue of the shared risks that stand \nbefore us, the shared threats that challenge us and the \nshared values that bind us together. \n \n \n15 10-55408 \n \n Climate change threatens all our social and \neconomic aspirations. Let me point to two important \nand dynamic processes that are among the most \npromising as we look for potential results in Canc\u00fan: \nlimiting emissions from deforestation, and financing. \n The Secretary-General\u2019s High-Level Advisory \nGroup on Climate Change Financing, which the Prime \nMinister of Norway chairs together with the Prime \nMinister of Ethiopia, is working hard to identify \nsources that can enable us to raise the funds we \ncommitted to in Copenhagen. We need to define \nworkable and acceptable sources, both private and \npublic, and help pave the way for a new international \nclimate agreement. We urge all Members to study the \nreport we will receive this fall with an open mind and \nto build on this important work taking place at the \ninitiative of the Secretary-General, as we prepare for \nCanc\u00fan and the period beyond. \n Norway is leading support schemes for reducing \nemissions from deforestation. In Bali in 2007, Norway \npledged to provide up to $500 million on an annual \nbasis to halt deforestation. We are working with key \npartners such as Brazil, Indonesia and Guyana to \ndevelop concrete methods to do this in practice. Such \nmeasures are effective as a means of mitigation and \nprovide strong leverage for new and additional \nfinancing for developing countries. They take effect \nimmediately. I call on other countries to join in this \ngreat endeavour. \n Ten years ago, we reaffirmed the connection \nbetween the three pillars of the United Nations: \ndevelopment, security and human rights. Human rights \nare an integral part of the United Nations vision and \nCharter, and should be mainstreamed in the work of the \nUnited Nations in all areas, as previously called for by \nthis Assembly. Norway will continue to be active in the \nHuman Rights Council and promote a human rights-\nbased approach in United Nations development work. \nWe will continue to work with partner countries from \nthe North and South to this end, as we successfully did \nlast week at the Trygve Lie Symposium on \nFundamental Freedoms, focused on business and \nhuman rights. \n This year also marks the 10-year anniversary of \nanother major United Nations building block \u2014 \nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women and \npeace and security. Women\u2019s empowerment is a crucial \nfactor not only in sustainable development, but also in \nsustainable peace. It is time to make good on the \ncommitments made and follow through on promises \nthat will enable women to take an active role in \nsituations that are a matter of life and death, not only \nfor them, but for their families, communities and even \nnations. When we do take stock in October, we should \nfocus on action taken, and above all on action that \nneeds to be taken. \n Norway would like to echo the vision and hope \nvoiced by President Obama in this Assembly that we \nmay in the near future have an agreement that will lead \nto the entry of a new Member into the United  \nNations \u2014 an independent, sovereign State of \nPalestine. \n The Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, which is chaired \nby Norway, has called for assistance to the Palestinian \nAuthority in implementing the Programme for the \nThirteenth Government for completing the task of \nbuilding a Palestinian State, with regard to institution-\nbuilding and the development of a sustainable \nPalestinian economy. The donors have been \nencouraged by recent reports that the implementation \nof the reform agenda accelerated significantly in the \nfirst half of 2010. The World Bank stated that if the \nPalestinian Authority were to maintain its current \nperformance, it is well positioned for the establishment \nof a State at any point in the future. \n It is crucial that this progress be mirrored by \nprogress in the peace negotiations. Norway welcomes \nthe relaunching earlier this month of direct bilateral \nnegotiations to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We \nregret that Israel\u2019s settlement moratorium was not \nextended. Norway reaffirms its strong commitment to \nthe two-State solution and to supporting the \nnegotiations by ensuring full compliance with Road \nMap obligations and maintaining their assistance to the \nPalestinian State-building effort. \n Allow me to underline another process with \nenormous importance for regional peace, security and \ndevelopment. Supporting the parties in the full and \ntimely implementation of the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement for the Sudan must be on our agenda. We \ncannot afford to end up in a situation where we all \nregret that we let peace slip in the Sudan. \n For over 60 years, the United Nations system, \nincluding the Bretton Woods institutions, has been the \nglobal intergovernmental framework for cooperation \non joint challenges. Current trends in global \n  \n \n10-55408 16 \n \ncooperation may point towards a looser, more \nfragmented structure of global governance. There is a \nfine line between such strategic alliances as \ncomplementary to traditional multilateralism, and as \nalternatives for global multilateralism with the direct or \nindirect representation of all States. This is why \nNorway attaches great importance to the ongoing \ndiscussion on how to best facilitate constructive \ncooperation between the Group of 20 and the United \nNations. \n United Nations reform has been a topic of many \nstatements during this debate. In order to remain \nrelevant, the United Nations must continuously reform \nand adapt to a changing environment and new \nchallenges. As Member States, we have the \nresponsibility to ensure that the Organization is \nequipped to respond to the task it is given. Therefore \nwe must continue to push for United Nations reform, \nbut with a view to improving and strengthening the \nUnited Nations. We must build on what is already in \nprogress and seems to be yielding results. Delivering as \none is showing progress at the country level. It now \nneeds to be followed up at Headquarters. The \nestablishment of UN Women is a system-wide \ncoherence success story. We congratulate Ms. Bachelet \nand pledge to support her in delivering on the promises \nmade to UN Women. Beyond new panels and \nprocesses, we now need to finalize work on proposals \nthat are already on the table. \n For Norway, commitment to the United Nations \nalso means commitment to reform \u2014 to strive for a \nUnited Nations that is efficient and able to live up to \nthe expectations that we, the Member States, place on \nit. We owe it to each other and to future generations to \nmaintain and strengthen the United Nations as a \nunique, inclusive and global meeting place where we, \nthe peoples of this world, come together to solve the \nglobal challenges of our time. This is our common \nresponsibility. "

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate \nyou, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. We \nare confident that with your vast academic and political \nexperience, you will provide the Assembly with the \nnecessary leadership in the year ahead. Allow me to \nalso commend your predecessor, His Excellency  \nMr. Ali Treki, for his many initiatives and guidance in \nsteering the sixty-fourth session to a successful \nconclusion. \n My delegation welcomes your proposal on \n\u201cReaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \nglobal governance\u201d as the theme for the general debate \nof this session. That theme is most appropriate, as it \ncomes at a time when the world looks to the United \nNations for its stewardship in addressing the multiple \nglobal crises, the devastating effects of climate change \nand the issue of the maintenance of global peace and \nsecurity. The United Nations has long been recognized \nas an indispensable global Organization due to its \nmandate, and must continuously adapt itself to deal \nwith the challenges confronting the world so that its \npivotal role in global governance is maintained. No \nother multilateral organization or intergovernmental \ngrouping, without the legitimacy of universal \nmembership, can hope to replace the centrality of the \nUnited Nations in global affairs. \n The vast majority of Members of the United \nNations are small States. The principle of sovereign \nequality enshrined in the United Nations Charter \nestablishes that all States, regardless of size, wealth, \nrelative power, population or level of development, are \naccorded equal opportunity to participate and \ncontribute to the work of the United Nations, its \nprincipal organs and its high-level posts. That, in fact, \nis the bedrock upon which this House was founded 64 \nyears ago. It is a principle that must remain in the \nforefront and help chart our course further as our \ndialogue on United Nations reform continues.  \n How can we, as Members of the United Nations, \ncredibly espouse equity among nations and peoples if \nwe fail to practise it among ourselves? After 39 years \nof membership, Bhutan continues to believe that the \nUnited Nations still has room and a role for smaller \nStates, as equal partners in global affairs, including in \nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \nFor that reason, Bhutan is seeking membership in the \nSecurity Council in a non-permanent seat for the term \n2013 and 2014. \n Last week at the High-level Plenary Meeting, our \nheads of State and Government acknowledged the \nplight of millions of people living in poverty and \nagreed to recommit themselves to keeping their pledge \non the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The \nsuccessful achievement of the MDGs by all Member \nStates will serve as a measure of the effectiveness of \nthe United Nations. The United Nations must therefore \ncontinue to provide the necessary leadership to foster \nrenewed global partnership to enable the realization of \nall the MDGs by 2015. \n On 20 September, Bhutan\u2019s Prime Minister \nhighlighted to this gathering the need to move beyond \nconventional development practices (see A/65/PV.3). \nHe therefore proposed the inclusion of happiness as the \nninth Millennium Development Goal. My delegation is \nhopeful that that proposal of my Prime Minister will \nreceive the support of the United Nations membership. \n  \n \n10-55396 26 \n \n My delegation is pleased to note that the reform \nagenda initiated following the World Summit in 2005 is \nbeginning to yield results. In that regard, we welcome \nthe Assembly\u2019s unanimous adoption of the resolution \non system-wide coherence (resolution 64/289) early in \nJuly 2010, which, inter alia, established UN Women. \nThe creation of UN Women effectively consolidates all \nthe existing mandates and functions relating to women \nand constitutes an important step in fulfilling the \ncommitments undertaken in the Fourth World \nConference on Women, held in Beijing. We are \nconfident that that entity will address the global issues \nof gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment with \ngreat vigour. \n Bhutan has long been convinced that no society \ncan be a happy one if it is not inclusive. Promoting the \nconditions that will enable the pursuit of national \nhappiness by all our citizens, so that, regardless of \nrace, sex, language, religion, politics or other status, \nthey may enjoy a good quality of life in a progressive \nand prosperous country is not only one of the \nobjectives of government, it is our moral obligation. \nThis spirit is further reaffirmed by our Constitution, \nwhich guarantees the fundamental rights of all \nBhutanese, thus demonstrating that Bhutan is \ncommitted to building an inclusive society, one that \nenables all Bhutanese, including those with disabilities, \nto lead fulfilling lives, to contribute and to participate \nas full members of society. My Government was \ntherefore particularly pleased to sign the United \nNations Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities on 21 September 2010. \n We are also pleased to note that resolution 64/289 \non system-wide coherence will contribute to the \nenhancement of the operational activities of the United \nNations, making the funding system more systematic \nand harmonizing the overall governance structure. This \nwould improve the capacity of the United Nations to \nmore effectively deliver assistance to countries, thus \nstrengthening its development pillar. \n My delegation recognizes the important role of \nthe General Assembly in setting the global agenda and \ndealing with many of the important issues confronting \nthe international community today. With each passing \nyear, the responsibilities entrusted to the General \nAssembly, as the chief deliberative and policy-making \nbody of the United Nations, continue to grow, and we \nbelieve that the authority of the General Assembly \nmust be simultaneously enhanced to assume the \ngrowing mandate entrusted to it. We therefore \nappreciate the progress made by the Ad Hoc Working \nGroup on the Revitalization of the General Assembly, \nwhere a number of key issues have been highlighted, \nespecially the strengthening of the Office of the \nPresident of the General Assembly. We are confident \nthat, with the political determination of Member States, \nthose deliberations will result in a stronger United \nNations. \n We are encouraged that, in the past year, the five \nrounds of intergovernmental negotiations on the \nquestion of equitable representation in and larger \nmembership of the Security Council and other matters \nrelated to the Council, held under the chairmanship of \nAmbassador Zahir Tanin of Afghanistan, is making \ngood progress. My delegation supports the expansion \nof both the permanent and the non-permanent \nmembership of the Security Council to reflect the \ncontemporary realities and make it a more \nrepresentative body. We believe that India, Japan, \nGermany and Brazil plus two countries from the \nAfrican continent, which have the capacity and \nresources to shoulder the onerous responsibilities with \nregard to the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity, should be granted permanent membership. \n Given the renewed commitment of the \ninternational community to the MDGs with a view to \nimproving the lives of the people in the poorest \ncountries, it is most timely that the Fourth United \nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries \nshould take place in 2011 in Turkey. We thank the \nGovernment of Turkey for its generous offer and \nassistance in hosting this important Conference. We \nalso appreciate the efforts of the United Nations Office \nof the High Representative for the Least Developed \nCountries, Landlocked Developing Countries and \nSmall Island Developing States in coordinating \npreparations for the Conference. \n As we undertake preparations for this event, we \nwill look to you, Mr. President, for your support and \ndirection, so that the least developed countries (LDCs) \ntogether with all our development partners cannot only \nensure a successful outcome, but also, more \nimportantly, give their people a chance for a better life. \nWe are confident that the Conference will build on the \nsuccesses of the Programme of Action for the Least \nDeveloped Countries for the Decade 2001-2010 and \nadopt new measures and strategies for the development \nof the LDCs in the next decade. \n \n \n27 10-55396 \n \n As most fittingly described, the other defining \nchallenge of our time, namely, climate change, requires \nthe collective and coordinated effort of all nations, as \nits devastating effects know no bounds. My country has \nfull faith in the leadership of the United Nations and \nbelieves in the centrality of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change in \naddressing climate change. We are confident that the \nongoing negotiations will lead to a concrete, \ncomprehensive and equitable agreement at the \nsixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange in Canc\u00fan later this year, as envisaged under \nthe Bali Action Plan. Success will be essential in \nCanc\u00fan for small and vulnerable countries such as my \nown, which bears a heavier burden as the result of \nclimate change. We must have the necessary resources \nfor mitigation and adaptation. \n With the severe threats and damaging effects \ncaused by climate change in South Asia, as recently \noccurred in Pakistan, it was no coincidence that the \nsixteenth Summit of the South Asian Association for \nRegional Cooperation (SAARC), which Bhutan was \nhonoured to host in April this year, appropriately chose \nclimate change as its theme. In addition to adopting the \nThimphu Silver Jubilee Declaration, entitled \u201cTowards \na Green and Happy South Asia\u201d, the Summit also \nadopted the Thimphu Statement on Climate Change. \nThe Statement outlines important initiatives to further \nstrengthen and intensify regional cooperation to \naddress the adverse impacts of climate change in South \nAsia. One of the important outcomes of the Thimphu \nSummit is the formulation of a common SAARC \nstatement on climate change, which Bhutan, as the \ncurrent SAARC Chair, will present at the forthcoming \nConference of the Parties in December in Canc\u00fan. \n We are pleased to report that, as Bhutan \nprogresses into its third year as a democratic \nconstitutional monarchy, the foundations for a \nsustainable and vibrant democracy are growing \nstronger. The institutional arrangements for the three \nbranches of Government, as required under our \nConstitution, are now complete and functioning with \nthe establishment of the Supreme Court earlier this \nyear. Likewise, all the constitutional bodies with \noversight functions have been firmly established, and \nthe media is performing its role as the fourth estate in \nan atmosphere of freedom. \n There is no doubt that, given the challenges \nconfronting our increasingly interdependent world, the \nrole of the United Nations is vital in addressing those \nissues. In order to do so, the United Nations requires \nthe full support and commitment of the entire \nmembership. Only then will it be able to truly reaffirm \nits central role in global governance. I therefore \nconclude by assuring you, Mr. President, of my \ndelegation\u2019s full support and cooperation, as you \nembark on a year-long journey of further strengthening \nthis Organization. \n"

        "file_text": "It is a \nspecial honour for me to address the sixty-fifth session \nof the General Assembly. I would like to congratulate \nthe President on his election to this important position. \nHis experience and continuing commitment strengthen \nmy conviction that he will take the achievements of his \npredecessor even further. Albania will fully support \nhim as he fulfils his mandate. I take this opportunity to \nexpress our special appreciation to the Secretary-\nGeneral for his continuing efforts to revitalize the \nglobal role of the United Nations, as well as to reform \nthe Organization. \n Albania is of the view that the role of the United \nNations remains powerful, coherent and irreplaceable \nas the centre of effective global action. It must \ncontinue to be encouraged and supported in its efforts \nto overcome the challenges of achieving open \ninternational cooperation, sustainable peace and \nsecurity, ongoing development and greater respect for \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. \n We live in a global world, interconnected and \ninterdependent, where States and nations must assist \nand support each other in the search for a \ncomprehensive answer to the common problems and \nnew challenges that we face. Multilateralism remains a \npriority for the entire international community. In this \ncontext, a reformed United Nations \u2014 revitalized, \ndynamic, powerful and effective \u2014 is crucial to the \ncomplicated process of global governance. In this path \nof cooperation around the world, the role of the United \nNations is irreplaceable, especially in regard to how we \nmake use of our human and material resources. \n Rapidly evolving issues throughout the world, \neach with positive and negative consequences that \nmust inevitably influence the challenges the future will \nbring, must be given special priority and approached \nwith special care. The United Nations challenging \nagenda must focus on strengthening peace and security, \nfighting terrorism, and the issues of stable \ndevelopment, climate change, poverty reduction, the \nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \nnatural disasters, human rights, migration, and others. \nAlbania remains committed to contributing to this \nagenda. \n The lead role of the Organization and its agencies \nin administering its budgetary and human resources \nshould be responsive to the requests of Member States. \nThe establishment of the United Nations Entity for \nGender Equality and the Empowerment of Women is \nthe most recent example of tangible success in United \nNations reform. Strengthening the role of women in \nsociety will not only enhance political life but also help \ntheir emancipation and harmonious development. \n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are \na priority in our work. Following the adoption of the \nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) a decade ago, \nAlbania has advanced towards meeting the MDGs in \nall areas and with respect to all indicators. It has also \nmade great efforts to incorporate the MDGs into its \nnational development strategy. \n We are fully committed to reaching the goals set \nforth in the acquis communautaire of the European \nUnion (EU), which requires increasing investment in \nsocial issues, establishing local and central governance \nsystems, and enhancing development capacity in order \nto guarantee the ongoing improvement of the well-\nbeing of the Albanian people. However, as a full-\nfledged member of NATO and in the light of its \ninternal democratic stability, Albania is now seeking \ngreater standing in the world as a way to bolster its \ndevelopment in the long term. \n Delivering as one is a crucial factor in the reform \ndesigned to assist in development around the world. \nUnited Nations efforts to establish system-wide \ncoherence offer a real possibility to make the United \n \n \n29 10-54833 \n \nNations more effective. As a pilot country, Albania is a \nsuccess story, having committed itself fully from the \nonset. The One United Nations concept in Albania is \nbeing developed in complete harmony with national \nsovereignty and national ownership of development, \nwhile responding to the specific needs of the country. \nThe responsibility of being a pilot country further \nencourages us to make this initiative a success. It is \nalso an opportunity for us to contribute to the overall \nreform of the United Nations. \n Albania has signed a memorandum of \nunderstanding with the United Nations Department of \nPeacekeeping Operations. As a NATO member, \nAlbania is a force for peace and stability in the region. \nNot only does Albania follow a policy of good-\nneighbourly relations and strive for the preservation \nand strengthening of stability in its own region, it also \nhas shown its interest in and commitment to stability \nand peace in other parts of the world by contributing \nmilitary and civilian personnel to the peacekeeping \nmissions of various international security organizations \nand of the United Nations, including the United \nNations Mission in the Central African Republic and \nChad and missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. We are \nthus willing to contribute peacekeeping troops \nanywhere in the world under the auspices of the United \nNations and regional security organizations like NATO. \n Terrorism remains a major threat to peace, \ninternational security and world order. The fight \nagainst terrorism remains a priority that requires great \ndetermination resolve. This global threat may be \nprevented and addressed through collective action, \nstrong responses and the mobilization of all States \nMembers of the United Nations. We must show our \nnations that, as a part of our responsibility, we shall \nstand resolute and united against terrorism. Together, \nwe must define a collective platform and strategy for \nvictory in the war against terror by strengthening the \ninternational system and order. \n We praise and appreciate the work of the Security \nCouncil and its committees for their engagement with \nand active support for Member States through their \neffective implementation of the Council\u2019s counter-\nterrorism resolutions, in particular resolutions 1269 \n(1999), 1373 (2001), 1540 (2004) and 1624 (2005). \nAlbania remains fully committed to cooperating with \nthe Security Council in this regard. \n Albania appreciates the Secretary-General\u2019s \ncontributions to addressing the issue of the Middle \nEast, particularly in the discussions aimed at achieving \na sustainable solution acceptable to all parties. All \npeoples share the desire to live in peace, and \nGovernments have an obligation to guarantee it. We \nsupport the relaunched dialogue process and hope that, \nwith the commitment of the international community, \nthe Palestinians and Israelis will take the steps \nnecessary to achieving stable peace in that important \nregion. \n Albania believes that the Alliance of Civilizations \nis a political means for the United Nations to promote \npeace and harmony among civilizations and to build an \ninclusive society through education, understanding and \nmutual knowledge. As a member of the Group of \nFriends, we shall take active part because we believe in \ndialogue and contacts among different cultures, in the \nneed to know and respect each other, and in the \nnecessity of defending the unique as part of the \nrichness of the whole. Our approved national strategy \nfor intercultural dialogue and the holding of the \nInter-Religious Forum in Tirana in January have served \nto enrich our experience. However, our participation in \nthe Third Global Forum of the Alliance of Civilizations \nled us to believe that a better job of fighting \nstereotypes and prejudice is still needed, as are greater \nefforts to make modern multicultural societies more \ncohesive. \n Albania\u2019s integration into and membership of the \nEuropean Union is a key priority of our foreign policy, \nwhere there has rarely been a broader political and \nsocial consensus. The important steps taken by Albania \ntowards EU membership and the phases of cooperation \nunder the framework of the integration process have \nshown a great deal of potential. \n The end of this year promises to be decisive as \nwe approach two decisions of great importance: the \ncompletion of the visa liberalization process with the \nEU and the achievement of candidate status for EU \nmembership. Albanians will finally be able to enjoy the \nreal freedom for which they fought and sacrificed \nlonger and more deeply than any other European \nnation. The near-unanimous decision of the European \nParliament\u2019s Committee on Foreign Affairs to remove \nthe requirement that Albanians obtain visas to enter the \nEU not only gives us great joy, but also confers greater \nresponsibility on us to fulfil our commitments as we \nprepare for EU membership. \n  \n \n10-54833 30 \n \n We guarantee that the seriousness with which we \ncompleted the EU questionnaire and our responsible \napproach to our relations with all European Union \ninstitutions and member countries will remain the \nhallmarks of our efforts to earn the status of candidate \ncountry at the earliest possible date. \n Albania\u2019s membership in NATO and its \nintegration into the European Union are important \nregional processes inseparable from the full integration \nof the region. We believe that every Western Balkan \ncountry is entitled to play a role in contributing to and \nassuming responsibility for the integration and \nemancipation of the region. I am happy to acknowledge \nthat the high level of regional cooperation and political \nawareness show that the only way forward is through \nEuro-Atlantic integration. \n These are hopeful and promising times, now that \nthe bitter past of that part of Europe has been \nconsigned to history. Albania and Albanians will \ncontinue to contribute to stability, security, long-term \npeace and economic growth by encouraging integration \npolicies related not just to security and economic \ndevelopment, but also to coexistence among countries, \npeoples and nations, cultures, traditions and history. \n A few days ago, a rare occurrence took place in \nthis very Hall with the adoption by consensus of \nresolution 64/298 on the international legitimacy of the \ndeclaration of Kosovo\u2019s independence. That was a very \nimportant event for Kosovo, Serbia, the Western \nBalkans, a united Europe and the United Nations. I \nwould like to express my gratitude for the commitment \nand engagement of all international actors, especially \nthe European Union, which imbued the resolution with \nthe contemporary philosophy and openness of Europe. \nThe European Union showed its cohesiveness and \nproved that the integration policies of our region are \nunstoppable and full of hope, and that the only way to \nunite with Europe is through dialogue and cooperation \namong neighbouring countries. \n Now that the matter of the status of Kosovo and \nits borders has been settled definitively, it is time to \nbegin a dialogue on practical issues. We hope that the \nmessage enshrined in the resolution will immediately \nbe put into practice by the two independent countries. \nWe support the immediate launch of dialogue between \nKosovo and Serbia. We support sincere and \nconstructive dialogue to resolve practical issues of \ninterest to the daily concerns of their citizens, to help \nthem and to facilitate and even calm the situation of the \nrespective Albanian and Serbian minorities. It is time \nto resolve the problems and issues concerning \nrepresentation, language and education, among others, \nin the spirit and vision of a common European future. \n Albania considers the consensus adoption of \nresolution 64/298 to be an important step not only in \nrespect of the advisory opinion of the International \nCourt of Justice and the authority of the United \nNations, but also for the consolidation of the State of \nKosovo and its democratic and European institutions, \nits independence and integrity, and its future as a \nMember of the United Nations. \n Albania appreciates the work of the Security \nCouncil in its engagement towards the implementation \nof the United Nations Charter and international law, \nwhich are essential to peaceful coexistence and \ncooperation among Member States in addressing \ncommon challenges and contributing to international \npeace and security. \n The advisory opinion of the International Court \nof Justice legally confirmed that the independence of \nKosovo remains a sui generis case that does not set a \nprecedent for situations in other countries. Now is the \ntime to prove with concrete facts that we respect the \nUnited Nations and the values that have united us here \ntoday. Today is the day to testify that we support its \nauthority and its independent institutions. Today is a \ngolden opportunity to accept the truth and to declare it \nloudly. \n Today, we have a responsibility towards a country \nand a people that rightly wish to be among us and have \ngiven ample evidence that they truly deserve it. I take \nthis opportunity to appeal to my colleagues, whose \ncountries have not yet recognized the independence of \nKosovo, to recognize it now, by assuring them that this \nis the only way to contribute to long-term stability and \npeace, not just in the region but also globally. \n In conclusion, I would like to confirm once again \nthat Albania is determined to continue to support the \nUnited Nations agenda and the stronger functioning of \nthe Organization at all levels."

        "file_text": "It is a pleasure for me to address \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. \n We meet following the historic review summit on \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the High-\nlevel Plenary Meeting of the Assembly, which gave us \nthe opportunity to review progress and share \nexperiences and ideas on how best to achieve our set \ngoals and objectives for 2015. As we return to our \nrespective countries we go with renewed commitment \nto keep working harder to meet the MDGs. \n I would like at the outset to extend our thanks and \nappreciation to the Secretary-General and the United \nNations agencies for their presence around the world. \nWe commend the active participation of the United \nNations in various missions, such as efforts to restore \npeace in conflict areas, and its role in disaster relief \nand in various exercises to fight hunger and poverty. \n We pledge ourselves to continue to support the \nUnited Nations in its primary role of ensuring that all \nthe nations of the world live peacefully with each other \nwhile supporting nation-building through development \nprojects. \n The theme for this sixty-fifth session, \n\u201cReaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \nglobal governance\u201d, came at a most opportune time in \n \n \n7 10-55103 \n \nthe life of the United Nations, since we have been \ncalling for all our voices to be heard. I must hasten to \nstate that all the wars and conflicts that we see around \nthe world can only be resolved through peaceful \ndialogue and negotiations. The United Nations is the \norganization best positioned for this task. There is no \nplace for unilateralism. \n It is on this basis that the Kingdom of eSwatini \nreaffirms our call for the finalization of the United \nNations reforms, with particular reference to the \nSecurity Council. It should be appreciated that the \nworld today faces a new set of challenges, different \nfrom those that it faced when our Organization was \nfounded in 1945; thus the urgent need for the United \nNations to remain dynamic and transform itself to meet \ntoday\u2019s challenges. \n One of the major organs that require immediate \nreform is the Security Council, which has seen a \nnumber of regions expressing a desire to gain \nmembership, to ensure wider representation. The \nKingdom of eSwatini stands by the African position, as \nclearly stated in the Ezulwini Consensus, that Africa \nshould have two permanent and five non-permanent \nseats. We hope that during this session this matter will \nbe finalized. \n We in the African continent are committed to \nresolving all conflicts through peaceful dialogue. The \ncoordination and cooperation between the African \nUnion and its various regional blocs is beginning to \npay handsome dividends. We now approach issues as a \ncollective for better results. We are happy that the \nUnited Nations continues to work and cooperate with \nus in effecting our programmes for peacebuilding and \npeacekeeping. \n The General Assembly will know that the African \nUnion declared 2010 to be our Year of Peace and \nSecurity. We have made it clear that all perpetrators of \ncoups and civil wars and all forms of conflict should be \ndealt with squarely and decisively. Indeed, we are \ncommitted to the promotion of lasting peace, because it \nis a prerequisite for achieving sustainable development. \nWe appreciate the support of the United Nations in our \nresolve to ensure that peace prevails in the continent \nand, indeed, the whole world. \n I am happy to say that I personally had the \nhonour of lighting and hoisting the African flame of \npeace twice this year. The Swazi nation prides itself on \nthis, because we are a peaceful nation, which is telling \nthe world that peace is the best formula for \ndevelopment. \n Another issue that touches upon global \ngovernance is that of the Kingdom of Morocco. It is \nour considered view that the United Nations, working \nwith relevant regional organizations, should work on \nthe issue and find a lasting solution. \n We note with concern the continued conflicts in \nMadagascar, Somalia, Darfur, the Middle East and \nAfghanistan, to mention just a few. We call for the \nrestoration of peace in all those areas, as it is always \ndisturbing to see people undergo so much suffering due \nto conflicts. \n While Afghanistan is still undergoing its process \nof reconciliation and the reconstruction of its \ninstitutions, it is depressing to note that there are at \ntimes pockets that seem to disturb the peace process in \nthat country. We must continue to work hard to find \nlasting solutions, because such instability affects peace \nand prosperity, not only in Afghanistan, but also in \nneighbouring States and the region. \n The Kingdom of eSwatini draws hope from the \npromising developments in Iraq, as that country \ncontinues on the road to peace through restoration of \nits important institutions for self-determination. \n Furthermore, we are also following with keen \ninterest efforts to ensure peace between Israel and \nPalestine. We are pleased to note the concerted \nmediation efforts led by the United States of America \nin bringing the parties together in pursuit of peace in \nthe Middle East. We support this process, and remain \noptimistic that it will reach its desired conclusion, so \nthat the Israelis and Palestinians can live together in \nharmony. In order to concentrate all their efforts \ntowards development and peaceful coexistence, we call \nupon them to reach a compromise and place the best \ninterests of peace and security above everything else. \n Developments in cross-straits relations between \nthe Republic of China on Taiwan and the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China continue to be a source of \ninspiration to us all. We note with appreciation that the \nRepublic of China on Taiwan and the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China have made impressive strides to \npromote mutual understanding leading to more trade \nand interaction between them. I am happy to say that \nTaiwan highly appreciates being allowed to participate \nas an observer in the World Health Organization. \n  \n \n10-55103 8 \n \nHopefully, this will also lead to Taiwan\u2019s participating \nin a similar manner in all other United Nations \nagencies. Of particular interest is the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change. \n Our world today continues to be concerned about \nnuclear proliferation and the threat that weapons of \nmass destruction pose to human existence, world \npeace, economic development and the environment. \nThe spread of nuclear weapons makes a mockery of \nour efforts for world peace and protection of the \nenvironment. \n It is a disheartening fact that currently efforts to \nensure accountability and compliance with United \nNations resolutions are hindered by an apparent lack of \nimpartiality in the processes meant to completely rid \nthe world of deadly nuclear weapons. I call upon the \nUnited Nations to strengthen the capacity of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency to enable the \ninspectors to do their work more effectively, with the \ninvolvement of all the countries with nuclear \ncapability. \n The United Nations must never compromise the \nimplementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \nof Nuclear Weapons; it must ensure that all countries, \nwithout exception, comply. Countries must be made to \ncomply and be accountable within clear time frames. \n It is my suggestion that we eliminate all weapons \nof mass destruction, because they present an uncertain \nfuture. Indeed, we need a fresh start so that we may \nregain the moral high ground in deterring whoever may \nhave ambitions for nuclear capability in the future. For \nexample, if we compel everyone to dismantle their \nnuclear capacity we will be able to rein in other \ncountries which may still be developing their arsenal, \nwithout being accused of unfairness or bias. \n A world free of nuclear and other weapons of \nmass destruction will allow us to concentrate on issues \nof sustainable development. \n As a developing nation, the Kingdom of eSwatini \nis following with keen interest the issues surrounding \nthe effects of climate change. As an agriculture-based \neconomy, the Kingdom is also a victim of \nenvironmental degradation. We therefore look forward \nto the climate change Conference to be held in Mexico \nlater this year. I trust that the ongoing negotiations will \nresult in agreements acceptable to all parties. What is \nof paramount importance is for the developed world to \nhonour pledges to assist developing countries in their \nmitigation and adaptation efforts. \n It is a known fact that access to international \nmarkets for our products is one of the ways to grow our \neconomies in our quest to eradicate poverty. We are \nencouraged that the developed nations have opened \ntheir markets for some products from developing \ncountries. We look forward with optimism to an \namicable conclusion of the Doha Round of talks, an \noutcome essential to boost global trade and economic \nrecovery for the developing world. \n As part of our development and poverty \nalleviation strategy, the Kingdom is ready to explore \nand exploit existing and emerging markets. Our focus \nis on limiting exportation of raw material by \nemphasizing the production of finished goods. \n The Kingdom continues to promote equality in all \nsectors of our development spheres. We therefore \nwelcome the recent establishment of the new United \nNations entity for gender equality: UN Women. \nWomen the world over continue to play key roles in \ncontributing to the socio-economic and political \ndevelopment of our nations. \n We are meeting as a family of nations that seeks \nto promote peace and coexistence among all nations of \nthe world and bring hope for the future. Our people \nlook to us, as leaders, to take the lead in promoting \npeace, as enshrined in the Charter. \n We must find lasting solutions to all the \nchallenges. They include poverty, unemployment, \ndisease and global warming, but the major challenge is \nto make peace within and among all nations happen. \nBy finding solutions, we shall indeed guarantee a clear \nroad towards the achievement of sustainable \ndevelopment by all the nations of the world. We shall \nachieve that noble goal if we all reaffirm and adhere to \nthe central role of the United Nations in global \ngovernance."

        "file_text": " I am honoured to \naddress the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session \nas Minister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of \nBarbados. \n The theme of this year\u2019s session, concerning the \nrole of the United Nations, multilateralism and global \ngovernance, is timely, and it permits an examination of \nthe complex issues facing the global community today. \nMoreover, it lends itself to an exploration of solutions \nto those issues as well as to restoration of the centrality \nof the United Nations and its organs. \n A week ago leaders from every corner of the \nworld met and confirmed that the global consensus on \nthe United Nations Development Agenda remained \nintact. They pledged to spare no effort to ensure the \nfulfilment of our collective promise to the world\u2019s \npoorest and most vulnerable. \n Barbados shares the view of the Secretary-\nGeneral that the Millennium Development Goals must \nserve as \u201ca blueprint for ending extreme poverty\u201d \n(A/65/PV.3). The Goals are at the core of the global \ndevelopment agenda. They represent our common \nvision of a more peaceful, prosperous and just world, \nin which all human beings can enjoy better and safer \nlives. For the past decade these globally shared and \nendorsed set of priorities have inspired extraordinary \nefforts by Governments and non-State actors alike. \n Now is not the time for complacency. Progress \ntowards achievement of the Goals remains mixed, and, \nwhile success is still within our grasp, it is by no \nmeans certain. Our common task is therefore to convert \nthis unprecedented consensus into collective action on \nall fronts and immediately implement what has been \nagreed in order to guarantee success by 2015. Failing \nthis, the many words of the Outcome Document that \nwe adopted a few days ago will simply serve as yet \n \n \n17 10-55276 \n \nanother solemn reminder of human needs neglected \nand promises unfulfilled. \n This display of global solidarity in the face of \nunparalleled economic uncertainty reminds us that the \nUnited Nations is an invaluable and indispensable \ninstrument for its Member States and for the world\u2019s \npeoples, as we seek to respond to the challenges of our \ntimes. While we may not have the same degree of \nconsensus on every pressing global problem, Barbados \ncannot contemplate the prospect of a world without an \nOrganization such as this. No other entity can mobilize \nglobal political will and coordinated action around \ncommon causes, and provide a voice for the voiceless, \nlike the United Nations. \n Scarred by the bitter experience of two world \nwars and a great depression, the founders of this \nOrganization had the foresight and wisdom to \nrecognize that only through multilateralism and a \nstrong and effective system of global governance, with \nthe United Nations at its core, could lasting peace be \nmaintained and international law upheld. \n Today we bear witness to a world which is more \ninterconnected and intertwined, yet in a real sense \nmore deeply divided, than ever. Barbados is of the \nview that an enhanced and renewed system of global \ngovernance must be at the top of the global agenda. In \nthis regard, Mr. President, Barbados fully supports \nyour initiative to address this issue during the course of \nthis sixty-fifth session. We must take stock and reflect \nin a holistic and comprehensive manner on the system \nof global governance, including the United Nations and \nits organs, to ensure that it truly delivers on the vision \nof our predecessors and serves the interests of all \nmankind, particularly the poor and the vulnerable. \n Delivering global public goods such as global \neconomic and financial stability; ensuring the \npromotion and protection of human rights; maintaining \ninternational peace and security; and ensuring \nenvironmental sustainability: those matters cannot be \nsuccessfully addressed by States acting on their own, \nor even by coalitions of the willing. Finding effective \nsolutions to those challenges and mobilizing collective \naction provides the most immediate and obvious reason \nfor enhancing global governance and strengthening \nmultilateral cooperation. \n As United States President Harry Truman stated \non 25 April 1945 at the birth of this Organization, in \nhis address to the opening session of the United \nNations Conference on International Organization, held \nin San Francisco: \n \u201cDifferences between men, and between nations, \nwill always remain. In fact, if held within \nreasonable limits, such disagreements are actually \nwholesome. All progress begins with differences \nof opinion and moves onward as the differences \nare adjusted through reason and mutual \nunderstanding.\u201d \n Renewing the vision of our predecessors must \nstart with the United Nations and extend outwards to \nall organizations with a role in dispensing global \ngovernance. \n During this session we must finalize the decades-\nlong project of Security Council reform. If the Council \nis to retain its unique legitimacy it should be made \nmore broadly representative of the international \ncommunity as a whole, as well as of the geopolitical \nrealities of today. \n The Council\u2019s working methods must also be made \nto adhere to the highest standards of transparency, \naccountability and efficiency. Its outreach to  \nnon-members must be significantly improved.  \n Barbados continues to believe that the number of \npermanent and non-permanent seats on the Council \nshould be increased, and that Brazil, Germany, India \nand Japan should join the ranks of the permanent \nmembers. Membership from the African Group must \nalso be assured. \n Sustained and widespread future prosperity will \nrequire major reforms in global economic governance \nas well as new approaches to global economic \ndevelopment. The global financial and economic crisis \nhas made clear the extent of the interconnectivity of \nfinancial markets, as well as their inherent \nvulnerabilities. While there is no precedent for the \ncurrent level of global financial and economic \nintegration, the policies, rules and institutions \nestablished to govern those processes are predominately \nnational in scope, and global mechanisms highly \ncompartmentalized. \n We can no longer postpone the task of reforming \nthe institutions responsible for global economic and \nfinancial governance. They must be better equipped to \naddress the challenge of a globalized and highly \ninterdependent world. In this regard, Barbados \nwelcomes the broadening of the Group of 8 to include \n  \n \n10-55276 18 \n \nthe participation of developing and emerging economies \nand the designation of the Group of 20 (G-20) as the \npremier forum for international economic cooperation. \n We also recognize the important role played by \nthe G-20 in stabilizing the global economy. We \nacknowledge its ambitious agenda to restore global \ngrowth and achieve needed reforms in the world\u2019s \nfinancial systems. However, the Group must \nsignificantly enhance its outreach to non-members, \nincluding the smallest members of the international \ncommunity, particularly when issues affecting their \neconomic viability and survival are under discussion. \nFurthermore, it must also demonstrate real leadership \nin breaking the impasse in the World Trade \nOrganization and ensure a successful conclusion to the \nDoha Development Round. It must also ensure that \nreforms in the Bretton Woods institutions are \naccelerated. \n Small States have traditionally played a crucial \nrole in shaping global governance, and our voice \nshould not be diminished in efforts to reform the \ncurrent system. Barbados will play its part. It is against \nthe background of articulating the role and importance \nof multilateralism and a strong and effective United \nNations that I will explore the response of my country \nto these global challenges. I will also address the \nstrategies to be pursued by this small nation intent on \nplaying its part in this family of nations. Barbados is a \nsmall island developing State classified as a middle-\nincome developing country. It faces significant \nvulnerabilities made real by the spectre of climate \nchange and the associated natural disasters, the \nconsequences of the recent financial and economic \ncrises, and the threat posed by transnational criminal \nnetworks. My country has sought to take its place in a \nworld characterized by increasing economic, \nenvironmental and social complexities. We take our \nplace in a world in which the United Nations family \ncontinues to witness increasing economic interdependence \nand globalization, both posing challenges to national \nsovereignty. \n Barbados shares the United Nations vision for a \nworld able to achieve and surpass the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. We are committed to the fight \nagainst the ravages of HIV and AIDS and other \ninfectious diseases. As a natural-resources-poor small \nisland developing State, we have achieved much on the \nbasis of our investment in human development, \nprimarily in the areas of education and health. We have \nthus prioritized our responses to those global \nchallenges in a manner that puts our people first. Our \nsuccesses to date have been due to our investment in \nour key resource \u2014 our people. Given the emphasis on \nour people\u2019s development and the dangers posed to our \npopulation, we supported the resolution entitled \n\u201cPrevention and control of non-communicable \ndiseases\u201d (resolution 64/265), introduced by the \nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) at the sixty-fourth \nsession of the General Assembly in 2009. Our \nresponses can be seen in our efforts to achieve our \nultimate goal of crafting a green economy. We see the \ngreen economy as a tool for transforming our economy \nto achieve sustainable development. At the heart of this \neconomic and social model is a commitment to people-\ncentred development. Aligning our development \nstrategy along this particular trajectory ensures a \nconsistency not only with our global obligations but \nalso, and more importantly, with our national values \nand in the best interests of all our citizens. \n Even as the international community searches for \na definition of the green economy, Barbados has \nsimply defined this model as an integrated production, \ndistribution, consumption and waste assimilation \nsystem that, at its core, reflects the fragility of our \nsmall island ecosystems as the basis for policy \ninterventions for natural resource protection, business \nand investment choice, human development \nprogramming, and the facilitation of export market \ndevelopment strategies. \n In pursuit of the green economy the Government \nof Barbados has undertaken an assessment of the \nopportunities and challenges of a green economy \ntransition. Our focus is on the priority sectors of \ntourism, agriculture, transport and housing, along with \ncross-sectoral issues of water resources, energy and \nwaste. In addition, we have partnered with the United \nNations Environment Programme to promote a \ntransition to a green economy, building on existing \nBarbados initiatives in the area of resource efficiency \nand the promotion of sustainable consumption and \nproduction. We believe that our experience in \ntransitioning to a green economy will serve as a useful \nmodel for other small island developing States and \nsmall economies, and we intend to share our unique \nperspective with the international community in the \npreparatory process for the Rio+20 Summit in 2012. \n The efforts of Barbados to transform its economy \ninto a green economy and achieve sustainable \n \n \n19 10-55276 \n \ndevelopment will be undermined without ambitious \nand urgent global action to address climate change. The \nchallenge of climate change remains one of the great \nthreats to the survival and viability of Barbados and \nother small island developing States. Even as science \npoints to a worsening situation, global emissions \ncontinue to rise and the prospects seem dim of arriving \nat an agreement to provide legal certainty in the fight \nagainst climate change. It is clear that the objective of \nan ambitious and comprehensive legally binding \noutcome will not be achieved in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, in \nDecember this year. Barbados nevertheless believes \nthat the substantive outcomes at the sixteenth session \nof the Conference of Parties (COP-16) to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \nmust demonstrate that the international community \nremains committed to addressing the defining \nchallenge of our time. In this regard COP-16 should \ndeliver outcomes that: prioritize the needs of the most \nvulnerable, particularly in the areas of adaptation and \nfinance; finalize issues on which there is a broad \nagreement and provide guidance and clarity on the \ndifficult issues; and demonstrate progress on the \ndelivery of the $30 billion fast-start financing pledged \nat Copenhagen. Critical to the success at Canc\u00fan is \narriving at a common understanding of how, when and \nwhere an ambitious and legally binding international \nclimate agreement will be finalized. \n In 1994 Barbados had the distinct honour of \nhosting the first Global Conference on the Sustainable \nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. The \nBarbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius \nStrategy for Implementation (MSI) remain the essential \nblueprints for the sustainable development of small \nisland developing States. Barbados welcomes the \nrecently adopted outcome of the five-year review of the \nMSI and hopes that this will result in a renewal of the \ncommitment of the international community to support \nthe sustainable development of small island developing \nStates. It is of great concern to Barbados that, 18 years \nafter the international recognition of the special case of \nsmall island developing States at Rio, our unique and \nparticular vulnerability is being challenged. Barbados \nis not prepared to renegotiate the special case of small \nisland developing States but urges the international \ncommunity to focus on the delivery of tangible and \nconcrete actions to build resilience and promote \nsustainable development in small island developing \nStates. \n The January 2010 earthquake that devastated \nHaiti serves as a grim reminder of the fragility of \nisland States to natural disasters. In the immediate \naftermath of the earthquake, the Government of \nBarbados provided financial assistance, relief supplies \nand deployed a contingent of medical and security \npersonnel as part of a CARICOM relief team. If Haiti \nis to realize its full potential, the international \ncommunity must remain fully engaged in Haiti, and the \nmany pledges of financial and technical support must \nbe delivered on time. The Government and people of \nHaiti can be assured that Barbados will continue to be \na partner in this rebuilding and reconstruction phase. \nOur commitment remains strong, and we will play our \npart in Haiti\u2019s long-term development. We call on all \nwho have mobilized resources for the benefit of Haiti \nto work with countries like Barbados and in \ncollaboration with the Government and people of Haiti \nto rebuild that country. \n There is a very definite role for a reformed \nUnited Nations to assist countries like Barbados. The \nmodel economy being pursued by Barbados cannot be \nachieved by unilateral action. \n As stated previously, the role of the United \nNations is clear. It must generate the templates to be \nadopted and serve as a catalyst for action: it must seek \nto mediate where conflicts arise; it must work to ensure \nthat there are reforms of the global economic and \nfinancial system to make it inclusive, transparent and \nsupportive of the development aspirations of least \ndeveloped countries and more developed countries; it \nmust also facilitate South-South cooperation, \nsupporting the efforts of these countries to share \nappropriate experiences and indigenous solutions. \n Barbados shares your vision, Sir, for a strong, \ninclusive and open United Nations as the guarantor of \nglobal governance. Barbados maintains the strong \nposition that responsibility for the setting of rules and \nthe making of core decisions on matters of a global \nnature rightfully belongs within the ambit of the United \nNations, given its primacy as the only legitimate forum \nfor global action."

        "file_text": "Most \nof the speeches we have heard so far today and \nyesterday have had three main focuses. One of them, \nwithout a doubt, is the global economic crisis, its \nimpact and evolution and how to overcome it. Climate \nchange has been another focus. And, finally, the third \nfundamental and very important topic has been the \nmaintenance of international peace and security. \n  \n \n10-54959 4 \n \n I believe that emerging countries, and Argentina \nin particular, have a wealth of experience to share in \nconnection with these three topics, and that we need to \ntake a position. With respect to the global crisis, whose \nimpact has been felt in emerging countries despite the \nfact that it actually originated in developed countries, it \nmust be pointed out that it was precisely the \ndeveloping countries that supported the economic \ngrowth of the past decade and that will again reignite \nand sustain economic growth and activity and thus \nprovide the means to overcome what is perhaps the \nmost significant economic crisis since 1930. And \nArgentina, in this sense, was somewhat of a guinea pig \nfor the policies of the 1990s, when it was held up as a \nmodel pupil while it was in reality ratcheting up \nunsustainable levels of debt, producing neither goods \nnor services, and actually experiencing a fall in job-\ncreation, finally collapsing in 2001 in a financial crisis \nvery similar to that which shook the world in the third \nquarter of 2008. \n The ground fell out from beneath Argentina in \n2001. However, through the policies we pursued from \n2003 onwards, we have been able to overcome that \ncrisis, which so closely resembled that which hit the \nworld in 2008. And we did so through our own efforts \nand, crucially, with an economic and political strategy \nthat was not dictated by demands from the multilateral \ncredit institutions but was in line with our own \nconvictions and, crucially, our own interests. \n In the eight years leading up to this bicentennial \nyear \u2014 this year, my country marks 200 years of \nfreedom \u2014 we have achieved the most significant \neconomic growth ever seen in our 200 years of history. \nWe managed to emerge from debt in a way never \nbefore seen in our history. Since that sovereign default \nof 2001, which was the greatest such default in history, \ntoday Argentina has renegotiated 93 per cent of its total \ndebt with Argentine debt title-holders. And, moreover, \nArgentina has achieved heretofore unknown inclusive \ngrowth in the past year, following our application of \ncounter-cyclical measures throughout all of 2009 and \nin late 2008. We have experienced growth in economic \nactivity of 9 per cent over the past 12 months. We \nbrought the unemployment rate back down to 7.9 per \ncent. And we managed to continue reducing the rates of \npoverty and extreme poverty, which are now at levels \nnever before seen in our country. \n This is due essentially to counter-cyclical \neconomic management and to an understanding that \ninstruments such as the central bank, reserves, foreign \ntrade, production, employment generation and better \nliving standards, with a robust expansion in fiscal \nspending, are exactly what has meant that the crisis \noverwhelming developing countries has not had the \nsame impact it would have had at other times. \n In this context, I wish to point out that we have \nalso promoted the intelligent use of our reserves, which \nis something currently under discussion in all \nmultilateral bodies, in the world of economics and in \nthe context of the Group of 20. We have used our \nreserves rationally because we believe that, in our case, \nthey are the result of a trade surplus \u2014 that is to say, \nhard currency dollars \u2014 and should be applied to \npaying down the debt rather than putting them into \ncapital markets, thereby resulting in double-digit debt \nwhile we would be paid only 0.5 per cent interest for \nour reserves. It would really have been senseless and \nirrational for our country to go into double-digit debt \nwhen in reality we had more than enough reserves, for \nwhich we would be paid barely 0.5 per cent. \n What I am trying to say is that our experience in \nArgentina, as well as that of other emerging countries \n\u2014 which, I wish to reiterate once again, are shoring up \neconomic growth \u2014 makes it incumbent upon the \nGroup of 20, as well as the Group of 77, where we will \nalso push for this, to carry out a rigorous reform of \ninternational credit agencies, which have failed in their \nfundamental purpose: to ensure a stable global \neconomy that produces jobs and well-being for the \ninhabitants of the planet.  \nIn that regard, we believe that it is truly urgent \nfor there to be global legislation in the area of vulture \nfunds, which basically move from one area of the \ncountry to another in genuinely speculative ways and \nhave a pitiless impact on economies. We also believe \nthat there is a need to evaluate and legislate on risk-\nrating agencies, which for instance rated Argentina\u2019s \ndebt as highly risky when it reality the Argentine \nRepublic had been scrupulously paying its debt since \nthe first renegotiation, in 2005, without turning to \ncapital markets. Nevertheless, they have given much \nhigher rankings to countries that subsequently \ndemonstrated that they did not have the capacity to \naddress their debt because they had structural problems \nin their economies, such as fiscal deficits, commercial \n \n \n5 10-54959 \n \ndeficits and reserve outflows \u2014 precisely the opposite \nof what took place in Argentina. \n We therefore believe in the need for global \nre-engineering of multilateral funds \u2014 essentially in a \ntheoretical framework different from the one that the \nworld has experienced, namely, the Washington \nConsensus. That Consensus has been exhausted by \nfailure, but has not been replaced by a new theoretical \nframework that gives different roles to central banks, \nas well as to States as instruments to promote counter-\ncyclical fiscal measures that ensure something which, \nin our opinion, is a central concern: employment \nstability, rather than just currency stability. \n We also sincerely believe that currencies should \nnot be protected solely from a monetary perspective; \non the contrary, we believe that the value of each \ncountry\u2019s currency is directly linked to the potential for \ngrowth and wealth-generation capacity of each \ncountry\u2019s economy. It is also linked to the equitable \ndistribution of wealth, which should make societies \nsustainable through a model that is not just economic \nbut also essentially political. \n Climate change, which is very important and will \nsoon be addressed at the Cancun meeting, has also \nbeen a central theme in all the interventions that have \nbeen made from this rostrum. While it is well and good \nto speak of that, we have not been able to reach an \nagreement because, in fact, we are not being offered a \nsolution in this area that is just and equitable in terms \nof who, and to what degree, should bear primary \nresponsibility for damage due to environmental \npollution. It is not fair that developing countries \u2014 \nwhich, by paying a high price, have been able to \novercome high levels of poverty and social inequality \nthrough economic growth \u2014 should be the ones that \nhave to assume responsibility for the environmental \nlegacy of developed countries, which for decades \ncontaminated the world and which should therefore be \nthe ones to shoulder this responsibility. Establishing \nviable targets and goals that are in line with the need to \ncontinue to grow the economy also require that we \nseriously realign our goals in the area of global \nwarming. \n With regard to the final focus, namely, building \ninternational peace and security, we sincerely believe \nthat the resumption of dialogue between the State of \nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority is very good news \nindeed when it comes to finally achieving what I \nbelieve all of us have looked forward to for quite a \nlong time: that the State of Palestine will be seated as a \nfull member during the next session of the General \nAssembly. We believe that will make an enormous \ncontribution to the maintenance of international peace \nand security. I say this by virtue of our experience as a \ncountry that has been a target and victim of \ninternational terrorist groups. As the Assembly is \naware, in 1992 and 1994 my country was the victim of \ntwo terrible terrorist attacks. The first was the blowing \nup of the Israeli Embassy, and the second tragedy was \nthe bombing of the Asociaci\u00f3n Mutual Israelita \nArgentina (AMIA). \n In that regard, in 2007, my country\u2019s then \nPresident, N\u00e9stor Kirchner, requested the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran to agree to the extradition of Iranian \ncitizens whom the Argentine justice system had \naccused of participation in carrying out that heinous \ncrime. I did the same as President in 2008 and 2009 \u2014 \nto little effect, I must confess. I did so while \nemphasizing that mine is a leading country in \nrespecting human rights and bringing to justice those \nwho commit crimes against humanity. I have also \nunderscored that we have a system that ensures due \nprocess and the right to counsel and that does not \npermit anyone to be tried or convicted in absentia. It is \nfor those reasons that we continue to make this request \nfor extradition. We have also emphasized that for any \nArgentine citizens who believe that our country\u2019s \njustice system is not fair enough or does not enforce \nthe law, we are party to international conventions to \nwhich they can turn, including such international \ntribunals as the Inter-American Commission on Human \nRights. Despite the fact that we have guaranteed that \nall these principles will continue to be respected in the \nArgentine Republic, we have not yet achieved results. \n I shall not on this occasion call for the fourth \ntime for something that will clearly not achieve results. \nBut I will propose to the Islamic Republic of Iran \u2014 \neven if it has no faith in Argentine justice, as it has \nsaid, because of prejudgement and insufficient \nneutrality to carry out a trial \u2014 that a third country be \nselected, through mutual agreement between our \ncountries, in which there are guarantees of due process \nand where international observers and United Nations \nrepresentatives may participate to bring to trial the \nterrible attack on AMIA in our country. I should also \nlike to say that we do not consider that attack as an \n  \n \n10-54959 6 \n \nattack on one community or one religion. For us, it was \nan attack on all Argentines. \n I am President of a country where we can \ncelebrate the Jewish New Year with the Jewish \ncommunity, as I did this year in my capacity as leader \nof the country. We also celebrated the end of Ramadan \nat an Islamic centre. We are a country of open-\nmindedness because of our immigrant heritage, which \nguarantees plurality and diversity for all. \n There is a precedent for what we are proposing. \nThis precedent is not a capricious or fantastical legal \nconstruction; it is the Lockerbie case. That is an \ninternational precedent of a trial held in a third neutral \ncountry that could provide guarantees for those who \nfear they might not be judged impartially. In this \nconnection, I would like to clarify that the Argentine \nRepublic is not seeking guilty parties. All the Argentine \nGovernment seeks is justice. Ultimately, anyone who \nhas committed a crime of such magnitude should be \npunished.  \n Thus, we hope that the offer I make to the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran today before the General Assembly \nwill put an end to the pretext of non-neutrality and to \naccusations of our complicity in withholding impartial \njustice. I address this in particular to those who insist \nthat there can be no impartial justice. I believe that this \neloquent gesture has international precedents and will \nallow us to resolve this situation and to channel this \ndispute institutionally. We must do this if we wish to \nfeel truly part of the international community. We must \nresolve this dispute in a framework of justice and \nlegality. \n Finally, again in connection with security \nconcerns, we must once again, here in this Assembly, \ndemand respect for our sovereign rights over the \nMalvinas Islands. We do not do so solely for historical \nreasons. Our claim is absolutely up to date. The United \nKingdom has systematically refused to implement \nuniversally binding General Assembly resolutions \ncalling for negotiations with the Argentine Republic on \nthe question of sovereignty.  \n But that is not all. Unilateral decisions have been \ntaken to exploit hydrocarbon resources on the islands. \nThere are two aspects to this exploitation. The first is \nthat it constitutes depredation of natural resources that \nbelong to us. It is unthinkable that territorial, historical \nor legal sovereignty can be maintained over islands \nthat are 14,000 kilometres from the United Kingdom \nand whose transplanted population sits on a continental \nshelf that unquestionably belongs to the Argentine \nRepublic geographically, geologically and historically.  \n The second aspect is the risk of ecological \ncatastrophe. British Petroleum, operating off the coast \nof the United States in the Gulf of Mexico, set off an \nunprecedented ecological catastrophe. The lack of \noversight by our country or any other over what the \nUnited Kingdom is doing in the Malvinas Islands has \nmobilized us not only to defend the natural resources \nof my country, but to seek to avert an ecological \ncatastrophe that could occur due to this total lack of \noversight.  \n Some may say that this has nothing to with \nsecurity. It has a great deal to do with security, because \none of the central problems of our globalized world is \nthe need to adapt the Security Council to our times. We \nneed a Security Council worthy of its name. England, \nlike other countries that have a permanent seat on the \nCouncil, has used and misused its position. Resolutions \nof the Council are applicable only to those countries \nthat do not have sufficient power or the right to a \npermanent seat on the Council. The Council should be \nreformed because it has never been able to maintain \ninternational peace and security. \n That is not simply because some seats are \npermanent or because the world context has changed \nsince the San Francisco Charter created the Security \nCouncil. The Security Council, with its permanent \nmembers, was a Security Council where those who \nwere seated could, by pressing a red button, cause a \nnuclear holocaust. That was the true reason for creating \na Council that could strike a balance between the \ninterests of a bipolar world and prevent a nuclear \nholocaust. \n That world no longer exists. Those who were \nonce irreconcilable enemies and rivals are now \nassociates, allies, friends or whatever anyone might \ncare to call them. What is certain is that those who can \nunleash terrible conflict situations, tragedies and \ninternational terrorism are not and never will be seated \nthere. Thus, the Security Council has lost its \neffectiveness because it is not in line with today\u2019s \nworld or the dangers besetting it. Quite the contrary, \nthe use and misuse of their dominant position by \nmembers of the Council in certain countries have \nprovoked conflicts that cannot then be stifled by the \nCouncil, much less by the Organization. \n \n \n7 10-54959 \n \n We believe that the case of the Malvinas Islands \nis very enlightening. The United Kingdom can do as it \nlikes because no one is compelling it to implement the \ndecisions of the Security Council, because it is a \npermanent member and an important member of \nNATO. In a world of double standards \u2014 where only \nthe developing and extremely weak countries are \ncompelled to abide by the international legal order \nwhile those who can systematically violate it do so \u2014 \nit is not possible to build peace, let alone maintain \ninternational security, because such situations end up \ncreating the kind of insurmountable disputes and \ndifferences we see every day. \n I believe it important to note that the concepts of \nsecurity and peace can never be associated with \nmilitary matters alone. They must be essentially \nassociated with political values, equity, freedom and a \ncause for which humankind has fought from the \nbeginning: equality."

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin by \ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President \nof the General Assembly and by assuring you of the \nfull cooperation of my delegation. In the interest of \nsaving the Assembly\u2019s valuable time, I will read out \nonly part of my address, the full text of which has been \ncirculated.  \n The United Nations was created, 65 years ago, to \nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war, \nto affirm faith in fundamental rights, to establish \nconditions under which respect for international law \ncan be maintained and to promote social progress and \nbetter standards of life in larger freedom. Six and a half \ndecades later, globalization has made the world a much \nsmaller place. It has also created conditions whereby \nthe problems and challenges of one country or region \ncan very quickly become those of the larger community \nof nations. \n Terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction, maritime piracy, pandemics and \nepidemics, organized crime and narcotics smuggling \nrecognize no borders or boundaries. Similarly, the \nfallout of intra-State conflicts, failed States, climate \nchange, natural disasters, food shortages and financial \nand economic crises transcend countries and regions. \nUnder those circumstances the international \ncommunity looks to the United Nations to overcome \nthe common challenges of humankind through the \nharmonized actions of nations, as stated in the Charter. \n The United Nations is the only organization that \ncan be at the centre of an international governance \nsystem. However, it needs urgent reform to reflect \ncontemporary realities and to effectively meet \nemerging global challenges. The first step has to be the \nreform of the Security Council. The overwhelming \nmajority of the membership has been clear in seeking \nan expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent \ncategories of membership. It is imperative that we \nbring the negotiations to an early and logical \nconclusion. \n We must also truly revitalize the General \nAssembly. It must reclaim its position on vital matters \nsuch as the appointment of the Secretary-General and \nthe relationship between the United Nations and the \nBretton Woods institutions. Along with the Economic \nand Social Council, the General Assembly should also \nset the paradigms of multilateral engagement for the \nglobal economy and for development and \ndevelopmental cooperation.  \n It is matter of much satisfaction that this year we \nhave significantly advanced the United Nations reform \nagenda in the areas of gender equality and women\u2019s \nempowerment. I wish to reiterate our strong \ncommitment to UN Women and to its strengthening.  \n We also need to ensure that the review of the \nHuman Rights Council this year adds to the Council\u2019s \nrole as an effective, credible and premier United \nNations mechanism dealing with human rights.  \n My Government accords the highest priority to \nthe attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. \nOur development challenges were exacerbated by the \nfinancial and economic crisis that started in 2008. \nActing in concert, the Group of 20 (G-20), which \nincludes the largest developed and developing \ncountries, reacted promptly and purposefully to stem \nthe global slowdown and send a strong message of \nconfidence and stability. India believes that the  \nG-20 \u2014 the premier forum for international economic \n  \n \n10-55396 4 \n \ncooperation \u2014 can help catalyse strong, balanced and \nsustainable growth for the benefit of everyone. \n As a country vulnerable to, and already suffering \nfrom, the impacts of climate change, India has an \nimportant stake in the success of ongoing international \nnegotiations in that regard. There is no substitute to the \nUnited Nations-led process, with its inherent \ninclusiveness and transparency, to lead us to an \nambitious and equitable outcome that respects the \nprovisions and principles of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, in \nparticular the principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibilities and respective capabilities. It is \nimportant that there be acceptance of equal sharing of \nthe resource of the atmosphere for all human beings. \n India has an abiding commitment to achieve \nuniversal and non-discriminatory nuclear disarmament \nwithin a specified time frame \u2014 a vision that was most \neloquently articulated in the Assembly by Prime \nMinister Rajiv Gandhi in 1988. More than two decades \nlater, that goal still remains distant. Meanwhile, newer \nthreats have emerged, including the danger of terrorists \ngaining access to weapons of mass destruction. \n India introduced a working paper on nuclear \ndisarmament in 2006, which contained specific \nproposals that reflect the spirit and substance of the \nRajiv Gandhi action plan. We call for an intensification \nof discussion and dialogue among Member States and \nthe larger non-governmental community, so as to \nstrengthen an international consensus that can be \ntranslated into concrete action to achieve nuclear \ndisarmament.  \n India remains committed to the negotiations in \nthe Conference on Disarmament on a multilateral,  \nnon-discriminatory and internationally verifiable fissile \nmaterial cut-off treaty that meets India\u2019s national \nsecurity interests. We hope that the Conference will be \nable to commence negotiations at an early date. We \nremain committed to a unilateral and voluntary \nmoratorium on nuclear-explosives testing. \n Terrorism has emerged as one of the most serious \nthreats to international peace and security. To defeat it, \nit is imperative for the global community to build on \ninternational cooperation and take concerted action \nagainst terrorists and their sponsors. There can be no \njustification for terrorism, just as there can be no good \nor bad terrorists. We urge Member States to display the \nnecessary political will to finalize and adopt the \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \n Peace and stability in South Asia is one of our \nhighest priorities. We are committed to good-\nneighbourly relations with all our neighbours, \nincluding Pakistan. In that spirit of solidarity with the \npeople of Pakistan in their hour of need we pledged \n$25 million in aid, which is being channelled through \nthe United Nations for flood relief efforts in that \ncountry. As a neighbour, we wish to provide succour \nand relief in a timely manner to the victims of that \nnatural disaster. We are saddened by the loss of life and \nproperty that Pakistan has suffered as a result of the \nunprecedented floods. \n It is well known that many countries have deep-\nrooted concerns about the growth and consolidation of \nmilitancy and terrorism in Pakistan. We share those \nconcerns, particularly because Jammu and Kashmir, \nwhich is an integral part of India, has been the target of \nsuch Pakistan-sponsored militancy and terrorism for \nmany years now. Pakistan must fulfil its solemn \ncommitment not to allow territory under its control to \nbe used for terrorism directed against India. Credible \nand firm action by Pakistan against terrorist groups \noperating from its soil is in the interest of the region, as \nit is in Pakistan\u2019s own interest.  \n Pakistan cannot impart lessons to us on \ndemocracy and human rights. If, however, Pakistan \nwere to live up to its commitment not to allow the use \nof territory under its control by terrorists acting against \nIndia, that would significantly help reduce the trust \ndeficit that impedes the development of better bilateral \nrelations between our two countries. We are \nneighbours, and as neighbours we have an obligation to \nwork together. \n Afghanistan recently successfully concluded \nparliamentary elections. We believe the international \ncommunity needs to be steadfast in its engagement \nwith Afghanistan to ensure the success of its \nreconstruction efforts and its emergence as a \ndemocratic, pluralistic and prosperous society. The \ncontinuing existence of safe havens and sanctuaries for \nterrorists beyond Afghanistan\u2019s borders is the major \nimpediment to the restoration of peace and security in \nAfghanistan. That should be a primary focus of the \ninternational community. \n Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, India\u2019s first Prime \nMinister, said in 1948:  \n \n \n5 10-55396 \n \n \u201cThe fundamental principles on which the United \nNations is based are right principles. We believe \nin those fundamental principles and want to help \nthe Organization in following these principles.\u201d \nThe Government and the more than 1 billion people of \nIndia have stood by that commitment. I would like to \nsolemnly reaffirm our faith in the principles that \nunderlie the United Nations, and in the United Nations \nsystem itself. "

But \ndevelopment assistance can only complement \u2014 and \nnever replace \u2014 development efforts based on genuine \nnational ownership. Thus, we have a shared \nresponsibility, developed and developing countries alike, \nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.  \n The development and prosperity of poor countries \nto a large extent depend on their ability to integrate \ninto the global economy. The fact that protectionism \nhas largely been kept at bay during the most severe \nrecession since the 1930s is therefore a major \nachievement. Robust international rules for open trade \nand investment are key. Free trade benefits rich and \npoor countries alike. The regions that have been most \nsuccessful in eradicating poverty are also those where \ncountries trade the most. In order to strengthen the \ntrading capacity of the poorest countries, aid for trade \ncan play an important role. Completion of the Doha \nRound must remain a shared first priority, but should \nnot prevent complementary free trade and investment \narrangements. \n The devastating natural disasters in Haiti and \nPakistan have underlined the importance of a well-\nfunctioning and well-coordinated international \nhumanitarian system. It is only through joint efforts \nand shared responsibility that the international \ncommunity can ensure quick and effective responses to \npeople in need. The Office for the Coordination of \nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA) plays a crucial role in \nthis respect. Sadly, we see a global trend of increasing \nhumanitarian needs. It is therefore of utmost importance \nthat we continue to strengthen the humanitarian system \nas a whole, in particular OCHA. In parallel, we need to \nfocus more on preparedness and prevention to reduce \nlong-term vulnerability to disasters.  \n Climate change is clearly one of the greatest \nchallenges of our generation, affecting the world and \nparticularly poor countries in unpredictable and \ndevastating ways. Even if we meet the two-degree \ntarget set by the United Nations, disasters will continue \nto be a reality. Developed and developing countries \nalike share the responsibility to ward off this threat to \nour planet by working towards concrete climate goals. \nDeveloped countries, as major emitters, bear a large \nshare of the responsibility for reducing emissions and \nfor providing funding, but actions must be taken by all \ncountries. The example of Sweden shows that it is \npossible to achieve both emissions reductions and \neconomic growth \u2014 there is no contradiction.  \n Together we have a shared responsibility as the \nguardians of human rights, enshrined in the United \nNations Charter, the Universal Declaration and the \nrelevant conventions. Without respect for human rights \nand fundamental freedoms, all other progress will be \nincomplete. The ultimate responsibility lies with \nStates. It is for us to put ideals into practice. The \nHuman Rights Council needs to use all its tools to \naddress the substance of its mandate: human rights \nviolations. For that Council to be relevant, its members \nmust meet the membership criteria of fulfilling their \ninternational human rights obligations. Much remains \nto be done. The death penalty continues to be applied \nextensively across the world, in some cases even \nagainst juveniles, and often without a credible legal \nprocess. As we have recently seen, in some countries a \nwoman can even be sentenced to death by stoning for \nalleged adultery, and both men and women can be \nexecuted for no other reason than their sexual \norientation. The responsibility to stop such barbaric \nacts lies firmly with us, the governments. Gender \nequality remains one of the greatest challenges to \nhuman rights and democracy. We therefore welcome \nthe establishment of the United Nations Entity for \nGender Equality and the Empowerment of Women  \n(UN Women) and believe it will further the cause of \ngender equality.  \n Democracy and human rights are not just \nmutually supporting; one cannot be said to truly exist \nwithout the other. The right to participate in a \ndemocratic system of government is indeed in itself a \nhuman right. Although we have seen democracy spread \nto new countries, a large part of the world\u2019s population \nis still denied the right to participate in free elections. \nWe call upon the Government of Myanmar to make its \nNovember election free, fair and inclusive. In this \ncontext, we reiterate our call for the release of the \npolitical prisoners and detainees, including Daw Aung \nSan Suu Kyi.  \n Freedom of expression is a core human right and \na prerequisite of democracy. In this era of information \ntechnology, communication has been revolutionized. \nNew technologies can assist in making Governments \nmore transparent and can stimulate citizens to take a \n  \n \n10-55276 38 \n \nmore active role in the democratic governance of their \ncountries. Yet, technology alone cannot make \ninformation and expression of opinion free. Access to \ntechnology is needed as a catalyst for human rights. \nThe harassment and jailing of journalists and bloggers \nmust stop. The situation in countries such as China, \nViet Nam, Egypt, Myanmar, Cuba, the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea, Eritrea and Iran is deeply \nworrying. It is important that the international \ncommunity address the issue of violations of freedom \nof expression, also in connection with new \ntechnologies and with greater vigour than in the past. \n Sweden is concerned about continued human \nrights violations in the Sudan, not least in Darfur. Full \ncooperation with the International Criminal Court is an \nobligation under international law. The upcoming \nreferendum on the status of Southern Sudan will be of \ncrucial importance to the country\u2019s future. We must \nspare no effort to make sure that it is credible and to \nsupport the parties in reaching an agreement on post-\nreferendum arrangements. In this process the United \nNations has a key role to play, together with the \nAfrican Union. \n The recently reported cases of sexual violence in \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, with shocking \nnews of hundreds of rapes of women and children, are \nnot isolated incidents. They are part of a pattern of \nconflict-related crimes that have been carried out with \nimpunity over many years. As so often in conflict \nsituations, women and children are the most vulnerable \ngroups; as so often in peace processes, women are the \nmost ignored. A lasting peace calls for the \nempowerment and equal participation of women in \nnegotiations and decision-making. Lasting peace can \nnever be achieved while there is impunity. It is high \ntime to fully implement Security Council resolutions \n1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, and \n1820 (2008), on sexual violence in conflict situations. \nSweden welcomes the appointment of a Special \nRepresentative of the Secretary-General on Sexual \nViolence in Conflict. \n The international community has agreed on the \nresponsibility to protect populations from genocide, \nwar crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against \nhumanity. We need to intensify our efforts and develop \nthe right tools to ensure the full realization of the \nresponsibility to protect, both as sovereign States and \nas part of the international community. Sweden fully \nsupports the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to strengthen \nthe early warning capability within the Secretariat. \n Few aspects of our cooperation through the \nUnited Nations illustrate shared responsibility better \nthan our joint role in preventing and managing \nconflicts, and keeping and building sustainable peace. \nImportant steps have been taken to improve global \npeacekeeping. We welcome the New Horizon Initiative \nas a way of further enhancing the capability of the \nUnited Nations to conduct demanding and complex \npeacekeeping missions worldwide. Much work remains \nto be done in the areas of conflict prevention and \npeacebuilding. We need to increase the capacity of the \nUnited Nations to help countries in transition from war \nto lasting peace, and to provide relevant support \u2014 not \nleast through the Peacebuilding Commission and the \nPeacebuilding Fund \u2014 for their efforts to foster peace \nand rebuild State and society. Similarly, the United \nNations must have the right tools to help prevent \ncountries from lapsing into conflict in the first place. \nThis is a central challenge for the United Nations and a \nkey priority for the coming decade. \n We welcome the increasingly important role that \nthe African Union plays, not least in peacekeeping \noperations in Africa. Cooperation between the African \nUnion and both the United Nations and the European \nUnion has been important in both the Sudan and \nSomalia. Earlier this year, Sweden led the European \nUnion\u2019s anti-piracy operation off the coast of Somalia, \na mission that provides security for humanitarian \ntransports of the World Food Programme into Somalia. \nFurthermore, the European Union, in close cooperation \nwith the African Union, is conducting training in \nUganda of the Transitional Federal Government \nsecurity forces. The African Union has made a \ncourageous and considerable contribution to security in \nMogadishu. Yet over the past year we have witnessed \nsome of the most violent fighting in Mogadishu and in \nparts of south-central Somalia. Together with the \nTransitional Federal Institutions, we now need to \nprepare and plan for the end of the transitional \narrangements by August next year. In this process, \nstrong United Nations leadership will be crucial. \n The United Nations plays a crucial role in the \nefforts of the international community to contribute to \nsecure, stable and democratic development in \nAfghanistan. At the Kabul International Conference on \nAfghanistan, held in July, there was a renewed \ncommitment by the Afghan authorities and the \n \n \n39 10-55276 \n \ninternational community to enhance national ownership \nin this process. Together, the United Nations, the \nEuropean Union and other international actors have to \nshow continued strong resolve in assisting the Afghan \npeople in building a more peaceful and democratic \nsociety. To this effect, Sweden will continue to contribute \nto civilian and military operations in Afghanistan, while \nincreasing our development assistance. \n In the Middle East the responsibility for the \nsuccess of direct negotiations lies with the two parties. \nBut we all share an interest in, and must contribute to, \na two-State solution with Israel and Palestine living \nside by side in peace and security. We deeply regret the \nIsraeli decision not to extend the moratorium on \nsettlements. The context of direct negotiations, as \nstated in European Union Council conclusions, must be \nthat negotiations should be based on the pre-1967 \nborders, that settlements are illegal, that all final status \nissues are to be included in the negotiations \u2014 \nincluding the status of Jerusalem as capital of two \nStates \u2014 and that both parties are to refrain from \nprovocative actions. \n We strive for a world without nuclear weapons. \nWorld leaders have made significant progress in \ndisarmament and non-proliferation efforts in the past \nyear. The New START agreement is of great \nimportance, but there is scope for further reductions, \nnot least of non-strategic nuclear arsenals. The spread \nof nuclear weapons must be stopped. The Action Plan \nadopted at the Review Conference of the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in May, \ncovering the three mutually reinforcing pillars of the \nNPT, must be implemented and fully respected.  \n The early entry into force of the Comprehensive \nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is as urgent as ever. \nThe unacceptable deadlock in the Conference on \nDisarmament must come to an end.  \n We are deeply concerned that the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea has continued its \nwithdrawal from the NPT, even having tested two \nnuclear devices, and that Iran has been conducting \nactivities in violation of its NPT commitments. It is of \nvital importance that commitments under the NPT be \nhonoured. \n The control of conventional arms is also an \nurgent priority. The illicit or uncontrolled spread of \nsuch weapons contributes to regional and international \ninstability, maiming and killing thousands. We must \nseize the opportunity and strive together to find the \npolitical will to agree on regulating mechanisms, such \nas is currently being discussed in the form of an arms \ntrade treaty. \n The European Union is a strong supporter of the \nUnited Nations. Following the entry into force of the \nLisbon Treaty, the EU has established new permanent \nstructures for its external representation, taking over \nfunctions previously carried out by the rotating \npresidency. Ensuring that the EU can continue to \ncontribute effectively to the work of the United \nNations requires allowing its representatives to \nparticipate actively in its proceedings in the capacity of \nobserver. We are looking forward to continued \ncooperation with a view to ensuring the adoption of a \nresolution to that effect as soon as possible. \n Our countries are interconnected today in an \nunprecedented way. In a globalized world, problems \nsuch as climate change, natural disasters, disease, \ndrugs, terrorism and conflicts take on new proportions. \nAt the same time the alleviation of poverty, the fight \nfor human rights and democracy, and economic \ndevelopment remain as relevant as ever. We need to \ncooperate in global structures and engage in various \nforms of global governance to meet these challenges. \nThe United Nations is the only world body offering a \nunique forum to address these problems in a \ncoordinated way. We need to continue to reform the \nUnited Nations in order for it to fulfil its functions and \nremain relevant. Only when every country assumes its \nshare of responsibility can the United Nations achieve \nits full potential. Sweden will continue to be a strong \nsupporter of the United Nations and will assume its \nshare of our common responsibility."

        "file_text": "More than ever before, our \nworld is confronting multiple global crises which \ncannot be effectively addressed without a coordinated, \nmultilateral action. No country can face these crises \nand provide for its future in isolation. The threats are \nglobal, and so are the solutions. A strong, central role \nfor the United Nations is essential. \n It is also essential to resist forces of division that \nspread misunderstanding and mistrust, especially \namong peoples of different religions. The fact is that \nhumanity everywhere is bound together, not only by \nmutual interests, but by shared commandments: to love \nGod and neighbour; to love the good and neighbour. \n This week, my delegation, with the support of our \nfriends on every continent, will introduce a draft \nresolution for an annual World Interfaith Harmony \nWeek. What we propose is a special week during which \nthe world\u2019s people, in their own places of worship, \ncould express the teachings of their own faith about \ntolerance, respect for the other, and peace. I hope that \nthe draft resolution will have the Assembly\u2019s support. \n Another critical area for United Nations \nleadership is peace \u2014 and one peace hangs in the \nbalance today. With direct negotiations between the \nPalestinians and the Israelis, a door opens to a final, \ntwo-State settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. \nAnd the establishment of an independent, viable and \nsovereign Palestinian State, living side by side with \nIsrael, will pave the way for a comprehensive regional \npeace. An end to this conflict is long overdue. \n No regional crisis has had a longer or broader \nimpact on global security and stability. No such crisis \nhas been longer on the United Nations agenda, or has \nfrustrated peacemakers more. Every resource spent in \nthis conflict is a resource lost for investing in progress \nand prosperity. Every day spent is a day lost to forces \nof violence and extremism that threaten all of us in the \nregion and beyond. \n People are wary of disappointment, and spoilers \nare doing everything they can to make us fail. We \ncannot underestimate the importance of success, or the \npainful cost of failure. All of us need to support swift \naction, hard choices and real results. The alternative is \nmore suffering and deeper frustrations, with spreading, \nmore-vicious warfare. Such a catastrophic scenario will \ncontinue to drag in the whole world, threatening \nsecurity and stability far beyond the borders of the \nMiddle East. To prevent that, the talks must be \napproached with commitment, sincerity and courage. \n There should be no provocative or unilateral \nactions that can derail the negotiations. Instead, the \nparties must work hard to produce results, and quickly. \nThat means addressing all final-status issues, with a \nview to ending the occupation and reaching the two-\nState solution, the only solution that can work, as soon \nas possible. The status quo is simply unacceptable \u2014 \nenough injustice, enough bloodshed. \n Jordan and the rest of the Arab and Muslim world \nare committed. In the Arab Peace Initiative, we reach \nout to Israel with an unprecedented opportunity for a \ncomprehensive settlement, a settlement that will enable \nIsrael to have normal relations with 57 Arab and \nMuslim States, one third of the United Nations. Now \nwe reach out to our fellow members of this United \nNations. All stand to lose if the talks fail; all gain when \npeace is achieved. Our global and collective influence \nis key. Together we must tip the balance towards peace. "

        "file_text": "On behalf of the \nGovernment and people of the Commonwealth of the \nBahamas, I congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-fifth session, and I assure him of my country\u2019s \nand my delegation\u2019s full support and cooperation. I \nalso extend sincere congratulations to his predecessor \nfor his stewardship of this Assembly during the sixty-\nfourth session. \n I also take this opportunity to express \ncondolences on behalf of the Government and the \npeople of the Bahamas to the Government and people \nof Pakistan for the loss of lives and property sustained \nas a result of devastating floods affecting their region. \nThe Government and the people of the Bahamas stand \nin solidarity with Pakistan. \n One of the greatest challenges of the global \neconomic and financial crisis has been the loss in speed \ntowards achieving the development goals, including \nthe Millennium Development Goals. We are \nencouraged by the decline in the number of people \nliving in absolute poverty and the reported increased \naccess to primary and secondary education for some. \nWe are mindful that high levels of infant mortality, \nunsatisfactory reduction in the rate of maternal \nmortality, continued high incidences of sexual violence \nagainst women and a rise in the prevalence of HIV \ncontinue to persist in many countries. \n The World Health Organization forecasts that \nbetween 2006 and 2015, deaths from \nnon-communicable diseases will increase worldwide \nby some 17 per cent. The increasing risks and high \nprevalence of non-communicable diseases are exacting \nheavy tolls on finances and health systems of countries \nlike the Bahamas. Hence we welcome the adoption of \nresolution 64/265, which calls for a high-level plenary \nmeeting of the General Assembly next September to \naddress the prevention and control of \nnon-communicable diseases. \n The Bahamas continues to pledge the highest \npriority on attaining and achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. We fully expect to achieve most if \nnot all of the goals and targets identified. Still, we are \nnot out of the woods. The fallout from the global \neconomic and financial crisis continues to impact the \nchief engine and principal employer in our country, \ntourism, and to slow recovery and expansion in other \nsegments of our economy. My Government has \naccelerated the implementation of a planned \nprogramme of national infrastructure upgrade and \nexpansion, with a view to upgrading the country\u2019s \ninfrastructure in order to accommodate new growth and \ndevelopment when the global economy rebounds. \n We believe it is critical that greater attention be \ngiven to achieving a more transparent international \ncredit rating system that takes fully into account the \nneeds and concerns of developing countries. Greater \nparticipation by developing countries is also required \nin key international norm- and standard-setting bodies \nin financial regulation and supervision, including the \nFinancial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on \nBanking Supervision. It is also our view that there is an \nimportant role for the United Nations in this process, \nparticularly in the area of institutional strengthening. \n We are pleased by the considerable progress \nmade in enhancing our social safety net, expanding \nunemployment benefits and introducing a national \nprescription drug programme designed to ensure that \nthe most vulnerable sectors of our society \u2014 infants \nand school-age children, and the elderly \u2014 receive \nprescription medication, regardless of their ability to \npay. And we are also pleased that, notwithstanding \nforced reductions in Government expenditures across \nthe board, every child in the Bahamas continues to be \nassured of a place in Government-operated schools, \nfrom primary to high school. \n Overshadowing our successes is the ever-present \nthreat posed by climate change. The Bahamas is the \nfifth most vulnerable country to rising sea levels. We \nare a country of negligible greenhouse gases and \nnegligible gas emissions; still, we will suffer \ncatastrophic results if emissions are not stabilized and \nreduced worldwide. Indeed, science demonstrates that \na two degree Celsius change in temperature will result \nin a sea-level rise of more than two metres. Such an \noccurrence would submerge 80 per cent of our \nterritory. \n The Bahamas therefore joins with other small \nisland developing States (SIDS) in reiterating the call \nto the international community, and particularly to \ndeveloped countries, to undertake urgent and decisive \naction to significantly reduce emissions of all \ngreenhouse gases, and also to implement fast action \nstrategies. We similarly call for increased financial and \ntechnological support of SIDS, and our particularly \nvulnerable countries, as we struggle to adapt to the \n \n \n13 10-55264 \n \nadverse impacts of climate change. As such, we look \nforward with considerable anticipation to the \nDecember Conference in Canc\u00fan. \n The Bahamas draws attention to the importance \nof the Barbados Programme of Action for the \nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \nStates, as that programme remains the blueprint for \naction on sustainable development for SIDS, as was \nsubsequently reaffirmed in the Mauritius Strategy. In \nthe Bahamas we have an unwavering political \ncommitment to sustainability as the cardinal principle \nfor national development strategies. And in the area of \nbiodiversity, significant achievements have been made \nin establishing and expanding marine, coastal and \nterrestrial protected areas. We are also well along with \nthe development of a national energy policy, with \npotential for renewable energy. \n It is impossible for my country to note the high \nincidence of catastrophic natural disasters being \nexperienced around the world and not acknowledge the \nplight of our great neighbour, Haiti. Haiti and its \npeople are a priority concern for the Bahamas and the \nCaribbean Community subregion, as they are for the \nentire international community. None of us, however, \nwere under any illusion that the recovery and \nreconstruction of Haiti, in the wake of the devastating \nJanuary earthquake, would be anything less than a \nHerculean task. In the immediate aftermath of the \ndisaster, billions of dollars were pledged and the wider \ncommunity of nations vowed to stay the course and \nwork to ensure that Haiti gained a footing on the path \nto sustainable growth and development. \n There has been some progress in Haiti over the \npast nine and a half months \u2014 but not nearly enough. \nMillions of internally displaced people continue to \nlanguish in makeshift tent cities, with inadequate \nshelter or protection, and most of the rubble from that \nJanuary earthquake still lies where it fell. It is \nimperative, therefore, that the United Nations continue \nin its pivotal role of mobilizing international assistance \nfor Haiti and assisting with the recovery and \nreconstruction. \n International peace and security remain a concern \nto all of us. The recently held second review of the \nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy \nunderscored that we must renew our efforts to combat \nterrorism in an effective and integrated manner. I \nreiterate my Government\u2019s commitment to full \nimplementation of the Strategy and renew the call for \ncompletion of negotiations on a comprehensive \nconvention on international terrorism. The Bahamas is \na full partner in the international fight to combat \nterrorism and other transnational criminal activities. \nWe currently serve as Chair of the Inter American \nCommittee against Terrorism. We were also pleased to \nhost this past June a subregional workshop on counter-\nterrorism financing, organized by the Organization of \nAmerican States in cooperation with the United \nNations Office on Drugs and Crime. \n The Security Council is central to international \nefforts aimed at fostering peace and improving security \naround the globe. We believe that the Council\u2019s efforts \nin this regard would be strengthened if its composition \nbetter reflected the geopolitical realities of the world. \nTowards that end, the Bahamas lends its voice to the \ncall for increased urgency in efforts to make the \nSecurity Council more representative, accountable, \ndemocratic and transparent. \n Crime and threats to security continue to occupy \nthe minds of the people of the Bahamas and indeed of \nthe Caribbean subregion. International traffic in illicit \ndrugs and the illicit trade in small arms and light \nweapons have for many years disrupted the lives of \npeace-loving citizens of the Caribbean. Governments \nlike my own have been required to dedicate increased \nportions of our annual budgets to the fight against \ncrime. The seemingly unlimited resources of the illegal \ncartels continue to render our efforts insufficient. \nHence, we look forward with anticipation to the 2012 \nConference, whose objective is the conclusion of an \narms trade treaty. We fully endorse, in that regard, calls \nfrom fellow Caribbean countries for the treaty to be \ncomprehensive in scope, with provisions for all \ncategories of weapons. \n My Government also confirms its commitment to \nthe Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and \nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light \nWeapons in All Its Aspects. We were pleased with the \noutcome document of the Fourth Biennial Meeting of \nStates (A/CONF.192/BMS/2010/3), which was adopted \nby consensus in June. \n I record the appreciation of my Government for \nthe technical assistance recently received from the \nUnited Nations Regional Centre for Peace and \nDisarmament in Latin America and the Caribbean in \nthe area of firearms destruction and stockpile \n  \n \n10-55264 14 \n \nmanagement. We look forward always to assistance in \nthe future. \n The Bahamas applauds the General Assembly\u2019s \nproclamation of the year beginning on 12 August 2010 \nas the International Year of Youth, under the theme of \ndialogue and mutual understanding. We believe that the \noverwhelming majority of our young people are \ncreative and law-abiding citizens. They will doubtless \ncontribute and be a credit to their community and their \ncountry. Regrettably, however, a significant minority, \nnot unlike troubled youth throughout the world, find it \ndifficult to overcome the challenges presented by \npoverty, weak educational achievement, risky social \nbehaviours, including drug and alcohol abuse, criminal \nactivity and rising unemployment. \n A recent report of the International Labour \nOrganization found that young people aged 15 to \n24 accounted for 22 per cent of the increase in the \nnumber of unemployed persons since the beginning of \n2007. My Government is therefore seeking to further \nexpand educational programmes and career-oriented \ntraining opportunities for our youth by enhancing our \nsecondary school curriculum and by strengthening the \nprogrammes available at the Bahamas Technical and \nVocational Institute. \n The Bahamas welcomes efforts by the \nOrganization to continue to bring focus to women\u2019s \nissues. We applaud the adoption of resolution 64/289, \nwhich established a new gender entity \u2014 UN Women. \n We also applaud the recent launch of the United \nNations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \nin Persons. Human trafficking is a growing \nphenomenon in our region and is increasingly a \nchallenge for us in the Bahamas, as we are an \narchipelagic nation with porous borders. My \nGovernment is therefore committed to combating that \nactivity and to intercepting and prosecuting to the \nfullest extent of the law those engaged in it. \n Building on its ratification in 2008 of the \nProtocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in \nPersons, Especially Women and Children, the Bahamas \nenacted child protection and trafficking legislation \nspecially designed to work on counter-trafficking. We \nare fortunate that financing has been made available to \nrepresentatives of relevant Government agencies and \nkey stakeholders. \n The Bahamas believes that the United Nations is \nworking diligently under its mandate to facilitate \nincreased international dialogue, realizing the noble \ngoals set out in its Charter. The Bahamas has taken \nnote of the Secretary-General\u2019s announcement of a \nHigh-level Panel on Global Sustainability as a \nblueprint for a liveable, prosperous and sustainable \nfuture for all. \n My delegation fully endorses the Secretary-\nGeneral in his assertion that the time for narrow \nagendas and narrow thinking is over. As an \nOrganization, we must continue to chart a course that \nwill enable us to meet unprecedented global challenges \nand translate our efforts into actions for the benefit of \nall. The rhetoric must become reality. We all have a \ncontribution to make in realizing the goals and \nobjectives of the United Nations, based on the purposes \nand principles outlined in the Charter."

On this \nhappy occasion, I would first of all like to congratulate \nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the \nsixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I wish you \nevery success and assure you in advance of my \n \n \n23 10-55396 \n \ndelegation\u2019s support. Your undeniable personal \nqualities, in conjunction with proven ability, will \ncertainly inspire our work at a time when our \nOrganization faces numerous challenges involving the \nentire international community. I would also like to \nextend our gratitude to your predecessor,  \nMr. Abdussalam Treki, for the skill and dedication that \nhe showed in carrying out his mandate. \n Here, we would like to express our gratitude to \nour Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his \ntireless efforts to promote the noble ideals of the \nUnited Nations and, in particular, for his personal \ninvolvement in settling the crisis in my country. \n On assuming power on 23 December 2008 \nagainst a background of political and economic crisis, \nthe new Guinean authorities had to deal with many \ndifficulties, in particular poor governance, State \ncrimes, widespread insecurity and the proliferation and \ncirculation of small arms and light weapons. That \nworrying situation led to the adoption of various \nmeasures to restore order and security, build national \nunity and establish a regime respectful of human rights \nand individual and public freedoms.  \n In that specific context, the agreement signed in \nOuagadougou on 15 January 2010 enabled the people \nof Guinea, of all inclinations, to embark on a path of \npeace and dialogue and implement a political plan \nensuring the return to constitutional order based on the \nrule of law and good governance. Despite pitfalls, that \nprocess of democratization led to the establishment of \ntransitional bodies, specifically, a Government of \nnational unity, led by a Prime Minister, a head of \nGovernment coming from the Forces vives, the \nNational Transitional Council and the Independent \nNational Electoral Commission, as well as a timetable \nsetting the deadline for organizing free and transparent \nelections. \n In a show of great commitment, following the \nadoption of the new Constitution, the people turned out \nin force on 27 June 2010 for the most free and \ndemocratic presidential election that the country had \nknown since its independence in 1958. The second \nround of that important election is planned for the \ncoming weeks. \n Here, from this rostrum, I would like to launch an \nurgent appeal to the African and international \ncommunities to continue to support Guinea with a view \nto strengthening peace, stability and security in the \nsubregion. I would also like to pay warm tribute to the \nFacilitator, His Excellency Mr. Blaise Compaore, \nPresident of Burkina Faso, for his tireless efforts to \npromote the democratic process in Guinea. I also \nextend that tribute to the International Contact Group \non Guinea and, through it, the member States of the \nEconomic Community of West African States and of \nthe African Union, the international community and all \nfriendly countries that are working with us at this \ncritical time. \n Peace and security continue to be threatened in \nsome parts of the African continent and the world. \nSomalia continues to be subject to a fratricidal and \npainful war. In the Sudan, peace remains fragile despite \nthe huge sacrifices and the investments granted. We \nurge the African Union and the international \ncommunity to continue their efforts for a prompt and \nlasting settlement of those conflicts. \n In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the recent political \ndevelopments have made it possible for that friendly \nneighbouring country to move towards the presidential \nelection planned for 31 October. That important step \nforward, in conjunction with the positive outcomes of \nthe peacebuilding process in Sierra Leone and Liberia, \ngive us real cause for encouragement and hope for the \npeoples of the Mano River Union.  \n With regard to Western Sahara, my Government \nsupports the efforts of the United Nations and remains \nfirmly committed to the Moroccan initiative on the \nnegotiation of a status of autonomy for the Sahara \nregion. It urges the stakeholders to find a lasting and \nmutually beneficial political solution. \n The upsurge in threats and terrorist violence in \nAfrica are a source of serious concern to Guinea. My \ncountry supports the prompt establishment of a \nconsultative framework for action to eradicate that \nscourge. \n In the Middle East, my delegation welcomes the \ndirect talks between the Palestinian authorities and the \nIsraeli Government under the auspices of the United \nStates of America. It hopes that those talks will lead to \nthe establishment of an independent and sovereign \nPalestinian State, living side by side in peace with \nIsrael. The Guinean Government believes that peace in \nthat region can be achieved only in a climate of mutual \ntrust and with a will to implement the agreements and \nrelevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the \nSecurity Council. From that viewpoint, Israel must \n  \n \n10-55396 24 \n \nwithdraw from the occupied Palestinian territories and \nend its settlement policy. \n Only a week ago, in this Hall, the international \ncommunity reiterated its commitment to the billions of \npeople who are expecting it to make a reality of the \npromise of a better world expressed in the Millennium \nDeclaration (resolution 55/2). Guinea welcomes the \nholding of that summit, which allowed our heads of \nState and Government and our partners to reaffirm \ntheir will to achieve the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) within the agreed time frame. \n My country remains convinced that achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals is within reach. That \nis borne out by the remarkable progress made in many \nareas by countries that are among the poorest on the \nplanet. Barely five years from the 2015 deadline, we \nmust step up the pace, particularly in the countries \nfacing major challenges, in order to consolidate the \nachievements and make even more effective progress \nthan we have to date.  \n In order to take up the many challenges of the \ntwenty-first century, development partners and the \ninternational community have no choice but to step up \nefforts to work together to lend new impetus to \ninternational cooperation. My country urges all \nstakeholders to assume, at the national, regional and \ninternational levels, their share of responsibility in \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals.  \n The Republic of Guinea welcomes the progress \nmade in recent years with regard to official \ndevelopment assistance. However, it regrets that long-\nstanding commitments and those entered into more \nrecently are far from being met. It is vital to reflect on \nall standard and supplementary sources of financing for \ndevelopment. Innovative financing is becoming an \nincreasingly important means to mobilize additional, \npredictable and stable resources to supplement official \ndevelopment assistance. \n Guinea, which attaches great importance to an \nincrease in official development assistance, reiterates \nits proposal on organizing an African conference on \ninnovative financing and drawing up a draft African \ndeclaration on transparency of financial governance \nand fighting illegal capital flows. The purpose of that \nconference would be to promote strategies to mobilize \ninnovative financing as a complement to traditional aid \nand the domestic resources needed to fund the MDGs. \nThe draft African declaration on transparency of \nfinancial governance and fighting illegal capital flows \nwould seek to stem the immense capital outflows from \nAfrica by redirecting them towards development of the \ncontinent. \n Those proposals were warmly welcomed by \nvarious African bodies and the Leading Group on \nInnovative Financing for Development. They also \nreceived support at the twenty-fifth summit of heads of \nState and Government of Africa and France and the \nbacking of the African Union at its fifteenth summit in \nKampala. My delegation hopes that those initiatives \nwill feature among the proposals for action on Africa \nduring this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly.  \n Regarding international trade, we hope for a \nprompt conclusion of the Doha Round negotiations on \nthe basis of an agreement that is both far-reaching and \nfair to all stakeholders, in particular the least developed \ncountries. We again call for developed countries to \nrespect their commitment to remove by 2013 all export \nsubsidies that significantly distort trade and \nagricultural production in developing countries. My \ncountry welcomes the substantial progress made with \nrespect to debt relief and urges the international \ncommunity to continue its endeavours to effectively \nimplement the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries \nInitiative. \n The subject of climate change quite rightly \noccupies a central place on the international agenda, \ngiven that phenomenon\u2019s devastating effects. That \nreveals the emergence of a collective awareness and \nthe real threat that that phenomenon poses to \nhumankind.  \n Given that urgency, my country calls for \nconcerted and courageous international efforts to \nalleviate the suffering of victims, particularly the \nvulnerable populations of poor countries. The \ncommitments undertaken with regard to developing \ncountries in terms of financial resources, technology \ntransfer and capacity-building must be fulfilled, so that \nthe appropriate measures can be undertaken to adapt to \nclimate change and to mitigate its effects in those \ncountries. In that connection, my delegation hopes that \nthe climate conference to be held at the end of the year \nin Canc\u00fan, Mexico, will lead to an ambitious \nagreement that will commit States to concrete action.  \n As it is fully aware of the pressing need to act, \nthe Guinean Government, for its part, is determined to \nassume its share of the responsibility, especially since \n \n \n25 10-55396 \n \nGuinea plays a leading role in implementing all \npolicies and strategies aimed at achieving sustainable \ndevelopment and restoring ecological balance in \nwestern African. As the source of over 20 rivers that \nirrigate the West African region, including the Niger, \nSenegal, Gambia and Makona Rivers, Guinea is a \nveritable water tower for Western Africa and the \ncrucible for an incredibly rich biodiversity. \n The main theme of this session, \u201cReaffirming the \ncentral role of the United Nations in global \ngovernance\u201d, is extremely timely. We acknowledge that \nmost gratefully. In a highly interdependent world that \nis marked by the combined effects of many crises, a \nnew culture of international solidarity is essential.  \n Likewise, a profound reform of our Organization \nis needed to make it more democratic, more \nrepresentative and transparent. Sixty-five years after its \ncreation, the United Nations does indeed need to be \nreformed in order to become more effective and better \nplaced to meet the aspirations of our peoples. Let us \nmake it an effective instrument in the service of peace, \nsecurity, development and human rights. Only in that \nway will current and future generations in all countries \nand all regions of the world see their hopes of living in \npeace realized in a world that is free and prosperous, \nwithout fear, poverty or need."

        "file_text": "The world is undergoing \nprofound changes. Globalization is progressing at an \nunprecedented speed. The boundaries between \ndomestic and foreign policy are evolving. \nDevelopments in one region of the world may trigger \nunintended actions in other parts of the world. New \nactors \u2014 for good or for bad \u2014 have stepped on to the \ninternational scene. The world is now on the way to \nrecovery from the financial and economic crises of \nrecent years. More structural challenges, such as \nclimate change, poverty and demographic projections, \nas well as new security threats, however, will \nincreasingly impact the global agenda. If we are to \nrespond to such challenges, we need an effective \nmultilateral system founded on universal rules and \nvalues and on global legitimacy. Here, we turn to the \nUnited Nations. \n With the Lisbon Treaty in force, the European \nUnion has established the necessary structures to take \non the challenges of the twenty-first century and has \nenhanced its capacity as a global player. We look \nforward to seeing this reflected in the future position of \nthe European Union in the United Nations, and we \nregret that it has not been possible to come to an \nagreement on this issue (see A/64/PV.122). The \nEuropean Union will retain observer status at the \nGeneral Assembly. The main effect of the draft \nresolution will be to enable the European Union\u2019s new \npermanent interlocutors to represent the European \nUnion effectively in the General Assembly, speaking \non behalf of the European Union and of its member \nStates, as agreed by them. The European Union has a \nclear commitment to effective multilateralism, with the \nUnited Nations at its core. \n One of the most significant global challenges \ntoday is to fulfil the promises of the Millennium \nDeclaration (resolution 55/2) for a better world for \neveryone. With last week\u2019s Millennium Development \nGoals summit, a new momentum has been built \u2014 a \nmomentum for action, for the implementation of \ncommitments and for focusing our common efforts to \nreach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by \n2015. Five years is not a long time, especially when we \nalso need to overcome the effects of the financial and \neconomic crisis. But our task is clear. We must make \nthe MDGs a reality for all. We need to accelerate \nprogress and scale up our efforts where approaches \nhave proven to be successful. We have to be \ninnovative. Developing countries must focus their \npolitical will, administrative capacity and budgetary \nresources on reaching the MDGs, while we as donors \nmust live up to and fulfil our official development \nassistance commitments. \n We have clear evidence that fragile and conflict-\naffected countries are lagging behind the most with \nregard to the achievement of the MDGs. The \ncomparative advantage of the United Nations system \nand its unique possibilities in combining humanitarian, \npeacekeeping, peacebuilding, recovery and development \napproaches are especially relevant in relation to these \ncountries. We strongly encourage the ongoing efforts to \nstrengthen the United Nations role in this regard. We \n \n \n31 10-55276 \n \nwelcome the Secretary-General\u2019s steps to strengthen \nthe peacebuilding architecture, but more work is \nneeded in areas such as strengthened integrated \nmissions, improving in-country leadership, and \nstrengthening the Peacebuilding Support Office in \norder to forward the peacebuilding agenda. \n Green growth is an important challenge that \noffers new opportunities for employment, innovation \nand wealth creation in developed and developing \ncountries alike. Together, we must strive to optimize \nresource efficiency and apply green technologies. \nRenewable energy is a good example of how new \ntechnologies can contribute to development by \nproviding secure, sustainable and affordable energy to \nmillions of people. Green growth is not an obstacle to \ndevelopment but an opportunity. We must unite our \nefforts to take this agenda forward in the immediate \nfuture and in preparation for the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development in May 2012. \n Climate change continues to be one of the \ngreatest and most pressing challenges of our time, and \nwe are already starting to experience the consequences \u2014 \nfrom melting icecaps in the Arctic, heatwaves in Russia \nand floods in Pakistan to droughts in Africa. It \nconcerns all of us, and concerted and urgent action is \nneeded. The Copenhagen Accord contains delicate \npolitical compromises, paving the way for eventually \nreaching a global, legally binding international \nagreement within the United Nations framework. More \nthan 130 countries, covering more than 80 per cent of \nglobal emissions, have now associated themselves with \nthe Accord reached in Copenhagen in December last \nyear. We underline the importance of the commitments \non fast-start financing, which must be fulfilled. We are \nlooking forward to the sixteenth Conference of the \nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, and hoping for \na successful outcome that will significantly advance \nnegotiations on climate change. \n In the ever more interdependent and ever more \nuncertain world we live in, it is of priority to uphold \nthe principles, objectives, universal rights and \nfundamental values that are enshrined in the United \nNations Charter and that form the very basis for global \nstability, development and global prosperity. \nStrengthening the mutual understanding between \ncultures is an important challenge and a valuable \nopportunity for all of us. \n During the past month, we have witnessed just \nhow important it is to maintain mutual respect and \nunderstanding. As history has taught us, there are \nalways those who are ready to do the unthinkable in \norder to catch the attention of the international media. \nThe threats to burn the Koran in Florida were a \nparticularly repulsive example of this phenomenon. We \nstrongly condemn such acts, but as we have learned, \nthe more attention we give such individual acts of \nprovocation, the more they will multiply. We must \nnever allow such acts to steer our steps from the path \nof dialogue. We must stand firmly and jointly against \nany call to strife and violence. \n States must ensure the human rights and \nfundamental freedoms of their citizens in order for \neach individual to take an active part in shaping his or \nher own future to the benefit and prosperity of all. \nWomen\u2019s rights and gender issues are an essential part \nof human rights. The women\u2019s rights agenda supports \nand strengthens the overall effort of human rights\u2019 \nimplementation. International peace and security rest \nupon the ability and willingness of States to ensure the \nprotection of their populations from human rights \nviolations and atrocity crimes. \n In this context, I welcome the ongoing debate \namong Member States on the responsibility to protect. \nDenmark will take an active part in the further \ndevelopment of this concept, which provides the \nframework for a comprehensive approach. It is closely \nlinked to another key Danish priority \u2014 that of \nstrengthening the rule of law. Be it at the global, \nregional or national level, the rule of law provides \ntransparency and accountability and thereby leads to \nbetter governance. The establishment of the office of \nOmbudsperson in relation to the Security Council \nCommittee established pursuant to resolution 1267 \n(1999) was a successful example of our work at the \nglobal level. \n Piracy off the coast of Somalia presents a \nregional challenge that Denmark \u2014 through its naval \nefforts off Somalia and its chairmanship of the legal \nworking group of the Contact Group on Piracy off the \nCoast of Somalia \u2014 is committed to meeting. At the \nnational level Denmark, in close cooperation with \npartner countries, provides hundreds of millions of \ndollars to strengthen legal systems and judicial \ncapacities throughout the world. Let me stress here that \nour support for the International Criminal Court in no \nway springs from a wish for the Court to prosecute all \n  \n \n10-55276 32 \n \ninternational crimes. National jurisdictions are almost \nalways better placed to combat impunity, and through \nour rule of law programmes we seek to promote true \nnational ownership and complementarity for those able \nand willing to face the hard choices. \n The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nis the most serious danger emanating from \nglobalization. Following many years of deadlock, \nhowever, 2010 has been a year of progress. We \nwelcome the international momentum in dealing with \nthe issue of nuclear weapons as reflected in the New \nSTART agreement between the United States and the \nRussian Federation, the nuclear summit and, notably, \nthe results of the Review Conference of the States \nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons (NPT) here in New York in May. It is \nimportant that all States parties commit to \nimplementing the measures of the NPT action plan.  \n The issue of non-proliferation remains high on \nthe agenda, not least due to our deepening concerns \nabout the allegedly peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear \nprogramme. With the adoption of Security Council \nresolution 1929 (2010), the international community \nhas sent a clear signal to the Iranian leadership that we \ndo not tolerate the continuous and increasingly grave \nflouting of Iran\u2019s international obligations. It is hoped \nthat this resolution will help to convince Iran to change \nits current path and enter into negotiations. \n I should like to take this opportunity to welcome \nthe parliamentary elections in Afghanistan earlier this \nmonth, which represent yet another step on \nAfghanistan\u2019s road towards democracy. The elections \ncame after the successful outcome of the Kabul \nConference. We look forward to the implementation of \nthe Conference initiatives leading to the transition to \nfull Afghan ownership in all areas. \n The international community and the United \nNations must continue to play a supporting role in \nAfghanistan in the years to come. In this context, \nDenmark believes there needs to be a coordinated \ncivilian and military engagement in Afghanistan as a \nprecondition for success. The regional aspects also \nneed to be addressed. In this context, my thoughts go \nto the people and the Government of Pakistan, who \nhave not only experienced sacrifices due to terrorism, \nbut also heavy losses and suffering due to the \nunprecedented flooding of the country. Denmark has \ncommitted more than $45 million in assistance to \nPakistan so far this year. \n Denmark welcomes the recent relaunch of direct \nnegotiations between the leaders of Israel and the \nPalestinian Authority on reaching an agreement on all \nthe core issues within one year. We also welcome the \nQuartet\u2019s statement encouraging these negotiations. \nThey will be difficult, but we believe that an agreement \nis possible and that it is in the interest not only of \nIsraelis and Palestinians, but also of the peoples in the \nregion and beyond. We strongly support the United \nStates efforts to facilitate the negotiations, and we call \non the parties to negotiate in good faith and to live up \nto their obligations. The direct peace talks actualize the \nimportance of enhanced international political and \nfinancial support for Palestinian State-building. \nDenmark and the European Union stand ready to assist \nin fulfilling the goals of two States for two peoples \nliving side by side in peace and security. \n Peace needs to be secured in all parts of the \nworld. In this context, the implementation of the 2005 \nComprehensive Peace Agreement is vital to the future \nof the Sudan. The international community needs to \nsupport the referendum process to secure inclusive, \nfree and transparent elections. Without prejudging the \noutcome of the referendum, I should like to stress the \nimportance of developing institutional capacity and of \ncreating more self-sustainability in South Sudan. \nLikewise, we are very concerned about the \nhumanitarian situation in many parts of the country. \nFocus should be on securing access to all areas for \nhumanitarian workers and international peacekeepers. \nIn Somalia, the focus must be on the need to support \nthe Transitional Federal Government and improve the \ncoordination of assistance, including within the United \nNations system. \n The best way to deal with these global challenges \nis through an effective and strong multilateral system \u2014 \nthrough a strong United Nations system. The ability of \nthe United Nations effectively and efficiently to deal \nwith the global challenges of the twenty-first century \nmust be improved. Continuing the paths of system-\nwide coherence and delivering as one is part of that. \nReforms of the intergovernmental machinery and of the \nworkings of the Secretariat must also be pursued. We \nwelcome the ongoing intergovernmental negotiations \non Security Council reform aimed at changing the \nmembership in order to reflect the world of today. Let \nme take this opportunity to welcome the establishment \n \n \n33 10-55276 \n \nof UN Women and the appointment of Ms. Michelle \nBachelet of Chile as the first Under-Secretary-General \nand head of that agency. We have high expectations \nthat the new entity will contribute to streamlining in \nthe area of gender, women\u2019s rights and development \nthroughout the United Nations system. \n In the area of peacekeeping we commend \ninitiatives, such as New Horizon, to readjust United \nNations peacekeeping efforts in light of the experiences \ngathered during the last decade of immense growth in \nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. \n Let me conclude by emphasizing that today\u2019s \nworld is more complex than ever. But on so many \nissues, countries want to work together towards long-\nlasting solutions. More often than not, they turn to the \nUnited Nations to find answers. They turn to an \ninternational body whose strength has been and still is \nbased on its unique global legitimacy. Hence they, and \nwe, expect the United Nations to live up to \nexpectations, to perform, to show leadership and to \npush the envelope. Global challenges call for global \nanswers. The United Nations must live up to this call, \nfulfilling the aspirations of the Charter. No less will do \nfor the twenty-first century. \n"

        "file_text": " First I congratulate \nyou, Sir, on your assuming the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I am sure \nthat under your able leadership our deliberations will \nbe fruitful. Let me also commend your predecessor, \nMr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, for the wisdom with which \nhe guided the Assembly at its previous session. \n The theme of our session, \u201cReaffirming the \ncentral role of the United Nations in global \ngovernance\u201d, is both timely and well chosen. As we \nenter the second decade of the twenty-first century, \nhumankind faces a multitude of challenges, challenges \nthat are complex, multifaceted and transnational; \nchallenges that defy national solutions alone; indeed, \nchallenges that demand international cooperation. \nThose are precisely challenges of the type that the \nUnited Nations is potentially best equipped to meet. \n Such a central role for the United Nations derives, \nabove all, from its near universal membership \u2014 a \nrepresentative United Nations. It derives also from its \neffectiveness, its capacity to deliver results: an \neffective United Nations that is capable of delivering \npeace and security worldwide; a United Nations that \nequally serves the interest of all nations, developed and \ndeveloping, large and small; a United Nations that \nprovides a robust institutional support for efforts to \nachieve prosperity and equitable development for all; a \nUnited Nations that advocates not only political and \ncivil rights, but also economic and social rights, to all \npeople around the world; a United Nations that promotes \ndemocracy and justice; in short, a United Nations that \ncan play a central role in global governance. \n A United Nations that is at the forefront in \naddressing global challenges requires that we, its \nMembers, must move together in cooperative action: \ncountries of the North and South, East and West, \ndeveloped and developing. We must each contribute to \nthe resolution of problems and not simply accentuate \ndivisions, for there is no monopoly of wisdom amongst \nany one of us. \n Each Member State can contribute to meeting the \nchallenges to the international community. Therefore, \nour Organization, the United Nations, must have the \nwherewithal, the means, to ensure that the full problem-\nsolving potential of every nation is unleashed. Therein \nrests the importance of reform of the United Nations.  \n The Security Council must better reflect the \ncontemporary world, not that of 1945. A more \nrepresentative Council would be a more effective \nCouncil. \n The General Assembly must be revitalized. A \nmore efficient Assembly is a more effective Assembly. \n The Economic and Social Council must be made \nmore relevant, in accordance with its Charter-mandated \nresponsibilities. \n Not least, the full potential of the Secretariat must \nbe harvested. Its structure and organization must be \neffective and efficient and made more cohesive. \n The central role of the United Nations in global \ngovernance is due not only to its capacity to reform, to \nenhance its representative character, but also to its \nability to deliver in overcoming contemporary global \nchallenges, to deliver on its Charter-provided purposes, \nor, as the Charter eloquently puts it in paragraph 4 of \nArticle 1, \u201cTo be a centre for harmonizing the actions \nof nations\u201d. \n As a Member State, Indonesia will do its part. We \nshall continue to contribute to United Nations \npeacekeeping efforts. We shall also strive to ensure that \nthe recent positive momentum on the issue of \ndisarmament is maintained. Therefore, Indonesia is on \n \n \n11 10-55276 \n \ntrack to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \nTreaty. \n Indonesia will also work tirelessly to ensure that \nthe United Nations continues to discharge its historic \nresponsibilities on the question of Palestine. Thus we \nwelcome and support the resumption of direct \nnegotiations between Israel and Palestine. This is a \nprecious opportunity for Palestine and Israel to find \nsolutions on all final status issues. \n We therefore strongly deplore the decision by the \nIsraeli Government not to extend the moratorium on \nthe building of settlements in the occupied territory. \nSuch a decision does not in any way contribute to a \nclimate conducive for the direct negotiations. \n We will continue to contribute to the capacity-\nbuilding of Palestine, to support the Palestinian people \nin preparing for the day when they finally exercise \ntheir right of sovereignty. \n Today\u2019s global threat to security demands more \neffective global action. The United Nations must do its \npart to promote global cooperation to address  \nnon-traditional security threats: terrorism, people \nsmuggling, drug trafficking, piracy and money \nlaundering, to cite just a few. \n The United Nations must also contribute to \nachieving common prosperity, to make a better world \nfor all. We support the strengthening of the United \nNations frameworks for the attainment of equitable and \nsustainable development. The Rio Declaration, the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), and the \nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation have been the \nmultilateral linchpin of this. \n We welcome the renewed commitment of all \nMember States to meet the MDGs by 2015. We need to \nstrengthen genuine partnership to deliver on these \npromises and to turn hope into reality. \n The challenges we face in attaining equitable and \nsustainable development are compounded by the real \nand imminent threat of climate change. Addressing \nclimate change is therefore essential. Accordingly, the \nUnited Nations should ensure that the sixteenth \nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \nin Mexico, results in a consensus agreement that \neffectively addresses climate change. It should build on \nthe Copenhagen Accord and the progress made in the \ntwo Working Groups in the fifteenth Conference. \n We also look forward to the 2012 United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development as an \nopportunity to enhance coordination, synergy and \ncoherence in efforts, including within the United Nations \nsystem, to address challenges to sustainable development. \n We need to strengthen the capacity of the United \nNations to deal with a complex array of natural \ndisasters, including the delivery of international \nhumanitarian assistance. \n We attach great importance to the review process \nof the Human Rights Council in 2011. We need to \nensure that the Council can truly support all countries, \ndeveloped and developing, to promote cooperation in \nthe field of human rights. \n And, not least, we need to see the United Nations \ncontribute effectively to the promotion of tolerance and \nmutual respect among cultures, religions, faiths and \ncivilizations. \n We, the Members of the United Nations, must \npromote better synergy between the United Nations \nand regional organizations and initiatives. Many global \nproblems become more manageable if there are \nsimultaneous efforts to address them at the regional \nlevel. That is why Indonesia continues to promote the \nstrengthening of cooperation between the United \nNations and the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN). \n Before the end of this year an ASEAN-United \nNations summit will be held in Viet Nam. Meanwhile, \nthe countries of ASEAN and other countries in the \nlarger Asia-Pacific region are building a regional \narchitecture that will bring about and sustain dynamic \nequilibrium in the region. ASEAN will, of course, be \nthe driving force in the building of this architecture. \n While the promotion of democracy is a global \nconcern, we are also vigorously promoting democratic \nvalues in our own region, through ASEAN and beyond. \nIn 2008, Indonesia launched the Bali Democracy Forum, \nthe only intergovernmental forum on political \ndevelopment in Asia. In doing so, we created an inclusive \nplatform for sharing experiences and best practices and \ngiving mutual support in the development of democracy \nin the region. This December, we will hold the third Bali \nDemocracy Forum, this time on the theme of \u201cDemocracy \nand the promotion of peace and stability\u201d. \n We in Indonesia cherish our democratic \ntransformation. As the world\u2019s third largest democracy, \n  \n \n10-55276 12 \n \nIndonesia is proof that Islam, democracy and \nmodernization can go hand in hand. But democracy is \nnot something that can be achieved once and for all \ntime. It is an endless journey, an unremitting process. It \nmust keep evolving to remain capable of addressing \nnew challenges. That is why we keep fine-tuning our \npolitical institutions, so that they become more \neffective in serving the people. \n The same is true of the United Nations. It needs \ncontinuous reform, so that it serves all nations, \ndeveloped and developing; so that it will be a more \neffective instrument of humankind; so that it will \ndeliver peace and the dividends of peace. It is now time \nto make the United Nations deliver. "

His experience and competence \nqualify him to ably discharge his responsibilities, and I \nwish him every success in his endeavours. I also thank \nhis predecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, and extend \nto him and his fraternal country our appreciation for \nhis skilful stewardship of the work of the General \nAssembly during the previous session. I would also \nlike to express to the Secretary-General our \nappreciation and wishes for success in fulfilling the \ntasks entrusted to him. \n The Middle East region has been rife with \ntensions for many decades. It has survived major \nevents and numerous wars. The policies, interests and \ntrends that have unfolded on its soil have converged at \ntimes but clashed at others. Due to its geographic \nlocation, the Middle East influences neighbouring \ncountries in Asia, Europe and Africa and is, in turn, \ninfluenced by them. Syria, which lies at the heart of the \nMiddle East, has experienced these tensions, policies, \nevents and outcomes and has reacted to them. \n This fact \u2014 which has spelled both positive and \nnegative consequences for the Syrian Arab Republic \u2014 \nprompted us to define our perspective in addressing \nexternal issues, particularly the nature of our \ninternational relations. Safeguarding and sustaining \nSyrian and Arab interests is our priority. Therefore, our \ndoor remains open for an in depth and meaningful \ndialogue aimed at reconciling differences with others \nand reaching common ground on the basis of which \nprogress can be made. That was our response when \nSyria endured attempts to isolate and blockade it, a \nresponse we reaffirm today as Syria discharges its role \nas a major player in matters related to the security and \nstability of the region. We believe that civilized \ninternational relations must be built on openness and \ndialogue as opposed to insularity, isolation, \nconfrontation and aggression. This is our approach, \nwhich we hope will prevail in a world driven by \nmultiple interests and perspectives, overwhelmed by \nproblems and complications, yet at the same time \nsustained by hopes and noble visions. \n The world has declared that it is determined to \nachieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle \nEast, and has stressed that peace is an urgent \nprerequisite for the maintenance of security and \nstability in the region. In Israel, there is much talk \nabout peace, yet the drums of war continue to sound. \nLand appropriation for settlement-building goes on \nunabated. Peace negotiations, we are told, are currently \nunder way on the basis of the two-State solution, but \nsettlement activities are about to make this two-State \nsolution a dead letter that stands no chance of survival. \nIsrael is intensely pursuing its Judaization plans for \nJerusalem in order to depopulate it of its Palestinian \ninhabitants. Israeli actions threaten the safety of \nJerusalem\u2019s holy sites. Through settlement activities, \nactions and declarations concerning Jerusalem, Israel \npursues a fait accompli policy on the basis of which it \nimposes its will regardless of whether negotiations \ncontinue or stall. \n Peace can be genuine only if there is a genuine \nwill to make peace. That is the litmus test. Political \nmanoeuvres during negotiations under the umbrella of \nthe desire for peace strain and exacerbate the situation \nand may make it more volatile and explosive. \n Syria seeks a just and comprehensive peace \nachieved through the implementation of Security \nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), and the \nArab Peace Initiative. Our position has been known \nand declared for years. We have the will to make peace \nand we are the masters of our decision, which is \nunwavering. The occupied Syrian Golan is not \nnegotiable nor is it a bargaining chip. Recognition of \n  \n \n10-55264 20 \n \nthe fact that it must be returned fully is the basis on \nwhich peacemaking arrangements should be made. \nSyria is ready to resume peace negotiations from the \npoint where they stopped, through the Turkish \nmediator, if it finds in Israel a partner committed to the \nterms of reference of peacemaking, and if that partner \nhas the political will to achieve peace. \n We note with satisfaction the objective opinion of \nthe report of the Human Rights Council fact-finding \nmission investigating the Israeli attack on the freedom \nflotilla that was headed to Gaza on an exclusively \nhumanitarian mission (A/HRC/15/21). We look \nforward to the conclusions to be drawn from the report \nof the international commission now that the necessary \nlegal grounds and supporting evidence have been \nestablished by the Human Rights Council\u2019s fact-finding \nmission. \n Syria is a fraternal Arab neighbour of Iraq. For \nus, Iraq thus remains a subject of interest and a cause \nfor concern, particularly when the situation there \ndeteriorates. We embrace any improvement in \nconditions there with a major sense of relief. The \nrestoration of Iraq\u2019s full sovereignty and independence, \nthe preservation of its Arab and Islamic identity, the \nunity of its people and its territorial integrity are of \nutmost priority for our approach towards Iraq and its \nfuture. Undoubtedly, national unity remains the \ncornerstone of a secure, prosperous and strong Iraq. \n We have called for the withdrawal of all foreign \nforces from Iraq. In this context, the partial withdrawal \nof the American forces from Iraq constitutes, in our \nview, a positive first step in the direction of Iraq\u2019s \nassumption of its power over its own affairs and the \nrestoration of its full sovereignty over its territories. \nWe hope that Iraq will ultimately develop strong \nmilitary and security capabilities to safeguard its \ninternal security and safety as an independent and \nsovereign State. \n It should be reiterated that Iraqi security is \ncontingent upon its national unity and is based on its \nArab-Islamic identity and the principle of the \nparticipation of all segments of Iraqi society in \nbuilding their country\u2019s present and future. Syria is \nwilling to cooperate with Iraq in every aspect to serve \nIraq\u2019s interests and the common interests of our two \nfraternal countries. \n My country has been advocating the \nestablishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the \nMiddle East since 2003, a demand we included in a \ndraft resolution we presented to the Security Council at \nthe time. We continue to stress that Israel must be \nmade to comply with international decisions calling on \nit to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and to submit its nuclear \ninstallations to the comprehensive International Atomic \nEnergy Agency safeguards regime. Israel\u2019s accession to \nthe Treaty is of extreme significance for the security \nand stability of our region. \n We often wonder why some States talk about the \nuniversality of the NPT but hasten to make strenuous \nefforts to shelter Israel from the Agency\u2019s oversight. \nThey are encouraging Israel to continue to develop its \nnuclear military programme, which is a cause of \nconcern to the people of the region. Furthermore, this \npolicy of double standards runs counter to the \nnon-proliferation prerequisites, not only in the Middle \nEast region, but also in the world at large. \n We reaffirm that all States have the right to \nacquire nuclear technology for peaceful uses, as \nguaranteed by the NPT. We also call for the peaceful \nresolution of all disputes relevant to this aspect through \ndialogue. \n Syria follows the developments in the Sudan \nbecause we are dedicated to the Sudan\u2019s unity, \nsovereignty, security and stability. In that context, we \nare grateful to the State of Qatar, the League of Arab \nStates and the African Union for their efforts. We also \nappreciate and support the African Union\u2019s efforts in \nsettling disputes in the Sudan and other conflict zones \non the African continent, and in promoting Africa\u2019s \nrole within the international system. \n We also strongly reiterate our call to lift the \nembargo that has been imposed on Cuba for decades. \n The world has suffered numerous natural \ndisasters this year resulting from climate change and \nglobal warming. We all know that these disasters are \nbut a prelude to more severe and wider-scale calamities \nthat could well threaten natural life on this planet. We \nhave an obligation towards nature, yet we have \nexceeded all limits in abusing it. \n Many countries have chosen to ignore the \nwarnings of scientists and the ominous signals from \nnature. We must rise to this serious challenge and \nassume our historic responsibility, so as to make up for \npast imbalances and shortcomings. \n \n \n21 10-55264 \n \n We look forward to an expression of international \nsolidarity in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, based on scientific \nevidence and on the principle of common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities. It is our hope that the \nCanc\u00fan outcome will take into account the priorities of \nsustainable development in order to arrive at a \ncomprehensive and legally binding post-2012 \nframework agreement. We believe that it is extremely \nimportant to address the shortcomings of Copenhagen \nand to renew the commitment to the Bali Action Plan \nand the premises of the Kyoto Protocol. \n The painful situation in Pakistan, a typical \nsymptom of climate change, is yet another example of \nthe devastating disasters that we must expect unless we \nwork seriously and collectively to address this grave \nsituation. The people and Government of my country, \nSyria, wholeheartedly sympathize with Pakistan and \nother disaster-stricken countries. I stress the urgent \nneed for States to increase assistance to Pakistan, both \nin cash and in kind, to mitigate the tragic and \nwidespread damage there and prevent any further \nexacerbation of the situation. \n We aspire to a better, more just and secure world \nand look forward to strengthening and revitalizing the \nrole of the United Nations and guaranteeing respect for \ninternational law. We must not forget, though, that our \nplanet Earth is home to the world we are aspiring to \nbuild. This home is besieged by an ominous \nphenomenon, climate change, which entails tragic \nconsequences for humanity. This year was only a \nprelude to what is yet to come. We sincerely hope that \nthe Canc\u00fan conference will be the herald of a direly \nneeded rescue effort."

        "file_text": "I have the great honour to speak at \nthe sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly on \nbehalf of His Excellency Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema \nMbasogo, President and head of State of the Republic \nof Equatorial Guinea, who is not able to be here to \nparticipate, as he would have liked, owing to numerous \nhigh matters of State. \n In the name of the Government and the people of \nEquatorial Guinea, I would first like to address our \nmost sincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your \nunanimous and wise election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at this session. We wish you great \nsuccess in leading its work and deliberations. I also \nextend our thanks to the other elected members of the \nBureau. Most especially, we wish to express our \nadmiration and respect to His Excellency Mr. Ali \nAbdussalam Treki, outgoing President and eminent \ndiplomat of Africa, who did outstanding work as \nPresident at the sixty-fourth session and who is \nresponsible for our beginning this session with \noptimism. \n The Republic of Equatorial Guinea reaffirms its \nresolute commitment and attachment to the ideals, \nprinciples and objectives of the United Nations. In that \ncontext, I salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and \nreiterate to him the recognition of the Government and \npeople of Equatorial Guinea of his wise administration \nat the head of this great Organization. In particular, we \nappreciate his vision and the timeliness with which he \nhas identified the seven strategic themes of our current \nworld, which merit the greatest attention from every \nState Member during this session. \n Equatorial Guinea is taking part in the work of \nthis session with a good deal of optimism with regard \nto an eventual and gradual solution of the problems \ntoday facing humankind in general, and the African \ncontinent in particular. Above all, that is because since \nthe 1990s there have been several initiatives aimed at \nencouraging sustainable development. Those initiatives \nhave been promoted through major world conferences \nand summits that have addressed such major subjects \nas population and sustainable development, food, the \nenvironment and financing for development. In the \ncontext of this 2010 session, we shall consider the \nimplementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of \nthose major summits and conferences, such as the \nMillennium Summit. \n What can we see after more than 10 years since \nthose summits, especially the Millennium Summit? As \nhas been wisely pointed out in previous interventions \nin the Assembly, there is no point in doing things in the \nsame way and expecting different results. \n Unfortunately, both the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral (A/65/1) and the interventions delivered in \nrecent days by different delegations during the High-\n  \n \n10-55264 38 \n \nlevel Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals \nindicate that rather than improving, the number of \npeople who suffer from hunger has increased, the \nnumber of those living in poverty remains high and the \nenvironment has been degraded. The latter has led to \nserious climactic changes and the ensuing natural \ndisasters, including constant flooding, earthquakes, \nhurricanes and so on, which have caused total \ndestruction in several countries and seriously \nundermined people\u2019s ability to survive. \n Were that not enough, there has also been an \nincrease in acts of international terrorism, organized \nand cross-border crime and piracy on a continental \nlevel. There has also been a worsening in the acute \neconomic crisis, which continues to affect all \nhumankind. All those phenomena illustrate the need for \ngreater awareness and coordination on the part of every \ncountry on the planet. \n All of us must focus our efforts, energy and \nresources on promoting and maintaining peace and \nsecurity in the world, fostering a healthy environment \nand actively working and cooperating to eradicate \nnuclear weapons and to forcefully combat terrorism \nand international organized crime. We should work \nside by side to shape a world where there is a sense of \nparticipation and equality among men and women; a \nworld where Security Council reform allows for better \nrepresentation, participation and decision-taking that \nreflect the will and interests of every region and \ncountry of the world \u2014 large, medium or small. \n Previous interventions have underscored the \nimportance that \u201cevery Member country of the United \nNations be clearly involved here, at the heart of the \nUnited Nations, to respond to urgent matters of today\u2019s \nworld\u201d. It was that call that, in 2007, inspired His \nExcellency the President of the Republic of Equatorial \nGuinea to propose to the General Conference of the \nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization \u2014 UNESCO \u2014 the creation of an \ninternational prize for scientific investigation in the \nfield of life sciences. That $3 million contribution is \ndestined for the international scientific community, and \nits purpose is to seek solutions and remedies to the \nmajor pandemics and diseases that afflict the world \ntoday in general and especially the African continent. \n Despite the great need of the international \nscientific community, despite the potential to alleviate \nthe suffering of vulnerable communities, particularly in \nAfrica, despite having been duly approved by the \nStates members of the UNESCO Executive Board, and \ndespite the unanimous decision of the international jury \nfor the prize designating three international scientists, \nmost of them from developing countries, as winners, \nthis prize is still being blocked simply for being the \ninitiative of an African leader. \n The Republic of Equatorial Guinea cannot but \ndenounce the manipulations and manoeuvres of the \nnew UNESCO administration against the humanitarian \ninitiative of the people of Equatorial Guinea. As a State \nmember, we find it unprecedented and therefore \ndisturbing that a decision made by the Executive Board \nof a United Nations agency is not carried out by its \nleadership. What is most disturbing is that clear \nmanipulations and injustices of certain undeclared \ninterests have become apparent even in the heart of the \nUnited Nations-related organizations, as is, \nunfortunately, the case with UNESCO, where we \nbelieved that all the member States had the same \nconsideration and rights. \n For all of those reasons, the people and \nGovernment of Equatorial Guinea agree that this is the \nappropriate occasion and place to once more express \ntheir deep concern regarding the irresponsible, openly \nunjust and racist attitude that some actors, masked as \nnon governmental organizations, are orchestrating \nagainst the praiseworthy initiative and the \nhumanitarian intentions that led to the creation of the \nUNESCO Obiang Nguema Mbasogo Prize to motivate \nand encourage the action of scientists around the world \nin research for the preservation of life. \n The Republic of Equatorial Guinea asks that the \nUNESCO Obiang Nguema Mbasogo International \nPrize for Research in the Life Sciences come to fruition \nwithout further delay, in accordance with decision 180 \nEX/57, which was adopted by consensus by all the \nStates members of the UNESCO Executive Board in \nOctober 2008. \n The Republic of Equatorial Guinea is an \nindependent and sovereign State, governed by a \ndemocratic and pluralist political system that respects \nthe basic rights of people without racial, ethnic, gender \nor religious discrimination. Those principles are \ncontained in the fundamental law and in the laws that \nserve as the basis for our country\u2019s legal system, which \nguarantees and promotes the individual and collective \nfreedoms of the citizens of Equatorial Guinea and \n \n \n39 10-55264 \n \nprovides for punishment for offenders who could \nviolate the rule of law. Indeed, the Constitution of \nEquatorial Guinea reserves an important and privileged \nplace for human rights and basic freedoms, inasmuch \nas they are based on the United Nations Charter and \ntheir principles and goals are inspired by the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights. \n Therefore, our country has begun a reform of its \njudicial system and has already ratified several \ninternational agreements and treaties concerning the \npromotion and protection of human rights, which have \ncome to be an integral part of our legal system. \nLikewise, in the last 10 years the Government has \nmade significant progress in updating and adapting its \nlegislative, legal and administrative instruments with \nregard to the promotion and protection of civil and \npolitical rights, as well as social, economic and cultural \nrights. \n In addition to those enormous and ongoing \nefforts, the Government of Equatorial Guinea has taken \nseveral other relevant measures and provisions to \nstrengthen the implementation of the laws in force in \nthe country in order to promote human rights and the \nrule of law. A particular instance is the recent \nenactment of the new Organic Law of Judicial Power, \nwhich determines the overall organization of the \njudicial system and the operation of justice in \nEquatorial Guinea. \n In recent years, the world\u2019s nations have \nwitnessed an intensification and increase of violence in \nacts of terrorism, in particular starting with the tragedy \nthat took place in this beautiful and historic North \nAmerican city of New York on 11 September 2001. \nSuch acts have meant that the fight against terrorism \nhas become a one of the priorities of international and \nnational policy of all countries. \n In that disturbing context, the United Nations and \ninternational law have been defining a set of very strict \nobligations that States must comply with in order to \nensure an effective fight against that global scourge, \nwhich affects all States equally, irrespective of \nnationality or borders. In particular, we must bear in \nmind resolution 1373 (2001), and other related \nresolutions of the Security Council, which represents \nan important milestone with regard to international \nstandards in the fight against terrorism. Indeed, that \nresolution is a general standard and imposes upon \nStates a set of obligations that include that of \ncriminalizing specific conducts, such as the financing \nof terrorism or the recruitment of members of terrorist \ngroups. Consequently, the implementation of \ninternational standards in the fight against terrorism \nand, in particular, its criminal classification, is not \nmerely a decision of domestic criminal policy, but \nrather a matter of compliance with obligations imposed \nby international law in general. \n Our country has been a victim of terrorist attacks \non several occasions in the past five years, and as a \nresult the Government of Equatorial Guinea has put the \nfight against terrorism among the priorities of its \nAction Plan for national development, while at the \nsame time condemning in the most vigorous terms all \nacts of terrorism, regardless of their motivation or \norigin, since those acts constitute one of the most \nserious threats to international peace and security. \n Equatorial Guinea remains loyal to its \ncommitments and is deeply convinced of the need to \ncontinue the efforts it has been deploying in connection \nwith the Millennium Declaration and in harmony with \nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations \naimed at overcoming the many challenges of \ndevelopment. \n However, the current situation requires a closer \nand more dynamic, effective, sincere and coordinated \ncooperation, without any conditions, as well as the \ncoordinated and united support of all of the political \nforces of developed, developing and least developed \ncountries, with a view to promoting shared prosperity \nand a better future for all the world\u2019s countries. \n I would like to conclude my statement on behalf \nof the Government of Equatorial Guinea by renewing \nour strong desire to change the current concept and \nmanagement of international affairs \u2014 in which the \noften exclusive attitudes of certain States and regions \ncan be discerned \u2014 through a firmer and more sincere \ncommitment of the entire international community in \nfavour of the current United Nations reform process \nwhich is designed to strengthen multilateralism. Only \nin that way can we establish solid and lasting bases for \na world of peace and security \u2014 a prosperous world \nfor today and a solid inheritance for future generations."

        "file_text": "I stand before the Assembly \ngratified and in a position to salute it for playing a very \nimportant part in the process towards reconciliation in \nmy region, and for supporting the consolidation of the \nnew, modern Serbia. In a few days, we will proudly \ncelebrate the tenth anniversary of our peaceful \ndemocratic revolution. \n In a world confronted by so many threats, the \nUnited Nations must constantly reaffirm its original \npurpose and adapt to new challenges. The United \nNations has confronted, through its many agencies, the \nscourges of discrimination, disease, hunger, poverty \nand environmental degradation. In other words, the \nUnited Nations has built a capacity to create rules that \ntranscend frontiers, rules that we all respect. \n One thing that we have all embraced, as Member \nStates of the United Nations, is the wish to find \nsolutions to all challenges through peaceful means, \ndialogue and consensus. \n I opened with a specific reference to the General \nAssembly. A few weeks ago it adopted by acclamation \nresolution 64/298, proposed by Serbia and sponsored \nby the 27 States members of the European Union, \nacknowledging the content of the advisory opinion of \nthe International Court of Justice (ICJ) regarding the \nunilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo. \n The resolution is fundamentally status-neutral \nwith regard to the status of Kosovo. All other \ninterpretations do not correspond to the truth. The \nresolution welcomed the readiness of the EU to \nfacilitate a process of dialogue between the parties. \nSerbia welcomes the resolution. We look forward to \nengaging in the process that will hopefully lead to a \nmutually acceptable compromise solution to the \nproblem of Kosovo.\n \n We feel vindicated in our contention that the path \nto dialogue lay through the natural process of \ninternational legitimacy. The General Assembly sought \nan opinion from the International Court of Justice. The \nICJ delivered an opinion. The General Assembly has \nnow, as a consequence, called for dialogue. Moreover, \nthat request comes as a consequence of a joint effort \nbetween Serbia and the European Union. \n In the light of that, we sought reaffirmation of the \nvalidity of the international system as we know it. We \nfeel proud that our faith in this process has produced \nresults. We have always said that we are ready to \nengage in dialogue. But that dialogue must be framed \nby rules and accountability, and this has been achieved \nthrough the latest vote of the General Assembly. \n Many have been involved in this process, and we \nare grateful for the contributions of all those who in the \ndebate on the draft resolution expressed understanding \nfor the position of Serbia. Our issue has been the first \ntest of the new post-Lisbon institutions of the European \nUnion, which we consider our natural and eventual \nhome. We are encouraged by the commitment and \nsense of purpose of the leadership of these new \ninstitutions. \n We should be very clear. Serbia has always \nmaintained that the attempt to secede unilaterally is a \nviolation of the basic principles of the Charter, the \nHelsinki Final Act and Security Council resolution \n1244 (1999). A vast majority of United Nations \nMember States refrained from recognizing Kosovo\u2019s \nunilateral declaration of independence. They have \ncontinued to abide by their Charter obligations to \nrespect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of my \ncountry. On behalf of the Republic of Serbia, I once \nagain sincerely thank those countries for their support \nand solidarity. \n Serbia\u2019s position remains unchanged. The \nunilaterally declared independence of Kosovo will not \nbe recognized by Serbia explicitly or implicitly. This is \nenshrined in our Constitution. We have repeatedly said \nthat we seek dialogue, but within a framework of \nglobally acknowledged law, the law of the United \nNations. For this reason, we insisted on the process of \n  \n \n10-55103 10 \n \nseeking the opinion of the International Court of \nJustice and the subsequent General Assembly \nresolution related to the Court\u2019s opinion. \n Let me be very clear as to what the Court did and \ndid not say. Its advisory opinion reaffirmed that \nKosovo remains under the interim administration of the \nUnited Nations, and that Security Council resolution \n1244 (1999) and the United Nations Constitutional \nFramework for Provisional Self-Government in \nKosovo stay in force and continue to apply. That means \nthat this part of our territory remains subject to an \ninternational regime mandated by the Security Council. \n The centrality and leading role of the Security \nCouncil in determining the comprehensive settlement \nof the Kosovo issue remains paramount, and will \nprovide legitimacy to the result. The Court also did not \nendorse the view that Kosovo\u2019s unilateral declaration \nof independence was sui generis \u2014 a unique case. Nor \ndid it endorse any avowed right to self-determination \nfor the province\u2019s ethnic Albanians. \n The Court chose to examine the language of \nKosovo\u2019s unilateral declaration of independence, and \nheld the view that the text of the declaration itself did \nnot contain anything that violates international law. \nThe Court, thus, did not approve the province\u2019s right to \nsecession from Serbia, nor did it support the claim that \nKosovo is a sovereign State. \n The Court\u2019s opinion is clear: the unilateral \ndeclaration of independence was only \u201can attempt to \ndetermine finally the status of Kosovo\u201d (A/64/881, \nadvisory opinion, para. 114). The General Assembly \nresolution relating to the Court\u2019s opinion \nacknowledged this content of the Court\u2019s advisory \nopinion. It is within this framework that we are ready \nto follow the Assembly\u2019s resolution and to engage in a \ndialogue. \n We are now ready to talk, and we will do so in \ngood faith. Therefore, Serbia asks all Member States to \nengage fully in the spirit of their vote in the Assembly, \nin which they called for a dialogue to be facilitated by \nthe European Union. \n A dialogue requires trust. Soon the two parties \nwill be talking to each other for the first time in many \nyears. We must be patient and seek out those issues \nwhich allow confidence to be built on each side. There \nwill be many issues to discuss, and some of them will \nbe complicated. \n All Member States can contribute to an \natmosphere that creates trust. We are entering a phase \nin which creative solutions require political \nimagination, respect for our own democratic \ninstitutions and great skill. I trust that it can be a phase \nin which all parties leave behind them anachronistic \nanalyses and diplomatic ambushes. We must be able to \nbuild confidence to have trust. \n Serbia believes that the continued pursuit of \nrecognition is futile and counter-productive to the spirit \nin which we now enter this phase. All those who \nwanted to make their point have made it, and we still \ndo not have a clear settlement. I want to underline that \nit is of critical importance for Member States that have \nnot recognized Kosovo\u2019s unilateral declaration of \nindependence to stay the course on non-recognition \nthroughout the dialogue process. That will be a \nsignificant contribution to ensuring that unilateral \nattempts to impose outcomes of ethnic and territorial \ndisputes are not legitimized, thereby preventing \nKosovo\u2019s unilateral declaration of independence from \nbecoming a dangerous and destabilizing precedent. \n Until now, statehood has never been attained \nwithout the consent of the parent State. A durable \nsettlement on an issue of such magnitude and \nsensitivity has never been the product of compulsion; it \nalways necessitates consent. \n It would be equally harmful if there were \nattempts to alter realities on the ground while \ndiscussions get under way. Any attempt to change these \nrealities through the use of force would bring an \nimmediate end to the process of dialogue. \n I address the Assembly today as a leader who \nbelieves that the future lies in seeking reconciliation. \nOur National Assembly adopted a historic Declaration \non Srebrenica: a crime was condemned and an apology \nwas extended. There is little precedent for such an \naction, and I am proud, in that it demonstrates the \nmaturity of the democracy of Serbia. \n I hope that more such gestures throughout the \nregion will help us create a new region in which our \nshared history will unite us morally rather than divide \nus politically. For this, surely, is the foundation upon \nwhich the future will be built. \n My guiding light is the history of the European \nUnion. It should be for the entire region of South-East \nEurope. The European Union has been a story of \n \n \n11 10-55103 \n \nreconstruction and reconciliation. That story is not \nover. The Union faces its own challenges, and we in \nour region must assume the responsibility of emulating \nit. We must absorb the values and culture of today\u2019s \nEurope in order that the Union absorbs us. \n This is a delicate exercise, in which expectations \nmust be carefully nurtured. The EU is evolving. But so \nis our region. In this dynamic, we have to assume that \nthe European Union will remain true to its word that \nthe inhabitants of the region now referred to as the \nWestern Balkans will all become citizens of the \nEuropean Union. It would be a geographical, historical \nand cultural aberration if this were not so. However, as \nthe region goes through its own changes, it is \nparticularly sensitive to the signals that it receives from \nthe European Union. We hope that as the new \ninstitutions of the Union take shape, we will have an \nincreasingly clear communication from and with the \nEU. \n It is also true that our region is changing. To a \nvery large extent, it is changing to the good. We should \nrecognize the many new levels of cooperation that \nexist in our region. The Western Balkans \u2014 which has \nbeen affected by the financial crisis \u2014 is a story of \nmany small and larger incremental successes. In fact, \nrelations have never been better. But the region must \nalso acknowledge that as it develops its successes can \ngenerate new challenges. \n There is one area, therefore, on which I wish to \nspeak with a clarity that may be deemed undiplomatic. \nOrganized crime is now a global industry. It is the dark \nside of globalization. It attaches itself to weak \nsocieties. It attaches itself to political and religious \nextremists. It attempts to buy and subvert democracies. \nLike water, it spreads to where it finds least resistance. \nIt is global and globalized in its interconnections. \n Organized crime, I want to state emphatically, is \nin the Western Balkans. I consider it to be the greatest \nsingle challenge to my country and to the whole \nregion. It always has been present, and it was given \nsolid foundations because of the wars in our region. \nBut I fear that it is developing capabilities \u2014 acquired \nfrom the globalization of crime and access to \ntechnology \u2014 at a much faster pace. The criminals \nconcerned are bringing drugs, guns, human trafficking \nand corruption into our societies. In doing so, they are \nusing our region to spread into Europe. I fear that we \nare in a race against time in our region. The stark \nchoice is that South-Eastern Europe will become either \na valuable bridge between Europe and vital areas to the \nEast or it will become the beachhead of organized \ncrime trying to reach Europe. \n We have a common responsibility as leaders in \nour region to eliminate this scourge on our societies, \nand Serbia will spare no effort in our quest to eradicate \nthis threat. It is our responsibility to all our neighbours. \nFor this reason there has been a growing number of \nmeetings and consultations between us in the region on \nthis matter. \n But today I want to say that this issue cannot be \naddressed tactically and occasionally. It is a strategic \nissue that affects all of Europe. I am therefore asking \nthat we all become alert to the next generation of \nthreat. \n In our region, we have a responsibility to create a \nstrategic alliance against organized crime. We hope \nthat all Western Balkan States will make fighting it a \npriority. We owe this to our citizens, we owe it to our \nneighbours in the European Union, and we owe it to \nthe next generation. \n Serbia has historically been part of global \nmovements. That is why we are totally engaged in \nachieving membership of the European Union. That is \nwhy we support the United Nations system. It is also \nwhy we are now moving to reactivate the many \nrelationships that we built historically, as part of the \nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM). \n My country is the largest successor to a founding \nmember of the Movement. Serbia\u2019s capital, Belgrade, \nwas the site of the First NAM Summit in 1961. 1 am \nproud that one of the capstone events marking the \nMovement\u2019s fiftieth anniversary will be celebrated in \nBelgrade next September. \n As part of our commitment to the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, we are strengthening many of our \nengagements and commitments worldwide through the \nMovement. We shall contribute to those countries that \nwould welcome assistance, and we look to an \nintensification of cooperation. I hope that this is a clear \nsignal that my Government believes in an active global \nengagement that will contribute to both global \nsolidarity and the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals."

        "file_text": "\nThis is the first time I have participated in the general \ndebate since the declaration of the Plurinational State \nof Bolivia and my fifth as President \u2014 since I took on \nenormous responsibilities towards my people, acting \nthrough social movements. \n I would like to quickly say that in four and a half \nyears in government, we have begun to bring profound \nstructural and social change to Bolivia. Fortunately, \ntwo weeks ago, the United Nations recognized that \nextreme poverty had decreased from 41 to 32 per cent. \nIn four and a half years, our small country of \n10 million inhabitants has seen its national reserves \ngrow from $1.7 billion to $9 billion. The rate of \neconomic growth is currently 5 per cent, while before I \narrived it was barely 3 per cent. \n There has been a democratization of the national \neconomy, with grants and subsidies that have allowed \nfor the improvement of the economic situation of the \npoorest and most abandoned \u2014 in particular those of \nthe rural and indigenous movement, but also our \nbrothers and sisters the workers, and our brothers and \nsisters from the barrios of Bolivia\u2019s big cities. \n However, the improvement of our economy has \nbasically come with the recovery of our oil and gas \nreserves, and with the nationalization of these natural \nresources. Let me say that earlier, and unfortunately, \nunder instructions from the International Monetary \nFund (IMF), our natural resources were privatized. \nMoreover, the IMF contracts stated that the owner, the \ntransnational oil company, would have the rights from \nthe wellhead. The Fund Governors were telling us that \nas long as the oil or gas was underground, it belonged \nto the Bolivian State and the Bolivian people, but that \nonce it was taken out and reached the wellhead, it was \nthe property of the transnationals. From these \nmega-fields the oil transnationals received 82 per cent \nof the gas and oil revenue, while the Bolivian people \nwere left with only 18 per cent. \n It is a matter of responsibility. Countries that \ninvest have the right to recover their investment and \nthey have the right to make profits, but not 82 per cent \nof all of the profits from our oil and gas resources. On \n1 May 2006, the Government decreed, first, that the \nState would take control of all oil fields. We \nnationalized them. Secondly, so that the investing \ncompany, seeking to recover their investment, could do \nso and make a profit. We looked at the numbers \n \n \n35 10-54833 \n \ncarefully in order to ensure that the company would not \nbe harmed. Our data showed that with 18 per cent of \nthe profit, they would recover their investment and \nthey would even have access to profits. \n What I did with our supreme decree, after taking \ntotal State control of gas and oil, was to ensure that the \nState, the Bolivian people, received 82 per cent of the \nprofits and the investing oil company, 18 per cent. \nThese companies continue to be present in our country \nand continue to invest in Bolivia. We had discovered \nthat there was an ongoing sacking of our natural \nresources and this alone has brought changes to our \neconomy. For example, since 1940, Bolivia had never \nhad a budget surplus, only deficits. But once we had \nnationalized oil and gas, in 2006, the first year of my \nadministration, we had a surplus. With this surplus, we \nwere able to provide grants and subsidies for some of \nthe most vulnerable sectors of the population, namely, \nyoung people and the elderly. \n In February 2003, when I was a union leader and \nNational Deputy, the International Monetary Fund \ninstructed the then Government to institute an income \ntax or to increase fuel prices in order to decrease the \nbudget deficit \u2014 not to eliminate it, but to decrease it. \nThe Government decided to institute an income tax. \nThere was an uprising by those affected by this tax, \nand in two days of confrontation there were 15 dead. \n I would like to say from here at the United \nNations to the world and to the Bolivian people that, \nwithout income taxes and without increasing fuel \nprices, we had a surplus in the first year of our \nadministration. It was so important to have recovered \nour natural resources and to have recovered our \ncompanies providing basic services. \n Sooner or later the International Monetary Fund \nhas to redress the damage it has done to Bolivia and to \nLatin America. But it appears that the International \nMonetary Fund, under the pretext of structural \nadjustment, is continuing to impose policies on some \ncountries \u2014 policies of pillaging natural resources. It \ndid us great harm. I am demanding officially that the \nInternational Monetary Fund pay for the economic \ndamage and the damage to human beings that resulted \nfrom these impositions which, in Bolivia, resulted in \ndeath, injury and hunger. So I am very pleased that we have begun to \nchange Bolivia. Of course, it is impossible to meet all \nthe demands that our indigenous brethren have been \nmaking for 500 years, or that other brethren or regions \nhave been making for hundreds of years \u2014 or indeed \nthe demands which have arisen from 20 years of \nneoliberal Government in our country. \n We are living in times of deep and sweeping \nchanges. We have an enormous responsibility to future \ngenerations. The fate of Planet Earth depends on what \nwe do or do not do. \n We know ourselves. We have many ideological \ndifferences. We have many differences in our \nprogrammes, our cultures and our societies. We have \nmany differences from one continent to another. The \neconomic asymmetries are profound. But despite these \ndifferences we at the United Nations must work \ntogether, united. Why united? We must be united so \nthat human rights will be well and truly protected \naround the world. I come here to propose an alliance of \nall presidents and Governments so that we can save \nhumankind and save Planet Earth \u2014 or save \nhumankind by saving Planet Earth. \n There are four main objectives, the first being the \nprotection of human rights. I commend the many \nGovernments that last week adopted a proposal from \nthe Government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia \nthat water be recognized as a human right. Next will be \nenergy and after that communication. We must move \nforward and respond to the needs of the most \nvulnerable \u2014 the poor, the disenfranchised, the \nmigrants. All basic services in Bolivia are a human \nright under the Constitution. And we are currently \ntranslating that concept into practice, so that all these \nbasic services will truly be a human right. That is why \nI think it important to have an alliance now, in this new \nmillennium, to see that human rights are guaranteed for \nall. \n I should also like to say that it is indefensible in \nthe twenty-first century to continue to persecute and \nexpel migrants \u2014 whether they are migrants because \nof economic problems or because of climate change or \na natural disaster. I would like to take this opportunity \nto say that I learned from the media that President \nObama is rejecting the Arizona law. We must recognize \nthe need to put an end to policies \u2014 wherever they \noriginate, including the return policies of Europe \u2014 \nthat have the effect of expelling migrants. When our \n  \n \n10-54833 36 \n \nancestors migrated because of war or famine from \nEurope to Latin America there was no expulsion of \nmigrants. Those European migrants took over \nthousands of hectares and pillaged natural resources, \nand no one said anything. But now that our brothers \nand sisters, driven by lack of work, emigrate in search \nof jobs in the United States or Europe, they suffer \npersecution, discrimination and expulsion. This has to \nstop. Our alliance must also examine the fate of these \nbrothers and sisters. \n I have also heard it said that walls or fences are \nbeing built in, for example, Mexico and Palestine. As \nfar as I know, fences are only built to keep in cattle, \nsheep and cows. We cannot confuse human beings with \nanimals and build fences to keep them in. It makes no \nsense. But I also want to say: how can we prevent \nhuman beings from going from one continent to \nanother? We have heard much opinion in this debate on \nthe subject of free-market policies. Are commodities to \ncirculate freely around the world but not human \nbeings? What type of discriminatory policies do we \nhave? Those walls of shame must disappear. I listened \ncarefully to the address by the Secretary-General. He \nwants the United Nations to be strong in the interests \nof good governance. I share that opinion but believe \nthat we can only achieve this when we resolve the \nproblems of the world\u2019s most defenceless people, who \nare migrants in this case. And that is why it is \nimportant for us to be rid of these walls. \n But there is something else that is unthinkable in \nthe twenty-first century: the economic blockade of \nCuba. Everyone calls for the lifting of this embargo, \nimposed because Cuba was a Communist or socialist \ncountry. I want you to know that I too preside over a \nGovernment that is anti-capitalist, which, I think, is \nwhy the United States Department of State tries to \nmarginalize and exclude us. That is not a solution. \nPeople will continue to rebel against systems and \neconomic models that do not resolve the problems of \nthe majority in all our countries. I respectfully ask \nPresident Obama to put an end to the economic \nblockade of Cuba and the economic blockade of the \nGaza Strip in Palestine. If the United States is \u2014 and \nwe all know this to be the case \u2014 the supreme world \nPower, it has the authority to end this injustice and this \nviolation of the human rights of millions around the \nworld. \n The second objective of this alliance of \nGovernments to save humanity is its most important \nresponsibility: determining how to save Mother Earth. \nWhat concerns me greatly is that some countries, \ninstead of conserving Nature, are looking at how to \nmake a business out of climate change, putting a price \non Nature. We must not privatize our forests; we must \nnot sell carbon bonds as if the forest\u2019s only role were to \nabsorb carbon dioxide. Any country that does so is \nmaking a grave mistake. \n I want to share something from our culture and \nour experience in the indigenous world. We indigenous \npeoples live in harmony with Mother Earth, in \nharmony with Nature. Why do we live in harmony with \nNature? We came from the Earth, we live on the Earth \nand to earth we will return. The Earth, Planet Earth, \nNature, \u201cPachamama\u201d, Mother Earth \u2014 this is our \nhome, this is our mother. The Earth gives us life: water, \nnatural resources, the abundance of Nature. How can \nwe turn Mother Nature into a business? \n Because of the discussion I have with social \nmovements around the world, particularly with \nindigenous movements, I am convinced that the planet \ncan exist without human beings, but human beings \ncannot exist without the planet. As human beings have \nrights, like the right to life, so too does the planet, \nMother Nature, have the right to life. Just as we human \nbeings reproduce, biodiversity has a right to \nregenerate. For these and many other reasons besides, \nwe have the obligation to save Planet Earth. \n Within that context, our proposal is quite simple. \nHere at the United Nations we must develop a project \nto protect the rights of Mother Earth. This morning \nPresident Obama referred to the adoption in 1948 of \nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the \nUnited Nations. That was 62 years ago; before that we \ndid not have rights. Later civil, economic and political \nrights were adopted. Three years ago the rights of \nindigenous peoples were adopted here. Now in this \nmillennium we should adopt the rights of Mother \nEarth. And if we do not do this, we will be responsible \nfor a world disaster. \n To take an example: in a plane some people travel \nin first class, others in business class, while the \nmajority travel in coach, economy class. If the plane \ncrashes, no one survives \u2014 neither the first-class \npassenger nor the economy-class passenger. Is that \nwhat we want? It will be the same if we do not save \nMother Earth. The transnational company with lots of \nmoney, the millionaire \u2014 all of us will be equally \n \n \n37 10-54833 \n \naffected by the environmental problems that come with \nclimate change. \n That is why I want to tell you how important it is \nthat we prepare for Canc\u00fan, where we will have a great \nopportunity. I will propose there that we have an \nalliance of all the presidents and heads of government \nof the world, headed by the Secretary-General of the \nUnited Nations. What will the alliance be for? So that \ntogether we can determine how to cool the planet. We \nare talking about global warming. How can we cool the \nplanet? We, as peoples and Governments, are \nresponsible for humankind. The people, at a summit in \nCochabamba, Bolivia, said that we must stabilize the \ntemperature increase at 1 degree Celsius. The \ndeveloped countries, which are primarily responsible \nfor global warming, must commit to reducing their \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent during the \nsecond period of the Kyoto Protocol. Let us assume our \nresponsibilities to cool Planet Earth. \n I would like to discuss the serious situation in \nwhich my country finds itself. We sometimes buy drills \nto deal with droughts, and yet even by drilling we \ncannot find water. And if we do find it, it is buried ever \ndeeper and occurs in ever-smaller quantities. Soon, \ndespite all our drilling to obtain water, we will not find \nit. So what use will the drills be then? Our mountains \nare losing their snow fields. This is extremely serious. I \ntherefore find it extremely important that we stabilize \nthe temperature increase at 1 degree Celsius, as the \npeople of the world have said. \n The third objective, so frequently mentioned in \nstatements, is peace. We are all fighting for peace. We \nare all fighting for freedom, but the basis of freedom is \nequality and justice for all peoples. There will not be \npeace without social justice. Moreover, peace is not \nmade with military bases; peace is not ensured by \nmilitary interventions undertaken on the pretext of \nfighting against drug trafficking and terrorism but \nreally aimed at developing geopolitical interests \u2014 \naims I do not share. Yes, we must combat drug \ntrafficking. The best way to do so, I would say, is to \nput an end to banking secrecy. It is not right that the \nUnited States Government should decertify countries \nthat are not following the capitalist line. The Bolivian \nGovernment is making an effort to reduce coca crops. \nBut while the major cocaine-producing countries are \ncertified, the country that makes a real effort against \ndrug trafficking, a small country, is decertified. \n These are, of course, political decisions, and that \nis why I draw the conclusion that anti-imperialist, \nanti-capitalist countries will never be certified by the \nUnited States Government. In the end, this does not \nconcern or affect my Government. We are convinced \nthat there will be this type of scare tactic, harassment \nand intimidation. That has always existed. But there \nare contradictions here as well. The United Nations \ntells us that coca cultivation has increased by 1 per \ncent, while the United States Department of State says \nthat coca crops have increased by 9.4 per cent. Whom \nare we to believe \u2014 the United States or the United \nNations? Imagine the spin that is put on this to penalize \na Government or a country. The reports recognize the \nstrong efforts undertaken by the national Government \nin the fight against drug trafficking. For example, dried \ncoca is down to 43,000 tons from 43,500. But even this \neffort is not recognized, which is why we are \nconvinced that this is clearly a political problem. \n I believe that it is important to put an end to the \nacts of aggression, to the interventions in such \ncountries as Afghanistan and Iraq, and to the threats to \nIran. Let us put an end to the entire nuclear arsenal, \nbecause the nuclear arsenal is a threat to life. Let us \nbegin with the United States and then continue with all \nthe other countries. And this is not merely an attempt \nto punish a country that may wish to implement other \npolicies. Instead of spending so much money allegedly \non defence and security, in the end it is for war. If we \nare responsible to humankind, we must change \neveryone\u2019s mindset. \n The last objective of this alliance would be to \nwork together to strengthen the United Nations, but we \nalso have to begin to democratize the United Nations. \nThis is a very difficult task, of course. We have heard \nstatements made by heads of government and by \npresidents. Some anti-capitalist presidents are accused \nof being authoritarian or totalitarian, of being dictators. \nDelegations know, and the world knows, how a coup \nd\u2019\u00e9tat in a country such as Honduras can be ensured \nhere. This morning President Obama talked about \nworking with countries that fight against poverty. In \nBolivia we have greatly reduced poverty, and yet \ninvestments are cut. He has said that he will work with \ndemocratic Governments. In Bolivia, in five years I \nhave won two referendums and three elections, all with \nmore than 50 or 60 per cent of the vote. Where is the \ndictatorship? Where is the authoritarianism? The \nauthoritarianism is here at the United Nations. Some \n  \n \n10-54833 38 \n \nGovernments, some countries have permanent seats \nwith the right to veto. That is authoritarianism, and that \nis why we must begin to democratize the United \nNations if we want to move ahead with a democratic \nmindset or focus. We must start by practising \ndemocracy here. But, above all, I want to tell you, \nbrothers and sisters present here, that we must work \ntogether to ensure that, sooner or later, the United \nNations becomes an anti-capitalist Organization, if we \nare to save humankind. If we do not do that, we will be \nheld responsible. And I assume my responsibility by \ntelling you this in a direct and straightforward way. I \nam not at all scared because I know what the \nconsequences of capitalism are \u2014 in particular, with \nregard to the destruction of Mother Earth. \n I was thinking that our United Nations \u2014 and as \na President I feel part of the United Nations \u2014 should \nhave a slogan, a war cry for the effort to save \nhumankind. I propose to the Assembly and its \nPresident that our war cry should be \u201cThe planet or \ndeath; we shall win!\u201d And I wish to say that, from what \nI have learned in my four and a half years as President \nof my country, if there is the political will to serve the \npeople of the world, the people of the world can be \nsaved."

        "file_text": "The current, sixty-fifth session of the \nGeneral Assembly has started with an unprecedented \nnumber of events covering the full range of the most \ntopical international issues. It is encouraging that, in \nthe light of the numerous challenges facing mankind, a \npositive unified platform for collective action has been \ntaking shape, with the United Nations playing the \ncentral role. Having learned from the dramatic events \nof recent decades and having realized that attempts to \ncut the Gordian knot by force in violation of the \nCharter will only lead to deadlock, the international \ncommunity has concluded that there is no alternative \nbut to address political, economic and other problems \nthrough joint efforts based on international law. And \nthe United Nations provides a universal platform to \nstrengthen this positive trend in international relations.  \n The Security Council is a key instrument of this \nOrganization to maintain international peace and \nsecurity. The high-level Security Council meeting held \non 23 September (S/PV.6389) reaffirmed its members\u2019 \nintention to enhance that body\u2019s efficiency, not only \nthrough direct involvement in conflict settlement but \nalso by creating prerequisites for the non-recurrence \nand prevention of crises. This proves that the \ncomprehensive approach to ensuring international \nsecurity is gaining ground, as it reflects modern \nrealities and is based on the principles and provisions \nof the United Nations Charter. \n The United Nations faces unprecedented, serious \nand multifaceted tasks in the key area of peacekeeping. \nWhile paying tribute to the efforts and sacrifice of \nthousands of men and women Blue Helmets, joint \nefforts should continue to refine the theory and practice \nof peacekeeping under United Nations auspices and to \nimprove the quality of planning and the conduct of \npeacekeeping operations with adequate political \ncontrol by the Security Council. \n It is encouraging that the United Nations is \nworking towards this goal on a truly collective basis. \nMember States have quite a few constructive ideas on \ntheir table, which include Russia\u2019s initiative to \nrevitalize the Military Staff Committee in order to \nimprove the military expertise of Security Council \ndecisions. \n This year has been marked by progress in nuclear \ndisarmament. The 2010 Treaty between the United \nStates of America and the Russian Federation on \nMeasures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of \nStrategic Offensive Arms, signed by the Presidents of \nRussia and the United States in Prague, is a real \ncontribution by our two countries to strengthening \ninternational security and strategic stability. It is also \nthe result of positive changes in the relations between \nRussia and the United States that have placed Russian-\nAmerican interaction in world affairs on a qualitatively \nnew level.  \n We hope that the strong impetus provided by \nMoscow and Washington to the nuclear disarmament \nprocess will be followed similarly by all nations, \nprimarily by nuclear-weapon States. \n Pursuant to Russia\u2019s policy towards strengthening \nthe United Nations role in global security, disarmament \nand confidence-building, we intend to table three draft \nresolutions during the current General Assembly \nsession: one on transparency and confidence-building \nmeasures in outer space activities, co-sponsored with \nChina; a draft resolution on developments in the field \nof information and telecommunications in the context \nof international security; and a Russia-United States \nco-sponsored draft resolution on bilateral strategic \noffensive arms reductions and the new framework for \nstrategic relations. We call for their adoption by \nconsensus. \n The universalization of the Treaty on the  \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and its \nguaranteed strict implementation comprise the \ncornerstone of a strengthened international  \nnon-proliferation regime. In that context, the search \nmust continue for an effective solution to the Iranian \nnuclear problem on the basis of NPT provisions and the \nnorms of international Law. The Iranian side must \nensure the requisite level of transparency and \ncooperation with the International Atomic Energy \nAgency (IAEA), which is acting on behalf of the \ninternational community with the Security Council\u2019s \nsupport. \n Clarifying the outstanding questions about the \nIranian nuclear programme would not only meet the \ngoal of strengthening the non-proliferation regime but \nwould also quite obviously promote the interests of \nIran. Russia sees no reasonable alternative to a political \nand diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear \n \n \n31 10-55396 \n \nproblem through constructive dialogue between Tehran \nand the six countries involved. The meeting of the \nForeign Ministers of the six countries in New York \nhelped to consolidate the shared intention to ensure the \nearliest resumption of such a dialogue. We will \ncontinue to do our utmost to achieve this goal. \n As far as the sanctions instrument is concerned, \nsanctions are not a goal in themselves. The objective of \nthe sanctions regime established by the Security \nCouncil is to signal to Iran that it must fully cooperate \nwith IAEA, and to give an impetus to the negotiating \nprocess. All members of the international community \nmust show solidarity based on mutual responsibility. \nWe strongly reject a situation in which unilateral \ndecisions \u2014 including ex-territorial ones that undermine \nthe very foundation of further joint efforts \u2014 are made \nwith regard to sanctions in parallel to collective efforts \nby the United Nations Security Council. We must put \nan end to that practice, which runs counter to \ninternational law and has negative political effects. \n Even more obvious, the economic and financial \ntrade blockade of Cuba, whose lifting the General \nAssembly has demanded for a number of years, is \nclearly an anachronism. The codification of the \nprinciple of equal and indivisible security is \nindispensable to productive international efforts in this \nfield, which is the precise goal of President \nMedvedev\u2019s initiative to conclude a treaty on European \nsecurity. The proposal targets the complete transition of \nEuro-Atlantic policy from its old Cold War agenda to a \nnew one, as well as a firm legal foundation for the \nprinciple of indivisible security for all in the  \nEuro-Atlantic region proclaimed in the 1990s. We \nwelcome the substantive dialogue on this important \nRussian initiative, which has started in various \ninternational forums. \n A comprehensive settlement in the Middle East \nwould make a crucial contribution towards \nstrengthened global stability. The parties must \ndemonstrate political will and extend every effort to \npromote the success of the resumed direct Palestinian-\nIsraeli talks. The results of the ministerial Quartet \nmeeting of major international mediators held on  \n21 September demonstrated that appropriate support to \nthe Israelis and Palestinians will continue, but the \nultimate responsibility for a successful outcome rests \nwith them. \n In this connection, the decision by the Israeli \nauthorities to not extend the moratorium on Israeli \nsettlement activities has raised serious concern. A way \nout of the current impasse should be found so as to \nensure that negotiations continue. Our proposal to hold \nan international conference on the Middle East in \nMoscow is aimed at advancing the Middle East \nsettlement. This proposal has gained the support of all \ninterested parties and the United Nations Security \nCouncil. If the direct Palestinian-Israeli dialogue \nbecomes stable, the preparations for the Moscow forum \ncan get under way, which should also substantively \nexamine the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, as well as the \nprospects for the multilateral aspects of the Middle \nEast settlement. \n The development of a comprehensive strategy to \naddress the interconnected problems of the Middle East \nis on the agenda. It is necessary to continue working \ntowards an international conference in 2012 on the \nestablishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and \nother weapons of mass destruction and their means of \ndelivery in the Middle East, pursuant to the decision of \nthe Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \n Russia supports the international strategy for a \ncomprehensive settlement and for post-conflict \nrehabilitation of Afghanistan adopted by the Kabul \nConference, which envisages a stage-by-stage transfer \nof responsibility for the situation in that country to \nAfghan authorities, as effective governing structures \nare established in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. \nThe future of Afghanistan must be determined by the \nAfghan people themselves. The international \ncommunity must continue to provide its assistance, \nwith an important role being played by the United \nNations. \n Lasting stabilization in Afghanistan and \nthroughout the region will be impossible without \nresolving the drug problem. The dimension of the \ndanger posed by narcotics emanating from Afghanistan \nrepresents a clear threat to international peace and \nstability and requires more resolute actions throughout \nthe entire chain of the production and proliferation of \nnarcotics \u2014 from the destruction of drug crops to the \nsuppression of precursor supplies, including drug \ntraffickers on the sanction lists of the Security Council. \nIt is also necessary to move to a new level of \ninternational cooperation. Russia\u2019s initiative to \nestablish financial and counter-narcotics security belts \n  \n \n10-55396 32 \n \nalong the perimeter of Afghan\u2019s borders is consistent \nwith those goals. \n The regional dimension of the long-term \nstabilization of Afghanistan is becoming ever more \ntopical. To that end, we must fully engage the potential \nof relevant organizations that are actively working in \nclose contact with Kabul on Afghan issues, including \nthe Collective Security Treaty Organization and the \nShanghai Cooperation Organization. \n The settlement process in the Sudan is \napproaching an important milestone. As the date of \nreferendum on the self-determination of the South of \nthat country draws closer, the parties to the \nComprehensive Peace Agreement must redouble their \nefforts to overcome the problems that still divide them. \nWe should also give new impetus to the Darfur \nsettlement process. At stake is the stability of \nconditions in the Sudan and throughout the vast \nAfrican continent. We welcome the constructive \nattitude demonstrated by the Sudanese and other \nparticipants in the high-level meeting on the Sudan that \nwas held here recently. \n In Somalia, the confrontation continues between \nthe Transitional Federal Government, supported by the \ninternational community, and extremists and terrorist \ngroups linked with Al-Qaida. The lack of a settlement \non land is fuelling the problem of piracy off the coast \nof Somalia. A more resolute pursuit of the political \nprocess and stronger assistance to the peacekeeping \noperation of the African Union and further counter-\npiracy efforts, including the criminal prosecution of \npirates, are priorities in international efforts on the \nSomali track, as reiterated during the recent  \nmini-summit on Somalia, which Russia fully supports. \n The results of the Millennium Development \nGoals summit have reaffirmed the important role of the \nUnited Nations on development matters and must help \nmobilize political support and financial resources for \nthe timely achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). That requires joint \nefforts by Governments, international financial and \ntrade institutions, the private sector and civil society, \nbased on the principles of global partnership and \nshared responsibility. \n It is obvious that most global problems, including \nthe achievement of the MDGs, cannot be resolved \nwithout engaging innovations, advanced technologies \nand modernization solutions. The same is valid for \nsuch challenges as climate change, energy and food \nsecurity and the fight against diseases. The engagement \nof the enormous potential of the United Nations, its \nfamily and system of specialized agencies in this area \nwill allow the Organization to become a catalyst in the \nestablishment and development of multilateral \nmodernization alliances. Russia is prepared to \nparticipate actively in that work. \n To live up to expectations, the United Nations must \ncontinuously renew itself. The reform of the Organization \nis progressively moving forward. This year, the \nnegotiations on strengthening system-wide coherence \nwere completed successfully. In particular, the new \nimportant United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and \nthe Empowerment of Women has been established. \n Negotiations will continue at the current session \nof the General Assembly on the expansion of the \ncomposition of the Security Council. This is an \nextremely important issue on the reform agenda of the \nOrganization, involving the interests of the \noverwhelming majority of States. For that reason, the \nfinal formula for Security Council reform should be \nbased on compromise and the broadest possible \nagreement in the United Nations. This requirement is \nalso fully applicable to all other aspects of United \nNations reform. \n This year marks the sixty-fifth anniversary of the \nUnited Nations, as well as that of the end of the Second \nWorld War, from the ashes of which the world \nOrganization was born. For the sake of the memory of \nthe millions of victims and in order to prevent a \nrepetition of such scourges, we must suppress attempts \nto falsify the events associated with that historic \ncalamity. That is the aim of a well-known Russian \ninitiative in the United Nations. We count on the \nbroadest support for a draft resolution on the topic. \n The United Nations is our common and unique \nOrganization. It is up to all of us to determine how \nproductive and really useful its future work will be for \nhumankind. By pulling our efforts together, we will be \nable to renew the United Nations effectively and \nprovide it with all the necessary resources. We are \nconvinced that reasonable resources spent on that goal \nwill bring tangible dividends to all members of the \ninternational community in the form of durable peace, \nsecurity, cooperation and prosperity all over the globe."

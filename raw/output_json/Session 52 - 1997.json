        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, allow me\nto subscribe to the statement delivered this morning by the\nForeign Minister of Luxembourg, Mr. Jacques Poos, on\nbehalf of the European Union. In particular, Sir, I wish to\njoin him in his congratulations to you on your election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly.\nAs the year 2000 draws closer, our feelings somehow\nmake us ponder more keenly the achievements and\nmisfortunes of the present century, and make us look ahead\nto the next one. As I do this, central to my thoughts is the\nUnited Nations, an institution created when I was an\nadolescent, at the end of a war whose horrors were just\nthen coming to light. I remember having been elated at the\ntime about the purposes and principles of the new\nOrganization, and I remember how intrigued I was to see\nthat, in a way, devastation and despair had given rise to the\nbelief that a better world could yet be built, a world marked\nby peace, development and respect for human rights,\nnotions I was just beginning to learn about. Soon enough,\nI came to realize that such a world would be rather longer\nin the making than the Charter had led me to hope; that old\nquestions were giving way to new ones; that the United\nNations was not a panacea for all the troubles of mankind;\nand, more to the point, that the United Nations could never\nbe stronger than its Member States collectively willed it to\nbe.\nYet somehow my expectations remained, expectations\nwhich I shared with a growing audience around the globe,\nand which one generation was passing on to the next.\nRightly or wrongly, nations and individuals, Governments,\ncivil society and the public at large: they all have\nexpectations about what the United Nations can do for\nthem, and about how it might change their lives and their\ndestiny for the better.\nThe question then is not so much whether the United\nNations can meet all of those expectations. For it cannot,\nand it probably should not even try. The United Nations\nhas neither the mandate, nor the resources, nor the power\nto be the world\u2019s keeper. The question is rather how we\ncan exploit the strong points of the Charter, how we can\nmake the United Nations play a role that only the United\nNations can play, and how we can better equip the\nOrganization to do more by doing what it does better.\nWith that in mind, I wish to highlight three matters this\nafternoon: the fitness of the Organization; the potential of\nthe United Nations to manage crises in the wider context\nof development; and the Organization\u2019s action in the field\nof human rights.\nPart of the reason why the United Nations has\nproblems in meeting expectations is what it has turned\ninto over the past 30 years: an amazing structure of\nboards and committees populated by a growing\nmembership and assisted by an army of civil servants. For\nthat reason alone, the Organization has lost credibility.\nEfforts to streamline and revitalize the Organization are\ntherefore long overdue. United Nations reform is a must.\nThe proposals put forward by the Secretary-General are\nan important first step in that process, as the Foreign\nMinister of Luxembourg, Mr. Poos, said this morning, a\nprocess that will have to incorporate more ambitious ideas\nas it unfolds. The Kingdom of the Netherlands supports\nthe Secretary-General in his reform drive, we applaud the\nfact that he has made reform his number-one agenda item,\nand we welcome the reform package Mr. Kofi Annan has\nput in our care.\nBut we should get on with it. The world cannot\nafford to wait. We are looking at an Organization that is\nfar behind on its maintenance schedule. Yet over the past\nthree years, the reform debate has inched forward as if\noblivious to the need to produce results. Fortunately, the\nSecretary-General has injected new momentum into the\ndebate, and we should all welcome this.\nAs we are about to engage in this \u201cReform\nAssembly\u201d, as the Secretary-General has called it, we\nshould be conscious of the underlying concerns that have\nsurfaced in the reform debate from time to time. These\nconcerns are real, and dismissing them would jeopardize\na promising outcome for the present session. Indeed,\nvarious groups of nations have doubts about what other\ngroups of nations are ultimately aiming for in this\nexercise. Developing countries have even expressed\nmisgivings about the reform process as a whole. Some of\nthem are clearly afraid that major Western Governments\n15\n\n\nare out to recast the United Nations as an institution that\nwould run on the lowest possible budget and concentrate on\npeacekeeping, humanitarian aid and human rights. Another\nconcern is that the development programme of this\nOrganization \u2014 perhaps its single most important\nachievement over the past 30 years \u2014 might actually suffer\nas a result of reform.\nUnderstandably, many nations see the decline in recent\nyears of official aid levels as the writing on the wall. They\nare disheartened by the empty promises of Rio de Janeiro\nin 1992. Moreover, they are worried about the current\nfinancial crisis of the United Nations. And finally, a handful\nof nations describe the Secretary-General\u2019s proposals as a\n\u201cnorthern\u201d package \u2014 one that caters mainly to the needs\nof the industrialized world.\nInstead, developing nations would wish to see the\nUnited Nations strengthened in what to them is perhaps its\nmost critical field of action, a field of action that\ncorresponds to one of the main purposes mentioned in the\nCharter: social and economic development. They rightly\nargue that if the United Nations membership wants to be\nserious about that objective, it needs to equip the\nOrganization accordingly. And so, in their view, more\nresources should flow into the Organization. Before\nconsenting to change anything, they are inclined to play it\nsafe and to hold on to what is there.\nThis line of thought, assuming I am reading it\ncorrectly, calls for comments. My first remark is that,\nclearly, the Secretary-General was well-advised in having\nmost of his package focus on the economic and social\nsectors. This is indeed the area that commands the widest\ninterest among the membership. If we look at the merits of\nthe package, it seems fair to say that many industrialized\nnations might have wanted to see more ambitious and\ncomprehensive proposals. Still, speaking for the\nNetherlands Government, I would argue that the present\npackage of reform measures is well-directed, substantial and\nworthwhile. Evidently, the Secretary-General, on the basis\nof consultations which only he could undertake, has\nconcluded that the contents of the package represent the\nmaximum of what is achievable in the present state of play.\nAnd we should all accept that as a given.\nFurthermore, it is important to remember that reform\nmight strengthen the development sector of the United\nNations to the point where it can actually deliver better\nservice with the resources that are presently available. This\nexercise is not about cutting costs. Yet a leaner and meaner\nOrganization might give better value for the money. At the\nsame time, we welcome the idea of a development\ndividend, as put forward by the Secretary-General.\nA stronger development sector may help make the\nUnited Nations a more attractive Organization not only to\nrecipients, but to donor countries as well. Voluntary\ncontributions should not come only from the same small\ngroup of traditional donors year after year. For a long\ntime now, the Netherlands has been among the top\ncontributors to the United Nations system, and we intend\nto remain so. We appreciate the spectacular gesture by\nMr. Ted Turner. But donor contributions should also\ncome from those nations that fall far below the 0.7 per\ncent mark, as well as from newly industrialized countries\nin Asia and elsewhere.\nFinally, all Member States should become current\nand stay current on their financial obligations under the\nregular and peacekeeping budgets; and payments should\nbe prompt, in full and certainly without conditions.\nAll in all, the heart of the matter is not about core\nconcepts and not about mindset; it is about trust. It is\nabout feeling comfortable with the idea that among 185\nMember States, a difference of views is inevitable,\nparticularly when they are asked to discuss such a wide-\nranging matter as the future of this Organization.\nWe have arrived at a crossroads where we face a\ncritical choice. This is a moment when we have to rise\nabove the level of squabbling over details in working\ngroups. No doubt, we all have a point to raise, a question\nto ask and a change to make. But that avenue would lead\nus nowhere, for soon enough the package would fall\napart. Now is the time to start trusting each other. This is\na time for vision and political courage. We, as statesmen,\nshould be ready to accept our responsibility in this regard,\nto join forces and to forge a breakthrough. We should all\nrise to the occasion and accept the package of the\nSecretary-General as it is before us now and work out the\ndetails and implementation later. Endorsement in general\nterms needs to be expressed before we all adjourn next\nDecember. Without such endorsement, the momentum in\nthe reform process will be lost.\nWe, the Member States of the United Nations,\npledged ourselves, in the words of the Charter:\n\u201cto take effective collective measures for the\nprevention and removal of threats to the\npeace\u201d.\n16\n\n\nNext to the United Nations development effort,\npeacekeeping and peace-building are perhaps the most\nvisible part of what the United Nations does \u2014 an\nimpression refreshed by Cable News Network (CNN)\nalmost daily. More importantly, those who are on the run,\nwho are afraid for their lives, who watch their homesteads\ninvaded, who are occupied and repressed, who look\nstarvation and genocide in the face \u2014 they have\nexpectations of the United Nations. They expect the\nOrganization to bail them out.\nWe need to improve the capacity of the United\nNations to deal with crises, be they military, political or\nhumanitarian ones, whether man-made or not. There is\nconsiderable room for improvement here, as illustrated by\nthe situations in Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda and Zaire. As we\nspeak, innocent blood is flowing in many places around the\nworld. Yet all too often the United Nations remains\nimpotent. We cannot allow this to continue. Here again lies\na major area where reform is indispensable, and the\nSecretary-General has duly underlined this.\nA number of Member States, including the Kingdom\nof the Netherlands, have been trying to develop the concept\nof a standby high-readiness brigade within the framework\nof the United Nations standby agreements. They have been\nmaking modest progress over the last three years. A rapidly\ndeployable headquarters is now being established.\nTomorrow a small group of nations will informally\ndeliberate on how to promote further steps. Several other\ninitiatives are under way, including regional ones. Given the\ncomplexities, this is going to be an incremental process, but\none where we cannot afford to let up.\nThe real test is where to position peacekeeping in the\nwider context of the overall concerns of the United Nations.\nOur agenda should be wider and should include conflict\nprevention and peace-building.\nThe difficulty we need to address here is how to\nintegrate different policy instruments \u2014 political, military,\nrelief, rehabilitation and social and economic development\n\u2014 into one comprehensive framework. Crises require a\ncoherent and effective international response, a response\nthat should integrate preventive diplomacy, political\nmediation and humanitarian relief, but also social action,\neconomic alternatives and cultural communication. In sum:\ndevelopment.\nOf course, prevention is the key. The United Nations\ncan be much more effective when we invest in prevention.\nDiplomacy, economic sanctions, arms embargoes and\npolitical pressure will reduce risk and costs as compared\nto military intervention in an escalated conflict. We could\navoid the loss of life and escape generalized human\nmisery. As a result of timely prevention, we could also\navoid the immense costs for rehabilitation, resettlement\nand reconstruction that arise after violence is over.\nMilitary intervention, under United Nations auspices, for\nhumanitarian purposes may be necessary in certain\nconflict situations. But it should always be a means of\nlast resort. Intervention implies that prevention has failed.\nThe link between development on the one hand and\npeace and security on the other is a tenuous one in the\nUnited Nations system. Yet experience has proved that\nmaking the link is imperative. We need to find the best\ncombination of conflict management, humanitarian\nassistance and social and economic programmes to pave\nthe way for sustainable development and for sustainable\npeace.\nIn San Francisco we promised to promote and\nencourage\n\u201crespect for human rights and for fundamental\nfreedoms for all\u201d.\nIt is a pledge we will have to renew again and again,\nperhaps indefinitely. Yet such a pledge may not\ndegenerate into lipservice. Commitments must be turned\ninto reality; obligations must be implemented. We cannot\nlet our guard down as we face reports on violations of\nhuman rights. Torture is still being practised on a wide\nscale. People continue to disappear. Arrest and detention\nwithout cause take place routinely. And freedom of the\npress is non-existent in too many countries.\nStill, we recognize that human rights are in better\nshape worldwide than they were 10 years ago, and\ncertainly 50 years ago. Totalitarian regimes have all but\ndisappeared; democracy is on the rise. Also, there is more\ninterest than ever before in the triangle of democracy,\ngood governance and human rights.\nToday, human rights are well established as an\nimportant objective in their own right and a major field of\nactivity for the United Nations. But, perhaps more\nimportant, human rights have become a leitmotif in a\nwide variety of other areas of United Nations policy, from\nsustainable development to population, from trade to\nhumanitarian aid, and from peacekeeping to human\nsettlements. That human rights is a \u201ccross-cutting\u201d issue\nis evident from the reform proposals of the Secretary-\n17\n\n\nGeneral and from the way he has revised the top\nmanagement structure in the Secretariat \u2014 both of which\nwe welcome warmly.\nExpectations on what the United Nations can achieve\nin the field of human rights have run high, among victims\nof human-rights violations, among mothers of the\ndisappeared, among grass-roots groups, and among\nnon-governmental organizations. Then again, there are\nGovernments that expect the United Nations to stay out of\ntheir precincts entirely: Governments that accept the\nuniversality of human rights, but only as a debating point;\nGovernments that accept the United Nations actions against\nhuman rights-violations, but only at a theoretical level and\nnot when it concerns them.\nAll in all, the instruments the United Nations can\napply have become the core of an extensive machinery that\nin many cases has worked strikingly well. Examples are\nnumerous and expanding. I refer to such diverse methods\nas international dialogue, the integration of human rights\nactivities into cooperation arrangements, the work of human\nrights field offices, human rights education and\nstrengthening regional supervisory machinery.\nMore recently, a new High Commissioner for Human\nRights took up her position. If this is indeed the age of\nhuman rights, as the Secretary-General says, then\nMrs. Mary Robinson will be one of its key personalities.\nWe wish her courage and wisdom in her new assignment,\nand she can be sure of our commitment.\nOne major platform in the realization of human rights\nand the international administration of justice is soon to\ntake its definitive shape. Next summer, a diplomatic\nconference will convene in Rome \u2014 we should all be\ngrateful to the Italian Government for hosting it \u2014 that\nwill, hopefully, adopt a convention establishing an\ninternational criminal court. Once established, the court will\nbe the natural counterpart to the International Court of\nJustice. My Government is looking forward with\nanticipation to this new offspring in the international legal\norder, and I take pride in announcing that my country is\noffering to house the seat of the court, in the city of The\nHague.\nThe fitness of the United Nations as an Organization,\nits capacity to manage crises in the wider context of\ndevelopment, and its action in the field of human rights are\nareas of ongoing concern to all Member States. This\nAssembly will continue to address them, either on their\nown merits or in the context of United Nations reform. The\nUnited Nations is expected to perform in these areas and\nto produce results. Yet there is only one way this is going\nto happen: if all of us join forces, join forces to make the\nUnited Nations a viable and credible institution, join\nforces to make it a centre for harmonizing the actions of\nnations in the attainment of these common ends. For only\nthen will we keep the promise of San Francisco.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin by\ncongratulating Mr. Udovenko on his election as President\nof the General Assembly at this fifty-second session. The\ncountry and the Group he represents have seen great\nchanges in the last decade. It therefore seems particularly\nfitting that he is presiding over a General Assembly\nwhich will lay the foundation for significant changes to\nthe United Nations itself \u2014 changes which must equip it\nbetter for the new and potentially more cooperative\ninternational environment in which we find ourselves.\nIt is thus not only right but necessary that reform is\nthe major theme of the United Nations at present, and of\nthis General Assembly in particular. We would like to\nthank the former President of the Assembly, Ambassador\nRazali, for the outstanding contribution he made to\npursuing the reform agenda during his presidency, notably\n16\n\n\nin his capacity as Chairman of the General Assembly\nWorking Groups.\nToday I want to concentrate on three issues in\nparticular: reform of the United Nations; reorienting our\napproach to human rights so as to promote cooperation and\ninstitution building, creating durable structures to give\nsubstance to the goals set out in the Charter of the United\nNations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and\nother international human rights instruments; and\nreconfiguring the traditional United Nations groups better\nto reflect the regional groupings of the contemporary world.\nIn dealing with reform, my purpose is to build a world\nfor the next generation, and I am inspired by the hope and\naspirations of the next generation.\nIn that context, I am pleased that we are joined in the\nGeneral Assembly today by Mr. Perry Cross, a\ndistinguished and courageous young Australian who is\nleading the fight against paralysis. He exemplifies the\nAustralian belief that individuals with a will and a practical\nfocus can make a difference in fighting barriers and\nreforming structures which are representative of an earlier\nera.\nAustralia wants to work with you, Sir, and with the\nSecretary-General and all Members of the United Nations,\nto ensure that by the end of this session of the General\nAssembly further, substantive progress has been made in\nthe three critical areas of reform: financial reform and\nresolution of the crisis surrounding the United Nations\nbudget and scale of assessments; reform of the Security\nCouncil; and reform of the Organization.\nWhen I made my first statement to the Assembly last\nyear, I stressed the need to move ahead urgently with\nreform and the reinvigoration of this important\nOrganization, to ensure its future effectiveness and\nrelevance. This year reform has been given real impetus by\nthe new Secretary-General, whose appointment Australia\nwarmly welcomed. Both in March and in July this year he\nannounced significant organizational reforms aimed at the\nrenewal of this body. I have enthusiastically supported these\ninitiatives. We must now build on them.\nWe share the Secretary-General\u2019s conclusions about\nthe shortcomings of the United Nations. The Organization\u2019s\nmission, as enshrined in the Charter, has been repeatedly\nreaffirmed and remains valid today. But the machinery and\nthe working methods to pursue that mission need thorough\nreview and revision. We agree that there is too much\nfragmentation of structures, too much rigidity within\nbodies and too much emphasis on bureaucracy and\nprocess.\nI would like to highlight in particular the reforms\nsuggested to the United Nations structure and to the\nSecretariat. The integration of 12 secretariats and entities\ninto 5, and the proposed consolidation of five\nintergovernmental bodies into two are particularly\nwelcome. They will help streamline and remove\nunnecessary bureaucratic structure and duplication from\nthe Secretariat. It is an approach we commend also to the\nspecialized agencies as Member nations seek to streamline\nand even merge some of these bodies.\nImportant steps are proposed in reforming the way\nthe Secretariat works. We applaud the removal of 1,000\nstaff posts and the cutting of administrative costs by one\nthird to which the Secretary-General has committed\nhimself. We also wish to see all Secretariat staff move to\nfixed-term, renewable contracts to allow for greater\nemployment flexibility in the Organization. We support\nthe introduction of a merit-based promotion system and\nperformance appraisal in the place of a system where\nseniority plays a disproportionate role. We also encourage\nmanagement to improve training opportunities for junior\nas well as senior staff.\nThese reforms will not only make the United\nNations work better, but also provide real savings. These\nsavings will be available for programmes, programmes\nwhich benefit all of us, but especially support the\ndeveloping Members of the United Nations. Thus it is a\npackage which is in the interests of all, and deserves\nsupport from all. We believe the Assembly needs to\nprovide broad endorsement of the package as a whole\nearly in this session to allow the reform process to\nproceed, even if some details are negotiated subsequently.\nBut I acknowledge that for reform to succeed and\nfor the United Nations to carry out its mandate adequate\nresources must be made available to run the Organization.\nAustralia continues to meet all its financial obligations in\nfull and on time and without conditions, and seeks the\nsame commitment from all our fellow Members. We\ncontinue to believe that the negotiation of financial\nreforms would be facilitated by early settlement of all\nunpaid contributions. The adoption of a responsible negative-\ngrowth budget and a new scale of assessments which\naccurately reflects relative shares of national income and\nthus the principle of capacity to pay will also be key\nissues at this year\u2019s session. It is important that the result\n17\n\n\nensures the burden of supporting the Organization falls\nfairly on Member States.\nAustralia remains committed to an expanded, more\nrepresentative and transparent Security Council, better able\nto tackle the challenges of the twenty-first century. It\nshould include as permanent members important Powers\nable to make a major contribution to international peace and\nsecurity, particularly at this time Japan and Germany. It\nshould also include permanent seats for under-represented\nregions as well as additional non-permanent seats.\nMiddle Powers such as Australia have made a\nsignificant contribution to the United Nations since its\nfoundation, notably in disarmament, development,\npeacekeeping and human rights. We are concerned that the\ninterests of small and medium-sized countries not be\nforgotten in this exercise. In this context, and because of\nour long-standing historical concerns about the veto, we\nwould like to see an expansion of the Council accompanied\nby a new understanding on the application of the veto. We\nwould also support a review of any new arrangements after\n10 years so that countries like Australia and all other\nmembers of the international community have a further\nopportunity to examine the size, composition and working\nmethods of the Council.\nI am optimistic about what can be achieved by the\nUnited Nations if we can bring about some essential\nreforms which would make the Organization function more\nefficiently and effectively. Let me mention one of the areas\nin which the United Nations has proven it can function\neffectively: as a forum and catalyst for international arms\ncontrol and disarmament efforts.\nIn recent years we have witnessed several landmark\ndevelopments in this field, notably the indefinite extension\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\nand the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty. The General Assembly was the forum, one year\nago, for the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty, and Australia is particularly proud to have been\nable to play a role in that historic event.\nThere are many challenges ahead as we work with,\nand through, the United Nations to reduce global stockpiles\nof conventional and non-conventional weapons and to make\nthe world a safer and more humane place. Let me single\nout two. The immediate commencement and early\nconclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off\ntreaty has repeatedly been identified by the international\ncommunity as the next major goal for nuclear non-\nproliferation and disarmament efforts, most recently by\nthe parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \u2014\nwhich now has more members than the United Nations\nitself \u2014 at their first preparatory meeting for the sixth\nReview Conference in 2000.\nThe Canberra Commission on the Elimination of\nNuclear Weapons also identified an agreement to cease\nthe production of fissile material for nuclear explosive\npurposes as an important step towards the elimination of\nnuclear weapons. Capping the amount of nuclear material\navailable for nuclear weapons use by extending\nsafeguards coverage over currently unsafeguarded,\nsensitive nuclear facilities would in itself be a significant\nachievement for international peace and security, quite\napart from its significance as a step towards the ultimate\nelimination of nuclear weapons.\nAs I said to the Committee on Disarmament in\nJanuary this year, the achievement of a fissile material\ncut-off treaty is a priority objective for Australia, and I\nnow commit Australia to redoubling its efforts to achieve\na cut-off treaty at the earliest possible date. We must not\nallow ourselves to be put off by the obstacles that\ncurrently face the achievement of this goal.\nThe effective elimination of landmines as a weapon\nof war is another important task facing the United Nations\ncollectively and its members individually. I have been\ngratified by the gains made to date, through the Ottawa\nprocess, through the Inhumane Weapons Convention,\nthrough national and regional measures and, perhaps most\nimportant, through enhanced contributions to demining\nand mine-victim assistance programmes to address the\nterrible human toll of anti-personnel landmines. We owe\nit to the victims of anti-personnel landmines to continue\nworking through all avenues to achieve a real and lasting\nsolution to the global landmines problem.\nThe elimination of landmines is one necessary step\nin creating a more humane world, a world where\nindividual human rights can demand proper respect. But\nfurther measures need to be taken involving the\nestablishment of durable national human rights institutions\nto advance the goals to which our international human\nrights treaty commitments aspire. We are encouraged by\nand support the proposal to integrate human rights issues\nmore fully into a range of United Nations activities. In\nour view, the linkages between respect for human rights,\ngood governance and sustainable development are\nimportant. The fact that all four Executive Committees\nestablished by the Secretary-General will take human\n18\n\n\nrights issues into account in their deliberations should\nensure that more effective coordination is possible across\nUnited Nations activities. We warmly welcome also the\nsteps taken by the Secretary General to reform and\nreinvigorate the Secretariat\u2019s organizational structure to\nsupport human rights, particularly the consolidation of the\nOffice of the High Commissioner and the Centre for\nHuman Rights into a single office. His appointment of the\nformer President of Ireland, Mary Robinson, as High\nCommissioner for Human Rights is an excellent choice. We\npledge ourselves to support her in her task.\nAnother important recent development at the\ninternational level has been the negotiation of a draft statute\nfor an international criminal court. Australia is strongly\ncommitted to the early establishment of the court as a\nmajor human rights objective. We urge all nations to\nsupport by consensus the proposed resolution at this\nGeneral Assembly calling for the convening of a diplomatic\nconference in June 1998 to finalize and adopt the statute of\nthe court.\nAs we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, we pay tribute to\nthe universal standards the Declaration has helped to\nestablish. Let us never forget as well that the Declaration,\nalong with the two International Covenants, and the whole\nbody of treaty law and practice that has since developed,\nwas reaffirmed by all nations at the Vienna World\nConference on Human Rights in 1993.\nAustralia is a nation committed to the advancement of\nhuman rights and regards human rights issues as integral to\nits diplomacy. However, the Australian Government does\nnot want the important area of human rights to become an\nunproductive battleground or an environment for\nsloganeering. What we seek is results, not rhetoric, with the\noutcome being genuine improvements in human rights. The\nreal basis for a sustained improvement in the quality of\nhuman rights needs to be through domestic reform founded\non working institutions that guarantee participation and\naccountability. Reform of the institutions of civil\ngovernance must come from within. It is not something that\ncan be imposed from outside, for if there is not the political\nwill and the people with the knowledge and a commitment\nto making those institutions work, then they will simply\nfounder. Almost all nations have dark moments in their\nhistory where abuses have occurred, where vigilance has\nfailed. Abuses and corruption are most likely to disappear\nwhen there are institutions established to bring light into\nthis darkness.\nAll too often, however, instead of working patiently\nto encourage and help others to build these institutions,\ncountries have tended to address issues of human rights\nby criticism alone. There is no doubt that in the 52 years\nsince the United Nations was established the world has\nwitnessed many egregious and vile acts committed for the\nmost inhumane of reasons, and deserving the strongest\ncondemnation. However, the condemnatory approach\nalone has only limited practical value.\nWe need to recognize that in practical terms\nprotecting human rights must primarily be done at the\nnational level. The international human rights system,\nwhich we have worked hard to build, inevitably has a\nbroad focus and a limited ability to assist States to\nimplement agreed standards. Regional human rights\nmechanisms also have a role, and we should do what we\ncan to encourage their establishment and strengthening,\nincluding in the Asia-Pacific. However, it is clear that the\nability of each State effectively to protect human rights\ndepends to a significant degree on the strength of its own\ninstitutions, including a representative legislature, an\naccountable executive and an independent judiciary. A\nvigorous civil society is another important element in\ncreating a culture of human rights.\nA critical element that has often been undervalued in\nthe national implementation of human rights standards is\nthe importance of effective institutions as a means to\nachieving good governance. It is this institution-based\ngood governance that offers a real hope of eradicating the\nrandomness and violence that can characterize systems\nwhere there is neither popular participation nor genuine\naccountability.\nGood governance creates the environment in which\ncivil and political rights are respected and protected. Good\ngovernance also promotes an environment for sound\neconomic management and sustainable use of resources to\nincrease prosperity. These conditions are important to the\nprotection of economic, social and cultural rights.\nAt the same time, the exercise of civil and political\nrights through participatory processes is essential to good\ngovernance because it helps ensure governmental\naccountability and effectiveness. The interlinkages are\nsuch that action in one area of human rights has a\npositive reinforcing effect on other dimensions of human\nrights, making all human rights indivisible.\nAccountability, participation and effective institutions are\nthree fundamental principles necessary for the protection\nof human rights.\n19\n\n\nIt is with all this in mind that Australia gives priority\nto institution building in the human rights field. One of the\nmost significant developments in recent years has been the\nspread of national institutions for the promotion of human\nrights. Such institutions, able to work with Governments\nand civil society, can reflect to a significant degree the\ndifferent cultures and local conditions of the societies in\nwhich they are established, while remaining consistent with\ninternational human rights standards. Moreover, it is worth\nnoting that the General Assembly has endorsed a set of\nminimum standards for such institutions \u2014 the so-called\nParis principles. Despite considerable early scepticism,\nrecent experience has been very positive, and many\nGovernments and non-governmental organizations are now\nlooking positively at independent national institutions as an\nimportant means to promote and protect human rights. The\ngenerally positive view of the work of national institutions\nheld by most States was reflected in the adoption by\nconsensus of Australia\u2019s resolution on this subject at this\nyear\u2019s session of the Commission on Human Rights, with\nan increased number of co-sponsors.\nDeveloping countries are showing rapidly increasing\ninterest in establishing or strengthening existing national\nhuman rights institutions, as a constructive way to take\npositive action at the national level, bearing in mind\nnational circumstances, to promote respect for human\nrights. Important examples of human rights institutions\nrecently established in my part of the world that are making\na difference on the ground include those in India and\nIndonesia. I was encouraged recently by the statement of\nPapua New Guinea\u2019s Prime Minister that he intends to\npress ahead to establish a human rights commission in the\nnear future.\nWe will also watch with expectation the development\nof the proposed Cambodian national human rights\ncommission. A credible and independent human rights\ncommission, along with a genuinely independent national\nelectoral commission, could make an important contribution\nto protecting stability and promoting the observance of\nhuman rights in Cambodia in the lead-up to what we\nstrongly hope will be free, fair and credible elections in\nMay next year.\nThe work of national institutions in individual\ncountries can be strengthened through subregional and\nregional arrangements which provide a framework for\nexchanges of views and experiences. Australia is a strong\nsupporter of the development of such arrangements in the\nAsia-Pacific region. Since an inaugural meeting in Darwin\nin 1996 there has been a steady consolidation of links\namong established and emerging Asia-Pacific human\nrights commissions. The 1996 meeting saw the\ncommissions of Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and\nIndia \u2014 later also joined by the Philippines \u2014 establish\na regional network of human rights commissions, the\nAsia-Pacific Forum of National Human Rights\nInstitutions, with a supporting Secretariat based in and\nfinanced by Australia.\nThe aim of this network is to strengthen cooperation\namong national human rights institutions, including\nthrough information sharing, staff exchanges, technical\ncooperation and an annual regional meeting. It also assists\nother regional Governments wishing to establish such\ninstitutions. The most recent regional meeting has just\nbeen held, in New Delhi. It attracted participation from\nthe founding human rights commissions as well as that of\nSri Lanka. Other regional countries from Asia and the\nPacific attended as observers, some of which are\nconsidering the establishment of their own human rights\ncommissions.\nA most effective area of United Nations operations\nin this field has been the work of the Special Adviser to\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights on National\nInstitutions, Regional Arrangements and Preventive\nStrategies. The United Nations work with a number of\nGovernments, including in our own region, is at an\nimportant stage. Australia was therefore pleased to\nprovide additional financial support this year to enable the\nUnited Nations to continue to support national institutions.\nWe welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s commitment in\nhis report on the work of the Organization to\nstrengthening cooperation on issues of democratization\nand good governance. We note his comment that\n\u201cThis past year has seen a dramatic increase in\nactivities relating to the establishment of national\ninstitutions for the promotion and protection of\nhuman rights.\u201d (A/52/1, para. 30)\nWe are heartened by this development and by the\nresponsiveness of the Secretary-General. His report\nclearly reflects the need I am stressing here for support\nfor national institution-building to be at the centre of\nUnited Nations human rights endeavours.\nEarlier this year I announced the establishment in\nAustralia of a Centre for Democratic Institutions. This\nCentre will be devoted to the provision of practical\nsupport for the consolidation and strengthening of\n20\n\n\ndemocratic institutions in developing countries included in\nAustralia\u2019s aid programme. It exemplifies a cooperative\nrather than a conflict approach towards promoting human\nrights, and it will be the flagship of our good governance\ninitiatives. The focus of the Centre\u2019s training programmes\nwill be on electoral, parliamentary, judicial and human\nrights institution-building and the processes by which\nbroader society, notably the media and community groups,\ncan contribute to democratic decision-making. It will also\nfacilitate visits and secondments of appropriate participants,\nsuch as Parliamentarians, senior administrators and other\ninfluential persons to relevant Australian organizations.\nWhile human rights remain at risk, our values are\ncompromised and international stability is jeopardized. The\nprotection of human rights to promote the dignity of the\nindividual is too important a matter for symbolic gestures\nalone. It is only through the pursuit of practical and\neffective efforts to promote human rights that we show our\nreal commitment to the welfare of individuals and society.\nAnd it is vital to such practical outcomes that we orient our\napproach to human rights to emphasize cooperation and the\ncreation of durable structures.\nIf I may stay briefly with the subjects of practical\noutcomes and durable structures, the nations of the world\nare facing today the threat of climate change and will need\nto agree later this year in Kyoto on sustainable responses to\nthat threat. At the recent South Pacific Forum, Australia,\nalong with other Forum countries, acknowledged deep\nconcern about the impact of increasing concentrations of\ngreenhouse gases on rising sea levels and changing weather\npatterns, especially low-lying islands. Australia, along with\nothers, is working hard to ensure that the Kyoto meeting\ndelivers a sustainable environmental outcome. We stand\nready to play our part, although, as we have made clear in\nthese negotiations, we have no intention of imposing upon\nAustralians an unfair and disproportionate cost in\naddressing this global problem.\nBefore concluding, I should like to address the third\nand final reform issue I said I would be raising. Australia\nbelieves there is an element missing in the present\ndiscussion on reform. I am referring to the existing electoral\ngroup system, which dates back to the last major reform of\nthe group system in 1963. Since the size of the United\nNations has nearly doubled since 1963, mostly with new\nnations from Africa, Asia and the Pacific, this issue needs\nto be addressed again.\nThe present configuration contains many conspicuous\nanomalies and inequities which constitute powerful\narguments for reform. The substantial disparities in the\nsize of the various groups and the inadequate level of\nrepresentation available to the many subregions, including\nin our own geographic region of East Asia and the\nPacific, has long been an evident source of frustration.\nComparisons between the size of the African and East\nEuropean Groups \u2014 embracing 53 and 21 members,\nrespectively \u2014 demonstrate the legitimacy of\ndissatisfaction with the status quo in this regard.\nThis widespread sense of under-representation is\nexacerbated by the social and political diversity of the\nlarger groups and the limited extent to which a single\nmember can be said to represent the group as a whole.\nWhile we have our own ideas, Australia does not believe\nit would be helpful to prescribe any rigid formula for\nreconfiguration of the group system. We acknowledge this\nis a sensitive issue on which there are many views. But\nI believe it is time we began to think about and discuss\nthis matter, as we seek to equip the United Nations for\nthe future.\nUltimately, reform of the United Nations means one\nthing. It means a more efficient organization capable of\ndelivering practical outcomes to the people of the world.\nIf we are to achieve that reform, then we must focus on\ncooperation, not conflict. We must build institutions\nwhich will guarantee effective vigilance, and above all\nelse we must have the courage to abandon the ideas and\nstructures of the past and embrace the changes which\nbring the future.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to begin by\ncongratulating His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on\nhis unanimous election as President of the fifty-second\nsession of the General Assembly. His outstanding\ndiplomatic skills and long experience in foreign affairs\nassure us that he will lead our deliberations at the present\nsession to a successful conclusion.\nMay I also pay our tribute to his predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Razali Ismail of Malaysia for his sagacious\nand exemplary stewardship of the Assembly at its fifty-first\nsession.\nI also wish to extend our warm congratulations to the\nnew Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, on his assumption of his high office. The new\nSecretary-General has already proved his dynamism and\ndedication in the discharge of his responsibilities \u2014 not\nthe least by providing us with his comprehensive United\nNations reform programme for our consideration at this\nsession of the General Assembly.\nThis is a time for change and renewal for the United\nNations. The reform package, proposed by Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, Secretary-General of the United Nations in his\nreport, \u201cRenewing the United Nations: A Programme for\nReform\u201d, is the most comprehensive proposal on the\nreform of the United Nations in the 52-year history of the\nOrganization. Specific proposals, contained therein, need\nto be most carefully studied, and considered by all of us.\nAnother question of reform which is the subject of\nintensive consultations and discussions among Member\nStates at present is that of the composition and working\nmethods of the Security Council.\nBoth the reform of the United Nations and that of\nthe Security Council are imperatives of our times. These\ninstitutions and their working methods need to be changed\nand adjusted appropriately to reflect the present-day\nrealities. With regard to the reform of the United Nations\nin general, we believe that there is a need for a thorough\nreview of the United Nations Charter. Many profound\nchanges have taken place in the world since the Charter\nwas framed 52 years ago. We are of the view that the\nrole of the General Assembly should be enhanced in line\nwith Articles 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the Charter. The\npractice whereby a few great Powers hijack important\npolitical issues for settlement among themselves in the\nSecurity Council, bypassing the Assembly is not basically\nconsistent with the spirit and principles of the Charter.\nNor is it in the interest of the entire membership of the\nUnited Nations and the interest of the Organization. The\nGeneral Assembly should be more actively involved in\nthe settlement of important political issues before the\nUnited Nations. We wish to see more intimate and\ndynamic cooperation between the General Assembly and\nthe Security Council. Moreover, the General Assembly\nand the Economic and Social Council should play a\ngreater role in the coordination and direction of global\nmacroeconomic policy matters.\nWith regard to the reform of the Security Council,\nthere is an emerging convergence of views among\nMember States that the membership of the Council should\nbe expanded to reflect the present-day realities, although\ndifferences of opinion still exist on the modalities of\nenlarging the Council. Myanmar endorses the position of\nthe non-aligned countries that the Council should be\n11\n\n\nenlarged by not less than 11 new members and that such an\nenlargement should be based on the principles of sovereign\nequality of States, equitable geographical distribution and\nrotation. Imbalance in the composition of the Security\nCouncil and gross under-representation in it of the non-\naligned countries should be corrected in order to reflect the\nuniversal character of the world Organization. In the\ncategory of permanent members, there are a few interesting\nproposals, including that of Mr. Razali Ismail, President of\nthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly,\nrecommending an increase of five new permanent members,\ntwo industrialized States and one State each from regions\nof Asia, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean,\nrespectively. There are also proposals to rotate the three\nnew regional permanent seats. These proposals deserve our\nserious consideration. We believe that there is also a need\nfor democratization and greater transparency in the working\nmethods of the Council.\nMay I now touch briefly on the reform package,\nproposed by the Secretary-General. We welcome the main\nthrust of his proposals for cost-cutting and streamlining of\nthe United Nations institutions and services. The important\nthing is that the reform of the United Nations should truly\nbenefit the entire membership, of which the majority are\ndeveloping countries. Our vision is a leaner and more\nefficient United Nations that can more effectively respond\nto the challenges of our time and better serve the interests\nof the entire membership of the Organization. In this\nrespect, we need to examine most carefully whether the\nnew senior executive posts it is proposed to create are\nreally necessary and whether emphasis and focus on\ninstitutional reforms are rightly placed.\nThese proposed reforms, if and when approved by the\nGeneral Assembly and implemented, will have far-reaching\neffects on the Organization and will go a long way in\ndetermining how well the United Nations will be equipped\nto meet new challenges in the twenty-first century.\nAccordingly, we should not rush into reform measures for\ntheir own sake, showing undue haste. We should undertake\na most careful examination and a thorough discussion of\nthese proposals before taking firm decisions in this regard.\nMyanmar is an ardent advocate of stepping up\ninternational disarmament efforts with a view to making\nfurther advances in this important area of our collective\nendeavour. We welcome the proposal by the Secretary-\nGeneral in his reform package to upgrade the Centre for\nDisarmament Affairs to the Department for Disarmament\nand Arms Regulation.\nToday, the post-cold-war international political\nclimate is conducive to arms limitations and disarmament.\nLast year, the General Assembly successfully adopted the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). We are\nencouraged to learn that the Preparatory Commission for\nthe Organization of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty is making good progress. However, it was\ndisconcerting to learn of the recent subcritical non-\nexplosive nuclear tests carried out by a nuclear-weapon\nState. Such subcritical tests run counter to the spirit of the\nCTBT and to the cause of nuclear disarmament. We wish\nto see the cessation of all weapon-related nuclear tests \u2014\nbe they explosive or non-explosive, subcritical or\nsupracritical \u2014 in all environments for all time.\nIn the field of arms limitations and disarmament, we\nattach the highest importance to nuclear disarmament and\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction. At the\nhistoric golden jubilee session of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly, Myanmar submitted, with the\noverwhelming support of Member States, the draft\nresolution that became resolution 50/70 P, entitled\n\u201cNuclear disarmament\u201d, calling upon the nuclear-weapon\nStates to undertake a phased programme of progressive\nand balanced deep reductions of nuclear weapons with a\nview to the total elimination of these weapons within a\ntime-bound framework and calling upon the Conference\non Disarmament to establish, on a priority basis, an ad\nhoc committee to commence multilateral negotiations on\nnuclear disarmament.\nSince the adoption of resolution 50/70 P by the\nGeneral Assembly in 1995, there has been a ground swell\nof renewed interest in and support for nuclear\ndisarmament worldwide. In their advisory opinion of 8\nJuly 1996, all Judges of the International Court of Justice\nunanimously reaffirmed the existence of a legal obligation\nfor all States, including nuclear-weapon States, to pursue\nin good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations\nleading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under\nstrict and effective international control. There has also\nbeen a clamour for nuclear disarmament by several\ngroups of experts, groups of ex-military officials from\nsome nuclear-weapon States and public organizations in\nvarious countries around the world.\nAt the fifty-first session of the General Assembly,\nmy delegation once again successfully submitted a follow-\nup resolution \u2014 resolution 51/45 O \u2014 on the same\nsubject. My delegation will submit another follow-up draft\nresolution on nuclear disarmament at this year\u2019s session\nas well. We hope that, in view of its immense political\n12\n\n\nimportance, our draft resolution will enjoy the\noverwhelming support of Member States, as in previous\nyears.\nThe recent Conference held in Oslo from 1 to 19\nSeptember negotiated a draft convention to place a total ban\non anti-personnel landmines. We are supportive of banning\nthe export and indiscriminate use of anti-personnel\nlandmines. We believe, however, that every country is\nentitled to exercise the right of self-defence, enshrined in\nArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter, in matters of its\nnational defence. In our view, the real problem lies in the\nindiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines and the\nexport and trade in these weapons. It is the indiscriminate\nuse of anti-personnel landmines that is actually killing and\nmaiming innocent children, women and men the world\nover, and it is the export and trade in these mines that is\ncausing their proliferation, leading to their indiscriminate\nuse. We should effectively address these real issues, rather\nthan reach out for an indiscriminate and all-encompassing\ntotal ban on anti-personnel landmines.\nNext year, 1998, will mark the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Significant and\nsubstantial advances have been achieved by the United\nNations in the promotion and protection of human rights in\nthe past 50 years. Nowadays, increasing importance and\nemphasis have been placed on the promotion and protection\nof human rights.\nWe are all for the promotion and protection of basic\nhuman rights, including the right to development. There is\nno question about that. But when it comes to the\napplication of human rights standards, we are concerned by\nthe deviation by certain Western countries from the criteria\nof universality, objectivity and non-selectivity enshrined in\nthe Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted\nby the World Conference on Human Rights. The\npoliticization of human rights questions and the selectivity\nand use of double standards run counter to the spirit and\nbasic norms of human rights.\nMyanmar has been unfairly treated in this matter and\nhas been singled out for censure by certain Western\ncountries under the guise of the promotion and protection\nof human rights. The fact is that never in our post-\nindependence history have we in Myanmar enjoyed such\neconomic growth; never have the Myanmar people better\nenjoyed the basic human rights to peace and stability,\nshelter, clothing and food than at present. Those Western\ncountries turn a blind eye to all these positive developments\nand accomplishments of the Government in my country and\nindulge in the ritual of unfounded fabricated charges\nagainst my country. To cite a Myanmar saying, their\nignorance of the realities and misjudgment may be\nlikened to that of a quack doctor who ignores the fact that\nthe patient is a man and gives him a gynaecological\ndiagnosis. A man must not be accused or censured for the\noffences he has not committed.\nFor our part, we have cooperated with the United\nNations to the fullest extent possible. Myanmar has been\nengaged in a continuing dialogue with the United Nations.\nFrom 1994 onwards, I myself, as a representative of the\nMyanmar Government, have held discussions with the\nSecretary-General and his representatives at United\nNations Headquarters in New York. Assistant Secretary-\nGeneral Mr. Alvaro de Soto, representative of the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, has visited\nMyanmar several times and has met and held discussions\nwith officials of the Government. There have also been\nseveral visits by the Special Rapporteur of the\nCommission on Human Rights. Moreover, the Myanmar\nGovernment has fully responded to queries on human\nrights situations and provided the full and comprehensive\ninformation sought by the United Nations and its\nsubsidiary bodies. We shall continue this cooperation with\nthe United Nations.\nThe spread of narcotic drugs is a growing\ninternational concern. Myanmar has always been in the\nforefront of the war on illicit drugs. A few facts and\nfigures will speak for themselves.\nIn the military operations from 1988 to the end of\nAugust 1997 by the Myanmar Armed forces to interdict\ndrug traffickers, 776 members of the Armed Forces,\nincluding 25 commissioned officers, sacrificed their lives;\nand 2351 members, including 84 commissioned officers,\nsustained injuries.\nFrom 1989 to date, operations to destroy narcotic\ndrugs have been carried out 11 times in Yangon;\noperations to destroy narcotic drugs, drug refineries and\npoppy plantations have been carried out 18 times by the\nlocal populace in frontier areas; a total of 36,682.03 acres\nof poppy plantations have been destroyed. All these\noperations took place in the presence of foreign\njournalists and diplomats.\nMyanmar has a comprehensive legal framework to\ncombat drug abuse, including money laundering. Under\nthe 1993 Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances\nLaw, money laundering and the acquisition of property by\n13\n\n\nthe illegal means of drug trafficking are strictly prohibited.\nStern punitive measures for such criminal offences are\nprescribed and a separate body \u2014 the Property Examination\nCommittee \u2014 was constituted effectively to deal with these\noffences.\nMyanmar\u2019s cooperation with other countries in mutual\nlegal assistance in the suppression of narcotic drugs is\nexemplified by the handing-over of the drug trafficker Mr.\nLi Yun Ching by the Myanmar authorities to the Thai\nauthorities on 17 May 1997 during the goodwill visit of\nThai Prime Minister General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh to\nMyanmar.\nA most significant accomplishment by Myanmar in\nrecent times in this respect is the declaration of Mong-la\nSpecial Zone (4) of the Eastern Shan State as a \u201cdrug-free\nzone\u201d as of 22 April 1997. Special Zone (2) of the Eastern\nShan State and Special Zones (1) and (2) in Kachin State\nhave been designated for establishment as \u201cdrug-free\nzones\u201d. Effective measures are being implemented to totally\neradicate drug abuse in these areas. We are confident that\nthese areas will be totally drug free in the near future. By\nestablishing an increasing number of such drug-free zones\nand by other effective measures of suppression of narcotic\ndrugs, we envision and strive to achieve the total\neradication of drug abuse in Myanmar in the not-too-distant\nfuture.\nIn fairness to all, it would be hard to find other\ncountries that have made sacrifices of such magnitude in\nterms of loss of life and limb of the members of their\narmed forces and have carried out such massive destruction\nof narcotic drugs. No candid observer, free from any\nprejudice against Myanmar, can deny these concrete facts.\nBut certain Westerners, bearing prejudice and malice\nagainst Myanmar, are pointing accusing fingers at my\ncountry on all sorts of fabricated charges. Nothing can be\nfurther from the truth. So glaring is their distortion of facts\nthat we can only say that the analogy of the quack doctor\nI have quoted above also applies in this instance.\nAs this is a time for change and renewal for the\nUnited Nations, so it is for the Association of South-East\nAsian Nations (ASEAN). In this year of the thirtieth\nanniversary of the founding of the Association, ASEAN, at\nits ministerial meeting in Kuala Lumpur in July this year,\nadmitted Laos and Myanmar, bringing its membership to\nnine. By so doing, ASEAN has demonstrated to the world\nthe solidarity among the South-East Asian countries. We\nare confident that this will lead to the further expansion of\nthe membership of the Association to 10 in the near future.\nBy this expansion, ASEAN has once again proven its\nrelevance, viability and dynamism as a regional\norganization.\nMyanmar is also taking an active part in regional\neconomic cooperation. An important step taken by my\ncountry recently is Myanmar\u2019s joining of the Bangladesh-\nIndia-Sri Lanka-Thailand Economic Cooperation (BIST-\nEC) in August this year.\nThrough its pursuit of an independent and active\nforeign policy, Myanmar has consistently contributed to\npeace and stability in the region and beyond. As a\nmember of ASEAN and of the Non-Aligned Movement,\nMyanmar will continue this contribution through its active\nparticipation in international and regional affairs in future\nas well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nshould like to join those who have spoken before me in\noffering you, Sir, my warmest congratulations on your\noutstanding election to the presidency of our Assembly.\nTo your illustrious predecessor, Mr. Razali Ismail of\nMalaysia, my delegation reaffirms its satisfaction with the\nefficiency and competence with which he guided the work\nof the fifty-first session. We wish once again to convey to\nhim our sincere appreciation.\nI also wish once again to welcome the election of\nMr. Kofi Annan as Secretary-General of our Organization.\nIn raising him to this position, the international community\nrecognized the qualities that have brought honour to him,\nhis country and the entire African continent. On behalf of\nmy delegation, I pay tribute to him for his dedication to the\ncause of international peace and security and for all he is\ndoing to make the United Nations more effective and\ncredible by improving its capacity to meet the needs of\ntoday\u2019s world.\nTwo years ago, we celebrated the United Nations first\nhalf-century. We recommitted ourselves solemnly to\nworking together to advance peace, development, equality,\njustice and understanding among all the peoples of the\nworld. The current session provides us with another\nopportunity to assess our collective work at a time when we\nare preparing to enter the twenty-first century with major\nachievements under our belt, to be sure, but also with\ninnumerable challenges to face.\nIn its ongoing quest to make life better for peoples,\nour Organization has adopted and is implementing\nalternative strategies to meet the demands of a world in\nconstant change. The proclamation of the United Nations\nDecade for the Eradication of Poverty, the advancement of\nthe rights of women and children, and the convening of a\nspecial session of the General Assembly on environment\nand development are all actions demonstrating the\ndetermination of the United Nations to address the great\nproblems of our time. But we must recognize that, despite\nthe efforts of the international community to establish a\nnew world order, we are still waiting for the ardently\ndesired peace, security, development and growth to\nmaterialize.\nDespite the detente that has existed since the end of\nthe East-West antagonism, the international political\nsituation continues to present a gloomy picture, marked\nby ongoing disputes, tensions and conflicts. Even if\npiecemeal efforts are made to settle these crises, definitive\nsolutions seem to elude us. Thus, we remain deeply\nconcerned for the future of mankind.\nMoreover, our helplessness in the face of resurgent\nterrorism, worsening poverty, the ever growing number of\nrefugees and displaced persons and the deterioration of\nthe environment dims our hope that the noble objectives\nlaid down in the Charter to build a better world for future\ngenerations will ever come true.\nIn this context, Togo, under the guidance of the\nPresident of the Republic, Mr. Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyadema, is\nstriving to strengthen the political and legal bases of a\nstate of law and to make development and, above all, the\neradication of poverty the cornerstones of its policy.\nThe citizens of Togo have entered a new era in the\nachievement of greater liberty, justice and progress in\norder to make their country a democratic, united and\nprosperous nation. Every day, they demonstrate their will\nto reflect in their actions this deep-rooted desire to live\ntogether in peace and unity. According to experienced\nobservers of good faith, the democratic institutions\nestablished in Togo are proving themselves. The National\nAssembly, having become an outstanding forum for\ndemocratic debate, is living proof of the country\u2019s\ncommitment to entrench itself in democracy.\nMost of the other institutions of the Republic\nprovided for under the Constitution have been\nestablished \u2014 for example, the High Audiovisual and\nCommunication Authority, the Constitutional Court, the\nNational Commission for Human Rights and the Supreme\nCouncil for the Courts.\nAware, moreover, that they control their own\ndestiny, the Togolese have decided to work together\ntowards a sound and transparent administration of public\naffairs. How could we not, therefore, be pleased by the\neconomic performances achieved thanks to efforts made\nfor the effective implementation of the Government\nprogramme? The gross domestic product increased by 6\nper cent in 1996, and the rate of inflation has shown a\nclear improvement compared to 1995 thanks to a prudent\nwages and monetary policy. Improved export\ncompetitiveness and the progressive resumption of\ncooperation have allowed us to correct the balance of\n5\n\n\npayments and strengthen Togo\u2019s contribution to the reserves\nof the West African Economic and Monetary Union. The\npeople of Togo hope that the community of nations will\ncontinue to support it in its progress towards legitimacy and\nlegality by helping it to complete the work of economic\nrecovery.\nThe maintenance of peace continues to be the primary\ntask of the United Nations. One cannot over-emphasize that\npreventing crises, reducing tension, separating combatants\nand finding definitive solutions to conflicts continue to be\namong the fundamental missions of our Organization. We\nare pleased to see in Togo that the United Nations, through\nconcerted actions, continues day by day to do even more.\nMy country confirms its unswerving dedication to the\nprinciple of the peaceful settlement of disputes, in\naccordance with international law, and emphasizes the need\nto strengthen in this area cooperation between the United\nNations and regional organizations. Chapter VIII of the\nCharter would then take on its full meaning.\nDespite every effort, peace remains threatened on our\nplanet, particularly on the African continent. As regards the\nRepublic of the Congo, Togo is concerned over the\nsituation there since 5 June 1997. We keenly hope that the\nprotagonists will put aside their arms in favour of dialogue\nin accordance with the spirit of Libreville Summit, held on\n14 and 15 September 1997, in which eight Heads of State,\nincluding President Eyadema of Togo, participated. The\nGovernment of Togo urgently calls upon our brothers in the\nCongo to conclude as quickly as possible a final ceasefire\nso that, under the aegis of the United Nations and the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), the international\ninterposition force planned by that last summit can be\ndeployed.\nAs regards the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nTogo, needless to say, was involved in the search for a\npeaceful solution to the crisis by hosting in Lom\u00e9 last\nMarch a special summit of the Central Organ of the OAU\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\nResolution in Africa. Faced with a new political situation,\nmy Government would urge the authorities in Kinshasa to\ndo everything in their power to provide a climate\nfavourable to national reconciliation in order to tackle the\npriority tasks of development.\nIn Sierra Leone, the hope born of the establishment of\na democratic regime and the signing of the peace agreement\nin Abidjan in November 1996 between the Government and\nthe Revolutionary United Front was thoroughly tested by\nthe putsch of 25 May 1997. My country strongly\ncondemned this coup. It is demanding the reestablishment\nof constitutional order and earnestly hopes that this\nquestion can be peacefully resolved in order to avoid\nanother crisis for the West African subregion at a time\nwhen the Liberian conflict is coming to a close. The\npeople of Togo are pleased to note that, on the basis of\nthe Abuja Agreement, the presidential, legislative and\nsenatorial elections were finally able to take place last 19\nJuly in an atmosphere of discipline, transparency and\npeace. My delegation takes this opportunity to\ncongratulate the mission carried out by the Economic\nCommunity of West African States, supported by the\nUnited Nations and the OAU, from the beginning of the\nconflict to the establishment of new democratic\ninstitutions.\nI should like, moreover, given the instability that\nAfrica is experiencing, to remind the parties concerned\nthat they must seek to prevent fratricidal conflicts, which\ndiverts their energy from the path of development. More\nthought should therefore be given to establishing an\nAfrican peacekeeping force, which was first suggested by\nPresident Eyadema at the thirtieth session of the\nAssembly of Heads of State and Government of the\nOAU, held in Tunisia in 1994. There is now an\nimperative, urgent need to establish such a force, which\ncould react promptly and effectively to any armed\nconflict, in order to reestablish peace and stability as\nquickly as possible wherever necessary.\nI would like again this year to return to the question\nof the Regional Centre of the United Nations for Peace\nand Disarmament in Africa and to welcome the sending\nby the Secretary-General of a mission of consultants to\nLom\u00e9 and other African capitals to explore ways and\nmeans of revitalizing the Centre. It is clear from the\ndecision taken in Harare by the thirty-third session of the\nAssembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU\nthat the Centre has a vital role to play in the maintenance\nof peace and security in Africa as well as in the\nprevention of conflicts on the continent.\nI cannot fail to mention here the situation in other\nparts of the world.\nRegarding the Middle East, my country, which had\nin the past hailed the courage, dedication and spirit of\ninitiative of the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in the\nimplementation of the timetable for the withdrawal from\nthe occupied territories, is today concerned about the\nblocking of the peace process in the region. We deplore\nthe continuation of the settlements policy and the\n6\n\n\nresumption of acts of violence, which only serve to\nundermine the climate of confidence that is a prerequisite\nfor the pursuit of dialogue.\nTogo urges the parties to resume negotiations in\naccordance with the Agreements of 1993 and 1994 in order\nto relaunch the peace process and achieve a comprehensive\nand lasting settlement of the conflict in the Middle East,\nwhich has lasted now for more than half a century and is\na threat to the peace and security of the States of the\nregion.\nI turn to the situation in the Korean Peninsula. Togo\nhas been following with great interest the talks under way\nand calls for the establishment of lasting peace in this\nregion. We hope that the negotiations that have begun will\ncontinue and will be crowned with success.\nEveryone is aware that most of these conflicts have\nclaimed, and continue to claim, numerous victims, including\nrefugees and displaced persons.\nThe proliferation of weapons, whatever their type, is\na threat to peace and security. To be sure, commendable\nefforts have been made to create a world free from the\nspectre of nuclear war. However, it must be emphasized\nthat the maintenance of international peace and security\nhinges on general and complete disarmament. My country\nhailed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and\nconsiders the entry into force on 29 April this year of the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and\non Their Destruction to be a decisive act by the\ninternational community in its permanent quest for a\npeaceful world. In ratifying this Convention, Togo wished\nto stress its unequivocal commitment to general and\ncomplete disarmament. It hopes that implementing the\nprovisions of this Convention will help spare mankind the\ninnumerable evils resulting from the use of such weapons.\nRegarding anti-personnel landmines, my country hails\nthe process begun in Ottawa in 1996, which concluded in\nOslo with the adoption of the treaty regarding the use,\nstorage, production and transfer of those mines and their\ndestruction. We hope that this treaty, which will open for\nsignature next December in Ottawa, will be ratified and\nrigorously applied by all States, so that, because of its\nuniversal nature, many human lives may be saved.\nThe end of the bipolarization associated with the cold\nwar allowed the international community to glimpse a\nworld in which efforts would henceforth be mobilized to\neliminate poverty so as to ensure development and well-\nbeing for humankind. However, we are obliged to note\nthat, despite this favourable environment for peace and\neconomic expansion, poverty continues to grow\nunchecked and remains a striking phenomenon in our\nworld. This situation provides a good illustration of the\nfailure of the numerous development strategies put\nforward by the international community.\nIn this context, the case of Africa remains the most\nworrying. The burden of external debt, the drop in export\nearnings and the adverse consequences of trade\nimbalances have largely contributed to an increased\ndeterioration in socio-economic conditions in many\ncountries. The world economy, characterized, as we near\nthe end of the century, by the phenomenon of\nglobalization, has experienced a general growth in almost\nall countries over the past few years. It is regrettable,\nhowever, that despite this globalization the new rules of\ntrade have not made it possible to dismantle the barriers\nerected by the industrialized countries to protect their\nindustry and agriculture. It follows that it is still difficult\nfor our products to gain access to their markets.\nThese protectionist measures, which do enormous\ndamage to developing countries, especially in Africa,\ncancel out the efforts made by African countries to\nrelaunch the growth of their economies through exports.\nWe cannot stress enough how much damage is\ncaused by the closing of the markets of the North to the\nproducts of developing countries. This situation deprives\nthe countries of the South of substantial foreign-currency\nincome, which are necessary to promote sustained\ndevelopment. In this respect, the Government of Togo\nfully appreciates the willingness of the richest countries,\nreaffirmed last June at the Denver Summit, intend to open\ntheir markets further to the countries of the South. We\nbelieve that by lifting their protectionist barriers the\ndeveloped countries will make a genuine and tangible\ncontribution to the development efforts being made by the\nless well-off.\nIn this light, my Government believes that\nglobalization must be accompanied by an impetus for\nincreased solidarity, characterized by the willingness of\nthe countries of the North to buy our staple commodities\nat remunerative prices.\nDespite the commendable efforts undertaken by\nAfrican Governments within the framework of structural-\nadjustment programmes, the economic situation in our\n7\n\n\nStates remains difficult, and living conditions for our\npopulations are increasingly precarious. Given this state of\naffairs, the international community has developed various\nstrategies to help the African States find viable and lasting\nsolutions to their many socio-economic problems. It is\nimportant to welcome here the United Nations System-wide\nSpecial Initiative on Africa, which my delegation believes\nsupports and complements the United Nations New Agenda\nfor the Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF),\nas well as the Cairo Programme of Action for the social\nand economic development of Africa.\nMy country also pays tribute to the Government of\nJapan which, in addition to its unfailing support to\ndeveloping countries, has taken the positive initiative of\nplanning to convene, in 1998, the second Tokyo\nInternational Conference on African Development. It is very\ndesirable for the various parties involved in African\ndevelopment who will be participating in that forum,\nincluding Africans themselves, to become more involved in\nthe conception and the implementation of development\nprogrammes for out continent.\nDevelopment policies for our countries cannot be\nconceived today without cooperation and regional\nintegration. In this respect, the entry into force of the\nTreaty establishing the African Economic Community is a\ngood illustration of the will of the African States to pool\ntheir efforts to achieve sustainable development. Togo\nwould like to reaffirm its commitment to the policy of\neconomic integration of the continent and urges the United\nNations and the international community to support the\nAfrican countries in their efforts to achieve the objectives\nof sustainable development so as to promote prosperity and\nwell-being for their populations.\nWe are pleased to note that 52 years after the adoption\nof the Charter in San Francisco, many processes are under\nway, aimed in particular at strengthening the United\nNations system, resolving the financial crisis of the\nOrganization and restructuring the United Nations in the\nsocial and economic spheres and in related areas, including\nthe Security Council.\nWith regard to the Security Council in particular, it is\nimportant that the ongoing discussions on its restructuring\naim at and succeed in expanding the number of both\npermanent and non-permanent members. Such an\nenlargement should take into account the interests of\ndeveloping countries and should be based on equitable\ngeographic representation in order to make the Council\nmore representative and more democratic, thereby enabling\nit to respond more effectively to the requirements of the\nday.\nWithin the framework of efforts to revitalize the\nOrganization, my delegation has noted with interest the\nmeasures envisaged by the Secretary-General and the\nrecommendations contained in his report, presented on 16\nJuly, which are aimed at restructuring the Secretariat and\nproviding it with the means to serve the Member States\nmore effectively. At this session the Assembly will have\nan opportunity to take part in a careful and in-depth\nconsideration of that report.\nTogo wishes to stress that the decisions and\nmeasures resulting from such consideration should not\nreduce the capacity of the Organization in the\ndevelopment field. We therefore hope, as the Secretary-\nGeneral himself has proposed, that the savings resulting\nfrom more rigorous management will permit the financing\nof United Nations priority programmes, such as those for\nthe elimination of poverty and the advancement of\nsustained economic growth in the developing countries.\nAt the dawn of the third millennium, humankind is\nat a decisive stage in its history and requires greater\npragmatism, creativity and solidarity in settling its\nproblems. In this respect, our world, in a spirit of\nsolidarity, must mobilize further to eliminate poverty,\nwhich is the vital concern of our time, as it impedes the\ncohesiveness of societies and States, destroys the very\nbasis of human rights and damages the environment. We\ntherefore need to tackle this principal cause of\ninstability \u2014 poverty \u2014 with the same urgency and\nvigour that we apply to political crises. For it is clear that\nno system of collective security can be viable unless we\nseek effectively to resolve the problems of poverty and\nmisery that are the daily lot of most of the population of\nthe world.\nTogether, therefore, let us seek a new international\norder based on peace, solidarity and justice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is indeed an honour once\nagain to address the General Assembly.\nOn behalf of the people of Sierra Leone, and on my\nown behalf, I congratulate you, Sir, on your election to\npreside over the work of this session, which you rightly\ndescribed as one that can mark the beginning of a new\nera in United Nations history. Ukraine, a founding\nMember of our Organization, is well known for its\ndecisive stand on unilateral nuclear disarmament. This in\nitself is a major contribution to the promotion of\ninternational peace and security. As an experienced\ndiplomat and former senior member of the Secretariat,\nyou are fully equipped to steer this session to a successful\nconclusion.\nI wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor,\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for the firm and\nskilful manner in which he led the Assembly in dealing\nwith the issues of the fifty-first session.\nWe commend the Secretary-General for the bold\neffort he has made so far in mapping out the tracks of his\nquiet revolution, a reform of the Secretariat. This is\nperhaps the first time in the history of the Organization\n7\n\n\nthat we have in the same session a President of the General\nAssembly and a Secretary-General both of whom were staff\nmembers of the United Nations Secretariat. I would like to\nconvey through the Secretary-General our appreciation to\nthe entire staff of the United Nations system, who have\nbeen and continue to be pillars supporting the structures of\npeace and economic and social well-being which our\nOrganization is building in various parts of the world.\nWhen I addressed this body last year, I spoke at length\nabout my Government\u2019s efforts to reach a peace agreement\nwith the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), the settlement\nof people displaced by the conflict and our efforts at\nnational reconciliation. I also spoke of our hopes: our hopes\nfor the consolidation of our new democracy, for the revival\nof our economy and for the regeneration of communities\nscarred by years of war. These were no starry-eyed\npronouncements. We were too well aware of the challenges\nwhich the achievement of these objectives entailed, but we\nwere tackling them in a spirit of realism within the\nframework of a united national effort and, above all, in\nconfident hope.\nIn the economic sphere, for example, the response was\npromising. My Government was credited within a year with\nthe introduction of a social security scheme and a minimum\nwage act; accountability and transparency in public\nspending; trade liberalization and public enterprise reform,\nincluding privatization; reduction of the rate of inflation\nfrom 65 per cent to 6 per cent; achievement of a 5 per cent\neconomic growth rate, which had been minus 10 per cent\na year earlier; and plans for an investment code. These are\nsome of the signposts of confidence which national and\ninternational investors saw when they concluded that Sierra\nLeone was well on its way to economic recovery. Prospects\nfor that recovery were at their highest in more than two\ndecades.\nToday I appear before you with a heavy heart. As I\nspeak, a great tragedy is unfolding in my country. On 25\nMay 1997, a combination of elements of the Sierra Leone\narmy and the Revolutionary United Front violently\noverthrew my democratically elected Government and\nunleashed on the country a reign of terror unprecedented in\nits scope and ferocity. Overnight, Sierra Leone was\ntransformed into a gulag of horrors: the killing of\ndefenceless, innocent civilians, looting, confiscation of\nproperty and rape. These atrocities continue. The people of\nSierra Leone have been ushered into a long night of\ndarkness. For the first time in our history, the survival of\nour national society as a morally and socially cohesive\nwhole has been put into question.\nIt is against the background of these dramatically\nchanged conditions in my country that I appear before\nyou today, to make an appeal \u2014 a desperate appeal \u2014\nfor help from the international community to save a\nnation and a people. My presence on this podium\nsymbolizes the people of Sierra Leone stretching out their\nhands to the United Nations, asking it to pull them back\nfrom the brink of catastrophe.\nThe people of Sierra Leone are united in a common\nfear, the fear that unless something is done, and done\nnow, the barbarism and adventurism of the military junta\nwill push the country over the brink. Their hope is that\nthe international community will not allow the military\njunta to convert their country into one vast killing field.\nIf the prevailing situation is allowed to drift much longer,\nbecause of a failure of political will, or for any other\nreason, then the hopes of a peace-loving nation for a life\nworthy of normal human beings will have been betrayed.\nI am more than convinced that this cannot be what the\nUnited Nations would like to see happen in Sierra Leone.\nMy belief in the United Nations, as the custodian of\nworld peace and security, and as the ultimate defence of\nthe weak and the defenceless, remains as strong as ever.\nIt is on the strength of this conviction, which has been a\npart of all my adult life, that I bring the case of Sierra\nLeone to the attention of the Assembly.\nOnly the speedy restoration of the democratically\nelected Government of Sierra Leone can provide a lasting\nsolution to the crisis and enable the country to return to\nnormalcy and to resume its place as a responsible member\nof the community of nations. This is no self-serving\nstatement. To insist on the restoration of my Government\nis no more than to insist that the Government which the\npeople of Sierra Leone freely and openly elected in the\nmost closely invigilated election in the post-independence\nhistory of the country be restored to them. Indeed, when\nthe Summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\nheld in Harare considered the matter it resolved strongly\nand unequivocally to condemn the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and called\nfor the immediate restoration of constitutional order in\nSierra Leone.\nMy Government emerged as a result of a transition\nprocess under the their military regime of the National\nProvisional Ruling Council. It was that regime which\nappointed the Interim National Electoral Commission as\nthe management body responsible for the conduct of both\nthe parliamentary and presidential elections. At the\nrequest of the Interior National Electoral Commission, the\nCommonwealth secretariat in London provided three\n8\n\n\nexperts, including a legal draftsman, to help with the\npreparations for the elections. None of these people had\nbeen to Sierra Leone before and they knew nobody in the\ncountry. The point of their attachment to the Interior\nNational Electoral Commission was to bring to bear on the\nwork of the Commission the highest international electoral\npractices. The European Union also provided a voter\neducation expert from Britain, while the United Nations\nsupplied a logistical expert.\nIn other words, at the heart of the election\nmanagement body, the international community had a\npresence to ensure the highest standard of probity and\ntransparency in the conduct of the elections.\nIn January 1996, in the middle of the preparations for\nthe elections, Brigadier Maada Bio forced Captain\nValentine Strasser out of office as Chairman of the National\nProvisional Ruling Council and immediately launched a\ncampaign to postpone the elections. The banner of that\ncampaign was \u201cPeace before Elections\u201d. A national\nconsultative conference comprising representatives of\npolitical parties, the army, the police, trade unions,\nwomen\u2019s organizations, the churches and mosques and\nother organizations of civil society was convened in\nFebruary 1996 to pronounce on the matter. I should add\nthat in attendance were also representatives of the\ninternational community. The overwhelming majority of the\ndelegates to the conference supported the holding of\nelections. Incidentally, the Revolutionary United Front was\ninvited to participate in the democratic process. Clearly\nillustrating its attitude towards legitimate democratic\nprinciples and procedures, the Front categorically refused to\nhonour the invitation.\nAnd so the elections were held on 26 and 27 February\n1996. There were observers from the Commonwealth, the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), the African-\nAmerican Institute, the African-American Labor Center, the\nCommonwealth Trade Union Council and the World\nCouncil of Churches, all coordinated by no less a body than\nthe United Nations itself. At the close of polling, and long\nbefore the official declaration of the results, the\ninternational observers made a joint statement on 29\nFebruary 1996, in which they said that, despite setbacks,\nthey had witnessed a remarkably peaceful, orderly and\ntransparent conduct of the vote, which led them to conclude\n\u201cthat the results will genuinely reflect the will of the\npeople of Sierra Leone and usher in an era of\ndemocracy\u201d.\nHaving failed to prevent the holding of the elections\nthrough political manoeuvring, the anti-democratic forces\nwithin the army and their Revolutionary United Front\nallies launched a campaign of terror and intimidation in\nthose parts of the countryside where the rebels had a\npresence to scare away people from voting. Many\ninnocent men and women had their hands cut off. Some\nwere branded with hot irons and many more were\nmutilated in ways that I cannot describe in public. But no\nintimidation could overcome the determination of the\npeople to put an end to military rule and all its associated\nabuses.\nThe elections which brought my Government into\noffice were more than an electoral exercise to replace one\nGovernment with another. They were no less than an\nopportunity \u2014 indeed, a historic opportunity \u2014 for the\npeople of Sierra Leone to put an end to nearly 30 years\nof undemocratic rule, the last four of which were an\noutright military dictatorship.\nIn retrospect, the victories of the people, first against\nthe political sleight of hand to stop the elections, and then\nagainst the campaign of terror and intimidation to scare\naway the voters from the polling booths, seem to have\nleft the reactionary forces in our country with only one\nremaining avenue to their objective, the unconstitutional\noverthrow of any civil Government, and that was\nprecisely what happened on 25 May.\nThe people of Sierra Leone have responded to the\ncoup in a manner unique in the history of Africa.\nThousands of citizens, some out of fear for their lives and\nother human rights violations, simply abandoned their\nhomes and their country, moved into neighbouring\ncountries, declaring they would rather live as refugees\noutside Sierra Leone than stay under the rule of the illegal\njunta. Those who stayed behind have refused to go to\nwork and have in various ways refused to cooperate with\nthe junta. This is the manifestation of the determination\nof Sierra Leoneans never to surrender their hard-won\ndemocracy.\nThe struggle under way in my country is between\nthe unarmed millions defending the cause of democracy\nand the armed reactionary clique of mutinous soldiers and\ntheir Revolutionary United Front cohorts. In embarking on\nthat perilous struggle, the people of Sierra Leone were\nnever in doubt as to where the sheer military advantage\nlay. What continues to sustain the determined resistance\nof the people and to fortify their courage is the belief, and\nthe expectation, that the international community cannot,\n9\n\n\nand will not, let them down \u2014 indeed, the belief that,\nwhatever hardship they are facing at the moment, right will\nultimately triumph over might.\nNo one who has seen the reign of terror unleashed by\nthe regime on the defenceless citizenry or witnessed the\ndaily looting, rape and other brutalities which have now\nbecome a way of life in Sierra Leone can mistake this for\npeace. There is no peace in Sierra Leone. What is\nhappening is that the horrors which the RUF inflicted on\nthe rural communities \u2014 the killings, the amputation of\nlimbs, the looting, the arbitrary and illegal seizure of\nprivate property of all kinds and many other crimes \u2014 have\nnow been generalized to encompass the urban centres as\nwell. To further compound their assault on innocent\ncivilians, the illegal junta has finally resorted to the laying\nof anti-personnel landmines throughout the country, and\nwithin the capital city itself. I need not spell out what a\nhorrific act this represents as far as innocent men, women\nand children are concerned as they begin to fall victim to\nthese hidden devices.\nThis was precisely what my Government set out to\navert. In my inaugural statement as President, I made the\npursuit of peace and the end of the rebel war my most\nurgent priority. Within a matter of days of assuming office,\nI signed a communiqu\u00e9 at Yamoussoukro, in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire,\nwith the leader of the RUF, Corporal Foday Sankoh, in\nwhich we effectively agreed upon a permanent ceasefire.\nThat agreement opened the way for substantive negotiations\nbetween the Government and the RUF, culminating in the\nAbidjan peace accord of 30 November 1996.\nWhat my Government did not know was that the RUF\nwas negotiating in bad faith. We took the RUF at its word\nand assumed that its professed commitment to peace was\ngenuine. The negotiations were protracted because the RUF\nwas adamant on certain issues. We conceded on those\nparticular issues with the hope that the RUF would honour\nthe resulting accord. This is, of course, not to suggest that\nthere were no doubters in our ranks who harboured\nmisgivings about the sincerity of the RUF. We had our\nshare of these doubting Thomases, but on the basis of our\npeoples yearning for peace, we elected to be guided more\nby our hopes and less by our fears.\nAfter peace, national reconciliation was another central\nplank of my Government\u2019s policy. The pursuit of that\npolicy began with the very configuration of my\nadministration. My party had a substantial majority in\nParliament, and I myself had won the presidential elections\nwith a convincing majority. On the basis of the outcome of\nthe elections, therefore, I was under no obligation to\ninclude in my Government people from other parties. But\nI took a wider view of the matter and decided that if the\ncause of national reconciliation was to be advanced it\nwould be desirable to have a broad-based Government.\nAccordingly, I appointed the leader of one of the minority\nparties to be my Minister of Finance, making him,\neffectively, the third most senior member of the\nGovernment. Other ministerial and senior positions were\nfilled by people drawn from other political parties. What\nemerged as a result was a broad-based Government of\nnational unity in all but name.\nThe policy of national reconciliation was taken\nfurther. The previous military regime, the National\nProvisional Ruling Council (NPRC) had confiscated the\nproperties of many senior Sierra Leoneans not on the\nbasis of law or due process, but on ad hoc commissions\nof inquiry whose findings were not published and were\nsubject to no appeal. No one pretended that justice had\nbeen done by the work of those commissions of inquiry.\nYet, on the basis of their findings, not only had many\npeople lost their properties, some of them had also been\ndisqualified from holding public office. If Sierra Leone\u2019s\nnew democracy was to mean anything, this was a state of\naffairs which could not be allowed to continue. I\nappointed a National Commission for Reconciliation and\napplied to the Commonwealth secretariat for a senior\nCommonwealth judge to review the findings of the\ncommission of inquiry and to put right what had been put\nwrong. I wanted a judge of suitable seniority and\ndistinction whose verdict would command respect. The\nCommonwealth Secretary-General secured for me the\nservices of judge Ulric Cross of Trinidad and Tobago. He\nwas due to return to Sierra Leone to resume his\nchairmanship of the National Commission for\nReconciliation when the coup took place.\nFollowing the earlier coup of April 1992, which had\ninstalled the NPRC military regime in power, many Sierra\nLeoneans went into exile. They, too, had to be enabled to\ncome home in security and in dignity. Former President\nJoseph Saidu Momoh had been living in exile in Guinea\nsince the coup of April 1992. My Government brought\nhim home and resettled him in a manner befitting a man\nwho had been our Head of State.\nI have gone into this background in detail to show\nwhat my Government did to end the war that had been\nraging for the best part of five years, to achieve national\nreconciliation and to usher in lasting peace. All this and\nmuch else will be erased if the regime is allowed to\n10\n\n\nremain in power. The burning question before the world\ncommunity, therefore, is how best to bring a swift end to\nthe ruinous regime of the military and to enable Sierra\nLeone to rejoin the mainstream of human society.\nSome people with the best of intentions but with little\nknowledge of the situation have called for negotiations to\nend the tragedy unfolding in Sierra Leone.I have been\ninvolved in negotiations of one kind or another throughout\nmy career. In fact, in a sense negotiating is second nature\nto me. Accordingly, I have no problems with the principle\nof negotiation. But it would be utterly disingenuous of me\nnot to state the serious reservations I hold about negotiating\nwith the junta.\nIn the first place, the junta is an unstable coalition. On\nthe surface it presents itself as a government in which every\nmember shares collective responsibility for decisions jointly\ntaken. In reality it is nothing of the kind. There is nothing\ncollective about the junta except the determination of its\nconstituent parts to hang on to power. For now the RUF\nmay be allied with some elements of the army, but there is\nno pretence that they are motivated by the same long-term\nobjectives. The RUF is not the army, and it is certainly not\nunder the command of the mutinous faction of the Army.\nThe RUF has a separate and independent command\nstructure, and it takes its instructions from its own high\ncommand. Therefore, based on our experience, in any\nputative negotiations with the RUF it can be expected to\ncome to the table with its own set of demands. The\ndecision of one part of the unstable coalition will not, by\nany stretch of the imagination, bind the other. Indeed,\nprecisely because they have separate and quite possibly\nconflicting objectives there is hardly any prospect of\nnegotiating with anything like a unified position.\nIn the second place, the RUF is undoubtedly the\nfaction with the upper hand within the junta. The RUF\u2019s\nprincipal objective all along has been to take and keep\npower by all means, including terror and murder. In its\npresent configuration, the RUF has no coherent programme\nto speak of. Rather than yield power peacefully, the RUF\nhas threatened to launch a scorched-earth campaign to\nreduce the country to ashes. Its position is that if it cannot\nrule Sierra Leone, nobody else should.\nAnd if none of these points is convincing, we have\nonly to look at the way in which the junta has handled the\nnegotiations with the Committee of four Foreign Ministers\nof the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS). The three-point ECOWAS formula for the\nresolution of the Sierra Leone crisis entailed, in order,\n\u201cthe early reinstatement of the legitimate\nGovernment of President Tejan Kabbah, the return\nof peace and security and the resolution of the issues\nof refugees and displaced persons\u201d.\nThis was the basis on which the regime entered into\nnegotiations with the ECOWAS Committee of four. The\nthird meeting between the Committee and representatives\nof the regime in Abidjan took place on 30 July 1997. It\nwas expected to be a breakthrough meeting. However,\nwhile it was in progress, the leader of the junta made a\nradio and television broadcast in which he stated clearly\nthat his regime was determined to remain in power for a\nminimum of four years. His statement was intended to\nwreck the talks, and that was exactly what it did. He has\nnot retracted his determination to stay in power for four\nyears.\nIf, in spite of the illegal junta\u2019s record of bad faith,\nthe international community insists that we must take the\npath of negotiations, then I suggest that such negotiations\nshould be held between the junta and the Committee of\nECOWAS Foreign Ministers, whose membership has now\nbeen increased to five. And for those negotiations to be\nmeaningful, they must proceed on the basis of clear\nunderstandings. In the first place, if the negotiations are\nresumed, the three-point ECOWAS negotiating agenda\nmust remain the agenda of such negotiations. Then they\nmust be time-bound. If they are open-ended, the regime\ncan be expected to filibuster and to spin them out\nindefinitely in the hope that it will achieve a creeping de\nfacto recognition by the international community.\nThen, the junta\u2019s delegation must always be led by\nthe junta leader himself. The Committee of five should\ninsist on no less, because if the regime\u2019s delegation is led\nby anyone else, the scope for subsequent repudiation and\ndouble-dealing will become infinite. Finally, to ensure\nthat the regime treats the negotiations with the seriousness\nthey deserve, existing international pressures and\nmeasures must not only be maintained but further\nstrengthened. In that way the genuineness of the regime\u2019s\ndeclared intention to negotiate will be tested.\nWhen all this is done and an agreement is reached,\nwe will still have to face the task of achieving genuine\nand total national reconciliation. What Sierra Leone needs\ntoday more than anything else is peace and reconciliation.\nI have never lost sight of this need, and it is the one\nobjective which has influenced every step that I have\ntaken since assuming office in March 1996. The events of\n25 May have only further deepened those divisions within\n11\n\n\nour society which my policies had begun to heal. As a\nresult, the adoption of a more vigorous policy of national\nreconciliation has become an absolute necessity.\nIt would not be exaggerating the case to say that the\nbrand of political persuasion practised by the military-RUF\ncoalition borders on systematic genocide. Since 25 May\n1997, whole villages, entire communities and targeted\nfamilies have been wholly or partially decimated in the\neastern, northern and southern provinces of Sierra Leone,\nin Moyamba, Bonthe, Sanda, Bumpe, Kumrabai,\nForedugu \u2014 the list is endless.\nThat is why many Sierra Leoneans strongly believe\nthat a war crimes tribunal should be appointed to try all\nthose who had a hand in the making of our tragedy. I\nunderstand the feelings behind this demand, but I reject it.\nl reject it because it will add to our already grave problems\nand postpone lasting national reconciliation.\nThroughout this address I have tried to draw a\ndistinction between elements of the army in complicity with\nthe head of the junta and the bulk of the army, who are\nbasically decent men and women and loyal to the best\ntraditions of the Sierra Leone army. Even so, I do not\nbelieve that any worthwhile national purpose will be served\nby a policy of reprisals against the misguided elements of\nthe army and others in the junta\u2019s camp.\nWe seek no more from the United Nations than the\nassurance of 6 August 1997 contained in the statement\nmade by the President of the Security Council:\n\u201cThe Security Council will, in the absence of a\nsatisfactory response from the military junta, be ready\nto take appropriate measures with the objective of\nrestoring the democratically elected Government of\nPresident Kabbah.\u201d (S/PRST/1997/42, p. 1)\nAt the same time, we are asking the Security Council\nto assist ECOWAS and the ECOWAS Monitoring Group\n(ECOMOG) in giving practical effect to that objective. By\ndoing so, the Council will not only be saving the lives of\nthe people of Sierra Leone, but will also be averting an\nescalation of the crisis which now threatens peace and\nsecurity in our subregion. And here I should like to take\nthis opportunity to express, on behalf of my Government\nand the people of Sierra Leone, our sincere appreciation to\nthe Heads of State and the Committee of Foreign Ministers\nof ECOWAS for their efforts over the past four months in\npursuit of their objective, which the Security Council\nsupports.\nOnce the objective of restoring the democratically\nelected Government is achieved, my Government will, in\nthe same spirit of reconciliation which had guided its\npolicies since the 1996 elections, consider, in an\nappropriate forum, the serious question of security and\nfull implementation of the Abidjan Peace Agreement.\nSecurity is paramount. Without security, no meaningful\nhumanitarian assistance can reach the people of Sierra\nLeone.\nNotwithstanding the acts of bad faith initiated by the\nRUF to derail the peace process and despite the\ndangerous coalition which had emerged since the 25 May\ncoup, my Government, the legal Government of Sierra\nLeone, is committed to the Agreement. We are also\ncommitted to the Secretary-General\u2019s plan and\nrecommendations, submitted to the Security Council last\nJanuary, for the establishment and maintenance of a\npeacekeeping operation in Sierra Leone in connection\nwith the implementation of the Abidjan Peace Agreement.\nWe are ready to reactivate my Government\u2019s agenda\nfor reconciliation, resettlement of refugees and displaced\npersons, and rehabilitation and reconstruction which the\nmilitary-RUF junta so ruthlessly disrupted almost five\nmonths ago. We owe it to our people to continue the\ntransformation of our economy from emergency relief\nprogrammes to realistic projects for medium- and long-\nterm self-sufficiency. Of course, we know that this is not\ngoing to be easy. However, we are confident that the\nimmediate and unconditional restoration of my\nGovernment, the Government elected by the people,\nconstitutes the first step towards that transformation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to extend our thanks to the outgoing President,\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, and to congratulate him on the\nway in which he fulfilled his mandate. I would also like to\ncongratulate Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on his election and\nwish him complete success in his efforts to strengthen and\nincrease the effectiveness of the United Nations in these\nhistoric times, which more than ever demand our\napplication, perseverance, determination and good faith.\nMore than half a century has elapsed since the United\nNations was founded. When the United Nations was born,\nmankind wanted it to lead to the creation of a world of\njustice, law and peace. The United Nations was supposed\nto be able to defend human rights when they were violated\nand promote justice. By means of the United Nations,\nmankind aspired to put an end to an era of war and usher\nin an era of peace and tolerance, of respect for national\nsovereignty and people\u2019s freedom and of independence of\nStates; an era in which people would be free to fulfil their\ndreams and aspirations and to maintain their identity. Never\nin the course of human history have we needed the United\nNations more than we need it today, in this era of\ncommunications and contacts, when frontiers are\ndisappearing under the force of the technological revolution.\nThis is an era of demographic explosion and deadly,\ndestructive weapons; an era when the environment is no\nlonger capable of meeting mankind\u2019s demands.\nToday we are truly in need of a basic means of\ncontaining conflicts and resolving disputes. This is why\nwe must increase the effectiveness of the United Nations\nmechanism and renew confidence in its justice, credibility\nand effectiveness, the freedom of its decision-making\nprocesses from hegemony, and the absence of imbalances\nin its measured ways and in the enforcement of its\nresolutions so that no one remains above international\nlaw. These steps are essential if we want to prevent the\ncollapse of the United Nations, and if we want it to retain\nthe moral authority necessary to resolve disputes and\nremain an alternative to hot and deadly confrontations.\nTherefore, Lebanon enthusiastically supports the\nreform of United Nations institutions, particularly the\nSecurity Council. We call for enhancing the numerical\nand geographical balance of the Council so as to reflect\nchanged realities. The Council must also be reformed to\ndissipate the misgivings some have about the way it\nperforms its role.\nLebanon subscribes to the principle of rotation of the\npermanent seats in the Security Council. We reiterate our\nsupport for the position of the Arab Group, as expressed\nin the paper it presented on this subject.\nWe welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s proposals for\nthe reform of the United Nations. We have given them\nour full attention and are carefully studying them. We\nbelieve it is necessary to enhance the role of the General\nAssembly and to make the issue of development a high\npriority for the Organization, while attaching great\nimportance to the work of regional economic and social\ncommissions.\nUnder the rubric of reducing costs and the budget,\nmany United Nations agencies, in particular the United\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees\nin the Near East (UNRWA), have lost much of their\nability to adequately provide social, health and education\nservices to refugees in their host countries. This increases\nthe burden on host countries, Lebanon among them. It is\ndifficult for us to shoulder these responsibilities under\nthese conditions. The responsibility of the international\ncommunity in redressing the injustice inflicted on the\nPalestinian refugees must be made apparent. This bitter\nreality, which cannot be free of hidden intentions, aims at\ntimes at attempting to pressure these countries and force\nthem to assimilate the refugee population they are hosting.\n15\n\n\nThis would be a step towards liquidating the refugees\u2019 case\nfor return. It is also a means of pressuring the host\ncountries into accepting unacceptable political terms.\nThe international community, represented by the\nUnited Nations and the donor countries, is duty-bound to\ncontinue to render assistance to the Palestinian refugees\nawaiting a political resolution of their status in accordance\nwith the right to return, as decided upon by the United\nNations and, in particular, the principle of reuniting\nfamilies. This is one of the pillars of the peace process, and\nthus it is essential that the international community\npersevere until a solution is attained.\nWe had hoped that this session would be an occasion\nfor us to express our gratitude for the restoration of peace\nin Lebanon and the Middle East. This would have been an\nattestation to the success of the Madrid peace process,\nwhich was launched six years ago to which should be\nadded one year of preparation. This international peace\ninitiative began auspiciously. We believed in both its letter\nand its spirit because the initiative was international, the\nsponsorship was effective and the contents were based upon\nan equitable, just and permanent peace. We were very\nhopeful, because we thought that peace would be realized\non the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967),\n338 (1973) and 425 (1978), on the basis of the principle of\nland for peace and on the basis of finding a consensual\nsolution to the question of Jerusalem. The initiative was\nalso supposed to put an end to Israel\u2019s building and\nexpansion of settlements in the occupied territories and lead\nto the recognition of the political rights of the Palestinian\npeople. It was supposed to be followed by a discussion of\nregional arrangements to settle security, social and\neconomic questions, in particular the question of the\nPalestinian refugees, thereby paving the way for the\neconomic development of the region.\nWe entered into the peace process convinced that the\nbasic elements had been accepted at Madrid and that they\nhad become commitments of the participating States. We\nthought that all that remained for the delegations was to\nbegin negotiations on implementation. However, the advent\nof the present Israeli Government and its head totally\ndashed our hopes, given the practices of this new\nGovernment. The principle of land for peace was thrown\nout, to be replaced by a new formula. The Israeli\nGovernment reneged on the need for implementation of\ninternational decisions, and thus demanded their\nreinterpretation. That Government did not want to find a\nsolution to the question of Jerusalem, so it went ahead and\nannexed it. The Israeli Government reneged on its\ncommitments with regard to the occupied Syrian Golan,\nso it stressed its annexation. The Israeli Government\ndemolished the principle of halting settlement activities\nand vastly expanded their efforts at settlement.\nThe negotiated commitments of the previous\nGovernment were abandoned, as if there were no\ncontinuity from one Government to the next. Instead of\nmaking progress towards peace \u2014 the only worthwhile\nobjective \u2014 the Government devoted itself to destroying\nwhat had been done, even if the steps previously taken\nwere limited.\nInstead of being able to work towards a genuine\npeace, we have had to endure propaganda manoeuvres\naimed at numbing and misleading public opinion, along\nwith meetings that were designed just to give the\nimpression that a dialogue was continuing. Instead of\ntrying to find a solution to the basic conflict, the emphasis\nshifted to the normalization of relations through economic\nconferences \u2014 as a precondition, even before solving the\nlegal and political problem \u2014 instead of having\nnormalization occur naturally as a crowning of the basic\nsolution.\nFaced with heightened internal crisis, the Israeli\nGovernment resorted to stirring up tension along its\nborders and in areas under occupation, to divert attention\naway from the peace it had scuttled. Thus, the principle\nof provocation and confrontation was re-established in\norder to create unity internally.\nIsrael continued to carry out its acts of aggression\nagainst southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa, once\nwith the goal of mobilizing Israeli public opinion against\npeace, and another time for the purpose of emptying\ninternational initiatives of their political content.\nThe attacks continued, through artillery shelling, air\nraids, operations inside our territories \u2014 against villages\nand cities \u2014 against children, women, the elderly and\nhomes. Destruction and demolition continued, as did the\ndetention of Lebanese citizens in Israeli military camps \u2014\nall of this without the United Nations international\ninstitutions being allowed to visit them. They were not\npermitted the enjoyment of elementary human rights: the\nright to counsel and the right to a fair trial. Some of them\nwere returned to us as corpses, while others were tortured\nor maimed \u2014 and this in the era of respect for the rights\nof environment, of plants, and of animals.\n16\n\n\nNonetheless, the more the occupation endured, the\nmore Israel became increasingly bogged down in the\nquagmire of the south which became an inferno to it. The\noccupier has become a prisoner, and the aggressor a\nhostage in the face of a valiant people\u2019s steadfastness and\nthe resistance of its sons and daughters. Thus Israel\nsustained huge losses which is prompting it to rethink the\nviability and usefulness of its continued occupation of\nsouthern Lebanon.\nAgainst this reality, we heard, through misleading\nmedia reports, of an Israeli readiness to withdraw.\nWe have to bring the truth forth. Lebanon\u2019s firm\nstance has always been for a complete Israeli withdrawal to\ninternationally recognized borders so as to enable the\nLebanese State to exercise its sovereignty over its territories\nthrough its own forces. But Israel does not wish to\nwithdraw; it is still camouflaging its unwillingness to\nwithdraw completely by relocating or redeploying its forces.\nIt continues to cast a smoke screen by asking to maintain\ninspection and control posts, by imposing conditions that\nlimit the State\u2019s authority and by giving the upper hand to\nthe militias that it created. Furthermore, Israel is attempting\nto impose control over the Lebanese Army, which could be\ndeployed, as well as other conditions that challenge any\npresumed Lebanese sovereignty when withdrawal takes\nplace.\nI should like to pay tribute to our fallen heroes,\nmembers of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon\n(UNIFIL) \u2014 most recently four Italian soldiers and an Irish\nsergeant. Their blood was spilled in defence of southern\nLebanon, mixing with that of Lebanese citizens. I should\nalso like to pay tribute to the Force itself, whose\ncommanders and troops are discharging a difficult task\nunder the most difficult and most trying circumstances.\nNo sooner had the people of the region begun to adapt\nto the anticipated climate of peace than they were thrust\nback into an era of confrontation, violence and inevitable\ndefiance and resistance. Though development plans for the\nMiddle East region were being formulated, and the world\nmanifested interest in its peaceful future, caution and\npessimism began once again to prevail, and hopes were\ndashed. No sooner had the Government of Israel drawn\nstrength from the veto power used against Security Council\nresolutions on its settlement policies, it has continued to\nchallenge Council resolutions, thereby undermining\nwhatever is left of the peace process.\nThe international community, which stands to be\naffected by the situation in the region, either directly or\nindirectly, must hold the defiant accountable. The\ninternational community has not only the right but also\nthe duty to take action through the Organization of the\nUnited Nations. On many occasions, the United Nations\nhas delegated this question to others, hoping that a\nsolution could be found. It has consistently refrained from\nenforcing its resolutions, in contrast to its recent\nbehaviour vis-\u00e0-vis many other States.\nThe time has come for the United Nations to reclaim\nits role. The time has come to return to the basics of\npeace as agreed in Madrid, to the principle of land for\npeace, to the need to implement Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978), and\nto resume negotiations on all tracks from the point where\nthey stopped. The time has come for Israel immediately\nto cease all settlement activities; to resolve the status of\nthe city of Jerusalem; to withdraw from the Palestinian\nterritory and recognize the political rights of the\nPalestinian people; to withdraw from the Syrian Golan to\nthe line of 4 June 1967; to fully withdraw from southern\nLebanon and its western Bekaa to the internationally\nrecognized boundaries in order to enable the Lebanese\nState to exercise its authority, in accordance with Security\nCouncil resolution 425 (1978).\nOpting for a peace that ignores these fundamentals\nis a choice that is doomed to failure, a choice that could\nignite the entire region. An isolationist policy that\nseparates the various tracks would run counter to the\nprinciple of a comprehensive peace and will never\nachieve it. This is because the conflict is fundamentally\na comprehensive one. It has never been a conflict\nbetween one single Arab State and Israel, but has always\nbeen between the Arabs and Israel. As long as a single\ntrack is excluded from the solution, peace will remain\nimpossible. The tracks are all intertwined, which shows\nhow indivisible and interconnected the cause is. Nobody\nshould think that one track can survive, even for one\nhour, while other tracks remain excluded.\nBecause Lebanon is at the heart of the conflict, it\nhas suffered a great deal. Today, however, it is\nconfounding all forecasts and expectations that presaged\nits demise by proving to the world once again, as it has\ndone throughout its long and time-honoured history, that\nit is too strong to wither away, and that a right that is\nclaimed by its people will never disappear.\n17\n\n\nWhen southern Lebanon and western Bekaa are\nliberated, when Lebanese sovereignty extends to all its\nterritory, when the United Nations credibility is confirmed\nby the authority of its resolutions, when Israeli jails are\nemptied of their innocent detainees and resistance fighters,\nwhen an end is put to bloodshed which soaks our land, then\nand only then will the wound be healed. The tears will then\nstop and confidence will be restored to all in a genuine,\njust, permanent and comprehensive peace, a peace that can\nrestore to the land of civilizations, religions and cultures the\nplace it deserves now and in future, as it has always been\nthroughout its long history.\nThe choice of peace will not always be available to us.\nThe peace that the Assembly supported is in the throes of\ndeath today. If restoring peace seems difficult, its demise\nwould close the door to any attempt to rekindle the process\nin the foreseeable future, thus putting world peace in\njeopardy and sparking an uncontrollable conflagration,\nwhich will be difficult to contain.\nMay God guide the steps of those who are working for\na peace that is just and not unfair, equitable and not biased,\nconsensual and not imposed, a peace that honours the\nmemory of those martyred, that does justice to those who\nstruggle, and that would put an end to darkness in the land\nof the prophets and the messengers of God.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, on behalf of the Government of the\nKyrgyz Republic and its people, to congratulate my\ncolleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine,\nMr. Udovenko, on his election to the high office of\nPresident of the fifty-second session of the General\nAssembly, and to wish him success in his endeavours. May\nI also express our feelings of respect for his country, which\nis playing an important role in resolving regional and global\nissues.\nI would also like to express our heartfelt gratitude to\nthe previous President of the General Assembly, the\nrepresentative of the friendly Malaysian people,\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, for his active and dynamic\nefforts in establishing constructive dialogue on ways to\nreform the United Nations.\nLike the entire international community, Kyrgyzstan\nexpects genuine progress regarding the complex issue of\nthe reform of the United Nations to come out of the\npresent session. We are confident that the session will be\nable to cope with the problems facing the Organization\ntoday during this difficult and complicated period. The\nPresident and the Government of my country fully\nsupport the efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, to enhance the efficiency of the United Nations,\nand his ability to respond sensitively and adequately to\nthe challenges of a rapidly changing world. We are\nconfident that a renewed United Nations will truly\nembody the principles and purposes proclaimed in its\nCharter, ensuring the harmony of the interests of all its\nMembers in the name of peace and progress. We are\nready to support all proposals that promote that goal.\nRegarding the reform of the Security Council, the\nissue of improving its methods of work is no less\nimportant than the question of enlarging its membership.\nKyrgyzstan believes that these questions must be\nconsidered together. We continue to support the proposal\nfor permanent membership in the Council for Japan and\nGermany. However, in our view, the permanent members\nof the Security Council should also include one\nrepresentative each from Africa, Asia and Latin America.\nMankind is now on the eve of a new millennium,\nand the changes taking place are altering the image of\nmankind and shifting the emphasis in the models for\nunderstanding and explaining our world. The collapse of\na bipolar world has provided us an opportunity to focus\nefforts on resolving the issues of poverty, health care,\neducation, economic development and democracy. We are\nall, however, still facing the threat of local and regional\nconflicts, international terrorism, organized crime, illegal\ntrafficking in drugs and weapons, the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction and the deterioration of the\nstate of the environment. All these negative aspects of\nhuman activity threaten the global trend towards\nstrengthening peace and progress, undermine the fragile\nnew democracies, wear down the strength of the\ndeveloping countries and generally threaten all our efforts\nfocused on building a safer and better world.\nThe period after the achievement of independence\nwas decisive for Kyrgyzstan, in the context of the\nformation of national statehood and of new social and\neconomic ties. The country is actively seeking ways and\nmeans to harmoniously integrate itself into the\ninternational community. Clear successes have already\nbeen achieved on this thorny path in strengthening\n10\n\n\ndemocratic institutions, radical reform of the economy of\nthe country, improving the means for achieving inter-ethnic\nagreement, enhancing tolerance and ensuring human rights.\nThe leadership of the country is also concentrating on\nthose domestic and international issues which must be\ndeveloped on a permanent and positive basis for the well-\nbeing of the population of Kyrgyzstan.\nOur country was the first of the newly independent\nStates to draw up and adopt a national plan of action for\nenvironmental protection. In the light of the implementation\nof the decisions of the Rio Conference, Kyrgyzstan is now\ncarrying out a country project, Capacity 21, which consists\nof three major components: coordination of and carrying\nout ecological studies, stable management of water\nresources and economic growth and social development.\nThrough an edict of President Akayev, a national strategy\nhas been adopted for sustainable human development which\nrecognizes man, and his harmonious existence with nature,\nas the highest priority. Kyrgyzstan was the first country in\nthe region to draw up a \u201cconcept for ecological security\u201d.\nThe Declaration adopted by the conference in Rio\nranks mountainous ecological systems among those\nparticularly vulnerable to natural and man-made impacts. It\nis universally recognized that peoples living in mountainous\nregions bear far heavier social and economic burdens than\nthose who live in plains.\nIn the light of these factors and circumstances and also\non the basis of the decisions of the Global Environment\nFacility, our country held an international conference on\nproblems of mountain ecosystems. The participants in the\nconference put forward a proposal to proclaim an\ninternational year of the mountains, a proposal which was\nactively supported by President Akayev in his message to\nthe delegates to the mountain forum and in his letter to the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations.\nAt the regular session of the Economic and Social\nCouncil in July this year, in Geneva, a resolution\nproclaiming International Year of Mountains, sponsored by\n44 countries, was adopted by consensus. The resolution\ncontains a request to the Secretary-General to present to the\nregular session of the Economic and Social Council in\n1998, after consultations with Governments and with the\nrelevant international, regional and non-governmental\norganizations, a report on the desirability of proclaiming the\nInternational Year of Mountains and other measures to\nensure the sustainable development of mountainous\ncountries.\nI would like to take this opportunity to appeal to\nGovernments and, above all, to the other sponsors to\nsubmit the relevant information for incorporation into a\ncomplete and comprehensive report on this question by\nthe Secretary-General. I hope the General Assembly will\nin turn adopt a consensus decision on this initiative.\nAt the same time, we believe that it is possible, with\nsupport from Governments, to raise the question of\ndrawing up a global programme of action to ensure the\nsustainable development of countries with mountainous\nregions, similar to the programme being carried out for\nsmall island developing countries.\nThere can be no doubt that the economic gap\nbetween the rich developed countries and the developing\nworld has widened over recent years. The poorest\ncountries are not in a position to take off economically or\nsocially and are continuing to lose the ties that enable\nthem to participate in the world economy. We can assume\nthat if this trend continues, their numbers will continue to\ngrow, and this represents a serious threat to all human\ndevelopment. We need to halt that trend. In this context,\nin the view of the experts, the most promising approaches\nare to increase investments in human resources to\nencourage the implementation of ecologically clean and\neffective technologies and to reform price structures.\nIn our view, it is precisely in these areas that United\nNations activities, in new conditions, should be stepped\nup in order to promote economic and social progress. We\nsupport the efforts of the Secretary-General to promote\nstable and sustainable development.\nSupporting peace and security is the highest priority\ntask of the United Nations. We place great store by the\nUnited Nations peacekeeping activities and pay due\ntribute to the courage and selflessness of United Nations\npersonnel working in regions of conflict. The efforts of\nthe United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan,\nheaded by the Special Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Gerd Merrem, and the Collective\nPeacekeeping Forces of the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States (CIS), culminated successfully in\nMoscow on 27 June 1997 with the signing of the General\nAgreement on the Establishment of Peace and National\nAccord in Tajikistan, which opened the way for the\ncountry\u2019s transition from war to reconstruction and\nrehabilitation.\nAs a representative of one of the States that is a\nguarantor of peace in Tajikistan, I am gratified to note my\n11\n\n\ncountry\u2019s involvement in this event. The mediation efforts\nof Kyrgyzstan, and of President Akayev himself, helped\nbring about the important agreement in May this year that\nlaid the way for the General Agreement, namely, the\nsigning of the Protocol on Political Questions. However, as\nthe events in August demonstrated, peace in Tajikistan is\nstill extremely fragile and its survival depends, first and\nforemost, on the Tajik parties themselves and how faithful\nthey are to the commitments they have made. We are\nconvinced that our Tajik friends will be able to see this\nthrough.\nThe prospects for peace-building in Tajikistan depend\nto a significant extent on the situation along the Tajik-\nAfghan border. The armed conflict in Afghanistan is of the\ngreatest concern to the States of the Central Asian region;\nit fosters the illegal production and trafficking of drugs and\nis prompting the massive flow of refugees to neighbouring\ncountries. The President and Government of Kyrgyzstan are\nfirmly convinced that there can be only one solution to the\nAfghan conflict, namely, a political solution. The problem\ncan be solved with the political will of the Afghan parties\nabove all and assistance from neighbouring States that have\nan influence in the region.\nWe have not abandoned hope regarding the\norganization of direct inter-Afghan negotiations under the\nauspices of the United Nations to discuss conditions for a\nceasefire and subsequent measures to bring about national\nreconciliation. In November 1996, President Akayev put\nforward an initiative to hold these negotiations in Bishkek.\nSubsequently, this proposal was repeated at meetings in\nNew York of top officials and experts on Afghanistan.\nBuilding on this initiative, in August the President of\nKyrgyzstan appealed to the parties to the conflict and Heads\nof State and Government concerned.\nKyrgyzstan, which does not share a border with\nAfghanistan and has no interest aside from ensuring\nregional security, considers the organization of inter-Afghan\nnegotiations under United Nations auspices an integral part\nof its peaceful policy of good-neighbourly relations and\ncooperation. Kyrgyzstan is ready to play the impartial role\nof mediator and make its good offices available to ensure\na peaceful settlement of this problem.\nPursuant to its peaceful policy, Kyrgyzstan has been\nactively promoting in the United Nations since 1995 the\nidea of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central\nAsia, as reflected in a number of working papers of the\n1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,\nthe Preparatory Committee of the Conference of Parties\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons to be held in the year 2000 and the\nDisarmament Commission. We are firmly convinced that\nthe creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones, which is an\nimportant confidence-building measure and a positive\nbackdrop to the disarmament process, is helping\nstrengthen peace and security in the region and, in the\nfinal analysis, throughout the world.\nWith the entry into force of the Treaties of Pelindaba\nand Bangkok, more than 1.7 billion people will be living\nin zones free of nuclear weapons. Together with\nAntarctica, this territory will cover practically the entire\nsouthern hemisphere. It is essential that we do all we can\nto support and promote the establishment of nuclear-\nweapon-free zones. Here, above all, we are hoping for the\nunderstanding and support of nuclear-weapon States. At\nthe international conference this September on the\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, held in\nTashkent, Kyrgyzstan proposed the convening of an\nadvisory meeting of the five Central Asian States, the five\nnuclear-weapon States that are permanent members of the\nSecurity Council, and representatives of the United\nNations to discuss practical measures to make this idea a\nreality. The conference approved the proposal.\nKyrgyzstan is actively participating in peacekeeping\nactivities. The Collective Peacekeeping Forces of CIS in\nTajikistan includes one of our battalions. Kyrgyz military\npersonnel in the Central Asian peacekeeping battalion\ntook part in the joint exercises held within the framework\nof the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\nprogramme Partnership for Peace. Kyrgyzstan is also a\nmember of the United Nations Special Committee on\nPeacekeeping Operations. We are also interested in\ntraining an international peace force, military observers\nand civilian personnel so that they can participate in\npeacekeeping operations. I would like to take advantage\nof this opportunity to ask the United Nations and the\ndonor countries to give us as much assistance as possible\nin this area.\nIn conclusion, I should like to say that this is a\ndecisive session for the United Nations. I should like to\nexpress the hope that the interests of individual countries\nand regions can be reconciled and that they will not\nprevail over responsibility for the fate of our common\nOrganization. On this positive note, I should like to end\nmy statement.\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We are in\ngood hands as we begin our work during what the\nSecretary-General has called \u201cthe reform Assembly.\u201d\nI know, too, that my Foreign Minister, on whose\nbehalf I am speaking, would want to warmly congratulate\nthe outgoing President, Ambassador Razali Ismail of\nMalaysia, on his efforts during the past 12 months. It has\nbeen a challenging time, and he has demonstrated the\ndecisive leadership we all expected of him.\nTwo years ago, at the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations, world leaders undertook to give the twenty-\nfirst century an Organization equipped, financed and\nstructured to serve effectively the peoples in whose name\nit was established. With the year 2000 now only 27 months\naway, we are still far from that goal. This is a matter of\ngreat concern to New Zealand. We firmly believe in the\nUnited Nations as a vehicle to a better life for the world's\ncitizens, and not just for those who live now. We have a\nresponsibility to strengthen the Organization for our\ngrandchildren and beyond. We must not let them and\nourselves down by allowing an unreformed United Nations\nto slide into increasing irrelevance.\nWe do not pretend the process of reform is easy or\nfinite. As the Secretary-General has said, \u201cReform is not an\nevent; it is a process.\u201d [A/51/950, para. 25] Our own in\nvolvement on the intergovernmental track, including co-\nchairing the Working Group on the Strengthening of the\nUnited Nations System and the Working Group on an\nAgenda for Development, has given us a good appreciation\nof the complexities involved in producing positive outcomes\nacceptable to 185 Member States.\nWe know the Secretary-General faces the same\nissues with his 16 July package. As with any package, it\nis inevitable that some Member States will find fault with\nindividual elements. But we are firmly of the belief that\nthe package should be viewed as a whole. This will be\nfor the greater good of the Organization. Difficulties with\nindividual elements of the package should not be allowed\nto unpick the overall good which is in it. We appeal to\nMember States to acknowledge this reality and to give the\nSecretary-General their generous support. It is small\ncountries like New Zealand, and developing countries,\nwhich, as we see it, stand most to benefit from what the\nSecretary-General is trying to achieve.\nTo reform and strengthen the United Nations\neffectively, we see a need to redistribute resources away\nfrom administration and into areas which are important\nfor those of us who place a high priority on the United\nNations itself. We support efficiencies, not cost-cutting.\nThe crucial difference between the two is that one\napproach seeks simply to save money without regard to\nthe impact on the Organization. We cannot support this.\nThe United Nations is too important to us to allow such\na downgrading.\nAn approach based on efficiencies allows us to\nreinvigorate the United Nations by reinvesting the money\nsaved from outdated administrative practices. This is\ncentral to the Secretary-General's package. In particular,\nthe proposal for a \u201cdevelopment dividend\u201d channelling\nresources freed by administrative efficiencies into\nstrengthening the development activities of the United\nNations is most welcome. We can certify from our own\nnational experience that the sort of management reforms\nproposed in the package do indeed lead to a reduction in\nadministrative overheads, allowing more to be delivered\nin terms of substantive programmes.\nAt a time when development funds are diminishing,\nthe significance of this step should not be lost. New\nZealand is a country that is increasing its overseas aid \u2014\nby 40 per cent since the 1992 United Nations Conference\non Environment and Development, the Rio Summit. Our\ncontributions through the United Nations system have also\nincreased by nearly 50 per cent over the last five years.\nBut the global trend is the opposite, particularly among\nthe larger traditional donors. It is becoming harder and\nharder for Governments to meet their Charter commitment\nto promote the economic and social advancement of all\npeoples. One of the modest outcomes of the last two\nyears of reform efforts within the United Nations has\nbeen the elaboration of an Agenda for Development\n19\n\n\nreaffirming the primacy of development, setting objectives\nand recommending ways of achieving them. But, with the\nbest will in the world, implementing that Agenda will come\nto naught in the absence of adequate funding.\nThe Secretary-General's reforms are designed to\ndeliver more for development. Equally important, they are\ndesigned to boost confidence in the United Nations,\nconfidence which two weeks ago was given tangible form\nby Mr. Ted Turner's billion-dollar grant to assist United\nNations agencies in key development activities. That\ngenerous offer has given the Organization a real boost and\ncould be a catalyst for leveraging further private-sector\nfunds for development. We must support the Secretary-\nGeneral's efforts to make the United Nations the best\nvehicle for delivering such assistance.\nMember States need to trust the Secretary-General to\nfulfil his responsibilities under the Charter: to give effect to\nthe policy directions which they set. We need to be clear\nand realistic in the priorities we set for the United Nations.\nWe cannot mandate the Organization with more and more\nnew tasks and somehow expect these to be achieved within\ncurrent resources. And, having set the priorities, we must\nresist the temptation to micro-manage. This will involve a\nsea-change in the way Member States have become\naccustomed to operating. The Fifth Committee still makes\ndecisions about staff numbers and placement within the\nSecretariat, administrative decisions that in any modern\norganization would be the responsibility of its managers.\nWe know that the transitional process of change will\nnot be easy for those working in the Secretariat either.\nBut \u2014 and we are conscious of our own experience in New\nZealand in instituting public-sector reform \u2014 the\nmanagerial and results-based budgeting proposals in the\nJuly package will improve work performance and will\ndeliver greater job satisfaction to those working for the\nUnited Nations. The Organization's most important resource\nis its people. The package recognizes the vital importance\nof investment in staff. If the best and brightest are to be\nattracted to and retained by the United Nations, they must\nbe recruited, trained, promoted and paid according to\nprocedures which are as good as the best employed by\nMember States.\nIt is also important to stress here the loyalty owed to\nthe Secretary-General by those who work for him. He has\nthe right to expect their full support for his leadership and\nfor the initiatives he puts forward. Anything less would be\ndishonourable, would subvert due process and would\npotentially disenfranchise Member States. It could not be\ntolerated.\nI referred earlier to the intergovernmental track. It is\nworth touching on the key issues of Security Council and\nfinancial reform.\nOn the former, New Zealand will judge specific\nproposals for enlargement of the Security Council by the\nyardstick of democracy and the representativeness of the\ninstitution as a whole. Increasing the proportion of\npermanent to non-permanent members runs counter to this\nprinciple. Nor could a package on Security Council\nreform be acceptable to us without substantive proposals\nopening up and modernizing the workings of the Council.\nSunshine, an American jurist once observed, is the best\ndisinfectant. Member States must continue to participate\nin the debate in the search for a consensus solution.\nOn financial reform, New Zealand is strongly\nconcerned about the crisis facing the United Nations. It is\ntrue that there are problems with the scales of assessments\nfor both the regular and the peacekeeping budgets. The\npresent floor has a negative impact on smaller, vulnerable\nnations, such as the South Pacific island countries, New\nZealand's neighbours. This is just one example of the kind\nof problem that needs to be addressed.\nBut those who want to see changes made to the\nscale need to offer genuine inducements, not threats. We\ncannot accept that any Member State is entitled to\nwithhold payments unilaterally or that the assessment of\nthose countries that will not pay their dues should be\npicked up by others. All assessed contributions must be\npaid in full, on time and unconditionally. It is a violation\nof international legal obligations to do otherwise. This\nmust be regarded with the utmost seriousness by Member\nStates. It undermines the Organization's ability to operate.\nIt penalizes, through damage to the Organization, those\nMember States that abide by their obligations. When the\nState responsible for the largest percentage of arrears\nowed to the United Nations is also the richest, and when\nthat State in addition attaches conditions to the payment\nof only a portion of what it owes, it is understandable that\nthese actions should generate real scepticism in this\nAssembly.\nThis sorry state of affairs must be resolved quickly.\nBut it can be resolved only on the basis of a credible\ncommitment that all conditions will be eliminated now\nand that all payments will be made on time. And that\nmeans in January each year.\n20\n\n\nI would like to raise another reform issue which has\nnot featured prominently in discussions to date, namely\nUnited Nations regional groupings. It seems to us that this\nis an issue that deserves examination. The groupings are in\nneed of revision to bring them up to date with present-day\ngeopolitical realities. It is anomalous, for example, that our\nPacific island neighbours, members with us of the South\nPacific Forum grouping, belong to the Asian Group while,\nfor historical reasons, New Zealand belongs to the Group\nof Western European and Other States. The fundamental\nimportance we accord our membership of the institutions of\nthe South Pacific Forum, of the Asia-Pacific Economic\nCooperation Council and of the Regional Forum of the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), and our\nrelationship with ASEAN itself, should be able to be better\nreflected in the regional groupings. We accordingly see\nvalue in a reconfiguration of New York electoral groupings\nto bring them more in line with those used elsewhere in the\nUnited Nations system, where New Zealand in most cases\nsits with our South Pacific partners and our East Asian\nneighbours.\nDevelopments in other regions will result in further\nanomalies in the present structure. We see at a future stage\nsome long and complex negotiations over regional seat\nallocations for a revised system of regional groups. New\nZealand of course will join with others in negotiating new\nand equitable allocations of seats. While we look forward\nto the outcome of that process, we realize that it will not\ncome overnight. In the meantime, and as a matter of high\npriority, my delegation is working to forge a closer\nrelationship with the Asian regional group in New York.\nI would like to close my statement by focusing once\nmore on the utmost importance of Member States' giving\npositive endorsement to the Secretary-General's package at\nthis General Assembly, as New Zealand will be doing \u2014\nnot only because it provides a positive and concrete start to\na reform process, but also because the alternative of not\nsupporting the Secretary-General will, in our view,\nseriously undermine the credibility of the United Nations.\nFor two years the United Nations has been involved in\nthe current reform exercise. But none of us can pretend that\nreform is an end in itself, or that introspection is an\nongoing excuse for inaction. The United Nations exists to\ndeliver concrete, substantive assistance to the hundreds of\nmillions most in need. No amount of self-analysis is a\nsubstitute for that. Moreover, sustained emphasis on\nintrospection will erode the Organization's capacity, and\npossibly also its will, to perform the tasks for which it was\ncreated.\nThe challenge now is to embrace the bold\nprogramme of reform outlined by the Secretary-General,\nto use this General Assembly to begin to implement it,\nand then to direct our energy where it rightly belongs, to\ntaking practical steps to reduce suffering and build a\nbetter and more peaceful world: like drawing up a solid,\npractical programme for alleviating poverty in the coming\ndecade; like establishing an international criminal court\nwhich will ensure that individuals are held responsible for\nwar crimes; like supporting and enhancing the United\nNations capability for preventive diplomacy; and like\ninvigorating the United Nations capacity for\npeacekeeping.\nThese are the standards by which the real success or\nfailure of the United Nations will be judged. New Zealand\nis determined that the verdict will be a positive one.\nWorking together, we can ensure that it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr.\nPresident, to you and your friendly country, I am pleased\nto extend my warmest congratulations on your election to\nthe presidency of this session of the General Assembly.\nYour expertise on United Nations and world issues will\nundoubtedly assist you in wisely discharging the work of\nthe General Assembly.\nAt the same time, I wish to express our appreciation\nto your predecessor for the efforts he exerted in connection\nwith the discussions relating to United Nations reform.\nThe world is currently passing through highly\ninterwoven and complicated circumstances, where progress\nand its horizons mingle with backwardness and its dangers\nwhile humanity takes pride in such achievements as\neconomic progress and the development of technology and\ninformatics, it is still suffering from the practices of\nterrorism, drug trafficking, organized crime, the spread of\ncorruption, the overflow of refugees, the challenges posed\nby war criminals, crimes of genocide and mass murder, and\nthe negative effects of racism and religious discrimination.\nAll this gives rise to a situation which requires the\ninternational community to cooperate and become\ninterdependent in its endeavours in a manner that helps it\nlive in security and to progress confidently. This cannot\ntake place unless the United Nations become the focal point\nand the centre of its concerted actions.\nThis prompts us to accord priority in Egypt's statement\nto this session to the issue of United Nations reform. The\noutcome of this session, and probably subsequent sessions\nwill constitute a true litmus test of the credibility of\ndetermination and the objectivity of resolve regarding the\npresent and the future of the United Nations.\nEvolution of the United Nations relies on a number of\nfacts and requisites. The principles of democratization and\nmultilateralism are widespread, market economy\nmechanisms are growing, and scientific progress and\ninformation technology are accelerating. This necessitates\nreaching agreement on and drafting new rules for\ninternational conduct.\nIt has been shown that the end of the cold war in no\nway sufficiently guarantees the non-eruption of conflicts,\ntragedies and wars. By the same token, the risks\nemanating from the outbreak of rampant international\nconfrontations have not disappeared. The root causes of\nnational and international disputes still persist. On the\nother hand, weapons of mass destruction are readily\navailable and are even on the rise. In addition to the\nabsence of any substantial progress in the field of nuclear\ndisarmament, there exist clandestine military nuclear\nprogrammes not subject to any international supervision\nin strategically sensitive areas such as the Middle East\nregion.\nWhile globalization is a rapidly growing\nphenomenon, and given its impact on the security and\nprosperity of various societies, national legislation and\nregulations are finding it difficult to cope with this\nphenomenon and to regulate international relations\naccordingly. Most of the developing countries do not\npossess the same capacity as the developed ones to\nspeedily effect the necessary psychological, cultural and\nlegislative adjustments. Therefore, the United Nations\nrepresents the proper mechanism for the formulation of an\ninternational consensus on the rules governing all these\ndevelopments, and the provision of necessary assistance\nto the developing countries to meet and regulate their\nrequirements.\nWhile we agree on the need to change the United\nNations and increase its effectiveness, we might not be as\nagreed on the means to achieve that objective. In this\ncontext, I wish to state Egypt's view of the main\nprinciples and points on which the United Nations reform\nprocess should be based, in addition to a preliminary\ncomment on some of the Secretary-General's recent\nproposals in this respect.\nIt is important that the United Nations reform take\nplace in conformity with the purposes and principles\nenshrined in the Charter and the mandates accorded to\neach of the United Nations principal organs. The General\nAssembly, representing the general membership of the\nUnited Nations, has to adopt clear decisions which reflect\nthe general consensus with regard to the proposals\n13\n\n\ncontained in the Secretary-General's report. Such consensus\nshould be built through serious intergovernmental dialogue\ncharacterized by maximum transparency and sense of\nresponsibility.\nWe concur with the Secretary-General's position that\nreforming the United Nations administrative machinery is\nnot a substitute for the political will of the Member States\nto enhance the role of the Organization. Thus, the first step\ntowards reform is the formation of a clear collective will to\nstrengthen the United Nations system through a\ncomprehensive approach in the interest of all.\nWhile we would generally welcome merging\ndepartments with similar activities as well as slashing a\nnumber of posts if the General Assembly so decides, we\nwish to stress that rationalizing expenditures must not be\ndone at the expense of efficient performance.\nAdministrative reform should not diminish the\nOrganization's capacity to fully implement the programmes\nadopted by the Member States. Nor should it adversely\naffect the equitable geographic distribution in the\ncomposition of the Secretariat.\nWe are also in agreement with the Secretary-General's\ndiagnosis of the real threat facing the United Nations,\nnamely the non-payment by some major Powers of their\nassessed contributions, be they to the regular budget or to\nthe budget of peacekeeping operations. Since these arrears\nare part of the Member States' obligations under the\nCharter, their payment should be made in full, immediately\nand without conditions. Any attempt to make payment\nconditional will only complicate the entire reform process.\nThe sharp and steady decline in the resources allocated\nto development, coupled with the absence of enthusiasm on\nthe part of some for the fulfilment of their obligations, have\nnegatively affected the implementation of many\nprogrammes adopted by Member States. This impels us to\nreview the funding modalities of the United Nations\noperational activities for development so as to ensure their\neffective performance.\nWe concur with the Secretary-General on the\nimportance of achieving the system-wide integration of\nUnited Nations programmes that deal with development.\nWe still look forward to hearing concrete ideas on how to\nachieve more comprehensive coordination throughout the\nUnited Nations system as well as on how to decentralize\nthe working methods of the regional economic\ncommissions. These commissions play a cardinal role in\nimplementing the Organization's priorities, such as\npoverty eradication.\nLastly, some of the other measures proposed by the\nSecretary-General, particularly those relating to how to\naddress the financial crisis, should be studied further with\na view to reaching arrangements which would enjoy\ngeneral consensus and help overcome this crisis.\nTherefore, we invite the General Assembly to study\nthe important proposals made by the Secretary-General.\nThe Assembly should then come up with\nrecommendations that clarify the Member States'\naspirations and the modalities of implementing their\nspecified priorities in the medium-term plan, together with\nmeans of promoting the vital role of the Organization in\nthe coming decades.\nIn the course of reforming the United Nations, the\nSecretary-General touched upon the elaboration of a new\nconcept and structure of the Trusteeship Council. This is\na matter that requires extensive discussion and study to\nclarify the impact and dimensions of the proposed\nconcept, as it is totally different from the current mandate\nof the Council. Besides, it is imperative to discuss the\nsignificance of, and the need to put under collective\ntrusteeship, topics set forth by the world community in\nwell-established international agreements that express the\nwill of the international community as a whole. Under\nthose agreements, mechanisms and organs have already\nbeen set up to oversee their implementation.\nAlso, within the context of changing the role of the\nOrganization, we note that the Secretary-General's\nproposals entrust the United Nations High Commissioner\nfor Human Rights with many additional responsibilities\nand competencies at the expense of the functions\nentrusted to the Centre for Human Rights. In our view,\nthis is not in line with what is important in the\nmanagement of the human rights field. Here we recall\nsome recent sagacious appeals for updating the approach\nand legislation of the international community in the field\nof human rights in order to better reflect the diverse\ncontributions of various cultures and civilizations in our\ncontemporary world to the promotion and enrichment of\nthese rights and the protection of the freedom of\nindividuals and societies. Although some political\nconsiderations stood in the way of including the valuable\ncontributions of some of those cultures and civilizations\nin the main human rights instruments \u2014 foremost among\nwhich is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \u2014\nthese sagacious appeals reflect the desire to enhance the\n14\n\n\ncontribution of various world cultures in the protection of\nhuman rights. Such enhanced and diverse contributions, in\nthe framework of a world consensus, could spare the\ninternational community any accusation of negligence,\ndouble standards or bias towards a single cultural concept.\nIn the field of disarmament, I should point out that for\n50 years, the United Nations has given due regard to\ndisarmament issues. It has given high priority to matters\nrelating to weapons of mass destruction in general and\nnuclear weapons in particular. A consensus on this high\npriority emerged in the first special session of the General\nAssembly devoted to disarmament and has been reiterated\never since. Egypt remains faithful to this high priority.\nI now turn to the Security Council. Past Assembly\nsessions, especially the fifty-first, witnessed protracted\ndebates on the reform and restructuring of the Security\nCouncil. Undoubtedly, reaching agreement on this issue is\none of the main pillars on which reform of the United\nNations must be built.\nIn this regard, Egypt reiterates its emphasis on and\ncommitment to the key principles adopted at the ministerial\nmeeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in New Delhi, as\nwell as the elements adopted by the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) Summit in Harare in connection with the\nCouncil's enlargement and the need for full conformity with\nthe relevant provisions of the Charter.\nTherefore, first, there should be no partial or selective\nexpansion or enlargement of the membership of the\nSecurity Council. Secondly, efforts at restructuring the\nCouncil should not be subject to any imposed time-frame.\nWhile recognizing the importance of treating this issue as\na matter of urgent attention, no effort should be made to\ndecide this issue before general agreement is reached.\nThirdly, efforts should be made to rationalize the exercise\nof the veto. Fourthly, the improvement of the working\nmethods of the Council should be given equal importance.\nFifthly, any resolution with possible Charter-amendment\nimplications as to the size, the composition or the allocation\nof the Council seats must be adopted in strict conformity\nwith the provisions of Article 108 of the Charter. Sixthly,\nit is important to study the principle of rotation and to agree\nupon the eligibility criteria for it in connection with the\nproposed expansion in the permanent-membership category.\nSuch an agreement could help avoid the divisions and feuds\nthat have begun to surface. Lastly, if there is no agreement\non the expansion of permanent membership, expansion\nshould be limited to the non-permanent category.\nAs to eligibility of States for permanent membership\nin the Security Council, and with a view to our\ncommitment to what will be agreed upon within the OAU\nin connection with a system of rotation, we propose that\nthe criteria for eligibility should include the degree of\npresent and future economic development, historical\nweight, geographic location and size of population. They\nshould also give due regard to the role played by a\ncountry in the maintenance of global and regional peace\nand security, including its ability to contribute to\npeacekeeping operations. Further, similar regard should be\ngiven to such a country's endeavours to preserve the\ninterests of the region to which it belongs.\nEgypt's regional and international contributions\nwithin the framework of Africa, the Arab and Islamic\nworlds and the Middle East region, as well as among the\ndeveloping countries and emerging economies,\nundoubtedly qualify it to shoulder the responsibilities of\npermanent membership in a new, expanded Security\nCouncil providing balanced and equitable representation.\nHowever, Egypt will remain committed to the African\nconsensus in this regard. I listened carefully to the\nstatement made by the Foreign Minister of Singapore, and\nI suggest that the points he raised should be studied and\ngiven due attention by the General Assembly and the\ncommittees working in the field of the reform and\nexpansion of the Security Council.\nThe non-aligned countries called for a\nreconsideration of the veto power, which contradicts the\nprinciples of democracy that must characterize\ncontemporary world order and prevail both among and\nwithin States. As a first step towards that goal, we\nsuggest that the use and scope of the veto power should\nbe restricted to specific actions such as those which relate\nto threats to international peace and security and which\nare taken under Chapter VII of the Charter. We can also\nagree on excluding specific matters from the use of veto\npower, such as provision to the Council of the\ninformation necessary for exercising its competence;\nhumanitarian issues, including respect for instruments of\ninternational humanitarian law and ceasefire resolutions;\nand the selection of the United Nations Secretary-General.\nSecurity Council reform and the improvement of its\nworking methods require a re-evaluation of the sanctions\nregimes imposed by the Council, including their routine\nperiodic review, their lifting and whether the regime in its\ncurrent form achieves the goals for which it was\ninstituted. If sanctions are intended to influence the\nbehaviour of certain States so that they abide by\n15\n\n\ninternational legality, it would be only logical to amend the\nway these sanctions are currently implemented in order to\ntake into account the related humanitarian aspects and the\nsufferings inflicted upon the peoples. And after compliance,\nthese sanctions must be lifted.\nIn all cases, it is important to consider setting specific\ntime-frames for sanctions so that they do not end up being,\nin effect, a people's punishment. Discussions in this respect\nunder \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d and the initial agreement\nreached thereon can be a viable basis for starting serious\ndeliberations with a view to effecting positive changes in\nthe current sanctions regime.\nI turn now to the situation in the Middle East, where\nthe peace process faces a serious crisis. The most apparent\nmanifestation of this crisis is that the concept, principles\nand bases of the peace process are being completely\nshattered and squandered. The vision spawned in the\npeoples' minds of the sort of peace, as agreed upon at the\nUnited Nations and in Madrid, has started to dissipate.\nTrust has been replaced by doubt, and hope by frustration\nand despair in a tomorrow where justice will materialize\nand peace will prevail.\nThe peace process is based on governing principles,\nnamely the implementation of Security Council resolutions\n242 (1967) and 338 (1973). At the heart of these principles\nare the land-for-peace formula and safeguarding the rights\nof the parties according to the balance struck by the\nSecurity Council and affirmed at the Madrid Peace\nConference. This certainly applies to the three tracks of\nnegotiations between Israel on the one hand and Syria,\nLebanon and the Palestinians on the other. The Oslo accord\ndid not deviate from the same principles, nor did it\nchallenge their terms of reference or binding nature. On the\ncontrary, it led to the recognition that the Palestinian people\nare a people with legitimate national and political rights.\nIt also recognized that the only way to establish peace\nand security in the region is through peaceful coexistence\nbetween the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, based on\nequality, justice, and, of course, Israel's withdrawal from\nthe occupied Arab territories and the establishment of\nnormal relations between the States in the Middle East.\nThese principles and concepts gave rise to a process\nof building bases for peace and its possibilities. In spite of\nthe obstacles and the problems which confronted the\nprocess of negotiations, the credibility of the search for a\npeaceful solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict still existed.\nThis quest for peace had become a strategic choice\ncharacterizing the policies and orientations of the region's\nGovernments, impelling the peoples of the region to\nenvision a future Middle East under a just and\ncomprehensive peace. Various methods and mechanisms\nfor cooperation which would enable the region to achieve\nthe requisite levels of development and progress were\ndiscussed. Despite the frequent diversity of views and\ntheir conflicting nature at certain times, that trend\nrepresented a healthy phenomenon: it indicated that the\npeoples of the region are already convinced of the peace\nconcept. The only thing that remained was how to\nreinvigorate the method of achieving it.\nAlas, confidence was lost, credibility was shaken and\nthe peace process lost much of its momentum. For this,\nand for the present serious situation, the current Israeli\nGovernment' policy is responsible. Settlement activities,\nas well as Israel's reneging on agreements and\ncommitments reached; making a mockery of legal\naccords; challenging the two sponsors of the peace\nprocess; pushing for confrontation; and giving rise to an\noverall feeling of despair could not but result in\nfrustration and destruction. This will lead to a catastrophe\nwhose responsibility, we hasten to underline here and\nnow, lies squarely with the current Israeli policies.\nThis serious crisis inflicted on the peace process by\nthe Israeli policies was recently considered by the Council\nof Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the States members of\nthe League of Arab States. The Council adopted the\nfollowing points, which constitute a unified Arab position\non the current situation.\nThe first point is a rejection of the Israeli\nGovernment policies designed to undermine the peace\nprocess, its denial of the principles and bases of this\nprocess, its evasion of the implementation of the\ncommitments, undertakings and agreements reached\nwithin the context of the peace process, and its unilateral\nmeasures aimed at imposing a fait accompli in Jerusalem,\nthe West Bank and the Golan, along with its aggression\nagainst southern Lebanon.\nThe second point is the upholding of a just and\ncomprehensive peace as a strategic choice and objective\non the basis of the principles of the peace process, and in\nparticular of the relevant Security Council resolutions, the\nprinciple of land for peace and the attainment of the\nlegitimate political rights of the Palestinian people, and a\nreaffirmation of complete Arab solidarity with this\nposition.\n16\n\n\nThe third point reiterates that Israel's breach of the\nprinciples and the bases of the peace process, its\nbacktracking on the commitments, undertakings and\nagreements reached thereon and its procrastination in\nimplementing these commitments have resulted in the\ncurrent setback of the peace process. These Israeli policies\nhave also led to a reconsideration of the steps taken\ntowards Israel within the framework of the peace process.\nFull responsibility for this lies with the Israeli Government\nalone.\nFourth, negotiations on the three bilateral tracks should\nbe resumed. On the Syrian track, negotiations should be\nresumed from wherever they ended. The two parties should\ncommit themselves to what has already been achieved. On\nthe Lebanese track, negotiations should centre upon the\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978).\nAnd on the Palestinian track, negotiations should be\nresumed on the basis of implementing the contractual\nagreements reached, including the commitments of the\ninterim period. Parallel to that, final status negotiations\nshould start in order to lead to the Palestinian people's\nexercise of their right to self-determination and to the\nestablishment of their independent state.\nFifth, the Council welcomed the American position as\ncrystallized during the visit paid by the United States\nSecretary of State to the region this month. There was\nconsensus regarding cooperation with United States policy\nas expressed by Mrs. Albright in her statement of 6 August\n1997 to the National Press Club in Washington. That\npolicy, which was reiterated during her recent visit to the\nMiddle East and contacts with the States of the region,\nreaffirms the terms of reference of the Madrid Peace\nConference, in particular the principle of land for peace, the\nimplementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions,\nthe realization of the legitimate political rights of the\nPalestinian people, and the commitment to abstain from\ntaking unilateral measures that undermine the permanent\nstatus negotiations. We stress the need to build on this\npositive position on the part of the United States, and call\non Israel to respond positively to it. In this context, the\nsteps that the Israeli Government is required to take to\nfoster the peace process should be within the framework of\nkey issues, not that of issues of a secondary or formalistic\nnature.\nSixth, the European role played in support of the\npeace process is welcome and the importance of its\nrevitalization should be stressed.\nSeventh, international legality in the context of the\nUnited Nations Security Council resolutions should be\nupheld and implemented.\nA stable and just peace must be built on a strong\nbasis of comprehensive security arrangements that take\ndue account of the apprehensions, concerns and\nviewpoints of all parties. This can materialize only when\nIsrael accedes to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), as it is the only State in the\nregion that has not yet done so. We should proceed\nforthwith with the implementation of President Hosni\nMubarak's initiative to free the Middle East from all\nweapons of mass destruction and their delivering vehicles.\nIt is a source of regret for us that so far no practical steps\nhave been taken to rid our region of the threat of nuclear\nweapons. This might lead to the proliferation of such\nweapons. Consequently, I call upon the General Assembly\nand the NPT depositories to take the necessary steps to\nensure Israel's accession to the NPT and for the prompt\nundertaking of serious negotiations to establish a nuclear-\nweapon-free zone in the Middle East, in implementation\nof the resolution adopted by the Review and Extension\nConference of the Parties to the NPT held in New York\nin April 1995. Such a nuclear-weapon-free zone could be\nestablished as a first step towards ridding the Middle East\nof all weapons of mass destruction.\nBefore concluding my remarks regarding the Middle\nEast, I would like to refer to the serious situation in Iraq.\nI would like to highlight the importance of respecting\nIraq's sovereignty and of ending the suffering of its\npeople. Furthermore, the islands of the United Arab\nEmirates should be returned, and the sovereignty of the\nUnited Arab Emirates over these islands should be\nrespected. The Lockerbie issue should be brought to an\nend in conformity with international legality. The\nterritorial integrity of the Sudan should be preserved and\nrespected. A settlement of the problems of Somalia\nshould be reached. A healthy climate for relations should\nbe created in the Middle East between States of the\nregion and neighbouring countries, based upon mutual and\nbalanced commitments along with a common interest in\nmaintaining positive relations for the benefit of everyone.\nTurning to Africa, I wish to refer to the ministerial\nmeeting convened by the Security Council last week to\nconsider the sources and causes of African conflicts and\nhow to contain and resolve them. As I said in my\nstatement before the Council, Africa has come a long way\non the road of political and economic reform. What is\nneeded now is to revitalize existing international\n17\n\n\ninitiatives in support of development and stability in Africa.\nSuch international support is also required to solve the\nproblems of refugees, enhance democratization and\nstrengthen regional and subregional integration. This\nrequires the fulfilment of promises by the international\ncommunity to establish a true partnership between Africa,\non the one hand, and the United Nations system and the\ninternational donor institutions on the other. This also\nrequires strengthening existing cooperation between the\nUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity in\nconformity with the provisions of Chapter VIII of the\nCharter.\nSince the dawn of history, the Mediterranean\ndimension has been an important framework for Egypt,\ninfluencing and being influenced by the centres of\ncivilization and enlightenment in the region. Inasmuch as\nEurope \u2014 Eastern and Western \u2014 has been the main\npartner with Egypt in trade transactions, tourist flows and\ncultural interactions, so has Egypt been and will continue\nto be a major active party in ensuring stability and\nregulating a veritable interaction between the European\ndimension of Mediterranean security and the Mediterranean\ndimension of European security, in the full meaning of the\ncomprehensive concept of contemporary security.\nIn this context, President Hosni Mubarak in November\n1991 presented to the European Parliament his well-known\ninitiative of establishing a framework for consultation and\ncooperation among the Mediterranean countries. By mid-\n1994, this idea was crystallized when the Ministers for\nForeign Affairs of 11 Mediterranean countries held in\nAlexandria their constituent session for the Mediterranean\nForum, which convened its fourth session last July in\nAlgiers, where the ministers unanimously agreed that the\nForum was a unique gathering for frank dialogue and a\nmechanism for the formulation and testing of ideas and\ncoordination of positions.\nThrough its chairmanship of the cultural working\ngroup of the Mediterranean Forum, Egypt looks forward to\ncontributing to strengthening cultural cooperation among the\nmember countries and stressing the common cultural\nfeatures of the Mediterranean personality, based upon the\nintegration and interaction of civilizations, rather than\nconflict and confrontation between them.\nA similar exercise is currently under way with regard\nto Euro-Mediterranean interaction, in the framework of the\nBarcelona process. The second ministerial conference,\nconvened in Malta last April, provided a good opportunity\nfor frankness and an exchange of views to activate and\ncorrect the path of this historic process that brings\ntogether countries of the European Union and those of the\nsouth and the east of the Mediterranean. In so doing, this\nprocess will truly lead to the creation of a balanced\npartnership among all parties, as well as the establishment\nof a common zone of peace and prosperity in the\nMediterranean basin.\nIn this context, Egypt follows with keen interest\ncurrent developments in the Balkans, a region closely\nlinked to the Mediterranean region, especially with regard\nto developments relating to the situation in Bosnia. Egypt\nbelieves that the only way out of tension in that region is\nthat of international legality, the full and speedy\nimplementation of the Dayton Agreements and the trying\nof war criminals, which represents an essential step\ntowards establishing justice and stability in this region.\nEgypt reaffirms its partnership with the international\ncommunity, the United Nations system and the donor\ninstitutions in the development and reconstruction of\nBosnia in order to help heal the wounds of years of war\nand destruction.\nI should not fail to address the concerns of Egypt\nand other developing countries regarding a number of\nchallenges accompanying the process of trade and\ninvestment liberalization. These challenges are manifested\nin the continued pursuit by some of unilateral and\narbitrary policies instead of abidance by the rules and\nregulations of the international trading system that we all\nworked so hard to adopt within the framework of the\nWorld Trade Organization.\nThis is in addition to the growing trend we witness\ntoday on the part of some of our trading partners who\nresort to covert protectionist practices, which hide behind\nnoble considerations such as environmental protection,\nrespect for labour norms and human rights, in order to\nserve some narrow self-interests, to justify the restriction\nof access to markets and to impose trade sanctions.\nOn another plane, we should be well aware that the\nliberalization of investment is not a panacea for every\nmalaise besetting our economies. Despite our interest in\nattracting investments, and despite our efforts to create a\nclimate conducive to the flow of investments, the fact still\nremains that investment agreements should strike a fair\nbalance between protecting the rights of the investor, on\nthe one hand and ensuring the rights and interests of the\nreceiving States, on the other.\n18\n\n\nA year ago, from this rostrum, I called for concerted\nefforts against attempts to marginalize the role of the\nUnited Nations.\nIf we are still awaiting the development of rules of\ninternational conduct under a new world order that is still\nevolving, we then urgently need to ensure the survival of a\nstrong and effective United Nations that can lead the way\nfor us in this nascent world order."

        "file_text": "\ufeffPermit me, on behalf of the\nUganda delegation, to express our pleasure at seeing Mr.\nUdovenko preside over the General Assembly at its fifty-\nsecond session. Allow me also to pay a special tribute to\nhis predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for\nthe outstanding manner in which he discharged his onerous\ntasks while presiding over the work of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-first session. I also salute and\ncongratulate Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations, for the commitment and dedication he has\ndemonstrated since he assumed this office.\nWe note the initiative announced by the Secretary-\nGeneral on 16 July 1997, entitled \u201cRenewing the United\nNations: A Programme for Reform\u201d. We will participate\nactively in the deliberations on these bold and far-\nreaching proposals. The discussions we shall have on the\nissues contained in the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal will\ndetermine the kind of United Nations that can best serve\nus in the twenty-first century.\nThe issue of the reform of the United Nations is not\nnew. Reform of this Organization has always been a\ncontinuous process in which we all have an interest. We\nall want to see the United Nations revitalized,\nstrengthened and well managed. The United Nations is\nunique. The reform of the Organization must be\napproached from the viewpoint of its purposes.\nIn reforming the United Nations, due consideration\nmust be given to its unequal and diverse membership,\nencompassing different cultures and value systems as well\nas great economic and social inequalities, which lead to\ndifferences of opinion on the different aspects of the work\nof the Organization and how they might be strengthened.\nIndeed, most views expressed in the past on reform\nhave come against the background of widespread\nscepticism. These views see the United Nations as\nexcessively costly, mismanaged, inefficient, bureaucratic,\ncorrupt and overstaffed with low- quality staff. The\nUnited Nations, therefore, finds itself at a critical\ncrossroads: neglected in some critical aspects and\ndeliberately eroded in others. Contradictory assessments\nof its performance and usefulness and divergent views\nconcerning its future role have given rise to political\ncontroversy.\nThe important issues of reform must therefore not be\nviewed merely as a question of cutting costs; rather,\nreform should aim at the enhancement of the efficiency\nand effectiveness of the United Nations in the delivery of\nprogrammes and services, particularly those addressing\nthe pressing needs of developing countries. In elaborating\nand implementing the reform package, it is necessary that\nthe programmes that benefit the least developed countries\nand Africa emerge stronger and better equipped to\ndischarge their onerous responsibilities.\nThe Chairman of the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) has already eloquently espoused the African\nposition on the reform of the Security Council. We\nsupport this and the Non-Aligned Movement positions.\nThe Security Council should be expanded in both\ncategories on the principle of equitable geographical\nrepresentation. Africa has already proposed that it be\ngranted two permanent seats with full veto powers. At the\n25\n\n\nsame time, the exercise of the power must conform to\ndemocratic principles.\nIf the United Nations is to be reformed and made\neffective, then adequate financing is a matter of top\npriority. We therefore appeal to all Member States to pay\ntheir dues in full, on time and without conditions. Without\nthis commitment, reforms will only be a smoke screen to\nhide our reluctance to implement the commitments we\ncollectively agreed upon at the celebration to mark the\nfiftieth anniversary of this Organization two years ago.\nRelated to this is the question of the scale of\nassessments. Uganda supports the principle of capacity to\npay as the fundamental criterion for the apportionment of\nthe expenses of the United Nations. This is critical in order\nto redress the unfair burden that developing countries in\ngeneral and the least developed countries in particular\ncontinue to shoulder as a result of imperfections inherent in\nthe present scale methodology, which are to their\ndisadvantage. This principle has been consistently\nreaffirmed by the General Assembly in various resolutions.\nIn this connection, we would like to caution that attempts\nto impose self-interested positions will not yield any\nsatisfactory outcome.\nUganda welcomes the result of the recently concluded\nagreement in the area of anti-personnel landmines in Oslo.\nWe are particularly satisfied with the progress thus far\nmade on these weapons. On our part, even before the\nconclusion of the Oslo agreement on these weapons, which\ncause untold and indiscriminate destruction, we in Uganda\nhad already stopped and dismantled our facilities for their\nmanufacture. We no longer manufacture, import or use\nthese weapons. We call on all peace-loving nations, those\nthat care for the innocent who lose their limbs every minute\nto landmines, to follow our example. It is our sincere hope\nthat when the agreement on anti-personnel landmines will\nbe opened in Ottawa, Canada, for signature, even those\nMember States that were reluctant to join in the consensus\non the agreement will sign it. We hope that the Oslo\nprocess will lead to progress in disarmament negotiations,\nleading to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and\nsubsequently of all weapons of mass destruction.\nThe political and economic situation in African\nremains a matter of grave concern to us. We believe that\nAfrica must continue to search for and to find the most\nsuitable political arrangements that will guarantee peace and\nstability. African society, since time immemorial, has\nalways emphasized harmony and decision-making by\nconsensus rather than competition and confrontation. Our\nsocieties emphasized the good of the whole rather than\nthe untamed pursuit of selfish interests. In short,\negalitarianism and equal participation were the hallmarks\nof societal and political organization. However, as we all\nknow, Africa was exposed to other cultures and systems\nthat introduced new forms of governance and politics. It\nis not surprising, therefore, that, upon independence, these\npowerful and pervasive influences, like multiparty politics\nand fierce competition, tore our societies apart. The\nconflicts that proliferated in the wake of independence\nmust be understood against this background.\nWe can state boldly today that, this notwithstanding,\nconflict and chaos in Africa is on the retreat. We have\nwitnessed the end of conflict in Liberia and elections have\ntaken place. Military dictators are now roundly\ncondemned and isolated. The actions that are being\nundertaken by the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS) against the military junta in Sierra\nLeone \u2014 actions that we all support \u2014 speak loud.\nIn our own region, the Great Lakes region, we\nwitnessed the rout of the Mobutu dictatorship, a heinous\nregime that plundered one of the richest countries in\nAfrica almost into oblivion. We refused to accept the\nmilitary coup of Pierre Buyoya in Burundi and have set\nout tough sanctions and conditions for the restoration of\ndemocratic governance. This position was recently\nrenewed in Dar-es-Salaam.\nThe efforts that we are undertaking, deserve support,\nbe they in the context of the OAU Mechanism for\nConflict Prevention, Resolution and Management or of\nregional initiatives such as those involving the Great\nLakes, the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) or those of the Intergovernmental Authority\non Development on the Sudan conflict. At the same time,\ncountries that have emerged from conflicts need to be\ngiven a modicum of moral and material support to allow\nthem get back on their feet. We are all agreed on the\nneed for post-conflict peace-building and the need to\nestablish a continuum from relief to rehabilitation and\ndevelopment. We are also agreed that democracy, good\ngovernance and accountability represent the best form of\nleadership.\nHowever, nations that are struggling to reconstruct\ncannot wait for a full restoration of democratic order\nbefore they address urgent humanitarian and relief\nrequirements. Quite often the very transition to the rule of\nlaw and to democratic governance is contingent upon\nsignificant progress on the humanitarian and economic\n26\n\n\nfronts. It is with these kind of considerations that we would\nlike to see tangible assistance extended to the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo without delay or preconditions. We\nmust put behind us the chaos that afflicted that country and\nthe sad chapter in the history of the Congo that was brought\nabout by Mobutu\u2019s mismanagement. The survival of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo is paramount and should\nbe of concern to all of us.\nThe experience of the United Nations in Somalia and\nRwanda has demonstrated the need for improvement in the\nOrganization\u2019s ability to anticipate crisis situations and put\nin place effective mechanisms to avert such situations,\nincluding in the area of early warning. In this connection,\nwe note with satisfaction the strengthening of the United\nNations capacity for post-conflict peace-building with the\ndesignation of the Department of Political Affairs as focal\npoint for this purpose.\nWe are seized of the grave situation in Congo\n(Brazzaville) and the Central African Republic. The\nunsteady progress on a negotiated settlement of the conflicts\nin Angola, Somalia, southern Sudan and the Western\nSahara continue be of concern to us. We call on all the\nparties to the conflicts to engage in constructive dialogue in\norder to establish lasting peace. We should all support them\nin this process.\nIn Uganda, we continue to search for solutions to our\neconomic difficulties. We have therefore continued to\nimplement far-reaching economic reforms that emphasize\nliberalization, privatization, investment promotion and cost-\neffectiveness in management. The results are promising,\nand we have recorded gross domestic product growth rates\nof more than 6 per cent per annum. Now we are grappling\nwith the need to ensure that economic progress benefits the\npeople, particularly the poorest. This we will address in the\nframework of a poverty eradication strategy, the pillars of\nwhich will include: first, the improvement of physical\ninfrastructure, such as roads and telecommunications;\nsecondly, the universalizing of primary education and the\nincreasing encouragement of private education at the\nsecondary and tertiary levels to unlock the creative power\nof our population; thirdly, the modernization and\ndiversification of agriculture; and fourthly, the promotion of\nmicro- and small-scale enterprise through improved access\nto credit for the rural poor.\nThis is a tall order, and we call upon our development\npartners to support us in this process in the context of the\nalready formulated national action plans and the agreed\nframework for international development cooperation.\nThe issue of the world\u2019s freshwater resources\nremains of the utmost concern to my delegation. Water\nshortages in the next century are likely to restrain\neconomic and social development. A large part of Uganda\nis covered by fresh water. In Uganda, we attach\nimportance to the economic value of water, and that is\nwhy we recognize the importance of its equitable and\nreasonable use. Unfortunately, our water resources are\nbeing choked by the rapid growth and spread of the water\nhyacinth on Lake Victoria and on other lakes and rivers\nin the Nile Valley. As we have done in the past, we\nurgently appeal once again to the international community\nto extend its support to enable us to address the problem\nof the water hyacinth.\nLet me reiterate our confidence in the mission of the\nUnited Nations in coordinating and delivering targeted\nassistance to developing countries in all areas of human\nendeavour, in partnership with Governments. It is\nimportant, therefore, to ensure that the focus of the\nOrganization is sharpened to enhance the relevance and\neffectiveness of its programmes, be it in the area of\ngovernance, poverty eradication, capacity-building or\nhumanitarian assistance.\nWe need a United Nations that will act as an agent\nof progress and change and that will be equipped to play\nan effective and leading role in improving the economic\nand social conditions of all the world\u2019s nations \u2014 not just\na few. We also want a reformed United Nations that will\ndeal effectively with the growing number of complex\ninternational challenges, including development, peace\nand security. Furthermore, we need a reformed United\nNations that must provide global leadership and vision in\nthe twenty-first century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy delegation is pleased to greet you, Sir, as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-second\nsession. I congratulate you warmly on your election; we\nhave full confidence in your notable qualities as a wise and\nexperienced diplomat.\nI wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor,\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, for the outstanding manner in\nwhich he carried out his responsibilities. We all benefitted\nfrom his exceptional ability and his dedication.\nWe were delighted at the election of the illustrious\nAfrican Mr. Kofi Annan to the post of Secretary-General at\na critical time in the history of the Organization. His\nsplendid performance in other high United Nations posts\nand the creativity and dynamism that have marked the\nbeginning of his term justify the legitimate hopes we have\nall placed in him.\nThe numerous and complex challenges before us at the\ndawn of the third millennium can be faced only by the\ncombined will and efforts of all Member States. My\nGovernment fully recognizes the prominent role of the\nUnited Nations in the constant quest for relevant solutions.\nIn today\u2019s world, in which sovereignty is less and less\nrespected, interdependence and globalization are becoming\nincreasingly real and tangible. As a result, we need the\ncreation of new tools capable of raising confidence to a\nhigher level and increasing cooperation between all\ninternational actors in a collective effort that alone can\nprovide answers to the global questions confronting us.\nFor several years, our Organization has been\nexperiencing an intensified process of reform aimed at\ngiving it revitalized energy, renewed representativeness and\nlegitimacy, increased effectiveness and greater transparency.\nThe first consensus is emerging, and its benefits will\ndoubtless soon be felt. Recent examples of this include the\nresolution adopted by the General Assembly following\ndiscussions in the Open-ended High-level Working Group\non the Strengthening of the United Nations System, as well\nas the adoption of an Agenda for Development, and the\ngains achieved so far on the road towards an Agenda for\nPeace.\nIt is very desirable that equally worthwhile progress\ntake place in parallel with regard to the financial situation\nof the Organization. In this regard, my country shares the\nvery broad consensus on the need for Member States to\nrespect their obligation under the Charter to pay their\ncontributions on time, in full and without conditions.\nReform of the Security Council is one of the most\ndifficult elements among all the reforms being studied.\nThe broad agreement required for a formula has not yet\nbeen found. Cape Verde recalls the joint position of the\nnon-aligned countries, which are demanding non-\ndiscriminatory treatment for the developing countries, in\nparticular with regard to the prerogatives accorded to the\npermanent members of the Council. For its part, Africa is\nnow working to refine practical means for rotation within\nthe continent of the seats that it expects to be at its\ndisposal to represent its Member States.\nThe Secretary-General has shown us how convinced\nhe is of the imperative for reform. He took certain\ndecisions and began to implement them. He then asked us\nfor advice and proposals. A fundamental objective of the\nproposed reforms is to provide unity and consistency to\nthe global activity of the system, and thereby to have an\nincreased impact. Structural transformations and changes\nin working methods are the favoured instruments for the\nimplementation of this objective.\nWe thank and warmly congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral for his initiative, whose focus and broad scope\nreveal a deep knowledge of the Organization\u2019s situation\nand an enlightened vision of the directions that should be\ntaken. We will give constructive support to these\nproposals in the consultations that will soon be\nintensifying at different levels: in the African Group, the\nGroup of 77 and the General Assembly.\nThe quality of the future to which humankind aspires\ndepends on what we can do today to give human beings\ntheir dignity and guarantee that they can enjoy the\nfundamental rights recognized in the international legal\ninstruments that reflect our collective conscience. We\nmust all commit ourselves to the resolute protection and\nconstant promotion of human rights. The United Nations\nis dedicated to doing so at several levels and through\ndifferent instruments. The Commission on Human Rights\nis one of the important ones, and Cape Verde is gratified\nthat it is able to contribute to its work. To accomplish this\ntask, which is limitless, we must ensure that we construct\nhuman rights around the axes that complement and\n5\n\n\ninteract with them, as is the case with democracy and\ndevelopment.\nFully functioning democracy provides a vital impetus\nfor the establishment of a human and institutional\nenvironment conducive to development and the\nimplementation of human rights. However, beyond the\nformal political dimension, conditions must be created that\nallow all of our citizens to live in dignity and achieve\nimproved standards of living. The right to development is\ntherefore reaffirmed as a cornerstone for concerted action\nto ensure that such a right can be enjoyed by everyone\nthroughout the world.\nIt is time to establish a true international understanding\nfor development. Everything possible should be done to\nensure that the Agenda for Development, long the subject\nof negotiation and recently adopted by the General\nAssembly, is fully implemented in practice. In this context,\nwe regard as promising those concerted efforts recently\nmade by the global institutions, including the United\nNations Conference on Trade and Development, the United\nNations Development Programme, the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization in areas\ncritical for development, such as financial flows, investment\nand commerce. We encourage the intensification of this\nconcerted action, which has also been requested by the\nEconomic and Social Council and encouraged by the\nSecretary-General. It can make a considerable contribution\nto the establishment of international cooperation, leading to\ndevelopment at both the global and country level.\nWe are presently engaged in a race against the clock.\nMany developing countries urgently need, finally, to\nexperience the stirrings of an economic lift-off within the\ninternational trend. Otherwise, we are afraid that the hard-\nwon reforms of the past and present will not be sustained,\nand will still less be able to gain the social backing that\nalone can ensure the eventual transition to the second\ngeneration of reforms.\nThe progress that we envisage is not limited solely to\nthe economic arena. Solidarity will also be required. We\ncannot accept the continued existence of certain barriers\nthat we have erected and that are now impeding us from\nfully enjoying our fundamental rights. I am thinking of such\nperversions as racism and exclusion areas based on\nxenophobia, discrimination which is inflicted on so many\nindividuals, particularly immigrants.\nMigratory movements have taken place throughout\nhistory. We should treat them with understanding and\ndialogue, which will enable us to find solutions to the\ninevitable problems, rather than allow them to become\nexacerbated. In this regard, international instruments can\nbe extremely useful. It is important that the International\nConvention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant\nWorkers and Members of Their Families finally enter into\nforce. We also hope that the Assembly will follow up the\nresolution of the Economic and Social Council on\nconvening a world conference against racism, racial and\nethnic discrimination, xenophobia and other related\ncontemporary forms of intolerance.\nOn this continuing and unequal march towards\ndevelopment, in which all are involved, some of our\ncountries remain among the least advanced. At a time of\nincreased globalization, to warn against the risk of\nconsolidating and perpetuating the marginalization of\nthese countries is not mere rhetorical overstatement. On\nthe contrary, this danger is very real. The least-developed\ncountries\u2019 share of world exports continues to languish at\nvery low levels, and their rate of growth even dropped in\n1996.\nExternal trade is vital for reversing the present\nsituation of the least developed countries. The decision\nadopted in Marrakesh regarding measures to help them,\nas well as the World Trade Organization Plan of Action\nadopted last December in Singapore, recognize that the\nleast developed countries urgently need to achieve a\nlasting increase in their exports. These countries must\ntherefore significantly improve their competitive\ncapability, and their exports of goods and services must\nhave free access to all global markets.\nIn this sense, we are expecting initiatives from the\nhigh-level meeting on the least developed countries, to be\nheld next month in Geneva aided by increased\ninstitutional synergy between those international bodies\nwith competence and responsibility in areas critical for\nthe development of the least developed countries.\nThe foreign debt of these countries continues to\ngrow. The problem continues to be inadequately handled,\nas regards both the categories of countries covered by\ninitiatives and the actual level of the initiatives. All least\ndeveloped countries \u2014 not only the most critically\naffected \u2014 need adequate and lasting relief.\nMoreover, the financing of certain elements\nindispensable for international integration of these\ncountries, such as infrastructure and education, to cite\nonly a few, requires a significantly increased flow of\n6\n\n\npublic development aid. For the least developed countries,\nthis will become ever more necessary in the future.\nIn Cape Verde, a least developed country which has\nsuffered a prolonged drought, there is today national\nconsensus about the country\u2019s future and the major paths to\nbe followed. The reforms which we are undertaking have\nthe support of the nation, which can legitimately aspire to\nimproving its living conditions today, and not in the distant\nfuture.\nThe fact that the African continent contains the\nmajority of the world\u2019s least developed countries speaks\neloquently of its limitations. For the international\ncommunity, Africa is a test of its will and its ability to\nmeet the challenge of global development. The world will\nnot be developed so long as Africa is not developed.\nSolutions, as we know, begin at home. The present\nand the recent past of our continent confirm that we\nunderstand this, and are acting upon it more and more. I\ntake this opportunity to thank those in the international\ncommunity who are firmly supporting Africa\u2019s development\nand encourage them to have greater confidence in the future\nof our continent and in the partnership between Africa and\nits friends.\nIf the Africans continue to step up the changes under\nway in the right direction, and if there is concrete progress\nand cooperation in the international environment, it is likely\nthat the positive signs of the last few years will\nprogressively be consolidated in Africa.\nHowever, there are constraints of another nature\nimpeding the general progress sought by our continent:\nsituations of conflict and potential conflict, which continue\nto proliferate, some of them particularly bloody.\nExperience \u2014 particularly recent experience \u2014 has shown\nthat these conflicts are often highly complex. They become\ndeeply rooted and thus thwart any diplomatic or other\nattempts at solution. However, that is no reason for the\nUnited Nations and its Member States to give up their\nefforts to solve these problems.\nWorking together and in concert with the United\nNations, the Africans are becoming more active in their\nefforts at the regional level to contribute to preventing and\nmanaging the conflicts on the continent. Africa needs\ninternational support in order to step up its capacities in this\narea. Such support should not become a means of\ndiscrimination, negative or positive, with regard to certain\nconflicts as compared with others, based on the subjective\npreferences of donors. The multilateral nature of the\nUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) implies avoidance of this risk and balanced\ntreatment of conflict situations.\nThe case of Angola has called for the greatest efforts\nof the United Nations in Africa \u2014 lengthy and repeated\nefforts. Unfortunately, a new deterioration in the situation,\nwith violent consequences, is not impossible at a time\nwhen UNITA is persisting in failing to respect the terms\nof the Lusaka Accords. Therefore, the most recent\nSecurity Council resolution on Angola is fully justified,\nand we hope that it will have the desired effect. Only a\nfew days from the expiration of its time limit, we urge\nUNITA to take the decisive steps required for lasting\npeace in Angola.\nWe would like to reaffirm here the support of Cape\nVerde for the people of East Timor in its quest for\ngenuine self-determination, the preservation of its identity,\nand recognition of and total respect for its rights. We\nwelcomed the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 to\ntwo eminent individuals from East Timor, Don Ximenes\nBelo and Ramos-Horta. That award brought even more\ninternational attention to the situation of their people. It is\ntime for reason and justice to prevail, and we welcome\nthe appointment of a Special Representative for East\nTimor by the Secretary-General within the framework of\nhis redoubled efforts to assist in finding an equitable\nsolution to the conflict in the territory.\nLast June, a special session of the General Assembly\nto assess the implementation of Agenda 21 achieved\nmeagre results. All sides \u2014 Governments, international\ninstitutions and social groups \u2014 are again challenged to\nhonour the Rio commitments and show more\ndetermination and responsibility on the environment.\nCertainly, with regard to control of the causes of\nenvironmental degradation and long-term management of\nthe planet\u2019s non-renewable resources, different parties\nhave different responsibilities, but those responsibilities\nare shared. Among the numerous constraining factors,\npopulation and consumption remain major factors. While\ndemographic growth presents encouraging medium- and\nlong-term indicators, unbalanced rates of consumption\npersist and even increase, putting unsustainable pressure\non resources.\nMy country, a country of the Sahel and an island\nnation, is particularly sensitive to certain threats to the\nenvironment, such as drought and desertification, which\n7\n\n\nwere the subject of an international Convention giving\nparticular attention to the situation in Africa. The\nPermanent International Committee for Drought Control in\nthe Sahel (CILSS), of which Cape Verde is a member, is\ntaking action with a visible impact, which merits continued\nsupport by its external partners.\nAnother factor for environmental deterioration \u2014 this\ntime a social one \u2014 is the scourge of drugs and the human\ndegradation to which it leads. To combat illegal drug\ntrafficking and the laundering of the money it generates,\nclose international cooperation is required, particularly in\nthe exchange of information and logistical and material\nsupport. This is a global phenomenon, and the means to\ncombat it must also be formulated globally, with national\nand regional foundations. The West African subregion,\nthrough the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS), has begun concerted efforts. The Political\nDeclaration of Praia last July laid down the basis for\ngrowing cooperation between the countries involved.\nThe last years of this millennium mark the end of an\nextraordinary period. The era which began with the fall of\nthe Berlin Wall will go down in history as an era of an\nexplosion of the ideals of liberty and progress such as had\nnot been seen since the great wave of independence in the\n1960s.\nThese gains, together with the dizzying advances of\nscience and technology, attest to mankind\u2019s extraordinary\nability to come up with imaginative answers. However,\nmankind has not yet freed itself from feelings of\nindifference and exclusion, and often even of hate. This is\nperhaps the major challenge as this century comes to a\nclose.\nThe complete achievement of the noble objectives of\nthe Charter would doubtless represent a decisive step\ntowards such emancipation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy country and my\ndelegation warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your election\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nsecond session. Your election to this high office is a tribute\nboth to you and to your great country, Ukraine. I wish to\nassure you of my delegation's fullest cooperation during\nyour tenure of office.\nIt also gives me great pleasure to convey our profound\ngratitude and appreciation to the outgoing president of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session, Ambassador\nRazali Ismail of Malaysia, who presided over the session\nwith such consummate skill, expertise and diplomacy, and\ndistinguished himself by his firm management of the\nsession through his dedication to and thoroughness in the\ndischarge of his assignment.\nI am also pleased to extend our sincerest\ncongratulations to the new Secretary-General of the United\nNations, Mr. Kofi Annan. My delegation is convinced that\nMr. Annan will make an outstanding contribution to the\nrole and responsibilities of the United Nations in\ninternational affairs and to the management of the\nOrganization. We wish to reassure him of our fullest\ncooperation during his tenure of office.\nThe greatest challenge facing our world today is\neconomic development, specifically the promotion of\nsustained economic growth with equitable social\ndevelopment, particularly in the developing countries of the\nworld. For small island developing States like Fiji, and for\nmany developing countries of the world in general, we need\nan international economic environment that is buttressed by\neconomic justice. We need an international economic\nenvironment that ensures a better life in all the countries of\nthe world and not in just a few. The slow pace of economic\ndevelopment and even the lack of such development in\nmany countries of the world, circumscribed by the evils of\nunemployment and poverty, are threats to international\npeace and security.\nThis greatest challenge is growing more and more\nacute as economic development is being retarded by a\nnumber of policies, trends and unilateral actions which\npervade our world today. Our development policies, plans\nand programmes are being seriously eroded by difficulties\nin accessing the markets of the developed countries,\nworsening terms of trade, inadequate capital flow for\ninvestment, spiralling debt burdens, protectionist\ntendencies, ambivalence in the transfer of technologies\nand exchange-rate volatility. Small countries like mine,\nand indeed all developing nations, have no real influence\nin these matters, except as victims.\nThe Charter of the United Nations calls for the\npromotion of the international economic and social\nadvancement of all peoples. Implicit, if not explicit, in it\nis embedded the principle of economic justice. As\nMembers of the United Nations, we have a collective\nmoral and humanitarian obligation to help and assist each\nother. We have a collective duty to make our world a\nbetter place to live in. The time has come for the\ndeveloped nations of the world, and all international\norganizations which can help, to cooperate and ensure\njustice by enabling developing countries in their own\nefforts towards the acceleration of sustained economic and\nsocial development.\nThere are a number of ways in which the developing\ncountries can be assisted towards achieving sustained\neconomic and social development. Developing countries,\neven those endowed with natural resources, are\nhandicapped by a lack of capital to mobilize these\nresources to their advantage. Developing countries need\ncontinuous foreign-direct-investment capital flows to\nstimulate and sustain economic growth. Both foreign\ndirect investment and private-sector investment are needed\nto help diversify and increase economic activities,\nespecially where industrialization is an option.\nThrough the diversification of our economies we can\nproduce more for export and trade. In fact, trade is the\nbest means for sustained income generation and\ndevelopment. The present globalized international trade is\nideally aimed at ensuring an open, secure, equitable,\ntransparent and predictable multilateral system wherein all\nparticipants can benefit.\nThe reality we face is very different from this\nespoused ideal. We do not live in an ideal world, but in\nthe real world, where international trade is dominated by\nthe industrialized, developed nations. Fiji and other\ndeveloping and least-developed countries of the world\n15\n\n\nhave to compete for markets with industrial giants. The\ninternational-trade playing field is not level, despite\nfrequent statements to that effect. In reality, there is no\neven playing field. It is in truth marked by inequalities of\npower, influence and resources, with steep and almost\ninsurmountable heights constraining small nations like ours.\nIn order for small countries like Fiji to survive and to\ndevelop, we must be allowed to retain special arrangements\nfor our essential exports, which give our people social and\neconomic security.\nMy country firmly believes that globalization is the\nphenomenon of today's international trade. The\ntransformation of international trade rules from the Uruguay\nRound to the World Trade Organization (WTO) has been\nmarked by rapid changes that can marginalize small\ndeveloping countries like mine.\nThe appellate body of the WTO has significantly\nnarrowed the scope of the General Agreement on Tariffs\nand Trade (GATT)/WTO waiver to the European\nCommunity in respect of the Lom\u00e9 Convention. Fiji is\namong other African, Caribbean and Pacific countries\nwhich will be adversely affected by these new arrangements\nif the arrangements of the Lom\u00e9 Conventions are eroded.\nFurthermore, it has opened up room for policies and\nactions, leaving weak developing countries unprotected and\nexposed to economic stagnation.\nWhile the WTO is insisting on a level-playing-field\napproach, peculiarities that pose problems for small island\ndeveloping countries persist. As for Fiji, our smallness,\nremoteness and inaccessibility to foreign markets remain\nour biggest hurdles in international trade. Annual natural\ndisasters, a consequence of the climatic conditions in our\nlocation, continue to be a big drain on the Government's\nsavings in terms of rehabilitation projects. Such angry\nseasonal visitations of nature can wreak havoc on budget\nplans and our scarce resources.\nSmall island States like Fiji have a very limited range\nand volume of exports and they cannot and will not\ndominate and overwhelm any sector of trade commodities.\nIn that context, my delegation is extremely disappointed at\nthe recent decision of the World Trade Organization appeal\nbody against banana exports from Caribbean countries to\nthe European Union.\nWe are not asking for favours. We are merely making\na plea for a sensible and reasonable transition period to\nenable us to adjust. This cannot be done overnight; thus,\nspecial arrangements must remain to allow us the\nopportunity to find means for accommodation and\nreplacement.\nThe blind pursuit of free trade, resulting in dire\nconsequences for small nations and leading to the loss of\nother fundamental freedoms, will not serve the purposes\nof eradicating poverty and eliminating social and\neconomic inequalities. We seek an equality of opportunity\nin a world dominated by inequalities of resources and\neconomic might.\nThe World Trade Organization must bring a sense of\nequity and justice in its deliberations and decisions, and\nconsciously eschew paths which disadvantage even further\nalready disadvantaged developing nations. We seek an\nequality of understanding for the position of the weak and\nthe small. We seek the creation of genuine freedom in\ntrade, for trade remains the best means for sustained\ndevelopment for developing nations.\nThe access of developing countries to new,\nenvironmentally sound technologies is also pivotal to\neconomic development and sustained economic growth.\nThere is a need for developing countries like Fiji to\nparticipate in, benefit from and contribute to the rapid\nadvances in the technologies of developed, industrialized\ncountries. Developing countries should be facilitated\naccess to reliable information on environmentally sound\ntechnologies and helped in institutional development and\ncapacity-building to accommodate the transfer of such\ntechnologies. Accessibility to knowledge for development\nis a right, the right of all nations, not merely of a\npowerful few to retain as a monopoly for their own\nselfish ends.\nOfficial development assistance is an important\ncatalyst for development, yet its value remains unrealized.\nOnly four countries have met or surpassed the official\ndevelopment assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross\nnational product. A renewed commitment to this target is\nessential in order to fulfil the imperatives established by\nthe Charter of the United Nations. At this stage of our\ndevelopment, it is a much needed catalyst to our own\nefforts.\nExternal debt repayments continue to be a major\nconstraint on economic development and sustained\neconomic growth in major developing countries.\nBurdensome debt repayments not only cause economic\ndevelopment to stagnate, but stifle social development as\nwell. I call for the adoption of an effective and equitable\ndevelopment-oriented solution to the debt problem, so that\n16\n\n\nit ceases to be a burden yet remains a useful tool for\nsustained development.\nI have emphasized economic growth for sustained\ndevelopment as the direction we must pursue. My country\nand Government are fully committed to this goal. Yet, for\neconomic growth to be sustainable, as well as beneficial\nand of quality, the environmental factor must be brought to\nthe forefront in all our development efforts.\nDespite the convening of the recent special session of\nthe General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review\nof the implementation of Agenda 21, there are still no clear\ncommitments on the part of many developed countries to\nwork towards achieving such environmental goals as, for\ninstance, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to\ninternationally specified levels. The South Pacific Forum\nisland countries are among the most vulnerable to climate\nchange in terms of sea level rise and global warming. It is\ntherefore imperative that all members of the international\ncommunity should strive for a firm political commitment\nbefore the next Kyoto Conference, to adopt a stronger\nprotocol to strengthen the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change.\nIn this connection, my delegation joins others in\nexpressing our appreciation to the private sector and civil\nsociety for the supportive interest they have shown in the\nsearch for an acceptable international solution to such\nglobal concerns. A most welcome demonstration of this is\nthe recent donation of $1 billion by the Turner Foundation\nin support of certain crucial activities of the United Nations.\nWe need more of such assistance to further sustain and\nstrengthen the work of the United Nations in achieving its\ntargets.\nI would now like to turn my attention to the issue of\ninternational security. Today we are witnessing a most\nsignificant period of change in our world, a change which\nbodes well for permanent and lasting peace and security.\nThe cold war has been over for some time now and the\ntensions and threats to peace and security which it\ngenerated are behind us. As a consequence, and with the\nadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\n(CTBT), we have moved a step further towards nuclear\ndisarmament. While this is gratifying, there is much more\nto be done to achieve the objective of our Organization to\nturn our swords into ploughshares and our spears into\npruning hooks.\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has\nadded to the impressive list of political and legal\ninstruments intended to de-escalate the production and\nstockpiling of nuclear weapons. We have come a long\nway in our efforts to prevent a nuclear holocaust on our\nplanet, but the existence and improvement of nuclear\nweapons still leaves the threat over us. The current\ninternational situation creates a favourable condition for\nthe international community, and particularly nuclear-\nweapon States, to take steps towards eliminating nuclear\nweapons from our planet. While the CTBT is a step in\nthe right direction, it lacks a clear time-frame for the\nremoval of all nuclear weapons from our midst.\nMy delegation urges the international community to\nbegin negotiations as soon as possible on a treaty to halt\nand prohibit, with acceptable verification, the production\nand development of all nuclear weapons. My delegation\nfurther urges the nuclear-weapon States to destroy all\nstockpiles and arsenals of nuclear weapons, with\nacceptable international verification, and thereby rid the\nworld of nuclear weapons, once and for all.\nMy delegation warmly welcomes the finalization in\nOslo last week of a draft treaty prohibiting the\ndevelopment, production, acquisition, stockpiling,\nretaining or transferring of anti-personnel landmines. We\ncall on all nations of the world to sign and ratify the\ntreaty.\nIn the achievement of all these objectives, whether\nthey relate to sustained development or disarmament, the\nUnited Nations has a crucial role. It must possess a\ndynamism to be effective. It cannot be cumbersome,\nunwieldy and partial. To meet new challenges, the United\nNations must be streamlined. A meaningful international\norganization such as ours must adapt to changes,\nenhancing its relevance and competence. The entire\ninternational community, including my country, has been\ncalling for the reform of the United Nations. It has taken\nsome time, but at last our new Secretary-General has\npresented his recommendations for a restructured\nOrganization that can carry us over the threshold into the\nnew millennium. I would like to thank the Secretary-\nGeneral for his comprehensive, constructive and coherent\nrecommendations.\nMy delegation will carefully study the bold and far-\nreaching recommendations for reform, and we endorse the\nproposals in principle. I make a plea that in the\nimplementation of these reforms there must also be\npositive benefits for the small Member States, including\ntheir increased participation in the United Nations system.\nI am particularly pleased that the Secretary-General has\n17\n\n\nidentified economic and social affairs, as well as\ndevelopment cooperation, as core activities. His proposals\nare congruent with the high priority which my delegation\nplaces on economic growth for sustained development. I\nhave already stated that the United Nations must play a\nconstructive and catalytic role, within its macroeconomic\npolicies to facilitate economic growth for sustained\ndevelopment, thereby enabling developing countries, which\nconstitute the vast majority of the Members of the\nOrganization, to have an equal share in the opportunities for\nwealth creation.\nI fully support the submission that peacekeeping will\nremain an indispensable instrument of the United Nations.\nMy country, small though it is, has played its part in\ninternational peacekeeping programmes in virtually every\ntheatre of the world since we joined the United Nations in\n1970. In fact, in terms of size of population, Fiji is\npresently among the largest troop contributors to United\nNations peacekeeping programmes. In the process, several\nof our peacekeepers have lost their lives. But as a nation\nwe remain committed to the goal of permanent and lasting\npeace in our world. I might add here that it is a cause of\ngreat pride, but pride tempered with humility, that one of\nour nationals, Major-General Jioje Konrote, has been\nappointed Force Commander of the United Nations Interim\nForce in Lebanon (UNIFIL). It reflects the degree and\nextent of the commitment of our small nation of fewer than\na million people towards the peace and security of our\nworld.\nThe proposals for the reform of the United Nations\nencompass new management and efficiency measures which\nshould reduce administrative costs, but the financial\npredicament of our Organization will not be resolved\nentirely by cost-cutting measures. It can be resolved if\nMember countries pay their contributions promptly. We call\non all Member States which are in arrears to settle those\narrears promptly, fully and without conditions.\nAs we press ahead with the reform of the United\nNations, it becomes incumbent on us to ensure that this\nextends to the Security Council. My country continues to\nadvocate that the Security Council should be expanded to\nreflect an equitable geographical distribution, taking into\naccount the substantial increase in the membership of the\nUnited Nations. Reforms affecting the Security Council\nshould encompass opportunity for participation in its\ndecisions, transparency in its work, a constructive\nrelationship with the General Assembly and the limited\nscope and use of the veto power.\nOn the issue of expansion, my country wishes to\nreiterate the recommendation it made to the General\nAssembly last November with regard to the membership\nof the Security Council, especially its non-permanent\nmembership. We strongly favour an equitable and wider\nrepresentation of non-permanent members, by which\nregions and subregions would adopt a rotation system,\nincluding a prohibition on immediate re-election.\nI further submit that in the same way that the\nCaribbean forms a special subregion of the Latin\nAmerican Group, the South Pacific region comprising 14\nindependent island States, eight of which are members of\nthe United Nations, and Australia and New Zealand,\nshould become a special subregion, ensuring continuous\nmembership from our region.\nThese changes are prerequisites for a dynamic\nUnited Nations with credibility in the next millennium.\nNow more than ever, our international community\nneeds a system of preventive diplomacy that can respond\npromptly, positively and peacefully to potential conflicts\nand threats of genocide. My country continues to call for\na special United Nations division or unit to undertake\npreventive diplomacy in conflict prevention and conflict\nresolution. The division should have the capacity to\nreceive, collate, analyze and interpret intelligence\ninformation and reports, with a view to early detection of\npotential conflicts and early reaction to minimize, contain\nand resolve such conflicts in collaboration with the\nrelevant Member States. May I reiterate that in such a\ndivision, adequate representation of skills and expertise\nfrom small States must be mandatory, for the division\nmust not become a device or a creature of the powerful\nto impose their will on their own terms.\nSpeaking as the head of Government of a small\nisland developing country, I totally support the principle\nof capacity to pay as a fundamental criterion and a firm\nbenchmark on which the contribution of member\ncountries to the United Nations should be assessed. My\ncountry therefore fully supports the recommendation of\nthe Committee on Contributions that the scale of\nassessments for all Member States whose share of\nadjusted national income is below the current floor rate of\n0.01 per cent should be assessed at their actual share of\nadjusted income. We also support the recommended\nminimum assessment rate of 0.001 per cent. We further\nurge that the ceiling should not be lowered any further\nbecause a reduction will negate the effect of reducing the\nrecommended minimum floor rate.\n18\n\n\nMy delegation supports the establishment of an\ninternational criminal court. Recent crimes against\nhumanity, including genocide, have made it incumbent on\nthe international community to take stern action against\nthose who perpetrate such heinous acts. It is our sincere\nhope that the current efforts by the international community\nwill be crowned with success and that come next year we\nshall be in a position to adopt a treaty establishing the\ninternational criminal court.\nMy country strongly emphasizes that the protection\nand security of small States should remain a central concern\nof the United Nations. Increasingly, elected Governments\nand the sovereignty and security of their States are\nthreatened by transnational networks of crime, narcotics,\nmoney-laundering and terrorism. These scourges are\nexpanding, and international cooperation and action are\nessential to counter them.\nThe Middle East continues to be a cauldron aboil with\nconflict, tension, violence and early death, the latter sadly\nreaching tragic proportions since last year's session of the\nGeneral Assembly. We call upon all parties involved to\nengage in genuine negotiations towards a just and lasting\npeace in the Middle East. We call upon the international\ncommunity, too, to contribute towards a just and lasting\npeace.\nLast year, I commended both the People's Republic of\nChina and Taiwan for their efforts toward reconciling their\ndifferences. I wish to renew my plea to them to work\ntowards unity. We in Fiji enjoy excellent relations with\nboth of them, though we adhere firmly to our One China\npolicy. We in the Pacific continue to enjoy their generosity\nand their concern for the welfare of the people of the South\nPacific. Both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan\nenjoy our friendship and trust. Fiji and the other 15 member\ncountries of the South Pacific Forum welcome their\nparticipation in the annual post-Forum dialogue and\nconsultation with each of them. It is our fervent wish that\nthey will, together, find a solution for their common future.\nLikewise, I urge South and North Korea to negotiate\na solution that will bring lasting peace and unity to the\npeople of Korea.\nFiji is an oceanic State. As in many island countries,\nour progress and development depend as much on our land\nterritory as on the sea around us. We are, therefore,\nconcerned that the seas are utilized in a manner that is\nenvironmentally sound and that the development of marine\nresources is orderly and sustainable so that they can serve\nthe present and future generations. We insist on this\napproach at the national level and strongly support similar\nefforts at regional and global levels.\nIn the past decade, our region has adopted a number\nof treaties and declarations that address the issue of better\nmanagement of oceans. More recently, following a\ndecision of the heads of Governments of the South Pacific\nForum, the region has taken the initiative to negotiate\nwith distant-water fishing States the establishment of a\nregional fisheries management organization in order to\ngive effect to the provisions of the 1982 Convention on\nthe Law of the Sea and the Agreement relating to the\nConservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks\nand Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. This is an important\ninitiative which is designed to promote sustainable use of\nthe region's valuable fish resources to the benefit of both\nthe coastal States and distant-water fishing nations. We\nlook forward to a successful outcome to these\nnegotiations.\nAs Fiji was the first State to ratify the Convention\non the Law of the Sea, in 1982, I feel gratified that,\nthanks to the efforts of many, including my own country,\nin resolving the outstanding problems, the Convention\ntoday enjoys universal support and near universal\nparticipation.\nAll States benefit from the stability and certainty that\nhas been achieved in the new regime of the Law of the\nSea. By defining the jurisdiction of States in marine areas,\nand by setting out the rights and duties of States, the\nConvention represents an important contribution to\ninternational peace and security.\nThe institutions established under the Convention,\nnamely the International Seabed Authority and the\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, and the\nwork being done with respect to the oceans in the United\nNations itself, require the support of the international\ncommunity if the achievements of the Convention are to\nbe consolidated and its promise of benefits to the peoples\nof the world is to be realized.\nLast year, I lent my strong support to an early\nadoption of the draft United Nations declaration of the\nrights of indigenous peoples. I renew my call here.\nWe are informed in the United Nations Development\nProgramme's Human Development Report 1997 about the\nbleak future for indigenous people in almost all societies\nwhere they are to be found. It is a great tragedy indeed\n19\n\n\nthat indigenous people have seen their values and customs\ndestroyed by incoming population. They face discrimination\nin employment and disparities in education and they fare\nworse in the non-income dimensions of poverty.\nThe observation of the International Decade of the\nWorld's Indigenous People, the programme of activities\nassociated with it and the efforts of the international\ncommunity to prepare a draft United Nations declaration on\nthe rights of indigenous peoples, will mean little or nothing\nif the indigenous people remain a disadvantaged people in\nour world. The United Nations Voluntary Fund for\nIndigenous Populations, however meaningful, is a mere\ndrop in the ocean of what is required to really facilitate the\ndevelopment of the indigenous people. The World Bank\nprogramme to assist indigenous people is too limited in\nscope and application. The Member States of the United\nNations and the international community should do more.\nThe survival of the indigenous people is at stake.\nMy own country is the home of two indigenous\ngroups, Fijians and Rotumans, but it is also the home of\nothers who came into our country more recently. These\nnewcomers represent nearly half the population of my\ncountry. A major challenge for us has been to accommodate\nthe interests and aspirations of these citizens and to\nreconcile them with the sensibilities, perceptions and\npre-eminent status of our indigenous people. We are\nensuring peaceful co-existence and cooperation with\nsecurity and respect for the fundamental rights of all our\ncitizens.\nIt gives me great pleasure to address briefly recent\ndevelopments in my own country, Fiji, before this\nAssembly. Our delegation has kept the Assembly up to date\nwith political developments in our country, in particular our\nefforts to formulate a new Constitution that is acceptable to\nall the ethnic communities in the country. Our current\nConstitution, the 1990 Constitution, was promulgated to\nsecure adequate representation in Parliament for the\nindigenous people in order to guarantee, protect and\nenhance their future in their country. That Constitution was\nreviewed by a Commission last year. Following the\nsubmission of the report of the commission, a Parliamentary\nSelect Committee comprising representatives of all the\npolitical parties in our Parliament gave due consideration to\nthe report and reached a consensus to amend the 1990\nConstitution. The changes were written into the Constitution\nAmendment Bill of 1997 which was unanimously approved\nby the House of Representatives and the Senate and signed\ninto law by our President on 25 July 1997. The amended\nConstitution comes into effect on 27 July 1998.\nI do not intend to provide all of the details of the\nnew Constitution, except to say that it contains an\nentrenched Bill of Rights guaranteeing and protecting the\nequal rights and fundamental freedoms of all individuals\nand groups, irrespective of race, religion, gender or\neconomic status. In addition to an independent judiciary,\ncitizens will also have recourse to an ombudsman and a\nhuman rights commission in the protection of their basic\nrights. The Constitution continues to enshrine the full\nright of self-determination of the indigenous Fijian and\nRotuman people, including their right to maintain a\nseparate system of administration to safeguard their\ninterests and welfare.\nA unique feature of the Constitution is the inclusion\nof a Compact which recognizes certain principles,\nincluding the following: the preservation of the ownership\nof land, including the ownership of indigenous Fijian land\naccording to Fijian custom; the right of all persons to\npractice their religion freely and to retain their language,\nculture and tradition; and a commitment by all political\nparties and their leaders to cooperate in the formation of\na broadly based Government to ensure that the interests\nof all communities in Fiji's multi-ethnic and multi-cultural\nsociety are taken fully into account.\nIndeed, an innovative feature of our new\nConstitution is the provision for the formation of a multi-\nparty Government. This is to allow for the representation\nin Cabinet of all political parties that secure seats in\nParliament through general elections. We have no\ndoubt - in fact, we are very confident - that with the\ncommitment, goodwill and cooperation of all, this\npioneering approach of bringing all communities together\nin national decision-making, in government and in\nParliament, is the best way of consolidating and\npromoting enduring peace, unity and progress in our little\ncountry of Fiji. From our ethnic and cultural diversity, we\nare determined to build a strong nation with the full\nparticipation of all citizens and communities in it.\nWe are the world. We who are gathered here\nrepresent the Governments and peoples of the world. We\nhave it in our power to facilitate economic development\nand sustained economic growth that include the full and\nequal participation of the developing countries of the\nworld. Let us make it an international imperative.\nToday I call on all of us to rededicate ourselves\nanew to our commitment to the United Nations. Upon the\nhigh principles of mutual love, justice and care on which\n\n\n\nit was established, let us together make our world a better\nplace in which to live.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPlease\npermit me, Sir, at the outset, to offer my sincere\ncongratulations to you on your election to the Presidency of\nthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly. In the\nsame vein, our congratulations are directed to the members\nof the Bureau on their election. I wish to assure you of the\nfull cooperation of my delegation in the discharge of this\nheavy responsibility entrusted to you.\nI would also like to express my thanks to Ambassador\nRazali Ismail of Malaysia for the able manner in which he\ndischarged his responsibilities during his Presidency of the\nlast session. At this juncture, I would like to pay a special\ntribute to Mr. Kofi Annan for his deserved election as\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and for the able\nmanner in which he is carrying out his responsibilities.\nLooking at the agenda of this meeting, it is an historic\nmeeting of the General Assembly and you, Sir, will be\nremembered for many years to come. Personally, I feel\nproud and privileged to be associated with this meeting.\nLast year, here in New York, members of the Group\nof 77 and China elected my country, Tanzania, to the\nchairmanship of the Group. The last nine months or so in\nthat post have been a very exciting and challenging\nexperience for me and my colleagues at our Mission to the\nUnited Nations and for the entire Government of the United\nRepublic of Tanzania. We have been involved in several\nmeetings, debates and negotiations on behalf of the Group.\nI am glad to say that, despite some setbacks, notable\nsuccess and progress have been made in all our\nendeavours. All this was made possible through the\ncooperation, support and, above all, teamwork of all\nmembers of the Group. We thank all members for their\nsupport.\nTwo years ago, world leaders met here to celebrate\n50 years of the existence of the United Nations. Besides\ntaking stock of the progress made and the lessons learned,\nthe Heads of State or Government endeavoured to chart\nthe institutional framework and operational parameters\nthat could enhance the Organization's relevance and\neffectiveness in a changed international environment. In\nthis context, apart from the Organization's traditional\nroles of maintaining international peace and security and\nproviding humanitarian assistance, it was also found\nessential to place development cooperation issues at the\ncentre of United Nations activities. The United Nations\nitself needed to undertake appropriate reform measures so\nthat it would be better able to deal with the challenges of\nthe new global economy.\nTo facilitate the reform process in the socio-\neconomic field, developing countries participated actively\nand effectively in work on the Agenda for Development\nto ensure the successful conclusion of the negotiations of\nthis important process. These negotiations were completed\nin June 1997, and I should like to commend the Ad Hoc\nOpen-ended Working Group of the General Assembly on\nthis issue for its good work.\nBuilding on the outcome of recent United Nations\nconferences and other relevant agreements, the Agenda\nfor Development underscores that sustained economic\ngrowth is essential to the economic and social\ndevelopment of all countries, in particular developing\ncountries. While acknowledging the importance of\nnational policies and measures in the development\nprocess, the Agenda for Development calls for action\ntowards a dynamic and enabling international economic\nenvironment, including such aspects as an open, rule-\nbased, equitable, secure, non-discriminatory, transparent\nand predictable multilateral trading system and the\npromotion of investment and the transfer of technology\nand knowledge. Additionally, the Agenda calls for\nenhanced international cooperation in the mobilization and\nprovision of financial resources for development. It also\nunderscores the need for an effective, equitable,\ndevelopment-oriented and durable solution to the external\n21\n\n\ndebt and debt-servicing problems of the developing\ncountries.\nMany developing countries are not able to benefit\nfrom the twin processes of the liberalization and the\nglobalization of the world economy. These processes\nbenefit some countries while causing instability and\nmarginalization in others, particularly in developing\ncountries. The least-developed countries face the greatest\nrisk of further marginalization. This is why they continue\nto demand that such uneven trends be addressed, and that\nthe World Trade Organization and other related\ninternational organizations adopt specific and concrete\nmeasures to mitigate the adverse effects arising from the\nimplementation of the Uruguay Round agreements. These\nmeasures must include long-term financial and technical\nsupport, the transfer of technology, and the improvement of\nthe trade performance of the developing countries. It is also\nnecessary to ensure full and effective participation of the\ndeveloping countries in the international economic decision-\nmaking processes.\nConcerning financial flows, it is imperative to reverse\nthe overall decline in official development assistance and to\nachieve the agreed target of 0.7 per cent by the turn of the\ncentury. We appeal to developed countries to reaffirm their\ncommitments to meet this target. Other sources of\nconcessional external financial assistance should also be\nstrengthened to enable them without conditionalities to\nincrease resources for disbursement in support of the\ndeveloping countries.\nIn addition to official development assistance and\nmultilateral assistance, the growth in foreign direct\ninvestment in developing countries is of particular\nimportance. However, foreign direct investment portfolio\nflows are going to very few developing countries, those\nwhich are already growing fast; very little, or none, is\ngoing to the least-developed countries. For example, Africa\nhas received only a small proportion of the total net private\nflows, despite extensive reforms that continue to be\nundertaken. The challenge to the international community\nin this respect is to ensure that adequate capital and\ninvestment flows also reach the least-developed countries so\nas to accelerate their pace of development. This could be\ndone through, inter alia, the improvement of economic and\nsocial infrastructure in the least-developed countries.\nExternal indebtedness is one of the major obstacles to\nthe development efforts of many developing countries. It is\nacknowledged that even with sound economic policies and\nwith full appreciation of the debt-rescheduling arrangements\nin place, developing countries continue to face an\nunbearable debt-servicing burden. There is hence an\nurgent need for adopting durable solutions to external\ndebt and debt-servicing problems, particularly those of the\nheavily indebted poor countries. More also needs to be\ndone in terms of debt stock cancellation and forgiveness.\nWe appreciate recent initiatives to reduce debts, both\nthose within the Naples terms of the Paris Club, and those\nwithin the multilateral framework, such as the heavily\nindebted poor countries initiative of the World Bank and\nthe International Monetary Fund. However, the criteria for\neligibility should be more flexible to enable more\ncountries to benefit from these arrangements. As it is\nnow, it is almost a nightmare for a country to qualify in\nterms of conditionalities involved and the time it takes\nbefore reaping the first benefits after qualifying. It is like\nbeing so near yet so far.\nThe debate on development is closely interlinked\nwith that on the environment. In June this year, a special\nsession of the Assembly was held to review and appraise\nthe implementation of Agenda 21 five years on. It is\nregrettable that the special session came out with no\nconcrete agreement or commitments on the cross-cutting\nissues of financial resources and technology transfer. For\nwhile it was possible to agree on follow-up action on\nsome of the sectoral issues such as forests, energy,\nclimate change, desertification, fresh water and others,\nlack of concrete agreement on issues related to financial\nresources and technology transfer militates against\neffective realization of the little that was agreed upon.\nIn his statement at the special session on behalf of\nthe Group of 77 and China, my President, His Excellency\nMr. Benjamin William Mkapa, emphasized that all\ncountries should rededicate themselves to the Rio\nDeclaration in order to achieve the goals of sustained\neconomic growth and sustainable development. He further\nstressed the need for creating a more conducive\ninternational economic environment, to enable developing\ncountries to gain access to new and additional resources\nand technology on concessional and grant terms. I wish\nto reiterate that call today.\nOther major international conferences and world\nsummits held since 1990 will also come up for review in\nthe near future. It is our hope that a new spirit of\ninternational partnership in resolving the various socio-\neconomic problems facing, particularly, developing\ncountries will emerge and that international support for\nthe implementation of the various programmes of these\n22\n\n\nconferences will continue to be provided by the\ninternational community.\nIn recent years, South-South cooperation has evolved\ninto an important modality for addressing the development\nneeds of developing countries. We are convinced that\nSouth-South cooperation provides a sound basis for\npromoting economic growth and increasing technical\ncapacities for acceleration of development in the developing\ncountries. The Group of 77 and China pledge to intensify\nexisting cooperation and solidarity among its members with\na view to sharing development experiences and solving\nsome of the development problems facing them.\nI agree with the Secretary-General that reform of the\nUnited Nations is not an event but a process. General\nAssembly resolution 50/227 and the Secretary-General's\nproposals provide a basis for the discussion of United\nNations reforms. However, we strongly feel that emphasis\nshould be placed on the overall policy thrust and mission of\nthe Organization geared towards the strengthening of its\neconomic role.\nFurthermore, institutions that deal with economic\nissues, such as the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD), the United Nations Industrial\nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO) and the relevant\nEconomic and Social Council bodies and regional\ncommissions, should remain. They should also be\nstrengthened to ensure that the development concerns of\ndeveloping countries are taken fully into account.\nAs for the reform of the Security Council, my country\nstands for more democratization and equity in this crucial\norgan of the United Nations. We stand for the expansion of\nits membership in both the permanent and non-permanent\ncategories, with the additional members in the permanent\ncategory getting veto power. The expansion in both\ncategories should include not only Japan and Germany, but\nalso equitable representation of the developing countries of\nAfrica, Asia and Latin America.\nAll reforms must be conducive to realizing the broad\npurposes and principles of the Charter and to improving the\nefficiency of the United Nations in all areas. They must\nalso contribute to a more positive and effective United\nNations role in promoting world peace and development,\nand meet the aspirations of developing countries. I am\nconfident that we will be able to achieve a broad consensus\nas long as all of us engage in deliberations in good faith\nand with a readiness to consider all legitimate concerns.\nTanzania appreciates the changes that have taken\nplace in the area of disarmament. The threat of nuclear\nwar may not at present manifest itself in the ideological\nconfrontation of the past, but it has not gone away or\nreceded. It is still with us, and we should guard against\nany complacency that we are any safer today. Nations\nstill possess nuclear warheads, and new generations of\nthese weapons are being manufactured. The total\nelimination of these weapons must continue to be the\ncentral purpose of our disarmament agenda.\nWhile nuclear weapons still pose a potentially grave\nthreat to international peace and security, conventional\nones have had a devastating effect, particularly in areas of\nconflict. Among these are anti-personnel landmines,\nwhich maim and kill the innocent, even long after war\nhas ended. The effects of these weapons are evident all\nover the world, with their most violent manifestation in\ncountries such as Angola, Cambodia, Mozambique and\nBosnia. Tanzania has supported, and will continue to\nsupport, a worldwide ban of these weapons through the\nframework of the Ottawa process and looks forward to\nbecoming an effective party to the instrument just\nconcluded in Oslo, Norway. At the same time, we hope\nthat the elimination of anti-personnel landmines will not\nbe seen as an end in itself, but as part of the overall\nobjective of eliminating other weapons, especially\nweapons of mass destruction.\nAs the United Nations grapples with the challenges\nof peace and development, it is still faced with many\npolitical problems which need urgent resolution if\nhumanity is to prosper. From Latin America and the\nCaribbean to Europe, from Asia to the Middle East and\nAfrica, the United Nations is faced with the arduous task\nof promoting peace, democracy and good governance as\nthe enduring pillars of development.\nWe congratulate the people of Liberia for having\nconducted a successful democratic election, which, we\nhope, has ushered in a new era of peace in that country.\nNow, as they seek to regain their footing and begin the\narduous task of national reconciliation, healing and\neconomic reconstruction, they will need the support of the\ninternational community.\nAt a time when Liberia is emerging from destruction\nand suffering, we are deeply concerned that Sierra Leone\nis sinking deeper into chaos at the expense of peace,\ndevelopment and democracy for that country. The\nGovernment of Tanzania has associated itself fully with\nthe efforts made within the framework of the\n23\n\n\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) to restore\ndemocracy and constitutional rule in Sierra Leone. Even at\nthis late hour, we continue to hope that the Sierra Leonean\nmilitary will realize the folly of their misadventure and\nagree to return their country to constitutional rule. In the\nmeantime, the continuing efforts of the West African\nregion, and Africa in general, merit expanded support so as\nto put an end to the destructive cycle of military coups in\nSierra Leone.\nIn Angola, we continue to be concerned by the\nmanoeuvres of UNITA to stall the process of\nimplementation of the Lusaka accords. Our concern is given\nadded urgency by the steady degeneration of the situation\nin the country and the likelihood of a return to open\nhostilities and war, with all the destruction and suffering\nthat portends for the people of that country. We urge\nUNITA to abandon its obstructionist policies and abide by\nthe Lusaka peace accords. We hope the United Nations will\nremain engaged in Angola.\nThe situation in the Great Lakes region remains\nprecarious. The consequences of decades of misrule in\nsome countries of the region have been horrendous in terms\nof suffering, war, death and lost opportunities to harness its\ngreat development potential. We regret that the situation in\nBurundi shows no sign of improvement. The military\nauthorities have persisted in frustrating the efforts of the\nregion within the framework of the Arusha initiative, under\nthe chairmanship of Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, to facilitate\nthe process of political dialogue.\nTanzania and the other countries of the region are\npersisting in their efforts because we believe there is no\nalternative to dialogue but war and more suffering for\ninnocent civilians. The region has no other interest in\nBurundi but to help. At the regional level, meetings were\nheld in Arusha on 4 September, and the leaders reiterated\ntheir commitment to the search for peace in Burundi and\ncalled upon the military authorities there to abandon the\ncourse of confrontation and seek dialogue and political\naccommodation with all elements in Burundi.\nThe region has been categorical in restating that the\nBurundi authorities should be under no illusion that they\ncan bury their heads in the sand or wish the problem away.\nThey simply have to face reality and dutifully rise to the\noccasion. Certainly the region and the international\ncommunity cannot leave them alone and allow them to lead\nthe country into self-destruction and war, with all the\nattendant problems that creates for Burundi and its\nneighbours. I wish to appeal to the international\ncommunity to continue assisting the region so that our\ngoal of restarting the dialogue for peace in the country is\nachieved.\nIn Rwanda, fortunately, the situation is steadily\nstabilizing, particularly after the return of most of its\ncitizens, who had been coerced into a drifting life in exile\nas refugees. Yet the difficulties which face that country\nare enormous. The process of recovery from the immense\nmoral, physical and spiritual effects of the 1994 genocide\nwill be painful and slow. As Rwanda struggles to come\nto terms with the genocide, reconcile with itself and\ncontinue on the path of national healing and renewal, it\nneeds our solidarity and support.\nWith President Laurent Kabila's assumption of the\nleadership of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the\nprocess of returning to democratic rule has begun, albeit\nslowly. We realize that it will not be an easy or swift\nprocess, given the political rigidity and the policies of\npolitical exclusion to which that country was subjected for\ndecades. We appreciate the enormity of the task of\nputting the country back on its feet, restoring Government\ninstitutions and setting out towards democratic recovery.\nGiven this background, what the Government and people\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo need most is\nsolidarity, understanding and material support from the\ninternational community.\nThe political problems of the Great Lakes have\nprecipitated a grave humanitarian challenge as millions of\npeople have been forced into a life of exile as refugees.\nThis has placed an enormous burden on the countries of\nthe region, including my own, which has had to shoulder\nit without commensurate resources. We appreciate the\ngreat work done by United Nations agencies and many\nhumanitarian non-governmental organizations in terms of\nproviding the much-needed assistance to the refugees.\nIndeed, without this support, the life of the refugees\nwould have been most unbearable. Yet even with this\nmuch-appreciated assistance, the burden left to refugee-\nreceiving States has been enormous. The economic,\nsocial, environmental and security consequences of\nhosting the refugees will have long-lasting effects from\nwhich these countries will continue to suffer even after\nthe repatriation of the refugees has been completed. This\nraises the fundamental issue of assisting the asylum\ncountries, not only to cope with the immediate task of\nmeeting the needs of the refugees, but also with the long-\nterm effects of hosting them. This aspect needs\naddressing.\n24\n\n\nSomalia may no longer be on our television screens or\nworthy of the news headlines, but it is still a problem\nwhich must not be forgotten. The country is still\nfragmented, and fighting among the factions in conflict is\nnot yet over. There is a chance that through the Sodere\ninitiative there may be some positive developments. The\nUnited Nations needs to continue associating itself closely\nwith the efforts being expended by the Intergovernmental\nAuthority for Drought and Development and the\nOrganization of African Unity aimed at bringing durable\npeace to Somalia.\nIn Western Sahara, too, we are concerned by the\napparent freeze in the implementation of the settlement\nplan. As we reiterate our solidarity with the Frente\nPOLISARIO, we express the hope that the initiatives of the\nrepresentative of the Secretary-General, in the person of the\nformer United States Secretary of State James Baker, will\nbear fruit and remove the prevailing political difficulties in\nthe implementation of the settlement plan.\nTanzania continues to follow closely the developments\nin the Middle East which now threaten peace in the area. In\nthis regard, Tanzania reiterates its solidarity with the\nPalestinian people and calls upon the Palestinian and the\nIsraeli authorities to persist in their efforts to consolidate\ndialogue and move forward in elaborating permanent\narrangements for peace. We still believe that, ultimately,\nenduring peace in the region lies in the return of all the\noccupied Arab land and in the full enjoyment by the\nPalestinian people of its inalienable right to self-\ndetermination and independence, including the\nestablishment of a homeland for themselves within\ninternationally recognized boundaries.\nIn conclusion, as we move into the new millennium,\nthe world is still a place largely besieged by poverty and\nunderdevelopment, conflict and war. The giant leaps of\nscience and technology which have enabled humankind to\nexplore outer space and to shrink the world into a global\nvillage have so far not been adequately and evenly\nchannelled into meeting the compelling needs of the greater\npart humanity. The world will transit into the next\nmillennium divided between those who are prosperous and\nat peace and those living in abject poverty and at war.\nTherefore, it must be the overriding objective of the United\nNations to ensure that this disparity is overcome. The\nchallenge that we must all face is to strengthen this\nOrganization by unconditionally supporting it fully,\npolitically and financially to enable it to serve humanity\nbetter.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nwould like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-second\nsession.\nIt is a principle of today\u2019s world that political\nlegitimacy and democracy constitute the most civilized form\nof government. The United Nations must reflect this\nincreasingly universal principle by supporting the efforts\nbeing made by the Governments and peoples of the world\nthat are struggling to democratize their countries.\nAfter a decade of totalitarianism and struggles of\nresistance, the Nicaraguan people have chosen democracy\nas our system of government. Proof of this is the elections\nthat were successfully conducted in 1990 and in 1996,\nwhen I was elected President of Nicaragua and undertook\nto build a state of law and to lead my country along the\npath of democracy, reconciliation with justice and the\ninstitutionalization of the State.\nWe know that this is a difficult challenge. The\nGovernment over which I preside has made the\ncommitment to achieve economic and social development\nthat will make it possible to meet the basic needs of the\npopulation and to guarantee sustainable growth in the\nmedium and long term.\nWe are aware of the need to promote a national\ncommitment to democracy. To that end we have initiated\nan open, sincere national dialogue with different sectors\nof society, including the political parties, civil society and\nnon-governmental organizations, so that together we can\nfind the key elements for building a democratic political\nculture.\nMy Government is pleased to support the\nhemisphere\u2019s efforts, as coordinator of item 18 on the\nagenda of the Summit of the Americas, \u201cStrengthening of\nthe role of women in society\u201d. The Summit meeting\nwished to emphasize that the exclusion of women from\nthe tasks and benefits of development is a big obstacle to\nthe attainment of growth and democracy.\nThe entire world is in a process of change, and we\nbelieve that the United Nations system cannot remain on\nthe sidelines. Nicaragua congratulates the Secretary-\n\n\nGeneral on his dynamic vision, and we thank him for his\nreport entitled \u201cRenewing the United Nations: A\nProgramme for Reform\u201d (A/51/950).\nNicaragua has benefited from many programmes of\nthe system and its agencies, programmes which have had an\nimpact on its economy, health, social well-being, education\nand employment, to name just a few areas, and ultimately\non democratic development.\nMy Government considers the time has come for\nMember States to approve a greater leadership role for the\nSecretary-General. We are glad that the Secretary-General\nattaches special importance to peace processes and the need\nto improve the system\u2019s capacity to combat drug trafficking\nand terrorism. We support programmes to reduce arms and\nenhance human rights, as well as to strengthen the ability\nto respond in the best possible way to emergency situations.\nLikewise, my Government considers that development\nprogrammes and programmes for strengthening democratic\nsystems must not be affected. Our democracies still have\nenemies. A rapid response capacity is essential today.\nThe Security Council\u2019s present structure and its\nMembers\u2019 prerogatives belong to a bygone era. The days of\nthe cold war and a bipolar world are a thing of the past,\nand the number of States making up the international\ncommunity has increased substantially since 1965, the date\nof the last enlargement of the Council. It is therefore clear\nthat its present structure is neither equitable nor democratic.\nThe days of armed conflict in the Central American\nregion are over. In this very forum, all the nations of the\nworld have declared Central America to be a region of\npeace, democracy and development. Fortunately, we Central\nAmericans are daily getting closer to real and effective\nintegration.\nWe are aware of the urgent need to bring about\nprofound change in our institutional system in such a way\nas to respect our sovereignty, and laws, and the different\ncharacteristics of each nation, while allowing us to face\neffectively the challenges of the next century and to blend\nsuccessfully into global flows of trade and investment.\nDeeply resolved, the Central American Presidents have\nagreed to initiate a process of gradually establishing the\nCentral American union. To that effect, we announced in\nManagua on 2 September the decision to designate a high-\nlevel group to prepare the bases and the conditions for\nconstituting the union. We ask the international community\nto support this process unreservedly, for we consider it\ninvaluable for the strengthening of our democracy and the\nwell-being of our peoples.\nWe Central Americans do not want the destructive\nconsequences of war experienced in the 1980s to continue\ninto the twenty-first century. We still face humanitarian\nand economic problems because of the damage caused by\nthe presence of landmines and other explosive devices,\nwhich have caused irreparable losses to the civilian\npopulation and the national economy.\nThe United Nations has seen profound changes in\nworld events, including great transformations in Eastern\nEurope and the former Soviet Union. We are pleased to\nsee how democracy, the ideas of civil society and respect\nfor fundamental human rights are becoming predominant\ncharacteristics of today\u2019s world.\nI therefore note with great regret that the 21.5\nmillion people who live in the Republic of China are not\nrepresented in this great Assembly. What is going on,\nMr. President? Everyone knows that the Republic of\nChina signed the United Nations Charter in 1945.\nDomestically, it maintains government structures\nguaranteeing its people the exercise of their fundamental\nrights and freedoms. In no international forum dealing\nwith this subject has the Government of the Republic of\nChina been described as a violator of inalienable rights.\nThe countries of South-East Asia have seen how the\neconomy and democratic development of the Republic of\nChina have been significant factors in the region\u2019s\nstability. The international community can attest to the\nfact that the Republic of China bases its attitude on the\nprinciples that govern the United Nations Charter,\nparticularly in its peace-loving nature and its capacity to\nmake a positive response to the needs of the international\ncommunity.\nBearing these facts in mind, I appeal to the\nAssembly to amend resolution 2758 (XXVI), which\nexcludes the Republic of China from the United Nations.\nWe ought to maintain the principle of universality through\nthe equal participation of all the States of the world. The\nGovernment of Nicaragua considers that the Republic of\nChina should enjoy equal opportunity to participate in the\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies. We cannot\nforget the right of those who freely chose to live in and\nto build the Republic of China and who want their\ncountry to be recognized with full and effective\nparticipation at the heart of this Organization.\n2\n\nWe have a broad programme of work, which will\ncontribute not only to overcoming the obstacles that peoples\nand Governments face in achieving their goal of\nmaintaining and implementing fundamental values of\ndevelopment, social well-being and justice, but also to\npreparing for our entry into the twenty-first century with a\nrenewed and strengthened world Organization that can\nassist Governments to attain the well-being of their peoples.\nOn behalf of the Nicaraguan people, I ask God to\nbless the United Nations and all the peoples of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, at the\noutset, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nsecond session. I also wish to thank your predecessor, Mr.\nRazali Ismail, for his excellent work during the last session\nof the General Assembly.\nThe ongoing session of the General Assembly is\ncrucial in terms of showing the capability of the United\nNations to react adequately to changes in the global scene\nafter the end of the cold war, mainly in connection with\nproblems humankind faces on the eve of the new\nmillennium. We all know that if the United Nations is to\nmeet the expectations and needs of the new era, it must go\nthrough a process of reform. The Slovak Republic\nwelcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s report (A/51/950) entitled\n\u201cRenewing the United Nations: a programme for reform\u201d\nand supports his endeavours to streamline the work of the\nOrganization in order to achieve greater unity of purpose,\nstrategic deployment of resources, coherence of efforts and\nflexibility in response.\nThe suggestions included in the Secretary-General\u2019s\nreport reveal a firm determination to transform the United\nNations into a centre which takes an active part in\ngoverning international relations, in accordance with its\nmain principles enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations. Though one of the basic goals of the reform is\nto streamline the work of the Organization, along with\ncost-saving, the latter should not be the final goal of the\nreform, since this approach itself does not lead to the\nstrengthening of the United Nations system. Any reform\nof the Organization which would lead to a weakening of\nits position is not acceptable.\nThe financing of the United Nations is necessarily an\nintegral part of its reform, since continuation of the\ncurrent financial crisis has a grave impact on the\nperformance of the Organization. We believe the principle\nof honouring legal obligations \u2014 in this case, the\npayment of assessed contributions \u2014 should be a basis\nfor any solution to be adopted, although we understand\nthat a number of countries are in arrears to the\nOrganization because their rates of assessment do not\nreflect their capacity to pay.\nSlovakia belongs to a small group of countries \u2014\nso-called good contributors \u2014 having paid its regular\nbudget contributions in full and on time this year. With\nregard to our peacekeeping- budget assessment, the\nGeneral Assembly decided to allocate Slovakia to group\nC of Member States for the period 1993 to 1996. We continue to believe that there is no need to limit\nthis decision strictly to such a short period. Speaking in\nterms of capacity to pay, Slovakia simply belongs to group\nC of the Member States. For this reason, the General\nAssembly should no longer postpone its decision on the\npermanent allocation of Slovakia to group C of the Member\nStates for the financing of United Nations peacekeeping\noperations. We expect that the General Assembly at its\nfifty-second session will take a decision confirming the\npermanent presence of Slovakia in this group. It was also\non the understanding of the difficult financial situation of\nthe United Nations that Slovakia, on the eve of the fifty-\nsecond session of the General Assembly, paid in full its\narrears to the peacekeeping budget for the period 1993-\n1996.\nThe maintenance of international peace and security\nremains one of the main priorities of the United Nations\nand peacekeeping operations are a key instrument available\nin this regard. As experience in recent years has shown, the\nability to respond quickly with adequate mandate and\nmeans is a prerequisite to the successful completion of\npeacekeeping operations. The Slovak Republic fully\nsupports the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to build up the\nUnited Nations standby arrangement system and to establish\na rapidly deployable mission headquarters team. We are\nready to participate actively in this system while\nconsidering the allocation of appropriate means.\nPost-conflict peace-building is of crucial importance\nshould a conflict resolution achieve lasting results. In recent\nyears, the reconstruction of a conflict-torn society has\ninvolved a variety of actions. Many actors have been\nengaged in this process while lacking integrated\ncoordination. Therefore, we welcome the decision of the\nSecretary-General to make the Department of Political\nAffairs the focal point for defining objectives, criteria and\noperational guidelines in this regard, as well as his intention\nto strengthen the role of a special representative of the\nSecretary-General to be responsible for the implementation\nof peace-building initiatives in the field. At the same time,\nin our view, it is still necessary clearly to define the\ncompetence, interaction and feedback between the\nDepartment of Political Affairs and the special\nrepresentative of the Secretary-General.\nThe contribution of the Slovak Republic to the work\nof the United Nations rests first of all upon the concrete\nfulfilment of the primary purposes of the Organization, such\nas the maintenance of international peace and security.\nSlovakia has been currently contributing its troops and\nmilitary observers to the United Nations Transitional\nAdministration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western\nSirmium (UNTAES) in Eastern Slavonia and to the\nUnited Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA)\nin Angola. It also takes active part in the work of the\nSpecial Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, of which\nit became a member in April this year, and thus\ncontributes to the improvement of the planning and\ncontrol system of United Nations peacekeeping\noperations. On this occasion, I can state with full\nresponsibility that the Slovak Republic is interested in and\nis ready to continue contributing to United Nations\npeacekeeping operations.\nExperience has proven that small and mid-size States\nare capable of bearing their part of the responsibility for\nstability and security in individual world regions. In this\nconnection, the Government of the Slovak Republic has\ndecided to present its candidature for a non-permanent\nseat in the Security Council for the term 2000-2001. We\nbelieve that the candidature of the Slovak Republic, which\nis not currently a member and has no representative in\nany of the principal United Nations organs, can win the\nsupport of the Member States in order to increase the\nrepresentativeness and democratic nature of this body.\nAlong with the reform measures initiated and\nundertaken by the Secretary-General within his\ncompetence, a discussion of important issues that reside\nwithin the jurisdiction of Member States is under way. A\nnumber of stimulating as well as antagonistic opinions\nreflecting the complexity of the process have been\nformulated. The most evident example of this is the\nquestion of Security Council reform. It is in all our\ninterests that the Security Council\u2019s composition and\ndecision-making procedure reflect the significant changes\nthat have taken place on the international political scene\nduring the last three decades. The Security Council\u2019s\nreform should result in an enhancement of its legitimacy\nand representativeness, while maintaining its ability to\nreact promptly.\nIn our view, a new geopolitical situation on the\nglobal scene should be reflected in a new concept of the\nSecurity Council. Apparently, a decisive part of the\ngeneral membership is not ready for such a step and\npolitical circumstances have not sufficiently matured. At\nthe same time, the efforts aimed at restructuring the\nSecurity Council within a predetermined timetable, even\nin the absence of a general agreement, might be\ncounterproductive. Since Security Council reform is an\nextremely important and sensitive issue for the further\nexistence of the Organization, Slovakia prefers a\n2\n\n\ncontinued and thorough discussion in this regard without an\nartificial acceleration of the whole process.\nThe change of priorities in international politics after\nthe end of the cold war, in particular the utmost necessity\nto solve various socio-economic problems, seems to have\nshifted arms control and disarmament issues out of sight.\nConcerned about this negative trend, we feel that\ndisarmament should again be given priority in the United\nNations agenda.\nRecently, the Slovak Republic, as a new member of\nthe Conference on Disarmament, was honoured to chair that\nunique multilateral disarmament forum. We are convinced\nthat the Conference on Disarmament must play a further,\nindispensable role in solving the most important issues of\ninternational security, stability, peace, arms control and\ndisarmament.\nBesides the opening of concrete negotiations on the\nprohibition of the production of fissile materials for\nweapons and other explosive devices, we find especially\nimportant the question of a global and comprehensive ban\nof anti-personnel landmines. We understand the efforts to\nbring this issue to the Conference\u2019s agenda and the Ottawa\nprocess to be fully complementary. We highly appreciate\nthe agreement on the text of the Ottawa convention reached\nrecently in Oslo.\nThe Slovak Republic has been continuously engaged\nin a number of activities that contribute to the alleviation of\nthe consequences of the use of anti-personnel landmines.\nReflecting the provisions of the Ottawa convention on the\nprohibition of anti-personnel landmines, we would like to\noffer our assistance in mine-clearance programmes by\nputting at the United Nations disposal a mine-clearance unit\nthat would follow up on the very successful performance of\nthe Slovak Engineer Battalion in former Yugoslavia.\nWe welcomed with satisfaction the conclusions\nreached at the first session of the Preparatory Committee\nfor the Sixth Review Conference of the Parties to the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\nIt is important that the technical and formal approach to the\nwork of the Preparatory Committee has been altered, thus\nestablishing favourable conditions for the success of the\nReview Conference.\nThe Slovak Republic, which uses nuclear energy\nsolely for peaceful purposes, has supported all steps\ndesigned to lead to the elimination of nuclear weapons.\nAs one of the 44 countries needed to ensure the\nConvention\u2019s entry into force, the Slovak Republic is\nprepared to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT) before the end of this year. I would also\nlike to state that Slovakia has been honoured to chair the\nPreparatory Commission for the CTBT Organization.\nThis year\u2019s entry into force of the Chemical\nWeapons Convention can undoubtedly be considered the\nmost significant event in the field of disarmament. The\nSlovak Republic has been striving to strengthen the\nConvention through its active approach to the work of the\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.\nWe are proud to state that some of the Organization\u2019s\ninspectors were trained in facilities provided by the\nSlovak Republic. We are interested in continuing these\nactivities in order to help the Organization fulfil its\nverification and preventive functions.\nSupport for economic and social progress is one of\nthe basic missions of the United Nations. We welcome\nthe creation of a new Department of Economic and Social\nAffairs, and we believe that this will lead to its further\nstreamlining and efficient performance. The Organization\nis a unique forum that can facilitate close cooperation and\npartnership for development among Governments, civil\nsociety, the private sector and regional and global\norganizations.\nThe role of the Economic and Social Council, as set\nforth 50 years ago in the United Nations Charter, needs\nto be revised. In a time of changing social and economic-\ndevelopment philosophy, it is necessary to strengthen the\npolicy-management and coordination roles of the\nEconomic and Social Council, as well as its position in\nthe macroeconomic-policy-coordination dialogue. The\nreform of the subsidiary bodies of the Economic and\nSocial Council and the rationalization of their structure,\nwork and functions require, in our opinion, a careful\napproach, one to be taken with full respect for their\nautonomy while aiming at their further rationalization and\nconsolidation. The steps taken so far by the Secretary-\nGeneral in this field are pointing in the right direction.\nSlovakia, as a member of the Commission on\nSustainable Development and the Governing Council of\nthe United Nations Environment Programme, devoted\nconsiderable attention to the nineteenth special session of\nthe General Assembly. Although the special session has\nnot brought the expected results, we consider it an\n3\n\n\nimportant step in the global discussion on the strengthening\nof the principles of sustainable development.\nWe look forward with anticipation to the special\nsession of the General Assembly on drugs. That session,\nwhich will be held next year, should yield concrete results\nwith regard to combating the production of and trafficking\nin narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. As we all\nknow, drugs pose a real threat, mainly to younger\ngenerations.\nSince the Slovak Republic\u2019s establishment as an\nindependent State, it has been participating actively in the\nwork of one of the most important multilateral development\nbodies, namely, the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP). Slovakia has been a member of the\nUNDP Executive Board since 1993. The UNDP regional\ncentre for Central and Eastern Europe was established in\nthe Slovak capital, Bratislava, in June of this year. The\ncreation of this centre is a concrete example of the\nachievement of United Nations reform, in this instance of\nUNDP\u2019s efforts for decentralization at the country level and\ncutting the burden of administrative costs. The centre\u2019s\nfoundation has been actively supported by Slovakia, and\nuse has been made of my country\u2019s advantageous position\nas a bridge between UNDP secretariat activities at\nHeadquarters in New York and UNDP efforts in the\ncountries of Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States region. We are convinced that the\npresence of the UNDP regional centre in Bratislava will\nenable Slovakia to be even more active in development\ncooperation within the United Nations development group.\nHuman rights are a matter of the highest priority\namong the activities of the United Nations. Slovakia\nstresses the need for the consistent implementation of\nrelevant United Nations resolutions. In this regard we\nsupport the role of special rapporteurs appointed to selected\ncountries where systematic human rights abuses occur. We\nacknowledge the results the special rapporteurs have\nachieved in this field.\nThe Slovak Republic supports the ambitious proposals\nfor restructuring United Nations institutions dealing with\nhuman rights in order to create effective conditions for\nimproved protection of human rights. In this connection, we\nconsider it appropriate and necessary to harmonize the\nactivities of the Commission on Human Rights with the\nwork of the relevant expert committees established pursuant\nto international human rights treaties. At the same time, the\nSlovak Republic supports the creation of effective\nconditions for tripartite cooperation among Governments,\nthe United Nations and non-governmental organizations.\nHuman rights abuse has been the cause of a number\nof conflicts in many places on our planet, which are often\nfollowed by a humanitarian crisis on a massive scale.\nWomen and children are the most fragile sectors of any\nafflicted population. We must not forget this fact while\npursuing the purposes of the United Nations.\nI believe that the United Nations reform process will\nbe successfully completed in next few years. I find the\nSecretary-General\u2019s programme for reform to be an\nimportant step in this regard. The Slovak Republic is\nprepared to contribute to this process so that the United\nNations can approach the next millennium as a modern,\nviable, global body with the adequate authority to fulfil\nthe purposes embodied in the United Nations Charter.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\npeople and Government of Papua New Guinea, I wish to\njoin previous speakers in conveying our felicitations to you,\nSir, on your election to the presidency of the fifty-second\nsession of the General Assembly. The Papua New Guinea\ndelegation is confident that you will guide this session to a\nsuccessful conclusion.\nMay I also take this opportunity to express my sincere\ngratitude to your predecessor, His Excellency Ambassador\nRazali Ismail of Malaysia, for his energetic, visionary and\noutstanding stewardship in facilitating the work of the fifty-\nfirst session of the General Assembly.\nAt the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,\nworld leaders reaffirmed their resolute commitment to\nuphold the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter\nof the United Nations. They pledged their support for the\npivotal role of the United Nations in building international\ncooperation and partnership in development and in\nengendering trust and confidence among nations and\npeoples in order to foster world peace and security.\nNo human institution is perfect, and the United\nNations is no exception. It has nonetheless withstood the\ntest of time. The shortcomings of our collective\nendeavours have necessitated efforts for constructive\nreform and measures directed at strengthening and\nreinvigorating the United Nations, our paramount\nOrganization.\nPapua New Guinea has always believed, and\ncontinues to believe, in the utility of the United Nations,\nand in this context commends the Secretary-General, His\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his bold initiative in\nproposing for our consideration a comprehensive reform\npackage aimed at making the United Nations more\nresponsive to the changing international situation.\nIn his proposal, the Secretary-General emphasized\nthat the principal objective of the reform is not only to\nmake the United Nations efficient and effective but also\nto improve its delivery system and operational coherency\nthrough management innovations. Papua New Guinea\nfully supports these principal objectives of the proposed\nreform package. The overall direction of reform should\nand must be tailored towards strengthening the United\nNations system in order to better serve the needs and\naspirations of its Members. It makes eminent sense for us\nto move from merely debating issues to determining\npractical steps and strategies that would make our\nOrganization more responsive and capable of meeting the\never-changing challenges of globalization and\nmodernization as we enter the next century.\n\n\nThese changes are necessary to enhance public\nconfidence in the United Nations and to improve its\ncapacity to build partnership between Governments and\ncivil society. This will enable the Organization to meet the\ndaunting challenges of economic development faced by our\nglobal community and those posed by the political and\nideological differences afflicting nations today.\nThe proposed reforms stem in part from the need to\nensure the operational viability and sustainability of the\nactivities of the United Nations. Papua New Guinea is fully\naware of the predicament of the United Nations \u2014 starved\nof much needed financial resources for its operations to the\npoint of being insolvent. We cannot allow such a situation\nto persist.\nWe agree with and applaud the role of the\nOrganization in development \u2014 in framing structures and\npolicies that will enhance the technological capacities of\ndeveloping countries and improve their effective\nparticipation in international markets, including their access\nto credit and their ability to acquire information\ntechnologies.\nRegarding priorities, Papua New Guinea is gravely\nconcerned at the lack of full implementation of a number of\ninitiatives and programmes undertaken by the United\nNations, in particular with respect to such critical areas as\nthe empowerment of women, child care, the protection of\nour global environment, poverty eradication and sustainable\ndevelopment.\nIt is critical to be aware that organizational reform\nalone cannot guarantee the effective delivery of services.\nThe United Nations needs more than bureaucratic and\ntechnocratic innovations. It needs our concerted action. It is\ntherefore imperative that we as Members commit ourselves\nto encouraging the development of genuine partnerships and\nseriously take urgent and practical measures to remove the\nobstacles and barriers that exist between developed and\ndeveloping countries.\nIn addition to its traditional role in the maintenance of\npeace and security, this paramount international body must\nbe equipped and strengthened to do more in framing\ninternational treaties and standards and in encouraging\ninternational norms and practices that will bring about\nequitable economic development and social justice for all\npeoples. Equity and justice in all spheres of development\nshould be our ultimate objective.\nConsistent with the reform process, we see merit and\nvalue in revising the regional groupings within the context\nof the United Nations to reflect present geopolitical\nrealities. In this regard, we support the calls made by\nNew Zealand and others in the South Pacific region for\nthe consideration of their inclusion in the Asia-Pacific\ngrouping.\nI now turn to the question of the reform of the\nSecurity Council, which is an important decision-making\norgan of the United Nations on global security concerns.\nAs a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Papua New\nGuinea fully supports the declaration adopted by the non-\naligned Ministers at the twelfth Ministerial Conference of\nthe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries \u2014 held in New\nDelhi, India, in April 1997 \u2014 and reaffirmed more\nrecently in New York on 26 September last. The\ncomposition and modus operandi of the Security Council\nmust reflect the changes that have taken place since its\nformative years, and, more importantly, must mirror\ncurrent geopolitical and economic realities.\nPapua New Guinea believes that the reform and\nexpansion of the Security Council should be guided by\nthe principle of the sovereign equality of States and\nequitable geographical distribution. It should also take\ninto consideration the need for transparency,\naccountability and democratization of the working\nmethods and procedures of the Security Council,\nincluding its decision-making processes.\nThe reform of the Security Council should be\ncomprehensive and based on universal values in order to\nenhance its legitimacy. More importantly, the reformed\nSecurity Council should allow for equitable representation\nby developing countries. On the question of permanent\nmembership, we reiterate our position on the inclusion of\nJapan and Germany from the industrialized States and\nalso support the fair representation of developing\ncountries as additional permanent members, particularly\nthose that have the capacity and ability to contribute to\nworld affairs.\nPapua New Guinea strongly supports the view that\nthere should be no distinction in terms of the privileges\naccorded to permanent members, particularly in relation\nto the exercise of the veto power. In other words, all\npermanent members of a reformed Security Council\nshould enjoy the same privileges so as to maintain\ngeopolitical equity and balance.\n2\n\n\nIt is indeed ironic to note in this Assembly the\ncontradictory positions of some of our members, who\npurport to be champions and defenders of human rights\nissues and yet continue to maintain colonial situations that\ndirectly deny genuine democratic representation and the\nrights of people to govern themselves in a manner\nconsistent with their political aspirations.\nHaving achieved decolonization in many parts of the\nglobe \u2014 of which the United Nations can be proud \u2014 we\nwould be failing in our noble duty if we were to ignore the\nconcerns and aspirations of the peoples of the remaining 17\nNon-Self-Governing Territories, some of them in the South\nPacific, which are still struggling to establish their own\npolitical autonomy, and even to exercise their right of self-\ndetermination. Given the importance we attach to this issue,\nPapua New Guinea is gravely concerned that recent\ninitiatives in relation to the United Nations programme on\ndecolonization have seriously eroded the importance of the\npolitical essence of that programme and have impacted\nnegatively on it. We hope that this anomaly can be resolved\nquickly and amicably.\nPapua New Guinea wishes to recall that many of us\nrepresented here would not have taken our place in this\nforum had we not been allowed the opportunity to exercise\nthat right. We therefore urge this body to adopt a more\nserious and aggressive approach to the implementation of\nthe decolonization programme of the United Nations. At the\nrecent meeting of the South Pacific Forum in Rarotonga,\nCook Islands, the States members of the South Pacific\nForum reaffirmed their support for the decolonization\nprocess.\nThe Non-Self-Governing Territory of New Caledonia\ncontinues to be of great interest to the South Pacific Forum,\nand we have over the years followed developments there in\nrelation to the Matignon Accords. Early this year we\nmounted, with the help of the Government of France and\nthe authorities in New Caledonia, a Forum ministerial\nmission to the Territory. We are pleased to note that all\nparties to the Matignon Accords appear to be satisfied with\nthe progress made in implementing the Accords. Papua\nNew Guinea continues to recognize the right of the people\nof New Caledonia to self-determination and urges all\nparties in the Territory to maintain their commitment to\nreaching a negotiated solution as a successor arrangement\nto the 1988 Matignon Accords. This negotiated successor\nsolution must take into account the wishes of all\ncommunities, including concerns on the changing\ndemographic composition of New Caledonia.\nThe economic prosperity and political developments\nand changes in the Asia-Pacific region continue to be of\ninterest to Papua New Guinea. As a special observer of\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN),\nwe were heartened by the initiatives taken by ASEAN\nleaders to bring the belligerent parties in Cambodia to the\ntable for urgent negotiations for peace and security. It is\nour hope that the people of that ancient civilization will\nreturn to their daily lives in a peaceful and secure\nenvironment once more.\nThe ongoing difficulties in the Korean peninsula and\nthe competing territorial claims in the South China Sea\ncontinue to concern my Government, because they all\nhave a bearing on the overall maintenance of regional and\ninternational security, as well as on other forms of\ncooperation.\nWhile we do not understate the importance and\nvalue of our diplomatic relations with the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China, we have, however, on a number of\noccasions urged both Beijing and Taipei to resolve their\nfundamental differences with the aim of maintaining an\namicable coexistence.\nIn view of the changing international climate\ncharacterized by global interdependence, it is important\nfor all peace-loving States to make every effort to\nminimize areas of hostility that could seriously undermine\ninternational peace and security. The United Nations\ntherefore has an obligation to assist in maintaining a\nsecure global environment in which economic growth and\nother forms of development can continue to thrive for the\nbenefit and common good of all peoples of the world.\nIn its efforts to attain economic prosperity, Papua\nNew Guinea has had to engage all economic entities in\nour trade and commercial relations. Consistent with our\nobligation to assure our people of a better future, we\nintend to expand our economic ties with trading partners\nthat have demonstrated their willingness to assist without\nour having to compromise various aspects of our existing\nrelations with our partners.\nIt is in this regard that we recognize Taiwan as a\ndynamic economy and trading partner without\ncompromising our one-China policy. Since Taiwan\nparticipates in such organizations as the Asian\nDevelopment Bank, the Asia-Pacific Economic\nCooperation Council, the World Trade Organization and\nthe South Pacific Forum as a dialogue partner, I cannot\n3\n\n\nsee any reason why we should not deal directly with\nTaiwan on trade and economic matters.\nThe world has witnessed once again the derailment of\nthe peace process in the Middle East. We call on the\nleaders of both Israel and Palestine to cooperate with\nUnited Nations efforts to reach an amicable solution to\navert further violence, and to focus on the path to peace.\nPapua New Guinea strongly believes that the rights of the\nPalestinian people over their homeland and their freedom to\nestablish their own Government and identity are paramount\namong the conditions that could lead to enduring peace.\nWe are encouraged to see positive signs of\nappeasement in Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo. Nevertheless, given the tense\nsituation that exists in that region, we urge those in\npositions of authority, including all leaders in that part of\nthe world, to resolve their differences peacefully to prevent\nfurther bloodshed. In this context, we are heartened to see\nthe Organization of African Unity playing a critical role in\nthe endeavour to bring about peace and stability in the\nGreat Lakes region. The crisis in Sierra Leone needs urgent\nattention, and we join the Secretary-General\u2019s call to the\nleaders of the military junta and support his continuing\nefforts to encourage them to respect the rule of law and\nmake every effort to restore democracy in that country.\nOn the regional front, Papua New Guinea is taking a\nmajor initiative in setting up the Asia-Pacific Economic\nCooperation Council (APEC) regional centre in Port\nMoresby. We would like to offer our gratitude for the\nsupport given by the States members of the South Pacific\nForum in our efforts to set up this centre. The objective of\nthe APEC centre is to assist in the area of capacity-building\nin the economies of 13 small island developing States in\nour region as we prepare to meet the challenges of\nglobalization and liberalization. We are also grateful for the\nsupport provided by the United Nations Development\nProgramme.\nAt the recent summit of the Heads of the South\nPacific Forum countries, the leaders reaffirmed our\ncommitment to maintaining a nuclear-free zone in the South\nPacific consistent with the overall objectives of the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We\nwelcomed the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty and reiterated our support for banning the\ntransboundary movement of radioactive and other hazardous\nwastes in the region, and in particular for the Vienna\nConvention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the\ndraft Convention on Supplementary Funding.\nIn this context, we welcome the ratification by the\nUnited Kingdom of the protocols to the South Pacific\nNuclear-Free Zone Treaty, known as the Treaty of\nRarotonga. We are still hopeful that the United States of\nAmerica will do likewise, and call upon it to do so at the\nearliest possible opportunity.\nAt the last session of the General Assembly, we\nsought and forged new agreements, including our\nrelationship with the Organization for the Prohibition of\nChemical Weapons. We also expressed our support for an\ninternational convention to ban all anti-personnel mines,\nand have participated in the Ottawa process, most recently\nat Oslo. Like other members of this body, Papua New\nGuinea is making the necessary arrangements to become\na party to that historic Treaty when it opens for signature\nlater this year.\nIn a few months we will usher in the International\nYear of the Ocean. Like other South Pacific Forum\ncountries, Papua New Guinea has an affinity for the sea\nwhich cannot be overstated. It is, for the greater part, the\nsource of our livelihood.\nWe urge the United Nations to continue to play a\nmajor role in ensuring global awareness of sustainable\nuse, conservation and management of marine resources.\nIn this regard, we call on the international community to\ncoordinate efforts to implement the priorities agreed upon\nduring the special session of the General Assembly on the\nenvironment and sustainable development. We are gravely\nconcerned that much of the outcome of the special session\nwill remain the province of historians and academics, if\nnot given practical effect. We urge that greater attention\nbe given to the special needs and concerns of the small\nisland developing countries.\nAn environmental issue of great importance and\nrelevance to Papua New Guinea and other small island\nStates in the South Pacific region is the impact of\ngreenhouse gas emissions, which are causing rising sea\nlevels and changing weather patterns in many member\ncountries, especially low lying island nations.\nThis issue was given priority attention at the recent\nSouth Pacific Forum meeting in Rarotonga, Cook Islands,\nwhere the Forum countries expressed deep concerns about\nthe insufficient progress made by the countries which\ncontribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.\nAs a member of the South Pacific Forum, Papua\nNew Guinea strongly urges all countries concerned to\n4\n\n\nmake additional efforts in meeting commitments under the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(FCCC). We also urge all parties to the FCCC to consider\nfully the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) draft\nprotocol during the ongoing negotiations, especially at the\nforthcoming Kyoto conference, in order to pursue the\ngreatest possible level of net reduction in global greenhouse\ngas emissions by means of a legally binding protocol or\nother legal instrument.\nOn Bougainville, let me reassure this body that Papua\nNew Guinea, as I stated earlier this year in the United\nNations Commission on Human Rights, remains fully\ncommitted to a peaceful and enduring resolution of the\ncrisis. It is absolutely clear that the people of Papua New\nGuinea, including the majority of Bougainvillians, want\npeace and will pursue a peaceful solution by every available\nmeans. As in the past, we will continue to give the people\nof Bougainville every opportunity to participate fully in the\nreconciliation process.\nMy Government is mindful of the effects of the crisis\non our region, particularly of the spillover effects on our\nclose neighbours. We wish to take this opportunity to thank\nthe neighbouring countries in our region for their assistance\nin the peace process. I would like to acknowledge the\ncontributions of Australia and, in particular, New Zealand,\nin initiating and facilitating the peace conference of all\nBougainvillian leaders which resulted in the signing of the\nBurnham Declaration last July. A follow-up meeting \u2014\nBurnham Talks II \u2014 between Bougainvillian leaders and\nrepresentatives of Papua New Guinea\u2019s Government is\ncurrently under way in New Zealand. We are optimistic and\nconfident that we can resolve the crisis within the\nframework of the Papua New Guinea Constitution.\nLet me also take this opportunity to thank, on behalf\nof my Government and people, the previous and current\nGovernments of the Solomon Islands and their people for\ntheir tolerance and understanding, particularly when they\nhave had to bear the full weight of the spillover effects. I\nwant to thank them also for agreeing with us to put in place\nin the last 12 months two important bilateral treaties: the\ncomprehensive framework treaty guiding bilateral relations\nand the basic border agreement. These treaties set the\nparameters within which our bilateral relations are\nconducted, including the legal mechanisms for consultation\nand dialogue relating to a more effective management of\nour common border, which is critical to the containment of\nthe Bougainville crisis, including its spillover effects.\nMy Government also offers its gratitude to the\nleaders of the South Pacific Forum for recognizing\nBougainville as an integral part of Papua New Guinea,\nand for their acknowledgment of the peace efforts\nconcerning Bougainville by all parties involved, including\nBougainvillians and their leaders, the Papua New Guinea\nGovernment, and the Governments of the Solomon\nIslands, Australia and New Zealand.\nIn conclusion, let me echo what other speakers have\nsaid before me. As we prepare to meet the dawn of the\nnext millennium, let us commit ourselves to building\ngenuine partnerships in development that will ensure a\nsecure environment for our present and future generations.\nWe do not and should not expect guarantees, but we\nshall look far and wide in our search for safeguards. We\ndo not want and shall not seek handouts; however, we\ndemand equity and greater participation to foster and\nexpand opportunities for our peoples.\nIt is only through the development of genuine\npartnerships and the enhancement of equity and justice in\nglobal trade and investments that we can improve the\nsocio-economic conditions of our people, ensure their\nprosperity, and guarantee the safety of our global\nenvironment, without which there is no hope for the\nattainment of enduring peace in our societies today and in\nfuture. Only when such peace has been attained can we\ntruly say that we have lived up to our obligations, for the\ninterests and common good of humanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me pleasure to extend to the\nPresident and to the members of the General Committee, on\nbehalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates, our\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the\nfifty-second session of the General Assembly. His\nexperience and diplomatic skills will undoubtedly contribute\nto the success of its work. I would also like to express our\nappreciation to his predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail,\nthe Permanent Representative of Malaysia, who conducted\nthe work of the previous session with distinction.\nI take this opportunity also to congratulate His\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan on his election as Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations. We are confident that his\nvast experience in international affairs and his competence\nand expertise will strengthen the role of the Organization in\nachieving international peace and security. I am also\npleased to express, once again, our deep appreciation to the\nprevious Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, whose efforts had a positive and concrete\nimpact on the progress of the work of the world\nOrganization.\nThe present session is of special importance because\nof the major changes taking place on the world scene and\nthe attendant far-reaching developments and transitions in\nthe political, economic, social and environmental fields.\nDespite the state of openness that has characterized\ninternational relations, the success achieved in resolving\nsome conflicts and the emergence of indications of relative\nimprovement in the growth of the world economy, we are\nstill facing new types of challenges. The most serious of\nthese are reflected in racial, ideological, and ethnic\nconflicts and civil wars; the aggravation of poverty\nsituations; human rights violations; violence; terrorism;\nand drugs. All of these have a negative effect on national\nsecurity, the sovereignty of States and economic and\nsocial development. These challenges require cooperation\nand coordination between States at the bilateral, regional\nand international levels.\nThe important role played by the United Nations and\nits specialized agencies in dealing with these new\ndevelopments as a whole is now the major incentive for\nconsolidating its permanence, supporting its objectives\nand upholding its Charter. This means that, more than\never before, we must provide it with the political,\nfinancial and moral support that will enable it to respond\nappropriately and promptly to emerging global needs.\nHaving studied the report of the Secretary-General\non the reform and renewal of the United Nations, the\ndelegation of the United Arab Emirates welcomes in\nprinciple its recommendations and proposals aimed at\nstrengthening and developing the work of the\nOrganization and adapting it to the realities of the\npresent-day world. At the same time, however, we wish\nto stress the importance of having the reforms reflect the\naspirations of the countries of the world, particularly the\ndeveloping countries, in achieving sustainable\ndevelopment and in promoting peace and security,\nstability and growth.\nWe also support the international efforts aimed at\nenlarging and restructuring the Security Council and\nimproving its rules of procedure with a view to ensuring\nequitable geographical representation and equality among\nStates, achieving transparency and objectivity in the\nadoption of its resolutions and the follow-up to their\nimplementation, and preventing double standards, which\nhave proved to be too dangerous in many issues of peace\nand security. In addition, we support all proposals calling\nfor the strengthening of cooperation and coordination\nbetween the General Assembly, the Security Council and\nthe Economic and Social Council and for widening the\ncircle of dialogue and negotiations with regional\norganizations in order to achieve a broader, more\neffective and more comprehensive consensus for the\nappropriate approach to reform and renewal.\nDespite the initiatives and the relentless efforts of\nmembers of the Gulf Cooperation Council during the past\nfew years to contain the devastating effects of the\n21\n\n\nconflicts in the Arab Gulf region, which has great\nimportance to regional and international strategies, and their\ncontinuing endeavour to support progress towards joint\nreconstruction and cooperation, the unstable political and\nsecurity conditions in the region remain a source of concern\nfor us. Such a situation therefore requires the establishment\nof a balance based on a firm political will to support all\nregional arrangements aimed at eliminating the causes of\nconflict and situations of occupation. It also requires\nbuilding bridges for multilateral cooperation, at both the\nbilateral and the collective level, on the basis of the\nprinciples of peaceful coexistence, confidence-building,\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of others, mutual\nrespect for regional sovereignties and the resolution of\ndisputes by peaceful means rather than the use of force, in\naccordance with the rules of international law and the\nCharters of both the Organization of the Islamic Conference\nand the United Nations.\nThe continued occupation since 1971 by the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran of three islands belonging to the United\nArab Emirates \u2014 Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu\nMusa \u2014 is a major issue to which we and the other States\nof the region attach great importance. That occupation\nconstitutes a source of constant tension, concern and\ninstability in the region, particularly as the Iranian\nGovernment persists in changing the historic, legal and\ndemographic character of the islands by constructing\nmilitary and civilian installations and building bases on\nthem. Examples of such measures are the construction of a\nbranch of Bayan An-Nour University and two airports on\nthe occupied islands of Abu Musa and Greater Tunb. Iran\nhas also resorted to repeated military exercises conducted\nin the territorial waters of the United Arab Emirates,\nincluding those off the three islands, thus continuing to\nconsolidate its occupation of the islands, persisting in its\nprovocative policy and imposing a fait accompli by force.\nAll this is in complete disregard of the dangerous\nconsequences of this policy for the future and the territorial\nintegrity of the region and for the aspirations of its peoples\nto peace, stability and the achievement of sustainable\ndevelopment.\nThe United Arab Emirates expresses grave concern\nabout all such illegal actions and practices, which not only\nconstitute a flagrant violation of its territorial integrity and\nan infringement of its national rights, but are also\ncontradictory to the peaceful inclinations of the States of\nthe region and the world at large. We therefore renew our\ncall to the Islamic Government of Iran to fulfil its legal and\npolitical obligations and undo all its unilateral actions in the\nthree Emirates islands. This would prove that its intentions\nwere good and give credence to its stated policy,\nespecially given certain recent statements by some Iranian\nofficials calling for the resolution of existing disputes\nthrough peaceful means and expressing their desire to\nestablish stability and security in the region.\nThe United Arab Emirates welcomed the new\nIranian Government and its declared orientation,\nespecially with regard to the promotion of good-\nneighbourly relations, the elimination of tensions and the\npeaceful solution of disputes in the region. We hope that\nthe Iranian Government will consider all our peaceful\ninitiatives in a spirit of objectivity and cooperation. These\ninitiatives have already been supported by sister, friendly\nand other States, and call either for serious bilateral\nnegotiations, without preconditions, to be entered into, or\nfor the dispute to be submitted to the International Court\nof Justice.\nResorting to policies of violence and force,\nstockpiling banned weapons and using terrorism to deal\nwith the concerns about the political and security balance\nin the region must not become an alternative to dialogue\nor to efforts to bolster the mechanisms for building peace\nand achieving the economic and social development of\nthe countries of the region. For this reason, we support all\nmeasures taken by the States of the region to protect their\nsovereignty, security and territorial integrity.\nWe stress the importance of full respect for the\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Iraq\nand consider that the suffering of the Iraqi people should\nbe dealt with within the framework of implementation of\nSecurity Council resolution 986 (1995).\nWe also urge the Iraqi Government to carry out in\nfull all its legal obligations under the relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions, especially those dealing with the\nrelease of all prisoners of war and detainees who are\ncitizens of Kuwait and other countries, and the restitution\nof Kuwaiti property.\nThe peace process in the Middle East is at a perilous\njuncture as a result of Israeli Government policies\nreneging on most of its obligations with regard to the\npeace process and the principle of land for peace, which\nare based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and\n338 (1973). Such policies constitute a flagrant violation\nof humanitarian law, international legitimacy and the\naccords concluded between the Palestinian Authority and\nthe Government of Israel, as do the ensuing serious\nactions, including the expansion of illegal settler activities\n22\n\n\nin Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since\n1967, particularly in Jerusalem; the expropriation of\nPalestinian lands and the demolition of houses; resort to\nalleged security reasons in order to carry out measures of\ncollective punishment; and the imposition of an economic\nblockade.\nThe United Arab Emirates strongly condemns all such\nirresponsible Israeli policies and actions, and reiterates the\nimportance of continuing the peace process as the only\nalternative for the stability and security of that region,\nregardless of the obstacles and challenges it is facing. It\ncalls upon the international community, especially the\nUnited Nations, and the sponsors of the peace process to\nshoulder their legal, political, historical and humanitarian\nresponsibilities.\nWe welcome the efforts of the Secretary of State of\nthe United States of America during her recent tour of the\nregion and hope that she will continue her endeavours to\nensure that the Palestinian-Israeli accords are implemented\nand that negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks are\nresumed on the basis of the principle of land for peace and\nthe inadmissibility of unilateral actions that would only\nprejudice the final phase of the negotiations. We also\ncommend the tireless efforts of the countries of the\nEuropean Union to persuade the Israeli Government to\nreverse its policy and seriously abide by all of its\ncommitments in the context of the peace accords and\ninternational legality, in a manner that would enable the\nPalestinian people to exercise their legitimate rights to self-\ndetermination, repatriation and the establishment of their\nindependent State on their national soil, with Jerusalem its\ncapital.\nIn the same context, and given that the other Arab\nparties adhere to the peace process as a sine qua non\nstrategic objective strategy, the Israeli Government must\nmake a similarly serious commitment to end its occupation\nof, and repeated attacks against, the territory of Lebanon in\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978)\nand to resume unconditional negotiations on the Syrian and\nLebanese tracks so as to ensure its full withdrawal from the\nSyrian Arab Golan to the lines of 4 June 1967, as well as\nfrom southern Lebanon and the west of the Bekaa valley.\nThe requirements of security, stability and a just and\nlasting peace in the region are urgent not only for Israel,\nbut for all the countries of that region. Consequently, we\nemphasize the inalienable right of peoples to resist\noccupation and aggression and condemn all forms of\nterrorism, whether they are aimed against individuals or\npractised by States, because terrorism has a direct impact\nin undermining regional and international stability and\nsecurity. We also regard the stockpiling of banned\nweapons and the threat of their use against other States as\nanother dangerous manifestation of terrorism. We\ntherefore urge the international community and the\nrelevant international organizations to make effective\nefforts to render the region of the Middle East and the\nArab Gulf a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction,\nincluding nuclear weapons, and to demand that Israel\naccede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) and comply with the international control\nand safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy\nAgency.\nEfforts by the United Nations and the regional\norganizations to deal with national and regional tensions\nand conflicts, as well as with the concomitant destruction\nof development infrastructure and human suffering in\nsome developing countries, have not resulted in the\ncontainment of the causes or extent of such conflicts. In\nthe European continent, for example, manifestations of\ntension and ethnic and racial bias still persist among some\nfactions in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a result of the\ncontinued pursuit by certain Bosnian Serbs of policies that\nconflict with the peaceful solutions of the Dayton peace\naccords. There are also situations of tension, insecurity\nand conflict battering parts of the continents of Asia and\nAfrica, such as Afghanistan, Somalia, the Great Lakes\nregion and other areas. It is therefore imperative that\nmore effective international and regional efforts be made\nin order to find peaceful and objective solutions to those\nconflicts. We also call upon the parties directly concerned\nto work and cooperate with efforts and endeavours\ndesigned to contain such situations in order to achieve\npeace and stability at the national and regional levels.\nThe first positive results achieved by globalization,\ndevelopment and the growth of world trade have not met\nthe expectations of countries in advancing and\nstrengthening their development or environmental and\nsocial policies. This is particularly true in the developing\nand least developed regions that continue to suffer from\nthe spread of poverty, unemployment and illiteracy, as\nwell as the burden of foreign debts, in addition to\nfluctuations in the rates of exchange and several other\nproblems.\nThe creation of an equitable and just economic\nenvironment built on a foundation of cooperation requires\njoint efforts by developing countries on the one hand, and\nby developing and developed countries on the other. We\n23\n\n\nmust also take into consideration the special requirements\nof the least developed countries, in particular by increasing,\nrather than decreasing, official assistance to them and by\nlifting existing trade barriers and economic obstacles. This\nwould contribute to a sharing of common responsibilities\nand interests among them. We also support all efforts aimed\nat promoting and enhancing the role of regional and\ninternational development organizations, at the forefront of\nwhich are the World Trade Organization, the World Bank\nand others, each within its own mandate, in the\nimplementation of a global strategy for comprehensive\ndevelopment.\nIn seeking to enhance its participation in such regional\nand international institutions, the United Arab Emirates,\nthanks to the wise guidance of its Head of State, His\nHighness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, has achieved\na qualitative and quantitative leap in the developmental,\neconomic, social, environmental and human fields in the\npast two decades. It contributed, to a large degree, to the\nexpansion of the bases for investment,\ncommerce, industry and the liberalization of trade. It\ntherefore continued to provide development assistance to\nthe developing and least developed countries, including,\nfor example, humanitarian assistance and concessional\nloans provided by the Abu Dhabi Development Fund, the\nZayed Benevolent Society and other multipurpose\nhumanitarian institutions. Within the framework of our\ncommitment to enhancing the contribution of the private\nsector in supporting the activities of the United Nations,\nwe are pleased to announce that we shall be hosting a\nconference on the role of the private sector in supporting\nthe United Nations, which is scheduled to be held in the\nEmirate of Dubai in mid-October. That will be in line\nwith our policy of continuing to hold a series of\nmultifaceted regional and international conferences and\nexhibitions in the cultural, social, economic, political and\nenvironmental fields. All these are regarded as\ncomplementing the United Nations efforts in the various\nareas of sustainable development.\nIn conclusion, I should like to stress the need to\nadopt values of security, peace and freedom as the\nformula for attaining a deeper understanding and a more\ncomprehensive view of the issues of our common destiny.\nLet us, then, unite our efforts in building a world based\non respect for the rule of law and justice, a world where\npeace, tolerance, prosperity and progress reign supreme."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn\ntaking the floor for the first time before this Assembly, I\nfeel legitimately proud to be the voice with which the\npeople of Chad, its Government and its President, His\nExcellency Mr. Idriss D\u00e9by, convey a message of peace,\nhope and wishes for complete success in our work.\nI would like to join the eminent speakers who have\npreceded me in reiterating my delegation\u2019s warm\ncongratulations to the President on his illustrious election to\npreside over this session. That choice is both a tribute to his\ncountry, Ukraine \u2014 a country resolutely focused on the\nquest for global peace \u2014 and the culmination of his long\ncareer as a talented diplomat. He can be assured of the\ncomplete support of my country, Chad, in the discharge of\nhis duties.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to express\nour gratitude to his predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail,\nwho has conducted the work of the fifty-first session with\ntact, competence and devotion.\nLastly, I would like to greet our Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, a son of Africa who has succeeded\nanother great African, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. The\nelection of Mr. Kofi Annan is the culmination of a\nbrilliant career devoted to the service of the international\ncommunity. It is an honour to his country, Ghana, and to\nall Africa. I should like to assure him of the firm support\nof the Republic of Chad in his efforts to bring about the\nnecessary and indispensable reforms of our Organization\nso as to make it more capable of achieving the purposes\nand principles of the Charter in our rapidly changing\nworld.\nThe ideals of peace, liberty and development, which\nare pursued tirelessly by each and every nation\nrepresented here, are of special significance for my\ncountry and people. Indeed, drawing upon the lessons of\nits sad experiences, since 1 December 1990 Chad has\nmade a firm commitment to the establishment of a state\nof law and the tireless quest for peace and national unity\nwhich are the essential foundations for its economic and\nsocial development.\nAt previous sessions the delegation of Chad\nregularly referred to positive developments in our country.\nToday I have the honour and privilege of announcing that\nwith the presidential election of 1996 and the legislative\nelections held at the beginning of this year, most of our\nrepublican and democratic institutions are in place.\nProjects are under way to hold local elections. All this is\ntaking place in a climate of peace and national harmony.\nThe ongoing quest for peace between Chadians, the\nnecessary consolidation of the achievements of national\nunity and the willingness to involve everyone in public\nadministration have compelled our President, Mr. Idriss\nD\u00e9by, to practise what we call consensual, participatory\ndemocracy. It follows that all political parties, including\nthose of the opposition, are represented in all State\nstructures. By the same token, a national mediator has\nrecently been appointed.\nThe fifty-second session of the General Assembly\ncoincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. This is the proper place to\nreaffirm our loyalty to that instrument, which, despite its\nimperfections, is, in its own language,\n14\n\n\n\u201ca common standard of achievement\u201d. (Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, resolution 217 (III),\npart A, operative paragraph)\nIn Chad we are getting down to work, and significant\nprogress has been registered. Thus, our independent press\nis one of the freest in Africa; human rights organizations\nare proliferating and carry out their activities unhindered;\nand organized civil society is fully playing its role.\nDespite these noteworthy advances, insidious\ncampaigns have been sporadically unleashed against my\ncountry. For my Government the subject of human rights is\nnot taboo. Thus, I should like once again to reiterate the\ninvitation that Mr. Idriss D\u00e9by, President of the Republic,\nextended during his last visit to France to all countries and\nhuman rights organizations that are truly interested in the\nfate of the people of Chad: to come to Chad and freely\nlook into the situation.\nWith the return to social peace and political stability,\nmy country is turning a new page in its history, one that\nshould enable it to face the challenges of the twenty-first\ncentury. To do that, the Government of Chad has adopted\na number of principles that, backed up by concrete actions,\nshould make it possible to achieve vigorous and sustained\neconomic growth. The objectives are the following: the\ncontinuation and consolidation of the process of\ndemocratizing political and social life; the increased\nparticipation of the citizens in political, economic and social\nlife and in making decisions that concern them; the\nestablishment of sound rules of government; the promotion\nof the private sector; the development of human resources;\nand the restoration and safeguarding of environmental\nequilibrium and of the ecosystem, with special attention\nbeing paid to environmental problems related to human\nactivities.\nThis entire development strategy will be presented and\ndiscussed at the round table on Chad to be held in Geneva\nin the months ahead. That meeting is necessary to reactivate\nand adapt the plan of orientation covering the period 1990-\n2000.\nI take this opportunity to invite all countries and\nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to\ntake part in that important conference on the future of\nChad.\nI should now like to touch on a problem that is of\ncrucial importance for my Government: the environment.\nChad is a Sahelian country, afflicted, moreover, by drought\nand desertification. It is deeply concerned with protecting\nthe environment, our common heritage, whose\nexploitation for us is a necessary condition for success in\nthe struggle against poverty. This is the appropriate forum\nin which to express our hope that the results achieved by\nthe Conference of States Parties to the Convention to\nCombat Desertification will meet our expectations.\nThe prospect of the exploitation of Chad\u2019s oil\nresources has led to a systematic disinformation campaign\nalleging environmental degradation in the region\nconcerned. I should like solemnly to state here that all\nnecessary measures have been taken by the Government\nnot only to preserve environmental balance but also to\nprevent any risk of accident that could jeopardize it.\nAnother subject of grave concern indirectly\nconnected with the environment is that of mines, an\nestimated 1 million of which infest a large portion of the\nnational territory, thus precluding any development\nactivities in that region. We would reiterate in this respect\nthe appeal for assistance in mine clearance that was made\nfrom this rostrum by President Idriss D\u00e9by during the\ncommemorative meeting on the occasion of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations. My Government, a\nvictim of the scourge of mines, welcomes the adoption on\n18 September last of the Convention on the Prohibition of\nthe Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\nPersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction.\nThe international situation remains alarming, even if\npeace ad security are not gravely threatened at the global\nscale. In Africa, despite the hopes born of the\ndemocratization of the political life of many countries,\nhotbeds of tension still persist. In Angola, implementation\nof the settlement plan advocated by the international\ncommunity is running aground on obstacles that\njeopardize a final return to peace in this country. We call\nagain on all parties, particularly UNITA, fully to\nimplement the Lusaka Protocol.\nPeriodic clashes remind us that in Somalia, the\nhatchet has not definitely been buried, despite numerous\nattempts at reconciling the fraternal Somali people.\nThe Great Lakes region is progressively entering a\nphase of relative calm despite sporadic incidents\nstemming from the chain of events that have caused\nupheaval in this part of the continent. We welcome the\nconcerted efforts of the international community and of\nthe countries of the subregion to help restore a definitive\npeace.\n15\n\n\nIn Sierra Leone, the situation resulting from the coup\nis far from responding to the wishes of the people. Chad,\nfor its part, strongly supports the consultations held within\nthe framework of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States, and in particular the conclusions of its last\nSummit, held in Abuja, Nigeria.\nIn Central Africa, closer to Chad, the exacerbation of\nthe conflict in the sister Republic of the Congo, despite the\nappeal made at Libreville by eight Heads of State on 15\nSeptember last, is of great concern to us. My country is of\nthe view that only an immediate and unconditional cease-\nfire can make it possible to re-establish dialogue between\nthe two parties. This in turn would make possible a greater\ninvolvement of the international community, particularly for\nthe deployment of a multinational force under the auspices\nof the United Nations and the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU).\nThe scope of the tragedy of these upheavals on the\nAfrican continent can be gauged by the number of\nhomeless and of refugees who, left to their own devices,\nare wandering from country to country, seeking a land to\nreceive them where they can live in peace. It is urgent for\nthe international community to take greater notice of these\ntragedies, which concern us all, in order to find appropriate\nsolutions.\nThis sombre picture of the situation on the continent\ndoes not eclipse the successes of international and, above\nall, African mediation in crisis and conflict situations, such\nas in the Central African Republic and in Liberia. In the\nCentral African Republic, the painstaking settlement of the\npolitical and military crisis to the satisfaction of the\npolitical class is, for Chad \u2014 a neighbouring, brotherly\ncountry \u2014 cause for satisfaction. Likewise, we welcome\nthe return to peace in Liberia, which has made it possible\nto designate a President of the Republic and a Parliament\nby means of free and democratic elections.\nIn both cases, the contribution of Africa was decisive.\nWe are proud of this, just as we commend the Security\nCouncil for its support of various African initiatives. This\ncompels me to urge the acceleration of the process leading\nto the establishment of an inter-African peacekeeping force.\nWe also urge the strengthening of existing structures, such\nas the Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions\nin Central Africa; the Regional Centre for Peace and\nDisarmament in Africa at Lom\u00e9, in Togo; and the OAU\u2019s\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\nResolution.\nWith respect to Western Sahara, Chad welcomes the\nfresh impetus given the process by both parties and hopes\nthat the settlement plan will shortly be implemented in\nfull.\nIn the Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian peace\nprocess seems to be put to the test, given recent\ndevelopments in this region. We urge all parties\nconcerned to respect the Washington agreements. This is\nthe only alternative if we are to achieve definitive peace\nin this region. Neither violence nor extremism, nor,\ncertainly, intransigence will allow us to arrive at a just\nand definitive solution to this crisis, which has gone on\nfar too long.\nIn Asia, the situation in Afghanistan and in\nCambodia can be solved only by political means.\nTherefore we urge the protagonists to gather around the\nnegotiating table and seek to resolve their differences.\nChad welcomes the progress, however slow, that has\nbeen registered in recent years in disarmament. We\ndenounce, however, the shocking trade in conventional\nweapons, which foment so many conflicts that ravage\nvarious parts of the world, including my country. We\ntherefore support the efforts initiated in western Africa\nrelated to the moratorium on the export, import and\nproduction of small arms.\nMy country reaffirms its unswerving faith in the\nvirtues of dialogue as a means of resolving conflicts\nbetween States. I should like in this connection to refer to\nthe question of the embargo that has so harshly and for so\nmany years afflicted the neighbouring and brotherly\ncountry of Libya. Chad is in a good position to gauge the\nconsequences that affect not only the people of Libya but\nalso the people of Chad, as that country\u2019s neighbour. That\nis why, as a country that is dually cut off and deprived of\nits principal means of evacuation and supply, Chad firmly\nsupports the resolutions of the OAU, the Organization of\nthe Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement,\nand calls for the lifting of this unjust embargo. We should\nlike to take this opportunity to express our solidarity with\nthe people of Iraq and Cuba, who have been\nindiscriminately affected by similar measures.\nMy country has noted with satisfaction the end of\nthe bipolar world, which has made possible the advent of\na new type of constructive dialogue that will enable us\ntogether to meet the challenges of the twenty-first\ncentury. In resuming diplomatic relations with the\nRepublic of China, the Government and people of Chad\n16\n\n\nhave no intention other than to diversify their relations of\nfriendship and cooperation with all peace- and justice-\nloving countries of the world on the basis of equality and\nsolidarity. In the name of the principle of universality so\ndear to our Organization, we support the return of the\nRepublic of China to the concert of nations.\nWhile the conflicts and other tensions throughout the\nworld concern us, so too does the international economic\nsituation. The justifiable fear expressed by the developing\ncountries in the aftermath of the cold war has not been\nmitigated. The recent report of the United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development reminds us of this.\nPoverty in the developing countries and the impoverishment\nof important social strata in the developed countries provide\nfertile ground for intolerance, extremism and nationalism,\nwhose consequences we are all too familiar with. Despite\nthe numerous dense documents adopted at major\nconferences, the expected concrete action has run aground\non the selfish conduct of the richest. Such an attitude\nimposes limits upon the globalization of the economy.\nAfrica, which has benefited from the sustained\nattention of the international community during this decade,\nis still, unfortunately, a continent ravaged by poverty,\nmalnutrition and epidemics of all kinds on a large scale.\nTo the perpetual problems of indebtedness and the\ndeterioration of the terms of trade are added the constant\nmarginalization of our continent from the international\neconomic circles. It is therefore urgent for concrete\nmeasures to be taken so that Africa can experience\nsustained growth, which should lead to genuine\ndevelopment. The terms of the declaration of the Heads of\nState and Government of the seven most industrialized\ncountries and Russia in Denver last May should be made a\nreality in this respect so that Africa, whose well-known vast\nnatural resources can really become part of the world\neconomy.\nThe new Chad reiterates its unswerving support of\nUnited Nations action in the sphere of peacekeeping and in\nthe area of development activities.\nOver time, the reform of our institution has become an\nimperative. Therefore, in the context of globalization and\ninterdependence, the United Nations must adapt itself and\nbecome both the instrument and the expression of\nmultilateralism in which the interests of all are taken into\naccount and safeguarded. For our part, we consider that the\npromotion of development must be at the core of our\nrenewed Organization.\nThe United Nations deserves more confidence than\never before, provided that it derives from incontrovertible\nlegitimacy which the Security Council with its present\ncomposition is far from embodying. It has now been\nestablished that that irreplaceable body should be adapted,\nbut its necessary restructuring should not have a\ndetrimental effect on any part of the world.\nAn acknowledgement of the legitimate claims of the\nvarious groups that make up our Organization is therefore\nindispensable. Chad, for its part, reaffirms the position\nstated at the last Summit of Heads of State or\nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity to\nassure the equitable representation of the African\ncontinent in that body, in which the destiny of peoples is\nat stake. This is a requirement if the renewed Security\nCouncil is to be credible and effective in the service of\nhumanity and if it is not to be a Council of double\nstandards.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to congratulate the\nPresident on his election and express my confidence in\nhis leadership during a crucially important session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I wish to assure him that Latvia\u2019s past\nexperience of fruitful bilateral cooperation with Ukraine\nwill guide the delegation of Latvia in pursuit of our\ncommon tasks at this session of the Assembly.\n20\n\n\nI wish to recognize with gratitude Ambassador Razali\nIsmail of Malaysia for his determined leadership during the\nfifty-first session of the Assembly, as well as of its General\nCommittee, of which Latvia was a member.\nAt the outset I will address the need for United\nNations reform, follow that with a response to the reform\nproposals of the Secretary-General, and, finally, inform the\nAssembly about Latvia\u2019s recent experiences with reforms.\nRecent history suggests why reforming our\nOrganization is essential. In 1945 many delegates to the\nfounding conference of our Organization travelled to San\nFrancisco by train and by sea. Delegates to the fifty-second\nsession of the General Assembly have travelled to New\nYork by air. They communicate with their capitals by very\nfast electronic means that did not exist 50 years ago. These\nadvances in the technology of travel and information have\nfacilitated an enormous and continuing expansion of\ninternational activities by ever greater numbers of State and\nnon-State actors.\nMost important for the United Nations is the\nexpansion of international activities by state actors other\nthan members of foreign services. The participants in these\ntransgovernmental activities come from many governmental\ninstitutions: the courts, police, central banks and regulatory\nagencies.\nState as well as non-State actors form successful\ntransnational organizations that are independent of the\nUnited Nations system. These organizations can be\ncompetitors and cooperating partners for the United\nNations. A United Nations that does not continually evolve\nto offer a coherent response to changing global conditions\nis a United Nations that risks becoming irrelevant.\nThe world needs a United Nations that can contribute\neffectively to the solution of complex global problems, such\nas those caused by the three-fold increase since 1945 of\nboth the global population and the number of independent\nStates. It needs a United Nations that will be a leader in the\nshaping of a new and workable international political order\nto fill the place vacated by the bipolar order of the cold-war\nera. This will be done best by a United Nations with\nuniversal membership.\nLatvia believes that the package of reform proposals\nwhich the Secretary-General has presented to this Assembly\ncontains measures which will enable the United Nations to\nrespond to the imperative of organizational evolution.\nLatvia views this package as a work in progress, rather than\nas completed reform proposals for the long term. But\neven if the proposals are imperfect or not complete, they\nare the best this Assembly has before it. Latvia will\nsupport the reform package as a good springboard for\nreform and hopes that other Member States will do the\nsame.\nDuring the next few months, the General Assembly\nand the Secretary-General will need to work together to\nbegin the process of implementing the reform package.\nThe Secretary-General will have to report regularly to\nMember States on the progress of the reforms. He will\nhave to develop implementation plans for\nrecommendations approved, on the basis of informed\nconsiderations, by the General Assembly and other United\nNations organs. This Assembly will have to elaborate\nfurther the procedure for addressing the proposals of the\nSecretary-General. It may wish to decide on additional\nreforms. Latvia expects that lessons will be learned during\nthe implementation of the reform proposals and that the\nlessons will suggest mid-course corrections, improvements\nand even termination of some elements in the package.\nLet me now turn to several substantive aspects of\nreform that may touch upon the Secretary-General\u2019s\nreform package, but are not a part of it.\nThe success of reform depends upon a sound\nfinancial footing for the Organization. In this regard, three\nrecent interconnected processes may be noted. These\nprocesses are, first, rapid changes since 1991 in\npeacekeeping budgets and a basically unchanging regular\nbudget; secondly, reform of the assessment methodology\nunder way since 1994; and, thirdly and most important,\nrecent unprecedented increases in overdue outstanding\ncontributions.\nThe interdependence of these three processes means\nthat the General Assembly will have to work out ways to\ntreat the three processes as parts of a whole. It is also\nnecessary that the Assembly make decisions that assure a\ngenuine movement towards achieving a sound financial\nsituation within a few years at most.\nIn regard to the very difficult question of Security\nCouncil reform, Latvia wishes to reiterate its continued\nsupport for an expansion of the Council that would result\nin more equitable geographical and small-state\nrepresentation.\nLatvia believes that the mixed outcomes of the\ncomplex post-cold-war peacekeeping operations initiated\n21\n\n\nby the Security Council may have relevance to the reform\nof the Council. Learning how to improve the success rate\nof these operations could have the side benefit of pointing\ntowards Security Council reforms that might improve the\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\nLatvia has a special interest in the future of United\nNations peacekeeping operations, since the Baltic Battalion\n(BALTBAT), in which Latvians serve side by side with\nEstonians and Lithuanians, has completed a successful year\nof learning to cooperate and interface. This has been done\nwhile participating in a multinational operation: the\nStabilization Force (SFOR) peacekeeping mission in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina. BALTBAT, which has been trained and\nequipped with the help and encouragement of the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Nordic\npartners of the Baltic States, corresponds to their standards\nand has become fully operational.\nIn view of the growth of crimes that escape national\npunishment or that cross national borders, Latvia fully\nsupports the establishment of an independent, efficient and\nauthoritative international criminal court with independent\nprosecution. We consider this to be the most important\ndevelopment in international law since the creation of the\nInternational Court of Justice. Latvia intends to participate\nactively in the completion of the establishment of the court\nin 1998.\nIn regard to reforms in Latvia, it may be noted at the\noutset that they are driven by the need to overcome the\nconsequences of 50 years of occupation, which caused the\npolitical, economic and social development of Latvia to fall\nbehind its Nordic neighbours. In its sixth year of restored\nindependence, Latvia continues with reforms designed to\ncatch up with its Nordic neighbours. Latvia wishes to build\na solidly democratic foundation for long-term economic and\nsocial well-being.\nIn this endeavour, Latvia receives international\nassistance from many sources. One source is the United\nNations system, cooperation with which \u2014 primarily with\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \u2014\nhas contributed significantly to the improvement of social\nand economic well-being in Latvia. The United Nations\npresence in Latvia began in 1992 with an integrated office\nunder the leadership of a resident coordinator who is also\nthe UNDP representative. The integrated office, essentially\na United Nations House, has allowed cost-effective access\nto the technical assistance offered by any part of the United\nNations system. In addition, UNDP mobilizes bilateral and\nmultilateral donors for projects in which it participates. I\nwish to express my deepest gratitude to UNDP and the\ndonors who have made contributions to Latvia\u2019s reform\nprojects.\nI will now focus on reforms in only three of the\nareas that have an impact on social well-being and in\nwhich UNDP and the donors it has mobilized have been\ninvolved.\nThe first area is human rights. Although at its last\nsession the Assembly concluded its consideration of the\nquestion of human rights in Latvia and Estonia, I believe\nthat a brief report on some human rights developments\nduring this year may nevertheless be of interest at this\nsession.\nLatvia cooperates with the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for\nHuman Rights. Recently Latvia made a financial\ncontribution \u2014 its first voluntary contribution ever to any\nUnited Nations body \u2014 in support of work by the\nCommissioner\u2019s staff on national human rights\ninstitutions.\nThe Latvian National Human Rights Office,\nestablished in 1995 as an independent national institution,\nhas begun to have a tangible impact, particularly on the\nrights of vulnerable social groups. The somewhat\nunprecedented powers and functions of the Office have\ngenerated considerable interest in other central and eastern\nEuropean countries. The Office has received UNDP\ntechnical and financial assistance at all stages of its\nconception, planning and development.\nOn 4 June 1997 Latvia ratified the European\nConvention for the Protection of Human Rights, thus\nproviding new legal guarantees to its residents, including\nthe right of individual complaint and compulsory\njurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights.\nHuman rights were further strengthened through adoption\nof the Law on Refugees and Asylum Seekers and\nratification of the 1951 United Nations Convention\nrelating to the Status of Refugees.\nAnother area affecting social well-being and\nintegration is language training offered to the relatively\nlarge segment of the population that lacks a knowledge of\nLatvian, the State language. The Government of Latvia\napproved the National Programme for Latvian Language\nTraining in 1995. Since then the Programme has\ncompleted the training of a core body of teachers.\nTextbooks and teacher handbooks have been published.\n22\n\n\nThe third area relevant to social well-being is support\nfor the re-emergence of civil society. Since the time of\nnational reawakening 10 years ago, almost 3,000 non-\ngovernmental organizations have been established in Latvia.\nThe first major national non-governmental-organization\nforum will take place in Riga this weekend. I note that its\norganizers have received valuable assistance from the\nUNDP office in Latvia.\nWith regard to economic well-being, the Government\nhas worked hard to achieve macroeconomic stability during\nthe transition process from a centrally planned to an\nefficient market economy. As a result, economic growth has\nresumed and inflation has decreased dramatically. Real\ngross-domestic-product growth for 1997 is estimated at 4\nper cent. By June of this year inflation had declined to\nabout 7.5 per cent on an annual basis. These achievements\nare accompanied by continuing economic hardship for large\nsegments of the population. Social welfare and poverty-\nalleviation projects are aimed at decreasing these hardships.\nLatvia intends to apply the lessons learned from its\nreform experiences to its work as a member of the\nEconomic and Social Council. One general lesson learned\nin Latvia is that the results of reforms include not only\nbenefits but also costs. The cost hardest to bear is probably\ninsecurity about the ultimate outcome of reforms.\nWe, the reformers of the United Nations, will surely\nhave to bear the cost of insecurity as well. Perhaps a bit of\nancient wisdom can diminish the insecurity. The Roman\nphilosopher and Emperor Marcus Aurelius, in his\nMeditations, asked three questions about reforms:\n\u201cIs any man afraid of change? Why, what can take\nplace without change? What then is more pleasing or\nsuitable\u201d\nthan change?\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI warmly congratulate Minister\nUdovenko on his election to the helm of the fifty-second\nsession of the General Assembly. His profound\nexperience in international affairs is the best guarantee for\nthe success of his mandate. Allow me also to thank his\npredecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail, who led the fifty-\nfirst session of the General Assembly with great\ndistinction.\nOn all the broad issues confronting the General\nAssembly, Italy supports the statement made on Tuesday\nby the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg on behalf of the\nEuropean Union.\nToday we have a historic opportunity to connect\nprinciples and reality, give life to our ideals and shape\nthis Organization for decades to come. The ideologies that\ndivided humankind in this century have crumbled.\nMeanwhile, the system engineered with such foresight by\nthe founding Members amidst the horrors of the most\ndevastating war the world has ever seen has maintained\nand increased its significance.\nWe no longer live in a world of purely national\ninterests. More and more, policy-making is informed by\nglobal concerns such as human rights, solidarity and\nsocial justice. At the threshold of the twenty-first century,\nlet us pledge to settle religious and ethnic conflicts\nthrough dialogue, tolerance and cultural exchange, and to\nfind collective answers to international terrorism,\norganized crime, drug trafficking and the degradation of\nthe environment. We can join forces to eradicate poverty,\nwhich is a major cause of social injustice and political\nturmoil in the world, and guarantee dignity, respect and\nbetter living standards for every human being.\nThe goals of a new world order, founded on mutual\ntrust and the rejection of the threat and use of force, are\npeace, security, sustainable development and respect for\nthe fundamental freedoms of the individual. But these\nvalues cannot be dictated by an elite group of States. The\nfuture of humankind is the responsibility of the\ninternational community as a whole.\nAs the United Nations prepares to meet the\nchallenges of the third millennium, the General Assembly\nhas a role of paramount importance to play.\n15\n\n\nAt the opening of the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly there was unanimous consensus on the need for\na far-reaching reform of the United Nations system. In my\naddress I stated that if the United Nations was to respond\neffectively to the growing concerns that had emerged,\nreform could no longer be postponed. The international\ncommunity requires higher standards of security,\ndevelopment and democracy, and it needs them now.\nOn that occasion, I listed 10 specific proposals to\nmake United Nations peacekeeping operations more\neffective, and I am glad to see that progress has been made\non some of them. Procedures for periodic meetings between\nthe Security Council and troop-contributing countries have\nbeen consolidated. To help the Organization respond to\ncrises where and when they arise, Italy recently became the\nsixth country to formalize its participation in standby\narrangements for United Nations peacekeeping operations.\nPresident Clinton said in his speech on Monday that\nthe first task of the United Nations must remain the pursuit\nof peace and security. When a situation of serious\ninstability developed in Albania last March, the Security\nCouncil \u2014 with the full support of the Secretary-\nGeneral \u2014 acted promptly, authorizing a coalition of the\ncountries, led by Italy, willing to form a Multinational\nProtection Force. During the four months of its mandate,\nOperation Alba enabled the safe delivery of humanitarian\nassistance, created a secure environment for the missions of\ninternational organizations, and made democratic elections\npossible. In short, it helped put the country back on its feet.\nOne of the keys to its success was an innovative approach\nto peacekeeping, involving the rapid planning and\ndeployment of the Force, and close coordination among the\nparticipating countries and the host country, under the\nconstant monitoring of the United Nations.\nTo consolidate the gains that have been made and lay\nthe foundations for Albania's growth and prosperity, the\nnext step is to rehabilitate the State institutions and\neconomy. With this in mind, the Italian Government has\nconvened a ministerial conference for October, in Rome,\nwith the participation of the Albanian Government and all\nthe relevant international organizations to assess needs and\ndecide on a common course of action.\nFor over half a century, the United Nations has been\nseeking to establish a permanent international criminal court\nto prosecute and punish genocide, war crimes and crimes\nagainst humanity, wherever and by whomever they are\ncommitted. This is a test of our collective responsibility,\nmade even more pressing by the terrible massacres that\nhave characterized recent ethnic conflicts, and Italy\nconfirms its strong support, pledges its active contribution\nto this endeavour, and is prepared to host in Rome the\ndiplomatic conference to adopt the statute for the\ninternational criminal court.\nA second major challenge is arms control. Before\ndealing with the security requirements of tomorrow, we\nmust stop living by the fears of yesterday. New standards\nof security can be produced only through international\ncooperation under the leadership of the United Nations.\nItaly has some of the world's strictest and most\nadvanced legislation on the export of arms. I am proud to\nreport that this past June the Italian Government\nunilaterally decided to renounce the production, export,\nstockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines, and\nenabling legislation to this effect has already been passed\nby one branch of our Parliament. But the full value of\nthis commitment can only be realized if it is shared by all\ncountries, whether or not they are parties to the Ottawa\nprocess. The recent Oslo conference, to be sure, made\nremarkable accomplishments, but they are not yet\nuniversal. To achieve this goal, our efforts should be\ncomplemented by the continuing involvement of the\nConference on Disarmament.\nTwo months ago, Secretary-General Kofi Annan\npresented a package of ground-breaking proposals to\nimprove the effectiveness of the Organization and\nenhance its ability to meet the new challenges. Those\nproposals deserve our full support.\nOne important goal of the Secretary General's reform\nplan is to energize the strategic direction provided by the\nGeneral Assembly. To this end, we need to streamline the\nagenda and identify priorities for consideration in the short-\nand medium-term. Since the time available for plenary\ndebates is limited, we should focus on matters of general\ninterest.\nThe reform of the Organization is a question of the\nhighest priority for the current session of the General\nAssembly, as the Secretary-General himself has\nunderlined. In the coming months, two other major\nsubjects also command our attention: the financial\nsituation of the Organization, and the structure and\ncomposition of the Security Council.\nTo function properly, the Organization has to be able\nto rely on adequate resources. Assessed contributions\nmust be paid in full, on time and without conditions by\n16\n\n\nMember States. Italy, for its part, has always complied with\nthis fundamental rule. Nevertheless, we believe that the\ntime has come to agree on a realistic new scale of\nassessments, based on Member States' capacity to pay and\nmaking the Organization less dependent on the\ncontributions of a single country.\nHowever, let there be no confusion about our support\nfor a review of the scale of assessments. There can be\nabsolutely no link between Members' contributions and\nSecurity Council reform, lest the impression be created that\npermanent seats are up for sale.\nThis brings me to the reform of the Security Council.\nThere is broad agreement that reform is needed to bring the\nCouncil more in line with the new realities of the world in\nwhich we live. The reform must be inspired by the\nprinciples of democracy, equitable geographical\nrepresentation and transparency. These are the very\nprinciples guiding the proposal presented by Italy. While\nwe are prepared to look constructively at other proposals,\nwe must guard against those advocating a system that\nwould divide Member States into four categories: first-class\ncountries \u2014 the five current permanent members of the\nSecurity Council, with veto power; second-class\ncountries \u2014 the new permanent members from\nindustrialized nations, without veto power; third-class\ncountries \u2014 \u201cpseudo-permanent\u201d rotating members, without\nveto power, from developing nations in different regions;\nand fourth-class countries \u2014 the overwhelming majority of\nUnited Nations Member States, with fewer chances than\never of serving on the Security Council.\nSuch stratification of membership, reminiscent of the\ncaste system in ancient empires, would defy the\nfundamental principles of logic and democracy, and\nmarginalize some of the countries most active in the\nOrganization. How could any of us accept relegation to the\nlast of these categories and go back to our people and\nParliaments and tell them that we actually voted in favour\nof our country's demotion to fourth-class status? Let me\nstress that this type of problem would not be generated by\nthe Italian proposal, which calls for an increase only in\nnon-permanent members, to be democratically elected by\nthe General Assembly.\nAnother aspect of reform is the question of the veto.\nThis cannot and should not be discussed independently of\nthe issue of enlarging the Council. The two issues are\ninseparable. Indeed, every aspect of Security Council\nreform should be addressed at the same time and in the\nsame context. Before determining the future size of the\nCouncil and the names of new members, we must define\nthe criteria that should govern the reform. Ad hoc\napproaches will not work. Ultimately, no solution can be\nadopted unless there is broad consensus. And a lasting\nand equitable outcome cannot be reached through hasty\nand partial solutions. Forcing the issue would deepen\ndivisions and jeopardize the larger and more urgent\nquestion before the General Assembly: approving the\nSecretary-General's reform package.\nIn a longer-term perspective, I would like to add that\na fact-finding inquiry recently conducted by the Italian\nParliament envisaged a permanent seat on the Security\nCouncil for the European Union, as a natural evolution of\nits common foreign and security policy.\nAlmost 55 years ago, on November 13 1942,\nPresident Roosevelt said that the future of the United\nNations association\n\u201cshould not be restricted to the 28 signatories of the\nAtlantic Charter, but should be one which all nations\ncould join.\u201d\nPresident Roosevelt believed that the purpose of the\nUnited Nations should not be the defence of the status\nquo and that its strength did not lie in sheer numbers, but\nin the way that Member States engaged in collective\ndeliberations and action. This vision should guide our\npursuit of a more promising future for all the people of\nthis world. History will not be lenient with us if we fail.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nRepublic of Angola, allow me first to congratulate the\nPresident, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, on his election to\npreside over the fifty-second session of the General\nAssembly.\nAllow me also to congratulate the outgoing\nPresident, Ambassador Razali Ismail, on the excellent\nwork he performed.\nWe should also like to express our appreciation to\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his dedication\nand determination in turning the United Nations into a\nmore effective instrument to meet the challenges of the\ntwenty-first century.\nThe cold war, which was the main obstacle that for\ndecades prevented the United Nations from performing its\nrole fully, a role defined by its founding Members in the\nCharter, is now a thing of the past. But our world\nOrganization has not yet achieved the degree of efficiency\nthat the Member countries and their people would desire,\nwith the result that sometimes despair and a lack of\nconfidence are felt, instead of trust in its efforts.\nThe construction of the new democratic world order\nto which we all aspire will demand that the principal\nforum for multilateral diplomacy, the United Nations, play\na greater role. In this context, the complete restructuring\nand revitalization of its system and an end to the present\nfinancial crisis, which is affecting its normal functioning,\nare essential.\nThe issue of the restructuring of the Security Council\nshould therefore be given priority. The current structure\nof that body is obsolete, reflecting a reality that prevailed\nmore than 50 years ago. How is it conceivable that\n27\n\n\nregions such as the African continent, which makes up the\nlargest regional group at the United Nations, or Latin\nAmerica, are not represented among the permanent\nMembers of the Security Council? Therefore, it is high time\nthat the geographical composition of that body be\noverhauled to allow for more balanced and more equitable\nrepresentation. In this regard, Angola endorses the African\nclaim for no fewer than two seats among the permanent\nmembers of the Security Council. The Council\u2019s working\nmethods should also be revised in order to ensure greater\ntransparency in its decision-making processes.\nAngola supports the declaration made by the Heads of\nState of the Organization of African Unity, as well as the\nstatement made by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the\nnon-aligned countries on reform of the Security Council.\nThe recent proposals made by the Secretary-General\non reform will certainly boost the process of overhauling\nthe United Nations. Angola welcomes the contents of those\nproposals, although we would have preferred to see further\nimprovements in some aspects. We are, however, optimistic\nas to the outcome.\nAs the Assembly is aware, the Lusaka Protocol which\nwas signed in 1994 between the Government and the armed\nopposition, UNITA, was intended to solve the post-electoral\ncrisis provoked by UNITA and at the same time to put the\ncountry back on the path towards peace, national\nreconciliation and democracy. However, approximately\nthree years since the beginning of its implementation,\nAngola is still far from achieving those goals due to the\nsystematic failures by UNITA to meet its obligations and to\nits repeated delaying tactics. This is a clear demonstration\nof bad faith and lack of political will by its leadership. It\nappears that the leader of this organization has not\nabandoned its strategy of taking power by force. He is still\nresisting the transformation of UNITA into a true political\nparty and UNITA\u2019s complete demilitarization, even though\nthe single national army, which includes in its ranks\nthousands of men provided by UNITA, has already been\nformed.\nUNITA still maintains a private, heavily armed army\nmade up of around 35,000 men, 4,000 of whom belong to\nthe UNITA leader\u2019s personal guard. This constitutes a\nserious violation of the Lusaka Protocol and is the main\ncause of the current climate of tension and insecurity in\nsome parts of Angola. The members of this army include\ntroops that UNITA hid from the United Nations during the\nquartering process, recently demobilized UNITA troops\nwho have been recruited again by force, and former\nsoldiers of the former Republic of Zaire.\nAt the same time, UNITA is still continuing its\nmilitary build-up through the reactivation of military\nbases and acquisition of sophisticated weapons from\nforeign countries, in clear contradiction of paragraph 19\nof Security Council resolution 864 (1993).\nOn the other hand, UNITA is holding on to large\nportions of national territory which were supposed to be\nhanded over to government administration. This is\nimpeding exercise of the State\u2019s sovereignty throughout\nthe country and the free movement of people and goods.\nThe control of some of these areas is aimed at exploring\nfor, and then smuggling and exploiting, their natural\nresources to finance UNITA\u2019s war machinery and satisfy\nthe individual interests of its leadership.\nAs a result of these actions, the perspectives created\nwith the inauguration of the Government of National\nUnity and Reconciliation and the swearing-in of the\nParliament have been postponed.\nUNITA\u2019s behaviour in the peace process is\nrepugnant as well as ambiguous. It insists on armed\nopposition despite the fact that it is part of the main\npower institutions and despite the fact that Angola has a\ndemocratic, pluralist system in which all political parties\ncan freely carry out their activities.\nThe international community has already expressed,\nrepeatedly and categorically, its condemnation of and\ndismay at UNITA\u2019s actions. In 1993 the Security Council\napplied the first package of restrictive measures against\nUNITA. More recently, the Security Council unanimously\nadopted resolution 1127 (1997), which applies a new\npackage of measures against UNITA as a result of its lack\nof cooperation in the implementation of the Lusaka\nProtocol. The position taken by the Council above all\ndisplays the concern of the international community and\nits determination to prevent the UNITA leadership\nstrategy from being implemented. Otherwise, peace and\nstability in Angola and the entire region of central and\nsouthern Africa would be at risk.\nThe Government of Angola reiterates its firm\nsupport for resolution 1127 (1997), because we feel that\nit is a strong means of pressure aimed at dissuading\nUNITA from its intention to return to war, encouraging\nit to speed up its demilitarization and transformation into\n28\n\n\na political party, and put an end to its jurisdiction over parts\nof Angolan territory.\nTaking the above into account, the Angolan people\nlook forward to the Security Council\u2019s demonstrating\nfirmness and determination in implementing resolution 1127\n(1997), immediately putting into force sanctions against\nUNITA unless that organization changes its behaviour and\ngives proof of good faith in complying with its outstanding\nobligations.\nThe Government of Angola is optimistic about the\nsuccessful conclusion of the peace process and will\ncontinue to do its utmost to guarantee the full\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol.\nBefore turning to another subject, I would like to\nexpress the sincerest gratitude of the Government of Angola\nto the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for\nAngola, Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, and to the\nGovernments of the troika of observers, Portugal, Russia\nand the United States, for their untiring efforts to bring\nabout peace in Angola.\nRecent changes in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo have contributed to alleviating the tensions in the\ncentral African region, opening new perspectives for its\nStates and peoples in terms of stability and development.\nThe present climate will allow stability to prevail in\nthe region and will allow for better coordination among\nStates with a view to reinforcing the observance of the\nprinciple of good neighbourliness.\nThe Angolan Government is very apprehensive\nregarding the crisis in the Republic of the Congo, a country\nwith which Angola shares a common border, close\nconsanguinity and historic ties.\nThe Republic of Angola favours a negotiated solution\nto the crisis and supports the international mediation efforts\nheaded by Mr. Omar Bongo, President of the Republic of\nGabon. Our Government also supports the deployment of\nan international force as soon as a political settlement\nemerges from the negotiations.\nIn Sierra Leone, we deplore the interruption of the\ndemocratic process and the overthrow of the legitimately\nelected institutions. The Government of Angola supports the\nefforts of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and, in\nparticular, of neighbouring countries to restore the\ndemocratic institutions.\nWe are also concerned with the situation in the\nRepublic of the Comoros, where tensions are threatening\nthe country\u2019s independence and territorial integrity. We\nencourage the international community to support the\nefforts of the OAU in the search for a peaceful solution\nable to preserve the territorial integrity and independence\nof that country.\nThe situation in Somalia continues to deteriorate, and\na solution acceptable to all the parties concerned has yet\nto be found. The Angolan Government approves of the\nefforts made by member countries of the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)\nand, in particular, the most recent initiatives of Ethiopia\nin bringing the representatives of the Somali factions\ntogether at the negotiating table.\nOf particular concern to us is the ostracism displayed\nin the main international forums with regard to the Somali\ncrisis.\nIn Western Sahara the recent opening of direct\nnegotiations between the Kingdom of Morocco and the\nFrente POLISARIO front is a positive sign. The Angolan\nGovernment has always been in favour of a negotiated\nsolution to the conflict which takes into account the\naspirations of the populations of the territory and\nencourages the parties to honour the agreements signed in\nHouston and to continue the ongoing dialogue in good\nfaith. In this connection, we support the joint efforts of\nthe OAU and the United Nations.\nWe are concerned with the continuation of the\nIsraeli-Arab conflict, the primary cause of the\ndeteriorating situation in the Middle East. Recent events\nhave delayed the peace process and have led to further\ndeterioration of the situation in the region. Angola\nreaffirms its support for the peace process in the Middle\nEast. Its success depends upon the reinforcement of\nmutual trust and the full implementation of the accords\nsigned between the parties concerned.\nWe endorse the position expressed in the Declaration\nof the Heads of State or Government of the OAU and the\nstatement made in New Delhi at the ministerial meeting\nof the Non-Aligned Movement with regard to the question\nof Palestine.\nMy Government expresses its concern at the lack of\nprogress in the initiatives to bring about a just solution to\nthe question of East Timor. The Government of Angola\n29\n\n\ndeplores the refusal by one of the parties to accept\nPresident Mandela\u2019s initiative.\nThe economic, commercial and financial embargo\nimposed on Cuba is a matter of concern to my Government,\nparticularly because of its negative impact on the economic\nand social situation of the Cuban people. We reiterate our\nappeal to have the embargo lifted, which will contribute to\nrelations between two peoples.\n(spoke in English)\nFinally, I should like to thank those who have given\nme the opportunity to speak today. As the Assembly knows,\nmy speech was to be delivered on 26 September. However,\ndue to a sad event which has happened in my country, I\nhave to leave tonight, and I was obliged to ask the\nAssembly to give me the opportunity to deliver my speech\ntoday.\nOne of our colleagues, the former of Minister for\nForeign Affairs of Angola, passed away yesterday. It is my\nduty to return home to pay my respects to my dear\ncolleague. Many here know Foreign Minister \\\"Loy\\\".\nI wish the Assembly well, and may good work be\ndone here for peace, stability and international cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It is with great\npleasure that I assure him of Lesotho\u2019s support and\ncooperation as he conducts the deliberations of this body.\nLet me also take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to\nhis predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Razali Ismail, for the\nskilful manner in which he guided the work of the fifty-first\nsession. My delegation truly appreciates his leadership and\ntireless dedication to the heavy responsibilities entrusted to\nhim during the past year.\nOn the eve of a new millennium, the United Nations\nis poised on the threshold of an era of momentous changes.\nDuring the first 52 years of its existence, the Organization\nwitnessed several changes in the configuration of\ninternational relations. Some of them were traumatic, others\nbenign. The survival of the United Nations through all these\ntribulations bears testimony not only to its resilience, but\nalso to the enduring validity of its mission.\nBut the continued success and relevance of the United\nNations in the new millennium will depend in large\nmeasure on its capacity for self-renewal and on its\nreadiness to meet its challenges in the environment of\nchanged global circumstances.\nThe Secretary-General has demonstrated his\nwillingness and resolve to bring about the much-needed\nchange. We applaud, at the outset, his bold and far\nreaching proposals on the reform of the United Nations.\nMany of his proposals, indeed, meet with the approval of\nmy Government, and it is our hope that the General\nAssembly will see its way clear to receiving them in the\nsame manner. Some, however, do need careful scrutiny to\nensure that the ideal of cost-cutting can still be achieved\nwithout compromising the overriding objective of\nrealizing higher efficiency and effectiveness of the\nOrganization in the execution of its mandate.\nWe urge that the totality of these proposals should\nbe subjected to serious scrutiny at the appropriately high\nintergovernmental level, with a view to implementing\nthose that enjoy wide support as expeditiously as possible.\nOur hope is that this can be done in a spirit of frankness\nand mutual understanding without the acrimony that so\noften characterizes our intergovernmental deliberations.\nDuring the last two sessions of the General\nAssembly, we have debated and arrived at a clear\nunderstanding of the United Nations reforms that will best\nserve the interests of the world community in the next\nmillennium. The reform initiatives of the Secretary-\nGeneral, which cover diverse aspects of the functioning\nof the Organization, are therefore a timely and welcome\nresponse to our collective call for a reoriented and\nrevitalized United Nations.\nLesotho, like other States of southern Africa, has\ngone through difficult political problems, which have\nlargely been resolved. The outstanding problem is\neconomic underdevelopment. We thus attach great\nimportance to the United Nations role in development\ncooperation. We recognize the need to strengthen the\ncapacity of the Secretary-General in this area by\nproviding him with a deputy whose principal role, in our\nview, should be to coordinate the Organization\u2019s efforts\nand to give direction to all entities of the United Nations\ninvolved in development cooperation.\nWe fully support the initiative aimed at facilitating\nthe unified and cooperative functioning of all the United\nNations funds and programmes involved in development\noperations at the field level, while at the same time\nreinforcing and maintaining the distinct nature of these\nentities. The specialized funds and programmes within the\nUnited Nations system continue to constitute an important\nvehicle for advancing international development\ncooperation, particularly in the developing countries. The\n14\n\n\nenhanced coordination and pooling of resources and\nservices among the specialized funds will not only lead to\nbetter planning but will also maximize programme impact\nand minimize administrative costs.\nIndeed, Lesotho has already made its own\ncontribution, however small, towards reaching the ideal of\na unified United Nations presence in the field. The\nGovernment of Lesotho, using its own national resources,\nhas constructed a United Nations House office complex,\nwhich will accommodate all field representatives of the\nfunds and programmes as well as other United Nations\nagencies in our capital. This House was inaugurated and\nhanded over to the United Nations Resident Coordinator\nonly five days ago, on 25 September 1997.\nThe suggestion by the Secretary-General for the\nestablishment of a $1 billion revolving fund also has its\nown merits. Let me, however, hasten to emphasize that\nthere can be no substitute for a demonstrable commitment\nby all Member States to honour their treaty obligations by\npaying their assessed contributions on time, fully and\nunconditionally, in order to ensure the financial health of\nour Organization. We nevertheless believe that the proposed\nrevolving fund can only be a short-term palliative. But such\na fund should serve neither to exculpate those who renege\non their treaty obligations nor to place an additional burden\non countries that are already making sacrifices to honour\ntheir obligations in accordance with the Charter.\nAs we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, in 1998, the issue\nof the protection of human rights is assuming an increasing\nimportance to all our countries because of its close linkage\nwith democracy, peace and stability. My Government\ntherefore welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s proposed\nreforms regarding the strengthening of the Organization\u2019s\nrole in the field of human rights. In this connection, we\nwish to urge that the consolidation of the Office of the\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for\nHuman Rights into one entity should not lead to the\nblurring of the distinction between the political functions of\nthe High Commissioner and the purely technical functions\nof the Centre.\nThe increasing globalization of organized crime,\nincluding trafficking in illicit drugs, continues to be a\nsource of concern to the international community. It is for\nthis reason that in our subregion, the countries of the\nSouthern African Development Community are taking\ncooperative measures to combat the scourge of transnational\norganized crime. Lesotho believes that the proposal to\nestablish in Vienna a high-profile United Nations office\nwhose main focus would be on drug control and crime\nprevention should be given favourable consideration.\nWith regard to the reform and restructuring of the\nSecurity Council, I can only reaffirm the view of the\nLesotho Government that only equitable representation on\nthe Security Council and an increase in its membership to\nno less than 26 can satisfy our aspirations. We share the\nview held by the majority of members of this body on the\nneed for true democratization of the Security Council and\nthe reform of its working methods, including the issue of\nthe veto power. Such reform should take into account the\nprinciple of sovereign equality of States, as well as the\nneed for transparency and accountability in the decision-\nmaking processes of the Security Council.\nSince the last session of the General Assembly, we\nhave witnessed a number of developments in the\ninternational arena that augur well for world political\nstability and peace. Recently we all shared in the\nuniversal joy at the peaceful reunification of Hong Kong\nwith its motherland. The United Kingdom and the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China ought to be congratulated for\ntheir significant contribution to world peace and for the\nvaluable lesson that they have imparted to the world\ncommunity in the sphere of resolution of disputes through\ndialogue.\nIn our region, we have witnessed the birth of a new\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo from the crucible of\none of the most vicious dictatorships ever recorded in the\nannals of history. It is now for the international\ncommunity to assist the people of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo in their efforts aimed at economic\nreconstruction and the consolidation of democracy and\naccountability in their country. The acceptance of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo into the Southern\nAfrican Development Community at the beginning of this\nmonth was a signal of the determination of the countries\nof southern Africa to make their own positive contribution\nto the reconstruction efforts of the Congolese people.\nWe are also greatly encouraged by the recent\nrestoration of stability and democracy in Liberia through\nthe assistance of neighbouring countries in that region.\nHowever, the reversion of Sierra Leone to a state of\nanarchy and chaos after the selfless efforts made by the\ninternational community to bring about stability in that\ncountry remains a source of great concern. Lesotho joins\nin the call by African States for the international\n15\n\n\ncommunity to withhold recognition of the military junta in\nSierra Leone and to remain steadfast in its resolve to\nrestore democracy and constitutional legitimacy in that\ncountry.\nIn Angola, the recalcitrance of the UNITA leadership\ncontinues to unravel the gains that had been made in the\nsearch for peace. The United Nations owes it to the people\nof Angola to enforce, through the Security Council,\nappropriate punitive measures against UNITA as a signal\nthat those who stand in the way of peace can no longer be\nallowed to succeed.\nThe recent events in the Middle East have cast a\nshadow on a future that seemed to hold promise for a\nnegotiated peace. False moves have escalated tension in the\nregion rather than abating it. We call upon Israel, as we\nhave always done in the past, to fully implement all\nSecurity Council resolutions aimed at the peaceful\nsettlement of the conflict in that region. All the parties to\nthe conflict must recommit themselves to the peace process\nand refrain from any acts which might jeopardize a\nnegotiated settlement.\nThe continuous eruption of armed conflicts throughout\nthe world, particularly in the developing countries, is a\nsource of concern to all of us. These conflicts put a\ntremendous strain on the resources of the United Nations\nand on the Organization\u2019s capacity to maintain international\npeace and security. Thus, we are encouraged by the positive\nattitude and the interest that some of the developed\ncountries have in the recent years shown in cooperating\nwith the Organization of African Unity towards enhancing\nAfrica\u2019s capacity in the field of conflict prevention. We\nalso welcome Japan\u2019s initiative to host an international\nconference on conflict prevention in Tokyo in January\n1998. Taken in their totality, these initiatives underline the\nmoral responsibility that rests on humanity to ensure that\npeoples everywhere enjoy the right to peace, development\nand the sanctity of life.\nLesotho is generally encouraged by the progress that\nis being made in the field of disarmament with the recent\nsigning of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and\nthe ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\nDespite the current relaxation of tension in international\nrelations, disarmament must continue to be accorded high\npriority on the agenda of the international community with\na view to achieving the total elimination of nuclear\nweapons. Africa has already contributed positively to the\ndisarmament process by the signing, in Egypt, of the\nPelindaba Treaty declaring Africa a nuclear-weapon-free\nzone.\nThe recent international negotiations in Oslo\nregarding a ban on anti-personnel mines are also a step in\nthe right direction. Lesotho fully supports the Ottawa\nprocess and urges all nations to associate themselves with\nit so that a truly global treaty banning the production and\nuse of anti-personnel mines can be successfully concluded\nin December this year.\nLast year, the Assembly demonstrated the\nwidespread and growing international support for a\npermanent international criminal court when it\nunanimously adopted resolution 51/207, which set mid-\n1998 as the date for a diplomatic conference to finalize\nand adopt a convention on the establishment of such a\ncourt. We have been encouraged by the progress made\nduring the last two sessions of the Preparatory\nCommittee, held in February and in August.\nWe appreciate the generous offer by the Italian\nGovernment to host the conference. The time has now\ncome for the necessary arrangements for the convening of\nsuch a conference to be put in place, and reaffirming the\nJune 1998 date will enable the Italian Government to\nproceed with the necessary logistical arrangements and\nensure that the court is established before the end of the\ncentury. Lesotho fully and unreservedly supports that\ndate. We remain convinced that the early establishment of\nthe court will offer the advantage of a system that aims\nto serve the common global good by preventing local\noutbreaks of violence from becoming security crises with\nglobal repercussions, and to deter the continued\nrecurrence of the genocide and other massive crimes\nagainst humanity that have haunted the world since\nNuremberg and Tokyo.\nMembers will recall the ninth session of the United\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD IX), held two years ago in South Africa,\nwhose main agenda item was on promoting growth and\nsustainable development in a globalizing and liberalizing\neconomy. In the post-UNCTAD-IX period, a major\nchallenge before us is to maximize the developmental\nimpact of this globalizing and liberalizing world economy.\nThis can be achieved only by ensuring that the risk of\nmarginalizing and even excluding weaker nations from\nparticipating actively in international trade and commerce\nis avoided at all costs.\n16\n\n\nWhen we met during the nineteenth special session of\nthe General Assembly, held only four months ago, we all\nexpressed our deep concern that, compared to 1992, the\noverall trend regarding sustainable development in\ndeveloping countries is worse today. Poverty and\nenvironmental degradation continue to afflict the lives of\nmillions of people in many parts of the world. The\nstaggering statistics only underline the need to strengthen\nthe capacity of the United Nations to improve the lot of our\ndisadvantaged peoples. In particular, they reaffirm that\nUnited Nations operational activities for development have\na critical and unique role to play in enabling the developing\ncountries to continue to lead the management of their own\ndevelopment process, and that the funds and programmes\nwithin the United Nations system continue to constitute\nimportant vehicles for advancing international development\ncooperation. It is in this spirit that we would support those\nefforts that are aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and the\ncapacity of the funds and programmes in the area of\ndevelopment assistance.\nIn conclusion, allow me to observe that with the vision\nthat the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has brought to\nthe Organization within his short period in office, the\nUnited Nations can and will come to terms with the\nchallenges that lie in the years ahead. The rationalization of\nthe structures and working methods of our Organization\nwill surely allow us to achieve our objectives.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPermit me first to offer you,\nSir, the congratulations of Belize\u2019s delegation on your\nelection, and the assurance of our fullest cooperation as\nyou follow through on the accomplishments of your\ndistinguished predecessor, Mr. Razali Ismail of Malaysia.\nAs the world shifts gears towards a preoccupation\nwith what could be described as millennium fever, our\nannual stocktaking exercise becomes particularly poignant.\nAnd if truth be told, the record of our success \u2014\nmeasured against the historical vision of the founders and\nagainst current challenges \u2014 is not an unsullied one.\nNevertheless, in every sphere of human endeavour, in\nevery tangible advance of international comity, the\nsignature of the United Nations can be found. We have\ncontributed to fundamental changes for good in the fabric\nof the global community. Of course, and as is always the\ncase with less than perfect man-made enterprises, our job\nis far from done.\nAs the Secretary-General noted in his report on the\nwork of the Organization, we live in an era of\nrealignment. Belize shares his view that this Organization\nhas to continue adjusting to the changes which envelop\ntoday\u2019s world, so as to maintain the balance in favour of\na more secure and predictable peace, greater economic\nwell-being, social justice and environmental sustainability.\nDespite sea changes in the international climate, the\nrelevance of the original objectives of the Organization\u2019s\nCharter remains acute. There is still need to respond\nrapidly to threats to international peace and security.\nEconomic and social development must be further\nadvanced. Human rights, the rule of law and the ideals of\ndemocratic, accountable governance must be concretized\nin our daily life. And the changes, such as globalization\nand reshaping of the United Nations environment must\nstrengthen the commitment of nations large and small to\ninternational cooperation. The one fundamental lesson that\nthe experience of the last 52 years has taught is that we\ncannot go it alone. There is large benefit to be derived\nfrom multilateralism; and to our mind the United Nations\nis the one organization with the wherewithal and capacity\nto take global action on a global agenda.\nWe have been promised that the renewed United\nNations system sought by the Secretary-General will\n3\n\n\nbecome both more effective and more efficient. The\nextensive and far-reaching set of changes proposed in his\nProgramme for Reform are said to be designed to achieve\ngreater unity of purpose, coherence of effort and flexibility\nin response. Belize therefore joins with those voices\napplauding the attempt to strengthen and streamline the\nUnited Nations and enhance its institutional capacity. My\ndelegation will eagerly await opportunities to hear comment\nand will participate in joint analysis of the proposed\nProgramme for Reform.\nOne major hindrance to the Organization\u2019s capacity is\nits dire financial situation. We have noted proposals within\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s Programme for Reform designed to\nensure a viable financial basis for the Organization. It is my\ndelegation\u2019s view, however, that there is still a need for\ngreater clarification if financial solvency is to be assured.\nWe are not entirely convinced that the creation of the\nproposed Revolving Credit Fund will alleviate the situation.\nWe would rather see implementation of measures for\nharsher censure in cases of tardiness in meeting obligations.\nLet us again state our view that this Organization should be\ngranted some measure of autonomy in generating revenue\nfrom sources outside national Administrations.\nThere is an ongoing parallel at the national and\norganizational level aimed at economizing. Streamlining,\ndownsizing, or the process of retrenchment by any name,\ncarries with it a human cost. We must therefore make every\neffort to ensure that the product of reform is greater than\nthe sum of its parts. Within this context, we wish to offer\nthe caution that in our eagerness to integrate Secretariat\nentities and units the critical thrust and focus of various\ndepartments, divisions and programmes, should not be lost.\nThe gasp of the weak and poor all too frequently can barely\nbe heard above the loudly trumpeted agenda of powerful\nconstituencies.\nDemocracy, human rights and the rule of law have\ntaken on renewed paramountcy, particularly in the post-\nconflict societies of Latin America. Good governance is the\nfoundation upon which we build structures to ensure\nsustainable development and durable peace. In both the\nsubregions to which Belize belongs this is a principle that\nachieves practical as well as intellectual expression. And we\nfind this fact noteworthy: that so soon after internal\nconflicts convulsed the isthmus, the countries of Central\nAmerica have been able democratically and constitutionally\nto reinvigorate their societies. It is also remarkable that so\nharmoniously has their economic integration movement\nadvanced, that they are now prepared to contemplate the\nnext step of political union. While this is logical, it is also\na quantum leap.\nNow, for juridical and historical reasons, Belize can\nonly be an observer in this process. But we wish to assure\nour Central American brothers that in our heart of hearts\nwe too are Morazanistas. We too are uplifted and inspired\nby this great visionary. And we sympathize keenly with\nthe spirit of the legacy that now animates his modern-day\nprogeny.\nIn the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) the\ncoming of the single market is only the most dramatic\nexpression of a new solidarity that Belize enthusiastically\nembraces. We continue to draw vital sustenance from\nwhat is, after all, a West Indian partnership rooted in a\nshared love for, and practice of, democracy, a democracy\nthat is not resting on its laurels, but that is engaged now\nin a process of revitalization based on the urgent search\nfor collective economic security and social advance.\nThe proposals for reform encompass suggestions to\nachieve greater coordination and cooperation among the\nUnited Nations agencies and entities which help nations\nlike mine pursue the central priority of sustainable\ndevelopment. We hope, however, that the effectiveness\nand responsiveness of individual agencies will not be\ncompromised.\nMore will have to be said about seeking innovative\nmeans to attract greater capital to finance development.\nThe argument that a development dividend can be\nrealized by a shift of resources from administration to\ndevelopment activities, is not, to our mind, persuasive.\nAny possible savings in administrative costs could hardly\nbe adequate enough to make significant progress in our\ncollective effort to eradicate poverty.\nWe have yet to hear any general admission of\nsatisfaction with the outcome of the nineteenth special\nsession of the General Assembly to review and appraise\nthe implementation of Agenda 21 and other agreements\nreached at the 1992 United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development. The special session\nclearly did not meet expectations for the adoption of clear\ntargets, commitments and specific initiatives as we\nprogress along the road from Rio. Long-term commitment\nand concerted action in the field are still critical if we are\nto continue to meet the needs of a rapidly increasing\nglobal population without depleting the resource base on\nwhich our very subsistence depends.\n4\n\n\nWe are heartened that the practical agreements reached\nat the so-called Earth Summit + 5 included those of major\nconcern to small island developing States, such as climate\nchange, tourism and natural disasters. Belize, a country with\na low-lying coastal plain, several coral atolls and more than\n100 coral islands, experiences challenges similar to those\nthat face small island developing States. At the United\nNations we participate within the very active Alliance of\nSmall Island States, and we remain faithful to the\nimplementation of the Programme of Action for the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates, adopted at the 1994 Global Conference in Barbados.\nWe look forward to the in-depth assessment of the\nBarbados Programme to be conducted at the forthcoming\ntwo-day special session to be held immediately preceding\nthe fifty-fourth regular session of the General Assembly.\nBelize will continue to insist that the constituency of\nlow-lying coastal States be accorded the deserved support\nof the international community so that we too may share in\nthe tangible benefits to be accrued.\nCountries like mine will also increasingly depend upon\nthe United Nations to steer the way forward in building the\nnew framework within which developed and developing\nnations interact. Against the backdrop of globalization and\nmarket liberalization, a new partnership is called for. The\nrole of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) and the regional commissions in\nexamining the issues pertinent to globalization and\ndevelopment and the effective integration of developing\ncountries into the international trading system is especially\nkey, for the recent negative rulings by the World Trade\nOrganization on the European Union banana regime, which\nsecured access for African, Caribbean and Pacific countries,\nfully demonstrate the dangers inherent in unbridled\nliberalization shorn of consideration for the special needs of\nsmall, vulnerable and disadvantaged economies.\nIn the current climate, it is perhaps basest apostasy to\nquestion the new catechism of free trade. \u201cRevisionism\u201d is\na bad word, and heresy will no doubt be swiftly repaid by\nexcommunication. But has not the zeal of the convert\nblinded us to the humanism of the original aims of\npreferential access? After all, this was not some hopelessly\ncapricious or unreasoning altruism. Preferential access\nregimes represented, rather, a real and sincere effort to\nenable small developing countries to produce for the\ninternational marketplace, to offer their societies a chance\nat a decent standard of living and to assure them a special\nstake in the global economy.\nAlthough economic thinking has changed, the\nobjective conditions of poor countries have not. Fervent\nrecitation of the new mantra alone can never wipe out the\ndiseconomies of scale for small, primary-producing States.\nWe cannot now compete on equal terms. Yet our calls go\nunheeded for the comprehensive capital inflows and\ntechnical assistance so vitally necessary to achieve the\nstructural adjustment that will enable us to participate\nequitably in the new trading arrangements. I repeat to the\nindustrialized world what surely has now become our cri\nde coeur: do not cut off our legs, then tell us to run.\nDevelopment is still one of the most important\naspirations in today\u2019s world. To return to my earlier\ncomplaint, the achievement of economic growth and\nsustainable development has not been balanced throughout\nthe five regions that United Nations comprises. It is an\nunderstatement to say that globalization and economic\nliberalization have had a different kind of impact on some\nof us. A few nations now enjoy the increased well-being,\nwhile others are visited only by deepening\nmarginalization.\nThe recently adopted United Nations Agenda for\nDevelopment stresses the role of the Organization in\ndevelopment matters. The Agenda is one concrete manner\nin which we can collectively address the issues and\nproblems relevant to development and, in particular,\ndevelopment\u2019s peculiar relationship with peace,\ndemocracy, good governance and human rights.\nBelize repeats its call for an annual observance by\nthe General Assembly at which development policy would\nbe the focus of debate. Such encounters could maintain\nthe Agenda\u2019s impetus, as well as provide a forum for\ndiscussing effective and coordinated follow-through with\nregard to commitments made at the several global\nconferences.\nPreventive diplomacy and peacemaking are still the\nbest means at the Organization\u2019s disposal in its efforts at\nconflict avoidance. The wide range of activities carried\nout in the name of preventive diplomacy must ever be\nmindful that success can be guaranteed only with the\nconsent of all parties.\nBoth the Security Council and the General\nAssembly, in extending existing operations or authorizing\nadditional ones, must continue to issue clear mandates. In\nthe light of the financial situation, some collective\ndiscipline will have to be applied in authorizing mandates\nwhen adequate resources are not available.\n5\n\n\nOn a related subject, we have learned of efforts under\nway to develop the Organization\u2019s rapid-deployment\ncapability. This dimension is necessary, but any deployment\nin this sense must withstand the scrutiny of national\nconsent. Again, we would prefer to see the preventive\naspect stressed rather than the enforcement side. Further, a\nrapid-reaction capability is not needed solely to respond to\nthreats to peace in the traditional sense. Recent measures\nemployed to enhance the Organization\u2019s humanitarian\nresponse to both man-made and natural disasters are also\ndemonstrative of the requirement for the institutionalization\nof a rapid-response capability.\nIn the Secretary-General\u2019s programme for reform,\ndeserved emphasis is placed on strengthening international\ncooperation to combat the new threats to civil society. The\ndeleterious effects of crime, drugs and terrorism know no\nborders.\nThe administrative changes to be instituted by the\nSecretariat to focus action through the United Nations crime\nprevention and criminal justice programme should give us\nthe upper hand in waging war against the forces of uncivil\nsociety.\nCountries such as mine expend huge amounts of\nlimited resources in addressing these concerns, which, in a\nsmall State, can amount to nothing less than threats to\nnational security. Further, we are convinced that the global\nnature of the problem requires the highest level of\ninternational cooperation that can be achieved. This must\nembody the concept of multilateralism and reject unilateral\ndevices which disrespect the sovereignty of States.\nBelize\u2019s declaration affirming respect for the\npersonality, sovereignty and independence of States, which\nwas sponsored by 30 members of the Organization of\nAmerican States (OAS) at the twenty-seventh session of its\nGeneral Assembly at Lima, Peru, speaks directly to this\nissue and strongly promotes the spirit of partnership that\nmust underpin an interdependent approach to addressing the\ncommon problem of narcotics trafficking and abuse.\nInternational cooperation in this regard must mean the\navoidance of not just political, but also of economic,\nunilateralism. For example, the banana industry in my\ncountry may well be destroyed by the efforts of the very\npeople who claim to be our partners in the fight against\nillicit drugs. We have a saying in Belize that the same knife\nthat sticks the sheep sticks the goat. If the prosperity of\nstrategically vulnerable southern Belize is to be sacrificed\nnow on the altar of the new orthodoxy, it will not be long\nbefore the substitute blandishments of the drug trade\nundermine our national anti-narcotics efforts to the point\nwhere they too become only burnt offerings at the feet of\nthe deity. The immutable, compassionless law of the\nmarket is very much a two-edged sword.\nIt is in this context that the forthcoming special\nsession of the General Assembly on illicit drugs is\nespecially timely. It will afford Member States an\nopportunity to discuss joint action in preventing money\nlaundering, international cooperation in judicial affairs and\nlaw enforcement. But the debate must be a thoroughly\nholistic one that looks carefully at the interrelatedness of\neconomic well-being and effective anti-narcotics policies.\nWe commend the prudence of this Assembly in its\ndecision that the Open-ended Working Group on the\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in\nthe Membership of the Security Council and Other\nMatters Related to the Security Council should continue\ndeliberations during the current session.\nIn the absence of any general agreement within the\nWorking Group, Belize would find it difficult to accept a\nstrict deadline in relation to Council expansion. Further,\nwe do not wish to see qualitative distinctions in the\ndecision making ability of existing and possible new\npermanent members. We note with gratitude that Belize\u2019s\ncomprehensive proposals on the subject are still included\namong the views being considered.\nOn another issue related to reform, the principles of\nequitability and universality confer urgency on the claim\nfor consideration of the Republic of China on Taiwan.\nTwenty-one million people living in a successful, robust\nand prosperous democracy should be entitled at the very\nleast to a discussion of their circumstances. The blanket\n\u201cno\u201d, the annual ritual that continues to slam the door\nshut on even the possibility of debating their aspirations,\nis irrational and unenlightened. A way must be found to\nreview this situation in a manner consistent with the\nrights of the parties and the spirit of the Charter.\nThis Organization, it appears, is completing a period\nof intense self-examination and introspection. We must\ncontinue to counter the influences that would ascribe a\ndiminished role to multilateralism. Our flexibility and a\nvisible search for consensus have enabled us to retool.\nWe are demonstrating that we are still equal to the tasks\nahead. With reform and renewal moving to the fore this\nyear, it is clear that the crisis of confidence is over.\n6\n\n\nWith an able chief executive, the United Nations is\nnow, therefore, strengthening and repositioning itself to\nsurmount the challenges that face us.\nIt is our sincere wish that in the weeks ahead we will\nreach a new pass in our great undertaking, and that\nmomentous debate will result in keen, relevant and timely\ndecision-making.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is an honour for me to take part in this\nGeneral Assembly as the representative of the people and\nGovernment of Peru, under the leadership of President\nAlberto Fujimori. I extend my congratulations to you, Mr.\nPresident, on your election to preside over this session\nand assure you of the fullest support by the delegation of\nPeru. We likewise congratulate Ambassador Razali Ismail,\nPresident of the previous session.\nPeru reaffirms its unfailing dedication to the\npurposes, principles and norms enshrined in the Charter\nof the United Nations, without whose faithful application\nit is not possible to achieve peace and harmonious\ncoexistence among States. We must all ensure respect for\ninternational law, especially scrupulous and good-faith\ncompliance with treaties, and must contribute to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security and\nparticipate in the promotion of economic and social\ndevelopment. Accordingly, effective observance of the\nCharter and respect for its principles are today more\nnecessary than ever in order to endow multilateralism\nwith renewed credibility and vigour. We live in a day of\nmarked change in the organization of power and of\nglobalizing trends in the international system which\nrequire, in keeping with the Charter, a scrupulous\negalitarianism in relations between States and,\naccordingly, multilateral policies in keeping with the\ntimes as an appropriate means of conferring priority on\nthe common goals of mankind in our era.\nInstitutional reform of the United Nations system is\nimperative to make it more efficient, adapt it to the\npresent needs of the international community and\nconsolidate institutions that will be truly representative of\nthe interests we all share.\nFor four years now the General Assembly has been\nat work on the reform of the Security Council. National\npositions have already been made known and reiterated.\nWe should now decide whether we shall embark on the\nnegotiations proper or whether that should be deferred\nuntil better political conditions prevail, for the\nunproductive prolongation of this debate could affect the\n8\n\n\nprestige and authority of the Organization at a juncture\nwhen it is essential instead to strengthen it as the supreme\nworld forum for dialogue, understanding and cooperation.\nWe are aware of the difficulty of this process. To\nthose who have a duty to exercise their power with self-\nrestraint we address an invitation to be flexible. We also\nbelieve that pressures or haste would be ill advised, since\nthey could hinder the achievement of a legitimate and vital\ngoal.\nPeru believes it is necessary to make the Security\nCouncil representative, to enhance its legitimacy, to secure\nequitable geographical representation through its expansion,\nto give it greater transparency, and to take the first steps\ntowards the abolition of the veto through strict limits on its\nuse. Accordingly, Peru supports the increase of both\ncategories of members. All of the foregoing should be\nachieved through a legitimate agreement that does not\ndiscriminate against developing countries.\nTo keep pace with the momentum generated by global\nproblems, a new institutional structure is needed, such as\nthat proposed by the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, in his\n\u201cA Programme for Reform.\u201d In order better to serve\ninternational peace and stability and the sustained growth of\nthe world economy, renewed efforts are needed that will be\nin keeping with the diversity of Member States.\nWe support the strengthening of the Secretariat, the\nemphasis on the promotion of development and the\nrecommendation for rationalizing and optimizing the use of\nits financial resources, as well as the transfer of the\nresources thus released to development cooperation\nactivities.\nThe Human Development Report for 1977 reveals that\nthe problem of internally displaced persons has taken on\ndramatic dimensions; the numbers increased fivefold during\nthe decade 1984-1994. At the same time, we note in the\nreport submitted by the representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral to the Commission on Human Rights concerning\ninstitutional lacunae in this area of the United Nations that\nthere is no institution with exclusive responsibility for such\ndisplaced persons.\nWe propose that at this session of the General\nAssembly, which the Secretary General has called the\nreform Assembly, the question of institutional responsibility\nfor the internally displaced be addressed.\nPeru favours the idea of unifying the country offices\nand operations of the agencies to facilitate the\nimplementation of comprehensive programmes in which\nthe United Nations system will be able to put its\nrecognized capacities to full use.\nNo reform can be successful without the necessary\nfinancial resources. The financial situation of the\nOrganization is a subject of widespread concern. Peru is\nof the view that contributions to the regular budget are a\nlegal obligation that should be fully and promptly\ndischarged. The principle of capacity to pay should\nremain the fundamental criterion in the apportionment of\nassessments. Accordingly, if States in arrears do not take\nconcrete measures to clear their indebtedness, certainly\nwithout setting conditions, it will not be possible in a\ntimely manner to earmark resources for activities essential\nto the majority of our countries. Such is the case, for\nexample, with the campaign against poverty.\nThere are other key questions on our increasingly\nabundant international agenda. We must place increasing\nemphasis on economic and social issues, cooperation for\ndevelopment, environmental protection, humanitarian\nassistance, the advancement and defence of human rights\nand, of course, the fight against illegal drug trafficking,\nterrorism and corruption.\nPeru approaches the development of the international\nsystem on the basis of four criteria that guide its foreign\npolicy: the pre-eminence of representative democracy and\nthe rule of law; the promotion of the fundamental rights\nof the human person; consolidation of the market\neconomy and development of regional economic\nintegration agreements; and the search for peace and the\nadvancement of cooperation for development.\nIn the era of globalization, Peru views international\npeace and security as multidimensional tasks. If States are\nto assume them as real commitments and priorities, they\nmust be associated with a higher purpose, namely, with\nimproving the intolerable lot of some 60 per cent of the\nworld's population.\nProblems such as poverty, acute poverty, illiteracy,\nmalnutrition, infant mortality, discrimination and\nmarginalization in general constitute a picture of potential\nsocial violence that threatens the universal ideal of a\npeaceful and orderly life. The plight of poverty and the\nchallenge of promoting human development have\nradically altered the direction and pace of international\nrelations.\n9\n\n\nThe international system is tending towards a gradual\ndemilitarization. With the end of the cold war and the\nreduced risk of a global military confrontation, conditions\nhave been created to give priority, on the basis of dialogue\nand cooperation, to the long-delayed task of advancing\neconomic and social development.\nGeneral and complete disarmament continues to be a\nkey element in security and an abiding goal of the\ninternational community. Peru attaches special importance\nto non-proliferation in all its aspects, primarily nuclear non-\nproliferation and nuclear disarmament. My country\nparticipated actively in the arduous negotiations that\nculminated in the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\nand signed it on the day it was opened for signature.\nWe are gratified at the outcome of the Oslo\nDiplomatic Conference, in the context of the Ottawa\nprocess to prohibit the production, transfer and\nindiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines, in which\nPeru has participated as a full member from the outset. We\nare preparing to sign the global agreement in December.\nThe Rio Group has undertaken to make our region the first\nin the world to be free of these odious devices, which day\nafter day continue to take their toll of thousands of innocent\nvictims.\nPeru is a peace-loving country that works for peace\nand repudiates conflict. We want to strengthen political and\neconomic cooperation with all countries and groups of\ncountries in various regions on the basis of common\ninterests and mutual benefit. We emphasize especially the\nforging of closer ties of friendship and cooperation with\nneighbouring countries and fostering mutual trust through\nspecific processes, mechanisms and measures that we are\nvigorously pursuing.\nWithout economic growth, there can be no creation of\nwealth or jobs, and without these there can be no\ndevelopment or prosperity. That is the great challenge of\nour time. We must act to create conditions of market\ntransparency and social convergence in order to sustain the\ngrowth of the world economy, the opening and\nliberalization of trade, services and capital flows and the\ntransfer of technology. Developed and developing countries\nmust reach an understanding in order to avoid a return to\nthat not-so-distant past when narrow forms of protectionism\nand conditionalities failed to overcome inequality and,\nindeed, aggravated it.\nGlobalization must not lead to greater poverty and\ndiscrimination, for they are one of the principal obstacles to\nstability, and, on the eve of the twenty-first century, they\nalso pose a moral challenge. We must adopt measures to\nincorporate disadvantaged societies into policies and\nprocesses that promote economic growth and social\ndevelopment.\nIn Peru, the campaign for the gradual reduction of\npoverty until its eradication has taken a comprehensive\napproach. Its focal points are openness, modernization and\nliberalization of the economy, reform of the State and a\nlegal framework that guarantees property and promotes\ninvestment. In addition, we are pursuing consistent\nsectoral policies, financed by 40 per cent of our national\nbudget going to items in the social sphere, such as health,\nhousing, education, population and justice. The results\nalready achieved in economic and social growth are well\nknown, and Peru is considered a stable, secure country\nwith a bright future. Around the year 2000, the Peruvian\nGovernment hopes significantly to reduce acute poverty\nand poverty in general.\nThe United Nations has primary responsibility for\naddressing three negatives trends of universal scope: illicit\ndrug trafficking, terrorism and corruption. We are\ncombating vigorously these criminal phenomena because\nthey erode fundamental values and threaten the stability\nof democracies. The upcoming special session of the\nGeneral Assembly on the question of drugs \u2014 a session\nthat we fully support \u2014 calls for unity of purpose. The\ninternational community will have an excellent\nopportunity to tackle this problem in all of its dimensions.\nPeru has been achieving concrete results in all facets of\nthis comprehensive campaign, not only in interdiction but\nalso in crop eradication and alternative development. We\nhope to see a substantial increase in international\ncooperation that would help step up our anti-drug policy\nand would complement, even if only partially, the\ntremendous national efforts that we have been making.\nWe hope that this enhanced cooperation will materialize,\nin view of the increased awareness and greater political\nwill that have emerged worldwide regarding a problem\nfor which all of us, without exception, share\nresponsibility.\nThe Eighth International Anti-Corruption\nConference, which took place three weeks ago in the\ncapital of Peru, brought together more than 600\nrepresentatives from 93 countries. I wish to highlight the\nset of recommendations that emerged for combating\npublic and private corruption. These are contained in the\nLima Declaration, the first global document of its kind. It\nestablishes an evaluation and follow-up mechanism that\n10\n\n\nwill bring these recommendations to the attention of\nGovernments and international institutions. The goal\nhenceforth in this endeavour, which concerns Governments\nand citizens equally, will be to identify specific problem\nareas, taking into account public opinion and with the\neffective participation of civil society.\nThe United Nations, as the global framework for\ncombating corruption in all its manifestations, must\nparticipate in these efforts, just as the inter-American\nsystem has been doing within its own geographical area.\nThe phenomenon of terrorism has, at the cost of\ncountless innocent human lives and huge material losses,\ntoday placed itself on the agenda of contemporary\ninternational relations. We have already unequivocally and\nat all levels condemned terrorist acts and the criminal\ngroups that perpetrate them, and we have also agreed that\nterrorist acts represent human rights violations. It is now\ntime to undertake a process of consultation that will enable\nthe international community to avail itself of universal legal\ninstruments with which to combat effectively terrorism in\nall its forms and manifestations, as we are striving to do on\nour continent.\nFive years after the adoption of the plan of action of\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, held at Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the lack of\nprogress on Agenda 21 is discouraging. There has been an\nerosion of the political commitment entered into, especially\nwith respect to the allocation of new and additional\nresources, as well as scant willingness to transfer\ntechnology to the developing countries.\nWe reaffirm that only a comprehensive approach can\nlead to the achievement of sustainable development,\nbecause this requires a consolidation of the process of the\nopening and liberalization of trade, as well as commercial\nand environmental policies that are mutually supportive. An\nadequate transfer of financial resources and technologies to\nsupport national policies is also required. In this task, no\nState should shirk its individual responsibility.\nOne of the challenges facing the international\ncommunity is to ensure the effective promotion and full\nobservance of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nThe advancement and protection of human rights are central\nconcerns of the Peruvian Government. The concept of\nhuman development, which underlies the entire economic\nand social policy of our State, focuses on a revalorization\nof life and of the human being. The cooperation of the\nUnited Nations is essential, through a realistic approach that\ntakes due account of regional and national characteristics\nand that is geared primarily to achieving a culture of\nhuman rights.\nMany countries, including Peru, are currently facing\na cyclical, worldwide natural phenomenon known as El\nNi\u00f1o, whose severe economic, environmental and social\nconsequences are drastically changing the marine\nenvironment, which is a source of food and employment\nfor broad sectors of humankind. The damage that these\nlarge-scale oceanic and atmospheric changes did in the\npast prompted my country some decades ago to promote\nthe study of this phenomenon. Thus in 1974 a regional\nstudy of El Ni\u00f1o was carried out in the framework of the\nPermanent South Pacific Commission, a subregional\norgan of the South-East Pacific Action Plan, which has\ncontinued to address this problem with the valuable\nsupport of organizations such as the Intergovernmental\nOceanographic Commission and the World\nMeteorological Organization.\nThe knowledge acquired by Peru and other countries,\nas well as by international, regional, and world bodies,\nneeds to be integrated and systematized. Accordingly,\nPeru proposes the establishment of a global programme\nof integrated cooperation on the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon,\nwhich would enable our countries to mitigate its effects\nand the ensuing material damage. In order to lay the\nfoundations of this program and set it in motion, we\nshould consider holding an international meeting with the\nparticipation of the relevant agencies of the system,\nregional organs and the respective national programmes\nof the countries concerned. In this context, we propose\nthat, as part of the reform of the United Nations system,\nits operational capacity in the area of the monitoring and\nthe mobilization of assistance for natural disasters be\nmaintained and strengthened.\nThe development policy now being implemented in\nPeru is anchored in the universal concepts, values and\nprinciples propounded by the United Nations: democracy,\neconomic freedom, respect for the fundamental rights of\nthe human person, environmental conservation, the\nadvancement of women and protection of the rights of\nindigenous populations.\nResponding to the dictates of its history and\ngeography, Peruvian society has since ancient times\nembodied the ideal of unity within diversity. We\nPeruvians are laying the foundations of our own future. I\nshall not dwell on the policies that we have been pursuing\nfor the last seven years, their impressive results or the\n11\n\n\nvicissitudes in this process that have tested our resolve and\nperseverance. But I feel that it is appropriate to repeat the\nprincipal characteristic of our development model, which is\na harmonious and rational complementary relationship\nbetween economic and social policies, which for the first\ntime in many years is enabling us to carry out a realistic\nstrategy for sustainable human development. Accordingly,\nthe modern and efficient functioning of the United Nations\nsystem of cooperation is now, more than ever, of strategic\nvalue to Peru. I should like in particular to express thanks\nfor the cooperation that the United Nations system has been\nproviding to the Peruvian people, which is stimulating and\ncomplementing our national effort.\nThe United Nations is the best instrument available at\na global level to consolidate international peace and\nsecurity, respect for the sovereignty and independence of\nStates and international law, and for the promotion of\neconomic and social development. Accordingly, its\noperations, approaches and strategies should provide\neffective answers to the challenges of the contemporary\nworld and the needs of our peoples, who continue to place\ntheir hopes in our Organization. Peru will always remain\ncommitted to that endeavour.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to begin by\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election to your\nhonourable post. You may count on our full support and\ndedication to your goals.\nYou, Sir, have inherited the legacy of the outgoing\nPresident, Ambassador Razali Ismail, which we can build\non: friendly atmosphere, lively debates, productive spirit,\nstrong desire for change and reform, and, last but not\nleast, brilliant management of the Assembly\u2019s work. My\nGovernment congratulates Ambassador Razali on his\noutstanding performance.\nI come from a country that is in the midst of\ncomprehensive reforms. Top-to-bottom institutional\nchanges have reshaped our society from its very roots,\nestablishing a commonly accepted democratic way of life.\nRadical changes involved in introducing a market\neconomy have borne fruit. Today, our democracy and\nmarket economy are inextricably linked with the new\nsecurity and economic framework of a united Europe.\nOur reform experience demonstrates that the courage\nto grasp the moment \u2014 to respond rapidly if and when\nthe changing situation requires \u2014 a key for success. We\nhave this key in our hands, and we need the determination\nto use it. With the end of the cold war, the fall of the\nbipolar system and the failure of power politics have\ngiven us a new chance to look deeper into the core of the\nUnited Nations and to reshape it in line with the needs\nand expectations of its Member States and for the benefit\nof all. The picture of the road ahead is visible.\nWe want this session of the General Assembly to be\ndominated by the programme of reforms. Lithuania\u2019s\nGovernment supports the Secretary-General\u2019s reform\ninitiative, which is expected to spur most fundamental\nchanges. We are confident that the Secretary-General will\nsuccessfully implement that part of his programme which\nfalls within his own responsibility.\nIt is unlikely that everyone will be happy about\nevery part of the proposed reforms. We, the Member\nStates, have to see the Secretary-General\u2019s proposals in\ntheir entirety, and, rising above narrow national interests,\nfind a compromise on every step that brings us closer to\na more focused, more efficient, more transparent and\nmore democratic United Nations. Lithuania is ready to\nplay an active part in achieving agreement on a United\nNations structure that will reflect the nature of the United\nNations mandate and its core functions: maintenance of\npeace and security, sustainable development and\n8\n\n\npromotion of human rights, humanitarian assistance, and\nsocial and economic progress. They should be placed within\na strict time-frame. Otherwise, lack of dynamics in the\nnegotiation process will cause a loss of direction.\nWhat is of special concern to us is that the financial\ndifficulties of the Organization are affecting its performance\nand endanger the progress of reforms. Lithuania will fulfil\nits financial obligations to the United Nations and urges\nother States to do so. At the same time, United Nations\nfinancing must reflect a State\u2019s capacity to pay. The scheme\nof limits has to be removed from the new scale of\nassessments that is to be negotiated this autumn. Lithuania\ncontinues to support the package of comprehensive\nproposals put forward by the European Union designed to\nput the Organization on a sound and predictable financial\nfooting.\nAlthough the reform of the Security Council started as\na separate process, it is now part of the entire package of\nUnited Nations reform. It was inspired by the general\nacknowledgement that the time had come for the Council\nto reflect new realities in world politics. Today we have\nmore nations able and willing to serve permanently on the\nSecurity Council than in the days of its inception. Two such\nStates are Germany and Japan. Asia, Africa and Latin\nAmerica, too, legitimately aspire to have new permanent\nseats. And there are more States whose contributions to the\ngoals of the United Nations point to the need for greater\nappreciation and better accommodation of their interests.\nWe want a comprehensive reform of the Council\nwhereby the number of non-permanent seats increases as\nwell. The Group of Eastern European States, whose number\nhas more than doubled over the past few years, deserves at\nleast one additional seat. Our position on this is very firm.\nWe also need a more transparent and democratic\nSecurity Council. But, most important, the reform should\ncontinue to progress. This year\u2019s discussions have been\nproductive, thanks to the efforts of the former President of\nthe General Assembly, Ambassador Razali. I hope the\nprocess will retain its vigour.\nIn the post-confrontation era, there are far too many\nweapons around the world. Fortunately, today there are\nmore tools to control the spread of the most deadly\nweapons. Last year we adopted the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \u2014 a major breakthrough in\nnuclear disarmament, which is feasible when pursued in\nconsecutive steps. The next step should be to ban the\nspread of fissile material for nuclear warheads.\nThe world\u2019s attention has been captured by the\nnegotiations in Oslo on the agreement to ban one of the\nmost inhumane weapons: anti-personnel landmines. We\nsupport these efforts, which require profound rethinking\nof national defence strategies in many countries, including\nLithuania. Confidence-building measures and security\ncooperation will help humanitarian concerns reign over\nmilitary purposes.\nWe have faith in regional and bilateral efforts to\ndisarm. Europe has set out on the path of toughening the\nrequirements for the stationing of conventional forces,\nthrough the adaptation of the Treaty on Conventional\nArmed Forces in Europe. We support this process and\nbelieve that it can be a model for other regions.\nEven though the total number of peacekeeping\noperations and their average size have been reduced in\nrecent years, peacekeeping is still the key instrument\navailable to the United Nations in discharging its primary\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\nand security. Together with Estonia and Latvia, and with\nPoland, Lithuania is developing joint peacekeeping units.\nApart from its genuine objective of contributing to United\nNations goals, this exercise is, in itself, a testimony to full\nunderstanding and cooperation among the neighbouring\ncountries of our region.\nIn recent years we have witnessed an increase in the\nrole and functions of international civilian police in\npeacekeeping operations. The civilian police forces can\nplay a major role, through assistance to local police\nforces, in rebuilding national police and judicial systems,\nin restoring civil order, in supporting the rule of law and\nin facilitating national reconciliation. The need for\nassistance from international civilian police is likely to\nincrease. It can be met by properly functioning United\nNations standby arrangements, which are designed to\nexpand the rapid-deployment capacity of the Organization.\nLithuania has decided to join the United Nations system\nof standby arrangements for peacekeeping operations.\nLater today, I shall submit to the Secretary-General a\ndetailed description of our permanently available\ncontribution, including well-trained police officers.\nNations around the world are being challenged by\ncertain phenomena which know no boundaries and which\ncan be tackled only by joint action. Fighting international\ncrime, drug trafficking and terrorism and ensuring\nenvironmental protection and humanitarian aid are among\nsuch challenges.\n9\n\n\nLithuania wholeheartedly supports the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s reform effort to strengthen, through the United\nNations entities in Vienna, the Organization\u2019s capacity\ncoherently and systematically to address threats to the\nstability and development of society created by\ntransnational crime in all its manifestations. For its part, the\nGovernment of Lithuania is determined to enhance regional\nstructures combating transnational organized crime as well\nas fully to implement bilateral, regional and multilateral\nagreements in this area.\nWe also look forward to the special session of the\nGeneral Assembly in 1998, which should enable the\ninternational community to develop new and improved\nstrategies to address the problem of illicit narcotic drugs.\nAlthough the nineteenth special session of the General\nAssembly was not a milestone of success and ended with\nfew commitments, we strongly believe that the political will\ndemonstrated by the presence of so many Heads of State\nand Government will be translated into action. The next\noccasion to demonstrate the seriousness of our intentions to\nprotect the environment and to agree on specific targets for\nreducing the emission of greenhouse gases, which were not\nrealized at the special session, will be the third session of\nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in\nKyoto, Japan, this December.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights will afford a great occasion to see what\nhas been done and what can be done about the protection\nof and respect for basic international human rights.\nWe welcome the appointment of Mrs. Mary Robinson\nas the High Commissioner for Human Rights and express\nour support for the structural reforms of the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and\nthe Centre for Human Rights. Internal restructuring of the\nUnited Nations human rights organs should go hand in hand\nwith close cooperation in human rights issues between the\nUnited Nations and such regional arrangements as the\nCouncil of Europe, the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe and others.\nIllegal migration and trafficking in migrants threaten\nstability in Central and Eastern Europe. We believe that\ntreaties on readmission between the States of the region\ncould be a key instrument against these threats. Lithuania\nurges the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent\nStates that have not yet done so to accede to the 1951\nConvention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967\nProtocol and to further strengthen national institutions\nresponsible for the management of migration flows.\nWe believe in a regional approach to regional issues.\nWe praise the United Nations reliance on regional\norganizations. The Organization for Cooperation and\nSecurity in Europe is a good example of what a regional\ninstitution with a limited budget can do rather than\nplacing the burden on the United Nations. The North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is another good\nexample. The record of the two organizations in the\nformer Yugoslavia is much better than what could have\nbeen achieved had the United Nations alone dealt with the\nwar.\nAlong with other measures towards a more\nconsolidated peace, good-neighbourly relations have\nbecome vital for regional security and stability. We have\ndone our utmost to establish and maintain friendly\nrelations with our neighbours, while simultaneously taking\npractical steps towards integration into the European\nUnion and NATO. The accession of Lithuania to\nEuropean and transatlantic institutions will have a\nsignificant impact on lasting security and stability.\nYesterday the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr. Primakov,\nproposed a different security model of our region.\nHowever, creating a substitute for transatlantic integration\nis not in line with our vision. The international Vilnius\nconference entitled, \u201cCoexistence of Nations and Good\nNeighbourhood Relations \u2014 A Guarantee of Security and\nStability in Europe\u201d, for which Lithuanian and Polish\nPresidents Algirdas Brazauskas and Aleksander\nKwasniewski acted as hosts in September of this year and\nwhich was attended by 12 Heads of State and\nGovernment, received joint greetings from the Presidents\nof Germany and France, Roman Herzog and Jacques\nChirac. They wrote:\n\\\"It is time to foster a culture of cooperation and\ndialogue all over Europe and to harness the political\nenergies of our peoples to bring about reconciliation\nand understanding ... Only in a spirit of unity,\ncommunity, friendship and good- neighbourly\nrelations, as well as mutual understanding, will we\nbe able to build the future of our continent.\\\"\nHere at the United Nations, I am tempted to quote this\nsentence, but with the last word, \\\"continent,\\\" in the plural.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPlease allow me at the outset,\nSir, to express my sincere congratulations on your election\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-second\nsession. The expectations of this session are great and the\ntasks demanding; however, your experience and political\nwisdom are a guarantee that they will be fulfilled.\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank His\nExcellency for Razali Ismail, Ambassador of Malaysia, for\nhis energetic and successful presidency of the fifty-first\nsession.\nAlmost two years have passed since we, Heads of\nState and Government of the United Nations Member\nStates, confirmed our commitment to the idea of reform\nin this very Hall. This reform should contribute to the\naccomplishment of the mission of the United Nations in\nthe current international situation as well as to greater\nefficiency of the Organization. Today, we have before us\na comprehensive set of proposals by the Secretary-\nGeneral in \u201cRenewing the United Nations: A Programme\nfor Reform\u201d (A/51/950). This document proves that the\ndiscussions held within the last two years, and the\nexperience gained in recent decades, have helped the new\nSecretary-General to prepare, within a few months,\nconcrete proposals providing a basis for further decisions.\nSlovenia joins those who have expressed their\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for the impressive\nwork he has performed in the first months of his mandate.\nThis work has included concrete measures for the\nfunctioning of the Secretariat and proposals for reform.\nWe are well aware, however, that the responsibility now\nlies with us. We, the representatives of the Member States\nand the peoples of the United Nations, are responsible for\ndecisions that will give impetus to the necessary reforms\nand enable the Organization to deal with the tasks of the\ncoming century.\nOur approach should not be based primarily on\ncalculations of what individual Member States might gain\nfrom the reform. It should above all be based on an\nassessment of how to reform the Organization so that it\nwill better serve all of us. This will be possible only if\n\n\nthe Organization becomes better able to fulfil its basic\ntasks \u2014 the maintenance of international peace and security\nand comprehensive economic and social development,\nparticularly in developing countries \u2014 and to ensure broad\nrespect for the promotion and protection of individual and\ncollective human rights.\nAnother important requirement for the success of this\nreform programme is for the United Nations to take its\ndecisions promptly and on time. The past years have made\npossible all-round discussion about reform. And now is the\ntime for decisions: Slovenia believes that major decisions\nshould be taken during the first part of the present session\nof the General Assembly. The President of the General\nAssembly will play a significant role with regard to those\ndecisions that cannot be postponed. We fully support and\nencourage you, Sir, in your assumption of an active role\nand in your determined management of the decision-making\nprocess.\nSlovenia supports the proposals contained in the\nSecretary-General\u2019s report on a programme for reform. This\nproject deserves all our attention and assistance. Its main\nvalue is that it offers the possibility of concrete decisions\nwhile remaining open to new ideas and proposals.\nThe proposals for promoting sustainable development,\ndefined as a priority task by the Secretary-General himself,\ndeserve careful examination. The impression is that these\nproposals are headed in the right direction, although clearer\nanswers to questions on development financing will be\nrequired. The \u201cdevelopment dividend\u201d created by the\nstreamlining of the Secretariat will not be able to provide\nall the answers we need. Concrete proposals will be needed\nto define more accurately the tasks of the proposed office\nfor development financing, which would encourage\ninnovative means of mobilizing new financial resources for\ndevelopment.\nSlovenia agrees with the suggestion of the Secretary-\nGeneral that human rights should be integrated into all\nprincipal activities of the United Nations, such as peace and\nsecurity, economic and social affairs, development\ncooperation and humanitarian affairs. This approach\npromises a significant improvement in the activities of the\nUnited Nations in these areas. It would also lead to\nincreasingly comprehensive United Nations activities in the\nfield of human rights.\nRespect for human rights is achieved not only through\nthe functioning of instruments to monitor compliance with\ninternational treaties but also through political, social and\neconomic measures that allow human rights to become an\nintegral part of social development and a part of the\neveryday life of each individual. Observance of human\nrights must be closely linked with the promotion of social\nprogress and the eradication of poverty in order to secure\nhuman dignity, essential social security and development.\nFurthermore, this would substantially contribute to the\nelimination of political tensions and of the root causes of\nthreats to international peace. Should the United Nations\nfail to ensure respect for human dignity and the protection\nof human rights, its basic mission will not be fulfilled.\nThe new High Commissioner for Human Rights will\ncertainly assume an important role in the search for\nsolutions to salient issues. We note with pleasure that it\nis Mrs. Mary Robinson, until recently the President of\nIreland, who has been appointed to this post. Mrs.\nRobinson has already won worldwide recognition, and we\nwish her every success and look forward to her proposals\nfor improvements in the field of human rights.\nReform of the Security Council constitutes an\nimportant part of the reform of the United Nations. The\nperiod following the end of the cold war only reconfirms\nthe importance of the effective functioning of the\nmechanisms of collective security. However, it also calls\nfor changes in the composition of the Security Council\nand for the improvement of its working methods.\nSlovenia is committed to a reasonable and balanced\nincrease in the number of permanent and non-permanent\nmembers of the Security Council, to a restriction on the\nuse of the veto and to greater transparency in the\nfunctioning of the Council. It is our hope that the\ndiscussions on Security Council reform, which have been\ngoing on for several years now, will lead to appropriate\ndecisions that have the genuine support of the\nmembership of the United Nations.\nSlovenia also endorses the approach taken by the\nSecretary-General in the field of disarmament.\nDisarmament has been one of the priority goals of the\nUnited Nations since its foundation. We have good reason\nto be satisfied, since disarmament efforts have registered\nconsiderable progress with respect to weapons of mass\ndestruction. The Chemical Weapons Convention, signed\nfour years ago, entered into force this year. We expect it\nto be implemented effectively, although this will be\nfeasible only if the Convention is ratified by all the\nremaining countries, particularly those disposing of large\nstockpiles of chemical weapons or of resources for their\nproduction.\n2\n\n\nThe indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the conclusion of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty last year have\nconsiderably reduced the dangers created by nuclear\nweapons. But the time has come to take further steps. We\nneed to ensure universal adherence to the ban on nuclear\ntests and to accelerate negotiations for the ban on the\nproduction of fissile material for nuclear weapons.\nEndeavours towards the reduction of nuclear-weapon\narsenals should be intensified in order to ensure their\ngradual elimination.\nI wish to place special emphasis on the importance of\nthe early adoption of the international convention on a\ncomprehensive ban on anti-personnel landmines and their\ndestruction. Slovenia has joined those countries that have\nalready renounced their use, transfer and production, and\nhas been participating actively in the Ottawa process since\nits inception. Negotiations concerning these issues have just\nbeen brought to a successful conclusion at the diplomatic\nconference in Oslo. Early in December of this year,\nSlovenia will join those who intend, in the presence of the\nSecretary-General, to sign the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer\nof Anti-Personnel Landmines and on Their Destruction.\nDisarmament efforts constitute an important element\nin the strengthening of international security. The formation\nand implementation of the regional arms control and\ndisarmament regimes represent an effective mechanism in\nstrengthening security. The experience gained during the\nBalkan crisis, which posed the most serious threat to peace\nin Europe since the foundation of the United Nations,\nstrengthens our belief that lower armament thresholds\nshould be imposed. More weapons can only present greater\ntemptation and danger.\nNone of the endeavours aimed at modernizing the\nOrganization by providing relevant answers to global issues\nwill have any guarantee of success if the United Nations\nproves unable to contribute to the solution of those crisis\nsituations that pose a threat to international peace and that\ngenerate humanitarian problems. These situations are now\nassuming larger dimensions than in any other period of\nUnited Nations activity to date. The credibility of the\nOrganization and the functioning of its main bodies must be\nrepeatedly proven. Special importance in this respect must\nbe attached to the activities of the Security Council, which,\nin accordance with the Charter, bears primary responsibility\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security.\nToday, expectations regarding action by the Security\nCouncil are more realistic than they were several years\nago. However, they are no less demanding. The Security\nCouncil is taking an active part in issues concerning\ninternational peace on the African continent. It has proved\nits ability to apply a variety of the methods that are at its\ndisposal in accordance with the Charter. These include\npreventive diplomacy, cooperation with the Organization\nof African Unity, classic peacekeeping operations and the\nuse of measured and focused economic sanctions. The\nappropriate choice of these methods has enabled the\nSecurity Council to formulate relevant approaches to the\nsituations in Liberia, Angola and Burundi. As for some\nother crisis areas, including the Republic of the Congo,\nthe most appropriate approach still remains to be found.\nThe Security Council is also participating in settling\nissues which arise after the military conflicts. In Europe,\nthe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina provides an\nexample of such involvement. Following the conclusion\nof the Dayton agreement, which halted the war, the\nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina has stabilized to a\ncertain extent. Yet peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina is\nstill far from secure. The return of refugees is proceeding\nslowly, is limited, and is facing hindrances. The\nauthorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina have not been\nfunctioning as stipulated in the peace accord, and the\nprincipal war-crime suspects have not yet been transferred\nto stand trial at the International Tribunal for the former\nYugoslavia. The United Nations has been performing a\nnumber of important tasks in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nparticularly in the areas of humanitarian aid, unarmed\ncivil police activity and criminal prosecution. The scope\nof the present engagement of the United Nations in\nBosnia and Herzegovina is, however, is in proportion with\nthe increased coordination of action taken in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina by other international organizations. At the\nsame time, success in those fields falling within the\ncompetence of the United Nations is of critical\nimportance for the establishment of lasting peace.\nLet me take this opportunity to stress that the\ninevitable starting point for solving the crisis in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina is the precise identification of the nature\nof that devastating war, which has not been completely\nstopped. If there is a lack of willingness to identify the\nreasons for and the nature of the war, and its aims and\nprotagonists, then the healing will inevitably be a lengthy\nand expensive process, with many risks to human life and\nproperty. One must even envisage the possibility that the\nsearch for peace might prove unsuccessful.\n3\n\n\nThe activities underway in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nhave assumed the character of a post-conflict action, but\ntheir aim is also a preventive one. Experience gained in\nrecent years has shown that conflicts often re-emerge in the\nabsence of appropriate preventive action of a diplomatic,\neconomic or, if necessary, military character. The time to\nwithdraw the international forces from Bosnia and\nHerzegovina will have to be considered very carefully.\nWithdrawing too early could lead to a recurrence of the\ninitial situation of instability or of armed conflict.\nAn example of successful preventive action\nrepresenting an important lesson for the future has been\nprovided by the international operation in Albania this year.\nOperation Alba was conducted on the initiative and under\nthe leadership of Italy, in agreement with the Albanian\nGovernment and with the authorization of the Security\nCouncil. That operation has shown how quick and\ndetermined action taken by a group of countries in the\nvicinity of the emerging crisis situation, and with the\nauthorization of the Security Council, can prevent armed\nconflict and potential destabilization in the region. Slovenia\ntook part in that successful operation and is ready to\nparticipate in other preventive actions, as well as in other\npeacekeeping operations. That readiness has been confirmed\nby the decision of the Security Council to include a\nSlovenian contingent in the peacekeeping operation in\nCyprus.\nThe recent international action in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and Albania, as examples of regional crises,\ndemonstrates the importance of the participation of regional\norganizations; such a role has been played by the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\nSlovenia\u2019s readiness to contribute towards\nimplementing the objectives of the United Nations has also\nbeen manifested by the candidature of Slovenia for a non-\npermanent seat on the Security Council for the period 1998-\n1999 in the elections to be held at the General Assembly in\na few weeks\u2019 time. Slovenia has confirmed its role as a\nState that has been successfully coping with the issues of\ndevelopment and of good-neighbourly relations. Within the\nscope of its possibilities, it has also been striving for long-\nterm stabilization of the situation in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and in the region at large. Through this action\nand its other international activity, Slovenia has proved to\nbe a factor for peace and stability in Europe.\nAs a Member of the United Nations, Slovenia is\nactively participating in the discussion on reform, including\nthe issue of reform of the Security Council. Our readiness\nto contribute, in practice, to the work of the Security\nCouncil has been manifested by our cooperation in the\npeacekeeping operations in Albania and in Cyprus. And\nlast but certainly not least, Slovenia has been paying its\nmembership contributions to the regular budget and to the\npeacekeeping budget in full and on time.\nAs a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the\nSecurity Council, we undertake in the event of our\nelection to observe the principles of openness and\ntransparency of action, and will strive to strengthen the\nties between the Security Council and rest of the\nmembership of the United Nations.\nMay I in conclusion reiterate again the importance\nof this session of the General Assembly and of the\ndecisions to be taken. We have arrived at a stage where\nwe may see the crystallization of solutions that will\nprepare the United Nations to cope with the tasks of the\nnext century. It is our responsibility to formulate these\nsolutions in a sufficiently clear and comprehensive\nmanner, and in that way provide for the viable future of\nour common Organization. I firmly believe that we, the\npresent generation, will be able to preserve the United\nNations as it was created by our forefathers in the\nturbulent time at the end of the Second World War, as an\nOrganization committed to the principles of peace,\ncooperation, development and respect for human dignity.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI take this opportunity to congratulate you, Sir,\non your election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-second session.\nI wish also to thank your predecessor, Ambassador\nRazali of Malaysia, for the skill and commitment with\nwhich he guided our work during the last session.\nI convey to the Secretary-General and his staff my\nhigh appreciation of the often difficult initiatives they\nhave taken this year to promote peace not only between\npeoples but also within nations. These initiatives accent\nthe Organization\u2019s role and its principles, to which I am\npleased to reaffirm the commitment of the people of\nSeychelles. There have also been initiatives to promote\ndevelopment and to protect the environment and the weak\namong us, and to help stateless individuals and refugees\nfrom countries that are often marginalized.\nWe need a consistent, effective United Nations\nbacked by the funds necessary for it to carry out its\nmandate. The Secretary-General has proposed a series of\nreforms along these lines, and the Republic of Seychelles\nfirmly backs that initiative.\nSeychelles is a small island State. Yet we have done\nall in our power to integrate ourselves fully into\ninternational life and into the world economy. In that\nconnection, Seychelles has requested membership of the\nWorld Trade Organization; it is already a member of the\nIndian Ocean Commission and the Common Market for\nEastern and Southern Africa, and recently joined the\nSouthern African Development Community. Seychelles\nhas thus adopted an open economic policy designed to be\nattractive; yet we continue to face the handicaps\ncharacteristic of an island State, exacerbated by a lack of\nhuman and natural resources and by the limits of our\ndomestic markets.\nFollowing the Global Conference on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, held in\nBarbados in 1994, and in accordance with resolutions\nadopted in international forums, the international\n6\n\n\ncommunity is heeding the appeal of small island States for\nhelp in laying and strengthening the foundations of\nsustainable development. Like larger countries, small island\nStates have the same aspirations, the same needs \u2014 and\neven more so. Yet they are disadvantaged by their greatly\nlimited means and their structurally fragile economies. That\nis why it would be more equitable to identify specific\ncriteria that would integrate them harmoniously into the\nprocess of global cooperation and economic development\non both the bilateral and the multilateral levels.\nRecently, Seychelles has experienced remarkable\nclimatic setbacks. Unceasing torrential rains of unusual\nintensity have caused loss of life, flooding, landslides and\nthe destruction of homes and of infrastructure of all kinds.\nThey also threaten the environment on which our lifestyle\ndepends and our ecosystem, especially in coastal areas.\nFor a small State striving to keep pace with\ndevelopment, an unexpected upheaval, with all its economic\nand other consequences, can have far-reaching effects that\nare not immediately evident.\nI should like to take this opportunity to thank the\nDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs for having quickly\ndispatched an evaluation mission to take stock not only of\nthe damage done but of the future threats such an upheaval\nposes, given the climatic change under way on a global\nlevel. Moreover, that mission was followed by the\nlaunching of an appeal to the international community for\nassistance. The people of the Seychelles are very grateful\nfor all these actions.\nIn conclusion, I should like to express the hope that\nthe future of our planet will bring vast improvements,\nnotwithstanding the numerous difficulties that loom on the\nhorizon. The United Nations, through its initiatives and the\njoint efforts of all peoples, will most surely achieve that\ngoal.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is with particular pleasure that I extend to you, Mr.\nPresident, my sincerest congratulations, and those of my\nGovernment, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly. Your election will ensure that the business of\nthe General Assembly will be conducted skilfully,\nimpartially and very efficiently at this important moment\nfor the General Assembly, when it will have to make\ndecisions that may be vital to the future of our\nOrganization.\nThe General Assembly session that we are now\nbeginning is a particularly important one in that its\npurpose is to ensure that in the future multilateral activity\nwill be assured of validity, effectiveness and credibility.\nWith the United Nations having completed more than 50\nyears of existence, we need new ways to view the world,\nwithout forgetting the many achievements made and the\nvaluable experience gained both from successes and from\nfailures.\nThis is an appropriate time for us to renew our\ncommitment to multilateralism as the guiding principle of\ninternational relations and the essential tool to resolve\ncrises and problems that are beyond the ability of any\nState, however important or powerful it may be, to\nresolve on its own.\nThis is particularly important in the face of a\ngrowing unilateralism that has recently emerged as a\nfeature of the international scene. The new international\nreality makes it essential for States to act together so as\nto confront energetically and resolutely the problems of\nthe environment, organized crime, arms control, human\nrights, democratization, poverty, unemployment, social\nfragmentation and many other issues.\nChile has consistently contributed to the\nOrganization and, to the limits of its ability to do so, will\ncontinue to lend its strong support to the great work of\nthe United Nations in all its forums.\nI wish to speak first of the issue of the Security\nCouncil and its reform process. I stressed before the\nGeneral Assembly last year the importance of greater\ninvolvement by Member States in the decisions of the\nSecurity Council in order to strengthen its legitimacy and\n25\n\n\ngive it the necessary political backing for the actions it\nundertakes.\nWe reiterate once again the desirability of revising the\ncomposition of the Security Council and its working\nmethods. In this connection, we appreciate the arduous\nwork conducted by the Working Group on this issue, which\nhas served to clarify the various positions and to allow a\nproper appraisal of this enormously complex subject.\nI wish especially to pay tribute to the outgoing\nPresident of the General Assembly, Mr. Razali Ismail of\nMalaysia, for his keen sense of responsibility and his\ncourage in taking the initiative to make specific proposals\non these matters in order to ease the difficulties\nencountered within the Working Group and make it\npossible to analyse and discuss them in specific terms.\nMy Government considers that any future composition\nof the Council must combine the requirements of its\neffectiveness with the need for an equitable representation\nof the developing countries that properly reflects the\nincrease in the number of Members in the past 50 years.\nWhere these fundamental issues are concerned, Chile\nsupports and endorses the content of the Declaration on the\nstrengthening of the United Nations and the reform of the\nSecurity Council issued by the Heads of State or\nGovernment at the eleventh summit of the Rio Group in\nAsunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, on 24 August of this year.\nIn that Declaration we expressed the great importance\nwe attach to the process of expanding and reforming the\nSecurity Council, which must result in a broad general\nagreement that will make it possible to correct the\nimbalances in its current composition, improve the decision-\nmaking mechanisms, make the conduct of its work more\ntransparent and represent with greater legitimacy all States\nMembers of the Organization.\nWith regard to the total number of members of the\nSecurity Council, we believe that a membership of up to 25\nwould not impair its effectiveness, provided that the\nexpansion met the requirements of responding properly to\nthe increase in United Nations Member States since the last\nreform of the Charter and the undeniably growing\nimportance of developing countries.\nChile shares in the broad base of agreement on\nallowing the entry of Germany and Japan as permanent\nmembers of the Security Council. Nevertheless, there is\nalso a conviction that this can take place only in the context\nof suitable regional representation, including other\npermanent members from Asia, Africa and Latin\nAmerica.\nWe support a process of regional consultation and\nconsensus to fill these seats. This, however, does not\nexclude a possible role for the General Assembly in case\nthere is an absence of regional agreement. In this\nconnection, the Assembly will have to analyse carefully\nthe proposals that have been put forward regarding\nrotation. These are undoubtedly attractive since they\ninclude a larger number of countries, but they could\nimpair the effectiveness of the Council and increase\ntensions between permanent and non-permanent members.\nAs far as the Latin American and Caribbean region\nis concerned, its fundamental responsibility is to fill its\nseats through a process that gives its members legal\nvalidity and political legitimacy. In this process,\nconsideration must be given to all the possibilities that\nwill allow for appropriate regional representation. Chile\nis prepared to accept any formula that reflects this.\nSerious consideration must be given to the possibility that\nonly one of its members will occupy the permanent seat\nallocated to the region.\nThe question of the veto will also have to be\ndiscussed in greater depth, taking into account many\nfactors, such as legal ones relating to Charter obligations\nand the evolution of modern international law, and\npolitical ones, such as the evolution of the international\nsituation, which are today very different from those\nprevailing at the time the United Nations came into being.\nThe outgoing President of the General Assembly has\nmade some very interesting proposals in this regard,\nwhich need to be carefully considered by Member States.\nChile is concluding this year, with a sense of\nsatisfaction, its participation in the Security Council after\nan absence of more than 30 years. Our decision to\nparticipate was motivated by the need to assume our\ninternational responsibilities, and we did so in the\nconviction that we could make a contribution.\nAs a preliminary conclusion, I would like to\nemphasize that the rich contribution of the non-permanent\nmembers of the Council provides genuine balance and\nenables the Council to renew itself over time. Our\nexperience has been a rewarding one, and we have sought\nto focus our contribution, beyond our natural interest in\nissues relating to the Latin American region, on a number\n26\n\n\nof areas in which welcome progress has been made, to\nwhich Chile has made an effective contribution.\nWe welcome the important progress the Council has\nmade regarding its responsibility in the humanitarian\nsphere, which has necessarily become a major aspect of the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. This is the\nfoundation of the presidential statement issued by the\nCouncil on the protection of humanitarian workers. The\nstrengthening of this aspect of the Council's work was one\nof the main issues in which Chile participated. Motivated\nby our concern about this matter, we proposed a mechanism\nthat establishes the modalities by which the Council\ncommunicates with the humanitarian agencies working in\nthe field.\nSimilarly, Chile has been particularly concerned that\ncountries that have experienced severe conflicts should not\nbe abandoned by the system once conflict ends. We have\ntherefore insisted on the need for a United Nations presence\nin the field when peace-building gives way to overall\nreconstruction and development activities.\nWith respect to sanctions, it has been demonstrated\nthat, where authoritarian Governments are concerned, broad\nsanction regimes merely penalize the population without\nbringing about political change. We have noted the progress\nmade by the Council in devising sanctions, as in the case\nof resolution 1072 (1996) on the situation in Burundi and\nthe one recently adopted on UNITA in Angola, which are\nindeed capable of yielding the desired results without\nharming innocent populations.\nLastly, Chile has attached special importance to\nAfrican affairs while a member of the Security Council. We\nbelieved it important to assist the Council in taking\ndecisions on the problems that region is facing at this\nhistoric moment when African countries are assuming their\nown responsibilities for regional problems, as has been\napparent in the Organization of African Unity initiative in\nthe Arusha process and the activities of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States, among others.\nWe are aware that the reform process is not confined\nto the Security Council. The Secretary-General has told us\nclearly and lucidly that we are facing the most extensive\nand farthest-reaching reforms in the 52 years of this\nOrganization's history. Accordingly, we welcome his\ncomprehensive report of last July, entitled, \\\"Renewing the\nUnited Nations: A programme for reform\\\". We agree with\nhis proposals aimed at transforming the leadership and\nmanagement structure of the United Nations so as to enable\nit to act with greater unity of purpose, coherence and\nagility in tackling the problems.\nWe wish to convey to the Secretary-General and his\ncolleagues our gratitude for the report, which the General\nAssembly will have to analyse in depth, and Chile will\ncontribute to the debate with interest and dedication and\nin an open spirit of consensus.\nIn this connection, we agree with the Secretary-\nGeneral's statement that the major source of institutional\nweakness in the United Nations is the fact that over the\ncourse of the past half century certain of its organizational\nfeatures have tended to become fragmented, duplicated\nand rigid, resulting in their ineffectiveness in some areas\nand superfluity in others. As Chile sees it, the main\nobstacle to the reform process has been the fear of change\nthat exists in the Organization, which has paralysed the\nprocess since it began here in the General Assembly four\nyears ago. The time has come for all of us, the Secretariat\nand Member States alike, to show proudly our collective\ncreativity, courage and realistic inventiveness. The period\nof bureaucratization in the United Nations must give way\nto the era of creation.\nOnly through flexible and efficient management will\nwe be able to give new impetus to the Organization and\nprovide it with the proper tools for the true modernization\nthe international community demands. Reform is not\nintrinsically an exercise in cutting costs or reducing staff.\nIts aim is to ensure a real and growing increase in the\npolitical effectiveness of the United Nations, from the\nSecurity Council and the way it deals with and resolves\npresent-day conflicts in today's world to the Economic\nand Social Council and the development agencies.\nMany of the problems facing the Organization result\nfrom the fact that Member States have been remiss in\nresponding to the need to adapt intergovernmental\nmachinery to the new requirements of the international\nsituation. This is perhaps one of the main aspects of the\nreform process we have embarked upon.\nAccordingly, it is essential to proceed further with\nthe reorientation and restructuring of the Economic and\nSocial Council in order to coordinate both the agencies\nand its subsidiary bodies so that it may engage in\nexecutive interaction with the functions of the General\nAssembly. In that way, it can regain its leadership\nposition as a flexible and efficient organ and contribute\neffectively to answering the challenges on the economic\nand social agenda of the Organization.\n27\n\n\nGiven this mandate of the Economic and Social\nCouncil, its future relationship with the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund will be extremely important.\nIn this connection, the establishment of a substantive\nsecretariat of the Economic and Social Council seems to us\nan interesting proposal.\nFurthermore, the reform process should leave room for\nthe progressive regionalization that is taking place within\nthe United Nations system. In the review of the regional\ncommissions to be carried out by the Economic and Social\nCouncil, there is a need to find mechanisms which, without\naffecting the regional mandates of each commission, can\ncontribute to the definition and regional implementation of\nthe major agreements and consensuses reached by the major\nconferences sponsored by the United Nations system over\nthe past decade.\nWe are following with interest the proposal to give to\nthe Resident Coordinator of the Secretary-General authority\nover all United Nations bodies in the field. This new\nintegrated approach, in which the funds and programmes\nwill retain their autonomy, will contribute to the necessary\ncohesion and reduce the natural tendency towards\ndivergence between the multidisciplinary agencies\nrepresented, thereby strengthening their activities.\nIt also seems to us essential to evaluate the subsidiary\nbodies in greater depth, using as the main criteria their\nrelevance and effectiveness, and to take the appropriate\ndecisions. Accordingly, we are concerned by the\nrecommendation to merge the Commissions on Narcotic\nDrugs and on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, since\nthat would run the risk of limiting treatment of the problem\nof narcotic drugs merely to its criminal dimension, losing\nsight, in the process, of elements that are an inherent part\nof the drug issue, such as education and prevention. At the\nsame time, the reform process must assign special\nimportance to measures and mechanisms designed to\naccelerate economic and social development, especially in\nAfrica, by supporting domestic efforts at economic\nrestructuring, diversification of raw materials and increased\nfood security being carried out by the countries of the\nregion.\nWe welcome the proposals designed to strengthen the\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, both\ninstitutionally and substantively, since they seem to us to be\nof great importance for the future development of the\nOrganization. The protection and promotion of human\nrights and fundamental freedoms, together with democracy\nand equitable growth, are the three pillars of present-day\ninternational society. As the Secretary-General himself\nhas stated, they constitute an essential component of\ninternational peace and security. Any measure that\ncontributes to strengthening the ability of the High\nCommissioner for Human Rights to take action will\nreceive the firm support of the Chilean delegation.\nSimilarly, we strongly support the initiatives by the\nSecretary-General with regard to the proposals for\ninteraction between civil society and private enterprise,\nwhich have become major actors at both the national and\ninternational levels. The time has come for civil society,\nincluding the business community, to participate in the\nUnited Nations at a level that reflects the contribution that\nit has been making for some time.\nA series of measures have been recommended to us\nthat are designed to make more flexible the procedures\nfor deliberations in the General Assembly, to reduce the\nlength of meetings, apply a thematic approach to topical\nissues, overcome delays and enable us to concentrate on\nthe most essential matters. While technically these\nproposals appear to relate more to formal than to\nsubstantive aspects, we know that in fact they will not be\nsimple or merely procedural decisions. In reality, their\naim is to promote the capacity of this Organization to\nbuild consensus, so as to arrive at concise decisions in the\nshortest possible time.\nOn financial matters, we endorse the proposal for\nresults-based budgeting, with few institutional\nmechanisms having a major strategic impact. This seems\nto us an innovation will have far-reaching consequences\nfor the Organization. We also support the idea of\nreallocating savings to economic and social activities\nthrough the establishment of a development account.\n28\n\n\nWe have focused our statement on the great task of\nreform, which is difficult, complex and full of potential as\nwell as of problems. We are determined to find the\nsolutions that the United Nations requires if it is to\ndischarge all its mandates and satisfy the demands and\naspirations of an international community that is anxious to\nplace in the Organization great hopes for the future. We are\ndetermined not to let this opportunity to restructure and\nrenew the United Nations pass us by. The full cooperation\nof the Chilean delegation can be counted on in this effort."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAs President of Colombia and Chairman of the\nNon-Aligned Movement, I would like to extend to you,\nSir, my sincere congratulations on your appointment to\npreside over this most important session, and I also wish\nto thank Ambassador Razali for his diligence in\nperforming his duties during the fifty-first session of the\nAssembly.\nOver the decades the United Nations has shown that\nits founders were not mistaken when they entrusted to it\nthe mission of developing a new model of co-existence\nfor our planet, thanks to which we defeated colonialism,\nfought against apartheid, prevented territorial\nconfrontations, extended our hand to help children,\ndefended the rights of women and protected the\nenvironment.\nHowever, we find ourselves today at a crossroads\nsimilar to that which led us to sign the San Francisco\nCharter. The globalization of the world has brought about\nthe internationalization of problems such as drug\ntrafficking, terrorism and corruption, all of which\nseriously threaten our systems.\nCertain industrialized nations are behaving selfishly\nin defining new rules of the game for free economies.\nUnilateralism and conditions imposed by the powerful\nupon others are rampant throughout the world. The spare\ncapacity of the military industrial complex since the cold\nwar is encouraging the beginning of a dangerous arms\nrace. The open wound of foreign debt is still an obstacle\nto the development of many of the poorest countries. The\nviolation of human, political, social and economic rights\nis also the order of the day.\nThe new United Nations, which the Secretary-\nGeneral has proposed we should reflect upon as the\ncentury comes to an end, will surely not deal only with\narmed conflicts. We must be prepared to face other\nkinds of war: social war against poverty; judicial war\nagainst organized crime; political war against\ninterventionism in our sovereign economies; and moral\nwar against the violation of human rights.\nWe cannot yet assert that the process of\nglobalization really represents progress for all of\nhumankind. While globalization has generated great\neconomic and technological advances, such progress\ncontinues to be the privilege of the industrialized\nnations and very small segments of the population of\nthe rest of the world. True progress for humanity\ncannot be brought by phenomena which generate new\nand more profound imbalances in the quality of life for\nindividuals. We must work hard to ensure that States\nand multilateral organizations such as the United\nNations, direct their efforts to guaranteeing that the\nbenefits of globalization do not remain in the hands of\na few.\nTherefore, any reform of the United Nations must\nbegin with the return of the concept of solidarity which\ninspired the San Francisco agreements, and which is the\nvery raison d\u2019etre of our Movement. We want not more\nsummits, but more compliance with the summits not yet\ncomplied with; a summit on compliance with other\nsummits would be welcome.\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) is not being properly complied with.\nImportant members have yet to ratify the Chemical\nWeapons Convention. There seems to be no interest in\nmaking progress on fundamental agreements to restrict\nthe conventional arms markets run by the world\u2019s\nmerchants of war. Government aid, as a proportion of\nthe resources transferred to developing countries by\ndeveloped nations, has dropped from 42 per cent to 24\nper cent in recent years. Funds for military operations\nwithin the United Nations system have increased 17\ntimes compared with increases in funds for social\nprogrammes.\nWe must find new paths for the United Nations to\nfollow. The reform of the United Nations system\nproposed by the Secretary-General must encompass all\nspheres of the United Nations system as a whole.\nIn the first place, there is the economic sphere.\nThe Bretton Woods organizations \u2014 the World Bank\nand the International Monetary Fund \u2014 which were\nborn as part of the agreement of March 1946, have\n6\n\n\nprogressively been removing themselves from the original\ndirection exercised by this Assembly over their economic\nand social policies. They have ended up by configuring a\ndevelopment model which they impose on developing\neconomies, without those economies being able to discuss\ntheir own priorities. Reform should include matters such\nas having greater international liquidity, greater flexibility\nin the management of multilateral debt, concessionary\ncredit flows for social investment and coordination with\neconomic bodies representing the interests of developing\ncountries, such as the United Nations Conference on\nTrade and Development (UNCTAD), the Economic and\nSocial Council and the United Nations Industrial\nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO).\nThe situation of the United Nations social sphere is\nthe most worrisome. The greatest burden of the\nOrganization\u2019s budgetary crisis has fallen upon the bodies\ninvolved, whose financing has dropped by many millions\nof dollars during the present decade. Some developed\ncountries have inexplicably withdrawn from bodies\ndevoted to children, culture, population, employment and\nthe environment, such as the United Nations Children\u2019s\nFund (UNICEF), the International Labour Organization\n(ILO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\nCultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Food\nProgramme (WFP) and the United Nations International\nDrug Control Programme. The report of the Secretary-\nGeneral contains interesting proposals to restore the\nactivities of such bodies, which constitute the very heart\nof the United Nations.\nIn a world where 1.3 billion people still survive on\nless than a dollar a day, in a world where, for the price\nof one combat plane, 57,000 children in Africa can be\nfed for a year, it is impossible to conceive of a reform of\nthe United Nations whose priority is not to strengthen the\nwork of its institutions and programmes dedicated to\nsocial issues.\nFinally, there is the matter of the political\nrelationship between the Assembly and the Security\nCouncil. The proposed strengthening of the Security\nCouncil cannot be carried out at the expense of taking\npower away from this Assembly, the highest democratic\nbody of the system. Any expansion of the Council must\ntake into account that developing countries by their\nnature and as spokesmen for various regions of the\nworld, need to have greater representation. The\ninstrument of the veto should be abolished because it is\nanti-democratic, since it places in the hands of one\ncountry the power to ignore the will of the majority. If\nthe veto cannot be eliminated, it should be restricted to\nthose matters truly fundamental for world security, and\nthe right to appeal vetoes before judicial or political\nbodies, such as this Assembly, should be established.\nA few months ago the Secretary-General presented\nto the United Nations a very interesting proposal for the\nreform for the Organization. The Non-Aligned\nMovement, which I represent, is reviewing this\ninitiative and considers that a number of its proposals\nwould contribute to the revitalization of the United\nNations.\nWe do not want a United Nations divided between\nrich and poor, with Members having first- and second-\nclass status according to their economic contributions.\nThe United Nations is not a private company, but the\nforum of solidarity in which all the countries of the\nworld come together.\nI wish to take this opportunity to appeal to the\nUnited Nations, and the international community at\nlarge, to confront the grave problem of arms\nproliferation with a clear and well-defined strategy that\nwill lead us to concrete results. To that end, I wish to\npropose five points for effectively dealing with of this\nmatter.\nFirst, I propose the declaration by the developing\ncountries of a two-year, worldwide moratorium on the\nhigh-technology-weapons trade.\nSecondly, I propose the expansion of the United\nNations Register of Conventional Arms to include light\nweapons, as well as production and storage, with a\nview to strengthening its role as a means of promoting\nconfidence.\nThirdly, I propose that the Governments of arms-\nproducing countries commit themselves to the\nestablishment of a moratorium on the sale of high-\ntechnology weapons in regions in conflict, as well as to\nconverting their weapons-production industrial capacity\nand workforce to other economic sectors.\nFourthly, I propose the follow-up and verification\nof all multilateral commitments and existing treaties in\nthis area.\nFifthly, I propose that the regulation of trade in\nlight arms, as well as in high-technology weaponry,\n7\n\n\nshould be a subject of deliberations at the fourth special\nsession of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.\nThis initiative is designed to deal with the various\nfacets of the grave phenomenon of arms proliferation,\nwhich \u2014 besides draining vast resources that could be\ndevoted to the social and economic development of our\npeoples \u2014 constitutes the most dangerous threat to the\npeace and security of the world.\nMuch water has flowed under the bridge that we\nbuilt in San Francisco half a century ago to make the\nworld a better place to live.\nWe have, without any doubt, progressed, but we\ncannot claim to be satisfied despite what we have\nachieved. So long as there is a sad, hungry child in the\nworld, there will be a United Nations. So long as there is\na weapon raised to kill a neighbour, there will be a\nUnited Nations. So long as entire populations are\ndisplaced from their homes by violence, hunger and\nintolerance, there will be a United Nations. So long as\nthousands of young people do not have access to\neducation because they must struggle every day to\nsurvive, there will be a United Nations. So long as the\nwhims of the powerful continue to defy the aspirations of\nthe powerless, there will be a United Nations. So long as\ndrugs on the streets threaten the future of our children,\nthere will be a United Nations. So long as terrorists and\nviolators of human rights continue to run loose, there will\nbe a United Nations. So long as there is a need for\nsolidarity, love and joy in the world, there will be a\nUnited Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI congratulate\nyou, Mr. President, on assuming your responsible office.\nMajor decisions are to be taken at this session and I wish\nyou good fortune in your conduct of the proceedings.\nI wish to thank Ambassador Razali for his\nexceptional commitment. He has made us all aware of the\ngreat responsibility we carry during this phase of reform.\nThe Secretary-General, through the impressive manner in\nwhich he presented his reform proposals, has\nre-emphasized that responsibility.\nNowhere else are we so acutely aware as at the\nUnited Nations General Assembly that, regardless of our\norigins or the colour of our skin, we have a common\ndestiny and that we all, North and South, the small\ncountries and the big countries, need one another.\nMillions of people all over the world, especially our\nyouth, ask themselves whether we politicians and\ndelegates from 185 nations have drawn the right\nconclusions from this; whether we can summon the\npolitical will for joint action to improve their security, to\ngive them better opportunities in life, and to safeguard\ntheir rights, or whether we will go on wasting and\ndestroying the natural sources of human life at their\n10\n\n\nexpense. Those of us with adult children know how\nsceptical their generation have become about the\ncapabilities of the governing class. That is good reason for\nall of us to stop, think and take action, and to do so here\nand now.\nThe world about which we are talking here today and\nthe world which we participate in shaping is not ours alone.\nWe have to preserve it for future generations as well. And\nthis we can achieve only through a united effort. For we are\nonly one world community that has to survive together.\nThere is only one boat for all, our vulnerable blue planet,\nand there is only one common future, good or bad. That is\nthe reality we face as we cross over into the third\nmillennium and it is the reason why policies deriving from\na sense of responsibility are not utopian. Indeed, in our age\nthey are the only realistic approach.\nThe world organization\u2019s programmes and funds, that\nis to say, those of the United Nation\u2019s Children\u2019s Fund\n(UNICEF), the United Nations Development Programme,\nthe United Nations Population Fund and the World Food\nProgramme, together dispense more than $4.6 billion a year\nin the form of economic and social aid. That comes to\nabout 80 cents for every person on earth. By contrast, in\n1994 the world\u2019s Governments spent about $767 billion on\narms, which was roughly $134 per person. This gross\ndisproportion is intolerable.\nI believe that we must all look beyond the rim of our\nown national interests. There is no more time to lose. We\ncannot simply come here, make and listen to speeches and\nthen return to business as usual for another 12 months. We\nhave a duty and responsibility to leave our children and\ngrandchildren a world which is worthy of humankind. And\nthat means doing something about it now, today. We must\nprotect the earth\u2019s atmosphere by reducing greenhouse-gas\nemissions. We must ban lethal anti-personnel landmines by\njoining in the Ottawa process. We cannot accept that we\nhave hundreds of millions of anti-personnel landmines still\nin place in the ground of many, many countries in this\nworld of ours.\nWe must halt the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, and we must streamline the United Nations\nOrganization. But above all, we must pay our contributions\non time and in full. These are the criteria which show\nwhether we are living up to our responsibility.\nThe opportunity for effective action is there. Despite\ncarping criticism, international cooperation within the\nUnited Nations framework is working. Malnutrition and\nundernourishment have been reduced by a third since\n1960 and illiteracy by 50 per cent. Most of the credit for\nthis, no doubt, goes to the United Nations. Infant\nmortality has been halved in the same period \u2014 a great\nachievement by UNICEF.\nBetween 1990 and 1995 the world population\nincreased by 1.48 per cent, considerably less than the 1.72\nper cent growth between 1985 and 1990. This nourishes\nthe hope that we have got over the hump of the\npopulation explosion. Again, this is a big achievement\nlargely attributable to the work of the United Nations\nPopulation Fund.\nMuch, I am pleased to note, has also been done to\nimprove the situation of women. This is important\nbecause with all the tremendous social challenges we\nface, the success of our efforts depends heavily on them.\nThey are the natural advocates of future generations. That\nis why one of our main objectives still is to ensure they\nhave equal rights, not only on paper but also in practice.\nThe World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna,\nthe Earth Summit in Rio, the International Conference on\nPopulation and Development in Cairo, the Summit for\nSocial Development in Copenhagen and the World\nConference on Women in Beijing have demonstrated that\nthe strategies for creating a better and more equitable\nworld are in place. What is missing is the political will to\nput them into effect. We must learn to give common\ninterests priority over national interests.\nWe must start to think not only of the present but of\nthe future as well. The first step \u2014 and I think it cannot\nbe underlined enough \u2014 is to reform and strengthen the\nOrganization which embodies all these objectives: the\nUnited Nations, our United Nations.\nThere has been enough talk. Time is running out. At\nthis fifty-second session, the General Assembly must\nmake decisions. The backlog of reforms must be dealt\nwith during this session.\nTrue, Governments and politicians don\u2019t possess a\nmagic wand with which to put the world in order. And I\nreadily admit, as a politician, that it is disappointing to\ndiscover how relatively little we ourselves can change,\neven in high positions, and I take it that it is the same\nwith the others present here. But that does not absolve us\nfrom the responsibility to do everything in our power to\nbring about necessary change and progress.\n11\n\n\nThere is more than enough to be done. The world is\nstill profoundly unjust. From the moment of their birth,\nmillions of people have hardly any chance of leading a life\nin conditions worthy of the human race. According to\nUNICEF, more than 20 million children all over the world\nare on the move. About 300,000 children were killed in the\nRwanda massacres. As a result of the 17-year-old war in\nAfghanistan, another 280,000 or so have died from\nundernourishment and disease. The civil war in Cambodia\nhas made some 350,000 children orphans. Every 90 minutes\na child is maimed by a landmine.\nYet it is on our children, the weakest members of any\nsociety, be it in the North or the South of our planet, that\nthe world\u2019s future and hopes depend. They are the weakest\nmembers of any society. They are little people who need\nbig rights. How much worse off would they be if there\nwere no United Nations? What would become of the\nworld\u2019s conscience? Who would demand consideration for\nand solidarity with such children if we allowed this\nOrganization to decline?\nAt this moment about 25,000 soldiers, civilians and\nmembers of non-governmental organizations are serving the\ncause of peace around the globe. All of them deserve our\nthanks and appreciation.\nA week ago today five Germans, including the Deputy\nof the High Representative, Ambassador Gerd Wagner, five\nAmericans, a Briton and a Pole lost their lives in a tragic\naccident. We mourn their loss and share the grief of their\nfamilies. Their deaths are an admonition to redouble our\nefforts for peace. They wanted to help people in need and\nin doing so brought a ray of hope to Bosnia and to the\npeople working on the ground. That hope must not be\nextinguished.\nLast Saturday I attended the memorial service in\nSarajevo. I have visited the region more than once, and the\ninner conflict among the people was again obvious. As\nbefore, the main obstacles to lasting peace in the region are\nhatred and fear among the various ethnic groups. On the\nother hand, most Bosnians, in spite of the terrible events of\nrecent years, realize there is no future for them and their\nchildren if the hatred and fear are not overcome, despite all\nthe terrible things that have been done, despite the rapes\nand the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d.\nThat is why I am speaking out here today \u2014 to appeal\nto all political leaders in Bosnia to change their attitude and\nto mount a reconciliation campaign. The international\ncommunity has provided assistance, making millions of\ndollars available. We have done a lot. We are very\ncommitted on the ground, and we want to see the results\nof what we have done. We believe that those who live in\nsecurity and peace have an obligation to help others.\nSo far more than 300 troops have sacrificed their\nlives for the cause of peace in Bosnia. My country\nalone \u2014 Germany \u2014 has spent more than 17 billion\nmarks on the peace process and on the more than 350,000\nasylum-seekers in Germany coming from Kosovo. That is\na lot of money, and those on whom we spend it will have\nto react in some way and have to give us a clear sign of\ntheir willingness to implement the agreements.\nBut outside help, including military support, cannot\nbe provided indefinitely. And on no account \u2014 I want to\nbe unequivocal about this \u2014 will it be given to those who\nthwart peace and reconciliation. Attempts to undermine\npeace, to incite the people and to torpedo the\nimplementation of the Dayton Agreement, especially in\nRepublika Srpska \u2014 must stop.\nI appeal to all political factions in the region to use\nwhat time remains to launch a new and serious attempt to\nsettle their differences and to see to it that Karadzic and\nother alleged war criminals and enemies of peace are\nbrought before the Hague Tribunal. These people must\nnot be allowed to sleep peacefully. But this demand must\nbe made by the international community, not just\nGermany: these people must not be allowed to sleep\npeacefully.\nWe Europeans have done quite a lot this year to\nimprove the situation on our continent in order to secure\na peaceful future for coming generations. Nations that\nbelong together are now growing together, and that in a\nregion that for centuries was divided and at war with\nitself. The European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization are gradually opening up to Europe\u2019s new\ndemocracies, while Russia and Ukraine are forming a\nnew, close partnership with both organizations.\nAnd let the world be prepared. In 1999 we\nEuropeans, right on schedule and in conformity with\nbinding stability criteria, will introduce the Euro, the\ncommon European currency. The enlargement of the\nEuropean Union and the introduction of the Euro are\nhistoric steps to safeguard the future for coming\ngenerations, steps that hardly anyone would have thought\npossible only 10 years ago. And mark my words: there\nwill be no going back in Europe.\n12\n\n\nAt the same time, we are aware that Europe\nconstitutes only a small section of the much larger global\nconstruction site. Everywhere the harbingers of the new era\nare knocking on the door. Nothing is like it used to be, yet\nthe hopes and wishes of citizens everywhere have remained\nthe same. They want peace and work. They want a roof\nover their heads, protection from crime, and schools for\ntheir children.\nThus the aims and ideals enshrined in the Charter are\njust as valid as they were in 1945: peace, sustainable\neconomic and social development, protection of human\nrights and democracy. These aims form a whole, and there\nis no order of preference.\nEighty per cent of United Nations activities focus on\nworld poverty, and rightly so, because this is the big\nproblem that has remained unsolved since the ending of the\nEast-West confrontation. Nearly a quarter of the world\u2019s\npopulation \u2014 1.3 billion people \u2014 live in poverty, while\n840 million suffer from chronic undernourishment. In the\nAgenda for Development we have adopted the right course\nfor the fight against poverty: good governance, market\neconomy, the rule of law, security for the citizen, regional\ncooperation and international integration.\nFollowing the lead of the Association of South-East\nAsian Nations countries (ASEAN), the Southern Cone\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR) and the now-expanding\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC), the\nnations of Central America too are forming closer ties. It is\nbecoming more and more apparent that this is the path of\nprogress. The worldwide trend towards closer multilateral\ncooperation is increasing, and will lead to progress, security\nand prosperity; it is the path of the future. One the one\nhand, the Information Age with undreamed-of possibilities,\nand, on the other, exclusive communities and citizens\nwithout rights \u2014 this does not add up.\nYes, globalization is a great leveller. Basically, it\nconfronts industrial and developing countries alike with the\nsame question: are we going to accept the challenge of\nbeing part of a \u201csingle world market\u201d, or are we going to\nmark time? A good number of newly industrialized and\ndeveloping countries have chosen the way forward, and it\nhas proved to be the right one. They have received the bulk\nof global direct investment, which in 1996 increased by 8\nper cent to almost $350 billion. Nor have the others been\nforgotten. Within the framework of the G-8 process, the\nnew global partnership for development was established on\ntheir behalf. A beginning was made at the Denver summit\nin June, focusing particularly on the sub-Saharan nations\nof Africa.\nSince 1978 Germany has cancelled debts incurred by\nthe least developed countries and other land-locked\ndeveloping countries in Africa amounting to more than 9\nbillion marks. These countries will continue to be the\nfocal point of our development cooperation. Between\n1991 and 1995 Germany made available 16.3 billion\nmarks for Africa\u2019s sub-Saharan nations, and we are proud\nof that.\nI am glad that the Security Council is holding a\nspecial meeting tomorrow on the situation in Africa.\nMany positive developments have taken place there in\nrecent years, a fact that is often overlooked.\nBut light and shadow are still very close together. I\nneed only mention Congo Brazzaville, Sierra Leone,\nSomalia and especially the Great Lakes region. My\ncountry, the Federal Republic of Germany, has played a\nhumanitarian and political role in all these conflicts, and\nwe recognize that the African States themselves \u2014 in the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and in the\nsubregional organizations \u2014 are making significant\nefforts to settle these conflicts. We must keep on\nsupporting them.\nBut Africa\u2019s real problems lie deeper, in the social\nand economic sphere, and in the lack of cohesion among\nthe different population groups. In my view, Europe\u2019s\nvast and important neighbouring continent, which has a\npopulation of about 800 million covers about 23 per cent\nof the world\u2019s land surface, has little chance of achieving\nstability and economic progress unless it follows the path\nof regional cooperation. Such cooperation brings stability\nwhere nations are too weak to achieve it individually.\nSouthern Africa is a good example. At the 1994\nBerlin conference, cooperation between the SADC and the\nEuropean Union was raised to a new level. At our\nmeeting in June we and our African colleagues redefined\nthe framework for the dialogue between the European\nUnion and the OAU. Europe will stay on Africa\u2019s side.\nPart of this support is that we are helping countries\nlike Angola and Mozambique to rid themselves of the\nscourge of mines. So far mine clearance by hand has\nbeen, at least to me, like trying to remove a sand-dune\nwith a thimble. We cannot accept that. What we need for\nthis task is safe, large-capacity machinery.\n13\n\n\nThe Oslo Conference gave rise to a sign of hope.\nEighty countries have put their names to a comprehensive\nand verifiable ban on anti-personnel mines. I wish to thank\nthe Secretary-General for his personal efforts on this issue.\nAnyone who, like me, has seen the poor, crippled victims\nin Cambodia, Mozambique or Bosnia knows that these\ntreacherous killing devices are wholly \u2014 I repeat,\nwholly \u2014 immoral. I therefore appeal to all countries still\non the outside to join the Ottawa process and help us ban\nthese infernal devices from the face of the Earth.\nThe world, galvanized by the spirit of freedom, has\nbeen totally transformed. But this new freedom and its by-\nproducts constitute a major test for us all, not only as\nregards competitiveness but also as regards our solidarity,\nour ability to show tolerance and to work together, and the\nopening of markets.\nThe East-West conflict has been consigned to the past.\nHere too, the question now is: are we going to try and\nsafeguard the future for posterity, or are we going to allow\nnew enemy stereotypes to divide us once again? There must\nbe no clash of civilizations. Hence, the dialogue of\ncivilizations and world religions must be raised to a new\nlevel. To me this is the spiritual challenge as we approach\nthe twenty-first century, for only thus can we bring\ndifferent standpoints closer together and mobilize the\nenergies needed for the joint resolution of humanity\u2019s\ncolossal problems.\nI suggest that we hold a forum here at the United\nNations to consider how we can generate new momentum\nfor this dialogue worldwide. The matter is important\nenough. Considerable cultural energy and potential for\ninnovation lie unused, and the United Nations is the proper\ncatalyst for their development.\nBut we must be very clear that there cannot and\nshould not be dialogue with terrorists. Terrorism has again\nraised its ugly head in Mostar, Jerusalem and Cairo. The\nvileness of the latest carnage in Algeria would be difficult\nto exceed: it really does take your breath away. How long\ncan the international community look away? I know how\ndifficult it is to help from the outside, but the world\ncommunity cannot accept the cruel killing of utterly\ninnocent people in the dark of night without standing up\nand reacting. We are not powerless in the face of such evil\nslaughter of mostly uninvolved persons. In Denver, the\nGroup of Eight called upon all nations to sign the\ninternational conventions on terrorism. We must resolutely\ncombat terrorism all over the world, using all democratic\nmeans at our disposal. I call upon the General Assembly to\ncomplete by the end of this session the negotiations on a\nconvention against terrorist bomb attacks, as proposed by\nthe Group of Eight.\nExtradition or suitable punishment remains the\nprinciple underlying our efforts to combat terrorism. No\none should give refuge to terrorists. We need a united\nglobal front against terrorism. To combat fanatical killers\nwe can only consistently apply the law as well as police\nand judicial measures. The source of sympathy for\nterrorist objectives must be withered by political means.\nIn other words, we must get to the roots, which in most\ncases are social problems.\nOn my last visit to the Middle East I spoke with\nmany citizens in Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Hebron, and\nin the refugee camps in Gaza. I sensed their fears and\nconcerns. Those who have seen the wretched conditions\nin the camps know that these people must be given a\nchance to improve their lives. They need to be able to\nhope again that the peace process is something from\nwhich they will benefit, that the violence will stop, that\nthey can find work and have enough to eat, and that their\nchildren can go to school.\nFor these hopes to materialize, both sides must show\na large measure of good will. President Arafat must do\neverything in his power to stop the terrorism. And the\nIsraeli Government must desist from any measures which\ncause the Palestinians to doubt Israel\u2019s commitment to\npeace. The settlements issue remains the crucial test here;\nat least, that is what I believe. Continuing to build in Har\nHoma only makes matters worse, so a moratorium is\nessential. To my mind, this is the only way to reopen the\ndoor to peace talks.\nAs for Iran, the new Government has changed its\ntone. It remains to be seen whether this will lead to a\nnew, constructive policy, especially with regard to the\nMiddle East peace process, human rights and international\nlaw. Germany has always maintained close and friendly\nrelations with the Iranian people, and in spite of all that\nhas happened, in spite of the Mykonos affair, we are\nready for talks. It is up to the Iranian Government to\nprovide the basis on which these can take place.\nWe are pleased that Mrs. Robinson has taken up her\npost as the new High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nNowhere is the need for a new culture of dialogue so\ngreat, we believe, as in the process of protecting such\nrights. This is crucial to world peace and global\ndevelopment. Any society that fails to respect human\n14\n\n\nrights, which include the right of development, is blocking\nits own progress. Our policy on this matter is based on\ndialogue and respect for different cultures. But we also\nagree with Pope John Paul II, who has said that if we want\npeace we must respect the conscience of the people. No\ncivilization or religion denies people their rights or\napproves of murder and torture. Nor can any such action be\njustified on political grounds.\nWe need an international criminal court of justice. The\nstatute of such a court is to be drawn up in Rome next\nsummer. The court must be empowered to act of its own\naccord where genocide, crimes against humanity, war\ncrimes and wars of aggression are concerned, and to do so\nwherever national courts either do not exist or cannot or are\nunwilling to prosecute such crimes. The terrible genocides\nin Rwanda and Srbrenica are warning signs. Such cardinal\ncrimes should not go unpunished.\nOur responsibility towards future generations is\nparticularly acute where protection of the natural sources of\nlife is concerned. That is why it is crucial to maintain the\nspirit engendered by the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development, the Rio Summit. That is the\npurpose of the environment initiative put forward by\nChancellor Kohl together with Brazil, South Africa and\nSingapore.\nThe climate conference to be held in Kyoto in\nDecember will be a major test of the industrial world\u2019s\ncommitment to the environment. Germany intends to reduce\nits greenhouse-gas emissions by 25 per cent by the year\n2010, based on 1990 levels. We and our partners in the\nEuropean Union are asking the other industrial countries to\ncut theirs by at least 15 per cent. That would go part of the\nway towards meeting our responsibility towards posterity.\nWhen we look at the air pollution in southern Asia,\nwe cannot fail to admit that we urgently need to agree on\na forest convention. We must put an end to the ruthless\nburning of forests to clear vast areas of land. Those who\ndeplete and destroy their own natural resources will make\nus all lose out in the end. The eleventh hour is approaching.\nTwo weeks from now the decision on where to locate\nthe secretariat of the Convention to Combat Desertification\nwill be taken in Rome. We ask members to vote for Bonn.\nSince the secretariat of the Framework Convention on\nClimate Change already has its headquarters there, it makes\nsense to combine the two.\nThe General Assembly is at a crossroads. Either we\nsolve our reform problems now and come out of our\nintrospective shell, or the United Nations will lose\npolitical standing \u2014 that is what would happen. All\nregional organizations, industrial, developing and\nnon-aligned countries have a joint responsibility for\nimplementing the reforms we have been talking about for\nso long. This applies to all areas of United Nations\nactivity: economic and social, Security Council and\nfinance.\nThe Secretary-General has submitted a bold package\nof reforms. Even though we do not agree with every\ndetail, we support the package as a whole. I appeal to all\nMember States: let us not talk it to shreds, but make\nquick decisions so that the necessary measures can be put\ninto effect. The United Nations has to be streamlined in\norder to increase its efficiency. Whatever savings are\nmade through reform should be used for developments-\nassistance purposes.\nThe Security Council must reflect today\u2019s political\nrealities, one of which is the greater status of Africa,\nAsia, Latin America and the Caribbean. The debate on\nthis matter should not be artificially prolonged. This the\nmost important body of the United Nations, and it cannot\ncredibly and effectively perform its role as the guardian\nof peace in the twenty-first century if its composition\nremains basically as it was in 1945.\nIt is gratifying to note that a large number of States\nregard the reunited Germany as a suitable candidate for a\npermanent seat on the Security Council. If elected, we\nwill be able to make a good contribution, one that is in\nkeeping with the spirit of the Charter.\nTwo years ago, on the Organization\u2019s fiftieth\nbirthday, we solemnly pledged to hand on to the next\nmillennium a United Nations equipped and funded for its\ntask. That promise has to be kept, and it has to be kept by\nall. This means, first and foremost, paying our\ncontributions in full and on time, because without\nfinances this Organization is a powerless one. The\nEuropean Union has submitted its proposal for changing\nthe scale of assessments, the purpose of which is to\nensure a fair distribution of burdens.\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights reads,\n\u201cAll human beings are born free and\nequal in dignity and rights. They are endowed\n15\n\n\nwith reason and conscience and should act\ntowards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\u201d\nThis vision must be sustained: the vision of a world in\nwhich it is not the law of the strongest, but the strength of\nthe law which prevails; a world in which both the strong\nand the weak feel at home; a world fit to live in which we\ncan safely leave to our children and to our grandchildren.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

His skills as a\nstatesman are excellent qualifications for the presidency,\nand I wish to assure him of my delegation\u2019s support and\ncooperation at all times during the proceedings of this\nsession.\nMy delegation\u2019s appreciation also goes to the\nPresident of the fifty-first session, His Excellency\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, for the impressive work he\naccomplished during his presidency. His efforts to\nimprove the work of the General Assembly and\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations in international\naffairs have increased the momentum of the United\nNations reform process. My delegation congratulates him\non a job well done.\nOn behalf of my delegation, I also wish to extend\nour congratulations to the Secretary-General, His\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan. Since he assumed office in\nJanuary this year, he has been engaged in commendable\nefforts to reform the United Nations Organization. The\npresentation of his two-tracked proposals and measures\n21\n\n\nconstitutes a bold and far-reaching reform programme,\nwhich is expected not only to revitalize the United Nations\nsystem but also to make it better suited to execute its\nmandates in the years ahead in a more efficient and cost-\neffective manner.\nThe fifty-second session of the General Assembly is\ntaking place at an important period during the international\ncommunity\u2019s effort to evolve an atmosphere of viable and\nequitable international cooperation in the areas of economic\ndevelopment, social advancement and the recognition of the\nimportant need for the maintenance of a balanced global\necosystem.\nThe recent holding of the nineteenth special session of\nthe General Assembly, on the overall review and appraisal\nof the implementation of Agenda 21, is one of the many\nfactors and activities that symbolize the importance of this\nperiod and that mark our collective effort to shape a more\nmeaningful atmosphere of international cooperation. The\nspecial session reaffirmed the international community\u2019s\neffort to ensure that the blueprint for international\ndevelopment and the preservation of the environment, as\nenunciated in Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration five years\nago, are translated into concrete realities.\nThe successes and constraints so far recorded in our\neffort to achieve sustainable development clearly point to\nthe difficulty of creating a framework for international\ncooperation characterized by the full and continued\ncommitment of both developed and developing countries.\nAs stated by Her Excellency the Vice-President of the\nGambia during the special session,\n\u201cThe difficult and protracted negotiations and the\nintellectual, expert and statesmanlike efforts that made\nthese agreements possible reflected the goodwill and\ngood faith of all Governments ...\n\u201c... the constraints cited as obstacles to implementation\nduring this review session tend to indicate the\npersistence of the contentious and also cross-cutting\nissues of additional financial resources, technology\ntransfer, information sharing, training and institutional\ncapacity-building and the unfulfillment of our\ndifferentiated responsibilities under these provisions\u201d.\n[See Official Records of the General Assembly,\nNineteenth Special Session, Plenary Meetings, 9th\nmeeting]\nI wish to inform the General Assembly of the political\nevolution taking shape in my country, the Gambia. Since\nthe Gambian delegation addressed the Assembly last year,\nwe have successfully completed a two-year transition\nprogramme to democratic civilian rule with the entry into\nforce of a new Constitution for the Second Republic in\nJanuary this year. Successful free and fair presidential and\nNational Assembly elections were held earlier, in\nSeptember 1996 and early January 1997. Most of the\ninstitutions provided for under the new Constitution are\nalready in place and have started to play their legitimate\nrole in the promotion and entrenchment of a genuine\ndemocratic culture that is commensurate with the hopes\nand aspirations of all Gambians. Throughout the transition\nprocess, the people of the Gambia have been regularly\nconsulted; their views and aspirations have guided the\nprocess. In this exercise we have been faithful to our\nwishes. The Gambian National Assembly, which is\nplaying its important role in our nation-building, has been\nreadmitted to the Commonwealth Parliamentary\nAssociation, where we will continue to participate\nactively.\nAlive to the fact that genuine democracy can neither\nthrive nor be nurtured and sustained in the midst of\npoverty, deprivation, hunger, ignorance and ill-health, the\nGambia Government embarked on an ambitious socio-\neconomic development programme during the two-year\ntransition period, which focused basically on building\nschools, health facilities, roads and other infrastructure as\nwell as on boosting agricultural development in order to\nensure food self-sufficiency by the year 1999. The main\nobjective of this programme was to lay the basis for a\ngenuine and sustainable democracy that is in consonance\nwith our own social and other specificities as a nation.\nThe successful completion of the transition period\nintensified our Government\u2019s determination to continue\nthe effective implementation of measures and programmes\ndesigned to promote and achieve the sustained socio-\neconomic development of the Gambia. In order to\naccomplish this task, the Government of the Gambia, in\ncollaboration with the private sector, has embarked on the\nimplementation of a national development programme to\ntransform the country economically and socially over a\n25-year period into a developed, economically viable\nState. The blueprint for this socio-economic development\nis called Vision 2020. The overall orientation of this\ndevelopment blueprint, as enunciated in its mission\nstatement, is:\n\u201cTo transform the Gambia into a financial\ncentre, a tourist paradise, a trading export-oriented\nagricultural and manufacturing nation, thriving on\n22\n\n\nfree market policies and a vibrant private sector,\nsustained by a well-educated, trained, skilled, healthy,\nself-reliant and enterprising population, and\nguaranteeing a well-balanced ecosystem and a decent\nstandard of living for one and all, under a system of\ngovernment based on the consent of the citizenry\u201d.\nIt is obvious from that mission statement that we in\nthe Gambia have opted for a holistic development strategy\nthat is human-centred and export-oriented, and founded on\nfree market principles. As rightly pointed out by His\nExcellency President Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh in his\nforeword to Vision 2020,\n\u201cThis means that the production base of the\neconomy will be strengthened and diversified to cater\nfor the needs of an export-oriented industry. In pursuit\nof pragmatism, Vision 2020 will build on the sound\nmacroeconomic policies of our recent past while\nlaunching a new partnership contract between the\npublic and private sectors to spin faster growth with\nequity.\u201d\nIn this connection, the Gambia has embarked on a\nsustained effort to enhance bilateral and multilateral\ncooperation with all friendly countries and institutions in\norder to ensure the realization of our development goals as\nenshrined in Vision 2020. In pursuit of these goals, we will\nnot relent in our efforts to develop and enhance intra-\nAfrican cooperation and solidarity in all vital sectors for the\nattainment of sustained economic growth. It is in fact the\nGambia\u2019s firm belief and conviction that it is only through\nsuch cooperation, founded on self-reliance and hard work,\nthat African countries can adequately rise to the daunting\ndevelopment challenges facing them.\nTo complement our own efforts at the national,\nsubregional and regional levels, no effort will be spared to\ndevelop and enhance cooperation with all traditional\ndevelopment partners as well as new friends in conformity\nwith the underlying principles of the Gambia\u2019s foreign\npolicy objectives, which are predicated on openness,\npeaceful coexistence, genuine respect for each other\u2019s point\nof view and full equality in international intercourse with\nall countries. We strongly believe that it is only through\ndialogue and the constant quest to understand the points of\nview of others that we can aspire to attain world peace,\nmutual trust and understanding.\nHere, I would like to underline again that the\ncentrepiece of the Gambia\u2019s foreign policy is the promotion\nof African solidarity and self-reliance and the enhancement\nof world peace. That is why we are friends of all\ncountries of the world irrespective of ideological or\npolitical differences. This policy is predicated on our\nstrong belief that the world is one family, and that it pays\nno dividends to isolate any member of that great family,\nbecause any member of the family which feels isolated\nquickly becomes intransigent and hostile in its dealings\nwith the rest of us. It is therefore paramount for us to\nmaintain lines of dialogue between ourselves, which can\nonly promote understanding.\nOn global economic issues, we note that the world\neconomic outlook continues to be influenced strongly by\nthe forces of economic globalization and trade\nliberalization, which in themselves are not negative\ntrends, provided they are underpinned by a genuine desire\non the part of all concerned to promote partnership, in an\nenvironment where equality reigns supreme.\nThe persistent slow rate of development in Africa\ncan be traced to certain factors and impediments. Africa\u2019s\nforeign debt crisis remains a major impediment to growth.\nThe international community\u2019s effort to resolve Africa\u2019s\nexternal debt problem continues to fall short of the\ndesired result. The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\nInitiative, recently adopted by the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) and the World Bank, while complementing\nthe global effort, also fell short of the expected target of\ncomplete cancellation of the debt stock of developing\ncountries. Unless this is done, the debt burden will\nnaturally continue to have a negative impact on the\navailability of existing resources to finance Africa\u2019s\neconomic recovery and social development.\nAlso, the growth and expansion of the incidence of\npoverty in Africa has contributed to the failure to achieve\nsustainable development on the continent. The sombre\nconclusions on the increase of poverty reflect, in a wider\nsense, the seeming lack of the required commitment by\nthe international community to promote social progress\nand the qualitative improvement of the human condition,\nas recommended by the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment.\nHere I want to state that my country, the Gambia,\nhas embarked on a bold national plan of action for the\neradication of poverty, and I want to commend the United\nNations system, the World Bank and other bilateral\npartners that are actively assisting us to achieve our goals\nin this domain. We thank them for their continued\nsupport. Poverty, we all agree, is a global problem that\nneeds to be addressed by all of us.\n23\n\n\nThe pursuit of global peace and security remains a\nfundamental responsibility of our Organization. It is,\nhowever, regrettable that the international community\u2019s\neffort to achieve international peace and security has been\nconstrained by continued conflicts and other forms of\ntension between States and communities.\nIn our own subregion of West Africa, the situation\nevolving in Sierra Leone remains of grave concern, not\nonly to us but also to the international community. Failure\nto resolve the problem and restore stability, security and\nconstitutionality in Sierra Leone can only prolong the ordeal\nof the innocent and peace-loving people of that country.\nTherefore, we all hope that the initiatives embarked upon\nby the Economic Community of West African State\n(ECOWAS) within the framework of the Committee of\nFive will yield the anticipated results. I am pleased to note\nthat the approach adopted by the Committee of Five to find\na solution to the Sierra Leone crisis has the support of the\nUnited Nations Security Council and the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU).\nIt is hoped that the restoration of constitutional\ndemocracy in Liberia following the national elections held\non 19 July 1997 will lead to a permanent peaceful solution\nto the country\u2019s crisis, paving the way for sustained\nnational reconstruction. All of us in the subregion are\ngiving our material and moral support to the sister Republic\nof Liberia to help it stay on the path of national\nreconciliation in order to recover fully from its tragedies of\nthe recent past.\nWith regard to the Middle East, despite the significant\nprogress of the past few years in the Middle East peace\nprocess, especially since the signing of the Oslo accords,\nwe note with concern the erosion of the peace dividend\naccumulated in the international community\u2019s effort to\nachieve durable peace there. The recent escalation of\ntension between Israel and Palestine over the extension of\nIsraeli settlements in East Jerusalem constitutes a serious\nthreat to peace and security in the region.\nThe adoption by the General Assembly of resolution\nES-10/3 of 15 July 1997, as well as other peace initiatives\nby the international community should, however, provide\nthe basis for a peaceful and permanent solution to the\nconflict.\nOn a more general note, we in the Gambia strongly\nbelieve that the containment of tension and conflict globally\ncan be enhanced by transparency, the restoration of mutual\ntrust and confidence and respect for the rights of peoples,\ncommunities and nations in the execution of the role and\nmandates of the United Nations. As I indicated earlier, it\nis only through genuine dialogue and the desire and will\nto understand each other that we can achieve global\npeace.\nIn this regard, my delegation strongly supports the\naspiration of the 21.3 million people of the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan to exercise their right to share and\nparticipate in the activities of intergovernmental\norganizations on international cooperation by joining this\ncomity of nations. The legitimacy of their aspirations,\nboth legal and national, has been reinforced by similar\nactions and measures taken by the United Nations on the\nissue of parallel representation, which now serve as useful\nreminders and examples. The Taiwan question is also a\ntest of the international community\u2019s interpretation of\ndemocracy. As we are all aware, the Republic of China\non Taiwan has existed, physically, legally and politically,\nsince the foundation of the United Nations. My\nGovernment therefore believes that our Organization will\ndo itself a great service by admitting Taiwan into our\nmidst, in the true spirit of the application of democratic\nprinciples. The presence of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan among us can only enrich our Organization. In\nthis regard, we therefore believe that resolution 2758\n(XXVI) adopted at the twenty-sixth session of the General\nAssembly, needs to be reviewed.\nConcerning the legal dispute surrounding the\nbombing of Pan Am flight 103, the Gambia supports the\nresolution on the matter adopted by the OAU Heads of\nState or Government in Harare last May as providing a\nviable framework for resolving the present impasse.\nWith regard to Cuba, it is incomprehensible to us\nGambians why a whole people, a whole nation, should be\nmade to suffer the denial of the basic necessities of life\nsimply because it chooses to live under a different\npolitical ideology. Therefore, in the present climate of\ngreater international cooperation and reconciliation, the\npeople of Cuba and their Government deserve the support\nand assistance of the international community in their\ncontinued efforts to engage in more meaningful national\ndevelopment in order to achieve greater socio-economic\nprogress. We fully support the measures being taken by\nthis body to provide this support. In doing so, our\nOrganization will only be upholding the principle of\nrespecting the basic human rights of the Cuban people.\nIt is in this same spirit that we call on the\ninternational community to continue to preserve the\n24\n\n\ndignity and security of the people and the Government of\nKuwait and to support the full implementation of the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions on payment of\nreparations and compensation, release of prisoners of war\nand other conditions imposed on Iraq for its internationally\ncondemned act of aggression against Kuwait. Therefore,\nwhile we encourage greater United Nations intervention in\nbringing solace to the suffering, innocent Iraqi civilian\npopulation, we strongly urge the Government of Iraq to\ncomply with the provisions of these Security Council\nresolutions, in order to alleviate the suffering, especially\nthat of the children.\nThat catalogue of conflicts and misunderstandings has\nprompted my Government and people to formulate the\nfollowing wish, which we want to express to the\ninternational community: we want the United Nations and\nthe international community to make a solemn pledge to\nensure that all conflicts are peacefully resolved by the year\n2000. In order to achieve this noble aim, we propose, first,\nthat 1998 be declared a year for the resolution of all\nconflicts between Member States; and, secondly, that 1999,\nas it is on the eve of the twenty-first century, be a year\ndevoid of conflicts and misunderstanding, to become the\nyear of reconciliation.\nThis, we believe, will enable humankind to enter the\ntwenty-first century as a united, peaceful family that can\nproudly bequeath to ensuing generations a developed,\npeaceful world, where democracy, justice, freedom and\nequality are guaranteed to everyone, irrespective of origin,\nrace, religion or political ideology. That is what the Gambia\nwants to bequeath to coming generations, and we strongly\nbelieve that all it takes is tolerance, mutual respect, love,\npatience and understanding.\nWith regard to global trade relations, we followed with\nhigh expectation the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of\nmultilateral trade negotiations and its implementation.\nWhile encouraging globalization and liberalization, it\ndeprived developing countries, particularly those in Africa,\nof the opportunities and benefits predicted during its\nimplementation.\nWe note, however, that the liberalization of trade and\ninvestment policies has yet to foster international\ncooperation for the achievement of economic development\nand genuine partnership among all nations. Developing\ncountries in general, and African and the least developed\ncountries in particular, are yet to be effectively integrated\ninto the world economy. The commitments agreed in the\nFinal Act of the Uruguay Round have not been fully\nimplemented.\nInternational cooperation has, however, continued to\nflourish in other equally important areas. The promotion\nand expansion of South-South cooperation continues to\nreceive greater support among developing countries.\nThese cooperation initiatives have resulted in the\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States, among many other\ninitiatives. Within the context of promoting South-South\ncooperation, Japan has successfully held the Tokyo\nInternational Conference on African Development\n(TICAD I) and it is now planning to host a follow-up\nconference, TICAD II, next year, in an effort to develop\na practical, achievable and sustainable development\nprogramme for Africa.\nIt is indeed commendable that this Japanese initiative\nis not restricted to Africa, but also includes the evolution\nof a new development strategy responsive to the present\ninternational development climate, and is providing the\nmotivating force for a concerted global effort. We\ncommend Japan for these initiatives, including financial\ncontributions which serve as a practical demonstration of\nSouth-South cooperative interaction and application.\nIt should, however, be pointed out that the\npromotion and application of South-South cooperation\nwithin the context of technical and economic cooperation\namong developing countries can only succeed as an\nimportant aspect of international development cooperation\nif both the South and North remain committed to its full\nrealization.\nIntra-African economic cooperation and integration\nhave also been growing. Regional activities are now\ndirected to the socio-economic transformation and\nintegration of the economies of African States. The\nadoption and implementation of the Abuja Treaty, putting\nin place economic integration arrangements, is a positive\neffort in building an African Economic Community. The\ninaugural session of the African Economic Community\nwas held during the thirty-third summit of Heads of State\nand Government of the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) in June this year. We in Africa are becoming\nmore and more aware of the paramount importance of\nself-reliance. Any assistance from development partners\nmust be seen as a complement to what we can or should\ndo by ourselves.\n25\n\n\nWithin the context of subregional cooperation, the\nGambia hosted the twelfth summit of Heads of State and\nGovernment of the Permanent Inter-State Committee for\nDrought Control in the Sahel (CILSS), held in Banjul from\n11 to 12 September 1997. The summit unanimously elected\nHis Excellency Colonel Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh, President\nof the Republic of the Gambia, as chairman of the\norganization for the next three years. These meetings and\nactivities testify to the importance attached to the issues of\ndrought and desertification, not only in Africa, but also in\nother parts of the world, and to the urgent need for a\nsustained collaborative effort to combat the twin menace. In\nthis regard, the Gambia is fully and actively participating in\nthe ongoing Rome Conference of the Parties to the United\nNations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those\nCountries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\nDesertification, Particularly in Africa. In fact, we should\nredouble the resources provided and the measures so far\nadopted to combat drought and desertification and improve\nour environment in accordance with the provisions of the\nConvention, and also of chapter 12 of Agenda 21, adopted\nat the United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment. In furtherance of these targets we intend to\nachieve, as President Yahya Jammeh stated, sustainable\ndevelopment and food security through research into the\nunderlying phenomena of drought, desertification and\necological instability and by designing and implementing\nprogrammes for natural resource management and the\nimprovement of agro-food sectors in the Sahel, as well as\nthe sustainability of farming systems.\nI will conclude with the subject of reform of the\nUnited Nations system, a subject very dear to the hearts of\nGambians. The reform of the United Nations system\ncontinues to engage our collective attention. Reform\nactivities \u2014 including the restructuring and revitalization of\nthe United Nations in the economic, social and related\nfields, especially the work of the Economic and Social\nCouncil; and the efforts of the High-level Open-ended\nWorking Group on the Strengthening of the United Nations\nSystem in formulating innovative mechanisms to enhance\nthe role and functions of the General Assembly and its\nmain Committees, as well as of the Open-ended Working\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on and\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council \u2014\ncontinue to attract wide debate, both at the United Nations\nand in other forums. These include OAU, which at the\nsummit of Heads of State and Government held in Harare\nin June adopted a Declaration on the reform of the Security\nCouncil to which the Gambia remains firmly committed.\nIt is my Government\u2019s firm belief and conviction\nthat there is an urgent need to democratize the United\nNations, and especially the Security Council, to make it\nmore responsive to the hopes and aspirations of all its\nMembers for a world devoid of intolerance, injustice and\ninequality. There is therefore a need to curb the use of the\nveto, which is exercised by some Powers in the Security\nCouncil against the wishes of the vast majority of the\nMembers of our Organization. The geopolitical and\nhistorical considerations that were at the heart of the\npresent composition and mandate of the Security Council\nno longer prevail. The composition of the Security\nCouncil should therefore be reflective of the realities of\nour times, and the powers of the individual Member\nStates therein seen in the same light.\nWe also firmly believe that it is necessary to ensure\nthat United Nations resolutions and, indeed, decisions by\nthe International Court of Justice are respected, obeyed\nand implemented by all countries. It is not fair that while\nsome countries are chastised for violating United Nations\nresolutions, others seem to violate them with impunity.\nWith regard to the Secretary-General\u2019s Track 2\nreform proposals, the report (A/51/950) entitled\n\u201cRenewing the United Nations: A Programme for\nReform\u201d includes bold and far-reaching measures and\nproposals. The Gambia generally supports the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s reform proposals, in particular the following.\nFirst, we have that of creating a dividend for\ndevelopment. The effectiveness of this initiative would\ndepend on Member States meeting their financial\ncontributions to the Organization on time. Moreover, the\ninitiative should serve as a catalyst for donors to provide\ngreater support for development by meeting the agreed\ntarget contribution of 0.7 per cent of their gross national\nproduct.\nSecondly, the creation of the post of Deputy\nSecretary-General is timely, given the increasing\nmandates of the Organization. However, it is expected\nthat the role of the Deputy Secretary-General would go\nbeyond mobilization of funds for the Organization to\nincorporate administrative coordination. The length of stay\nin office of the incumbent should be determined.\nThirdly, restructuring and regrouping of organs and\nagencies to facilitate their effectiveness and productivity\nshould be guided by agreed principles, procedures and\noperational objectives to prevent a reduction of their\n26\n\n\nusefulness while enhancing the achievements of their\nspecific goals.\nFourthly, the fiscal measures, including zero growth\nand personnel cuts, are necessary. It is expected that this\nwill not impair the Organization\u2019s capability to fully\ndischarge all its responsibilities.\nFifthly, the putting into effect of \u201cUN House\u201d \u2014 the\ncommon premises system for all United Nations agencies\nserving in one country \u2014 is necessary and timely, given the\nsubstantial savings to be derived from the sharing of\ncommon services. Additionally, maintaining a common\nidentity and location in a country would enhance the United\nNations presence as a world Organization, as well as its\naccessibility in terms of speed and effective\ncommunication. It will also minimize confusion, waste\nand duplication of efforts.\nSuffice it to say that the Gambia will continue to\nstudy the Secretary-General\u2019s reform proposals and their\nbroad implications for the Organization and Member\nStates in the years ahead.\nLastly, as we continue with the reform of the United\nNations system after over 50 years of operations, so must\nwe also continue to address the weaknesses, inequalities\nand inadequacies inherent in the international economic\nand social system, global trade, finance and investment,\ninternational development and so on in order to achieve\nmore meaningful international cooperation and global\npartnership, the promotion and preservation of human\nrights and fundamental freedoms, the right to\ndevelopment, good governance and economic growth \u2014\nall cherished hallmarks of sustainable development and\nhuman achievements."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the people and Government of\nEl Salvador, I should like to convey to you, Mr. President,\nour congratulations on your election to preside over this\nsession. To your predecessor, Mr. Razali Ismail of\nMalaysia, we extend our gratitude for his efforts and\ninitiatives aimed at making progress in the modernization\nof the United Nations.\nWe commend the Secretary-General for his\nremarkable work during the first year of his term and, in\nparticular, for the progress made in reforming the Organization.\nMore than five years after the signing of the peace\naccords in El Salvador, we can state with satisfaction that\nwe have fulfilled and achieved the objectives that we\nagreed to. The far-reaching changes that have taken place\nin Salvadoran society have received universal recognition,\nas they represent one of the most successful\nundertakings of greatest scope carried out with the\nsupport of the Organization.\nOur Government\u2019s responsibilities and obligations do\nnot end with compliance with the peace agreements, but\ncontinue throughout time and space with a view to\nsafeguarding the achievements that we have registered in\nthe areas of democratization and respect for human rights,\nand also to meet the priority needs of Salvadoran society.\nWe Salvadorans are dedicated to building a new\nEl Salvador, attacking at their root causes of poverty and\nsocial marginalization and promoting a fairer and more\nequitable society.\nThe successful conclusion of the peace processes in\nNicaragua, El Salvador and, recently, Guatemala and the\nestablishment of democratic Governments have created a\nsituation conducive to regional stability, transforming\nCentral America into a region of peace, freedom,\ndemocracy and development. Central America has made\ngreat progress in demilitarization and in the strengthening\nof civil society, holding free, transparent and pluralist\nelections; integrating former combatants into national\npolitical processes; strengthening democratic institutions\nand the rule of law; and implementing a development\nprogramme whose central focus is the human being.\nIn the face of globalization and the processes of\neconomic openness and regionalization, we need to be\neven more creative in tackling present and future\nchallenges. For this reason we are reviewing the Central\nAmerican institutional system so as to make it possible\nfor us better and more effectively to take our place in the\nnew world order.\nThe aspiration of the peoples of Central America to\npursue a common destiny through the reunification of our\ngreater nation has always been latent among our peoples.\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that unity is the best\nroad for Central America to take so that it can\nsuccessfully tackle the challenges of the coming\nmillennium. It was in this spirit that on 2 September we\n22\n\n\nsigned the Nicaragua Declaration with a view to speeding\nup the process of unification. Today we come to share our\nresolve to pursue political union in Central America. We\nwant the international community and the United Nations\nto be witnesses to our efforts, and before them we commit\nourselves to do all that is within our power to achieve this\nobjective. In order to achieve this goal, we ask that friendly\ncountries and multilateral institutions continue to support us\nand to provide timely assistance, so that our national and\nregional efforts can complement one another, and to enable\nus to have at our disposal an effective mechanism for\nrealizing our aspirations.\nI should like to comment on issues of far-reaching\nimportance on the agenda of the General Assembly that are\nvital for the Organization itself. We stand convinced that\nthe principles of the Organization remain valid and that it\nis a unique, sui generis institution, essential and\nirreplaceable in the international system, and that its reform\nis necessary in order to adapt it to the demands of the new\ninternational order. With respect to the proposed reforms\nput forward by the Secretary-General, my Government\nsupports the institutional changes that will be necessary for\nthe Organization efficiently to respond to the common\nproblems faced by our nations.\nFor the United Nations to function better, it must be\nable to rely on adequate and predictable financial resources.\nIt is the responsibility of Member States to fulfil our\nfinancial obligations, which cannot be subject to any kind\nof conditionality, so as to safeguard the independence,\nimpartiality and credibility of the Organization\u2019s activities.\nReform of the Security Council is necessary in order\nto overcome the imbalances that exist in its current\ncomposition. We support an appropriate increase in the\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent members, so that\nthe Council will be representative of the number of\nMembers that the Organization now has. These new\nmembers should have the same rights and obligations and\nbe designated in conformity with the principle of\ngeographical distribution, so as to include developing\ncountries in both categories. We believe it particularly\nimportant to devote attention to the Council\u2019s working\nmethods and procedure so as to ensure that the decision-\nmaking process is participatory, democratic and transparent\nand involves effective coordination among all the organs of\nthe system.\nThe United Nations was created to be universal in\nnature. Therefore all peace-loving States that accept the\nobligations enshrined in the Charter should be Members of\nit. For this reason, we reaffirm our support for the just\naspiration of the Republic of China on Taiwan to rejoin\nthe Organization on the basis of the principle of\nuniversality, which is the distinguishing mark of the\nUnited Nations.\nIn conclusion, I wish to state that the people of\nCentral America are grateful for the work of the United\nNations in the process of peacemaking, democratization\nand development in Central America. We recognize the\nefforts that the Organization is continuing to make to\npromote international peace and security by seeking to\nsettle conflicts by peaceful means and in accordance with\nthe principles of international law.\nOn the threshold of a new century, nations are facing\ntremendous challenges. We invoke the aid of God so that\npeace, freedom and human values may prevail among the\npeoples of the earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like to begin by congratulating the\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Mr. Hennadiy\nUdovenko, on his election as President of General\nAssembly at its fifty-second session. This is a compelling\nacknowledgment of the high international esteem in which\nUkraine is held and of Mr. Udovenko\u2019s personal qualities\nand extensive experience. At the same time, I should like\nto express gratitude to the President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-first session, Ambassador Razali\nIsmail, who made a significant contribution to the\nsuccessful guidance of that session.\nIt is particularly important for us to be making this\nstatement today from this lofty rostrum. Five years have\npassed since Georgia became a full-fledged Member of\nthe United Nations. I believe that the time has come to\nassess the development of Georgian statehood, as well as\nthe results of our full-fledged participation in and active\ncooperation with the United Nations.\nIn this five-year period our country has travelled\nfrom civil war, chaos, economic collapse and rampant\ncrimes to ever increasing stability, the establishment of\ndemocratic institutions and tangible economic progress.\nThe fact that we have been able to emerge with dignity\nfrom the most critical phase in our independent\ndevelopment is, to a large extent, to the credit of the\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies, which\nprovided Georgia not only with moral support but with\nspecific and timely financial and technical assistance. We\nshall always remember that with particular gratitude.\nWe understand what a responsible task the United\nNations has as it\n\u201cstrives to articulate an inclusive vision: community\namong nations, common humanity among peoples,\nthe singularity of our only one Earth.\u201d (A/51/950,\npara. 1)\nThe criterion for the formation of such a vision is the\ndestiny of each people and every State, including Georgia,\nwhose recent history fully and clearly reflects all the\nvirtues and flaws of the present world order. Georgia can\nthus serve as a model with regard to the need to\nimplement long-awaited changes and radical reforms\nwithin the United Nations system. It is precisely on this\nsubject that I wish to share my views.\nThe global post-confrontational development\nfollowing the end of cold war has not, unfortunately, been\n20\n\n\nas simple as had been expected. We have stressed on\nnumerous occasions, including from this rostrum, that the\nglobal confrontation between two systems has given way to\nequally dangerous local and intra-State conflicts that carry\nwithin them the potential for enormous destruction, thereby\nposing the same global challenge to international security.\nOne of the manifestations of this dangerous trend is the\naggressive separatism that has plagued my country and\nseveral other newly independent States. We have also\npointed out that the United Nations and other international\norganizations should act in a manner that takes account of\nthese changes. Unfortunately, our recent experience shows\nthat, as a result of somewhat entrenched attitudes, these\nrealities are frequently misunderstood.\nThe main obstacle to the strengthening and\ndevelopment of our statehood and to the full\nimplementation of economic reforms continues to be the\nlack of a settlement of the conflicts in Abkhazia and the\nTskhinvali region. The situation in Abkhazia is particularly\nworrying. About 300,000 refugees and displaced persons\nfrom Abkhazia are still unable to return to their homes.\nThese people, whom fate has not treated kindly, are already\nbeginning to lose hope for a peaceful settlement of the\nconflict. We are obliged to note that, regrettably, the\nconflict in Abkhazia has become a kind of touchstone\nexposing the inadequacy of United Nations efforts. We\ntherefore continue to insist on the need to find a new\napproach that can give a new impetus to the dialogue. We\nwelcome the vigorous steps being taken to strengthen the\nrole of the United Nations in settling the conflict in\nAbkhazia, Georgia.\nWe have embraced with hope and optimism the new\ninitiatives put forward by the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations. We would like to stress in particular that\nwe attach importance to the resumption of the Geneva\nnegotiations between the parties to the conflict, under the\nauspices of the United Nations and with the participation of\nthe Russian Federation as facilitator, the group of Friends\nof the Secretary-General on Georgia and the Organization\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). We are\nconfident that the Geneva process will not only promote a\nsettlement of the conflict, but will also reveal the\ntransformational role that the United Nations can play under\nthe new conditions. Here I must express deep gratitude to\nthe President of Ukraine, His Excellency Mr. Leonid\nKuchma, who, from this lofty rostrum expressed support for\nthe efforts of the United Nations in Abkhazia and\nreaffirmed Ukraine\u2019s readiness to participate directly.\nThe establishment of a United Nations standby force\nwould be very useful in developing the potential for\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations to prevent the\nescalation of conflicts in a timely manner. Such forces\nwould be on constant standby. We believe that such a\nsystem must include a technically well-equipped and\nappropriately staffed headquarters. It would be responsible\nfor the evaluation and assessment of emerging conflict\nsituations. On the basis of such assessments United\nNations rapid-reaction forces, which have yet to be\nestablished, could be quickly sent to zones of conflict. We\nare confident that, had such forces existed five years ago,\nthe tragic development of the conflict in Abkhazia could\nhave been prevented. As the vicissitudes of the conflict in\nAbkhazia, Georgia, have shown, there is still a need for\nclearly coordinated joint actions between the United\nNations and regional and international organizations for\nthe settlement of conflicts. The absence of such a practice\nconsiderably reduces the effectiveness of the\npeacekeeping efforts of our community.\nGeorgia\u2019s experience provides a positive example of\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\nThis cooperation includes the joint United Nations-OSCE\noffice for monitoring human rights in Abkhazia and the\nprogramme for the economic rehabilitation of the\nTskhinvali region, proposed and implemented by the\nUnited Nations Development Program. I also believe that\nwe should seriously consider the proposal of the acting\nChairman of the OSCE, by which the State chairing that\nOrganization would automatically join the group of\nFriends of the Secretary-General on Georgia, thereby\npromoting and increasing cooperation between the United\nNations and the OSCE. We believe that there is a need to\nwelcome the process of cooperation between the United\nNations and regional international organizations, which\nhas already begun.\nWe should also reconsider the important concept of\npost-conflict peace-building. We are sometimes prisoners\nof stereotyped notions of a phased approach to settling\nconflicts, and as a result we sometimes fail to notice how\nthin the line is between establishing peace and\npeacekeeping itself. In the process of conflict settlement\nit is more effective to use elements of post-conflict peace-\nbuilding, including them in the strategy of peacekeeping\noperations. Elements of post-conflict peace-building such\nas social and economic rehabilitation of conflict zones\nand the establishment of a basis for their further\ndevelopment would facilitate confidence-building between\nthe parties involved and create a favourable social and\n21\n\n\neconomic environment for the achievement of a final\npolitical settlement. We believe that the United Nations\nshould remain actively seized of this matter.\nThe creation of a special fund would allow the United\nNations potential for post-conflict peace-building to be\nstrengthened. \u201cDevelopment dividends\u201d could provide one\nsource of revenue for this. On the other hand, the fund\ncould also consider the economic interests of the parties to\nthe conflict, and on that basis develop relevant projects,\nthereby assisting in conflict prevention.\nThe uniqueness and indispensability of the United\nNations as a central and multilateral mechanism of\ncooperation in the post-confrontational world must first and\nforemost be manifested in its leading role in the creation of\na qualitatively new comprehensive system of security,\nstability and development. The most important role here\nmust be played by a global system of economic security,\nthe formation of which should run parallel with the\ndevelopment of the process of world integration.\nA characteristic feature of today\u2019s world is that\nformerly isolated historico-geographic regions are gradually\novercoming their isolation and are cooperating to create a\nshared global infrastructure of human activities. Therefore,\nregional economic unions should be viewed as a driving\nforce of the mechanisms for building such an infrastructure.\nFor example, the Caucasus region clearly demonstrates\nthe potential of the so-called graded model of global\nintegration. I refer, in the first place, to subregional\ncooperation within the framework of a given region and,\nfurther, in the light of the geo-strategic situation of the\nCaucasus, to its role as a link for interregional cooperation,\nnamely between Europe and Asia.\nSuch a structure for integration, such a global model\nis in keeping with the realities of our day. We believe that\nthe coordinating role of the United Nations in this process\ncan be very effective.\nSuch a vision of the role of the Caucasus region has\nalready been embodied in the concept of the Euro-Asian\ncorridor, a kind of Silk Road for the twenty-first century.\nThis historic conduit for trade, the importance of which is\ncontinuing to grow and gain in recognition, is already\nworking and proving its effectiveness.\nSimilar corridors present a unique opportunity for the\nestablishment of new material and cultural values and for\nbringing economies and cultures together. On this basis,\nthey must \u2014 and, unquestionably, will \u2014 also play an\nimportant role in the establishment and strengthening of\nstability in the region.\nGeorgia has been called upon to actively promote\nthe implementation of this concept. Even a superficial\nglance at a map shows the strategic importance of\ngeopolitical and geo-economic dimensions of this central\nconduit for world trade. Therefore, we express our\nreadiness to cooperate with all those who are interested in\nmaking it a reality.\nThe broad functions of the United Nations as a\nuniversal organization are the basis for the initiatives\nspelled out by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his report\n\u201cRenewing the United Nations: A Programme for\nReform\u201d. First and foremost, we believe there is a need\nto focus on the treaty defining the international legal\nprofile of today\u2019s world order: the Charter of the United\nNations. Conceived under specific circumstances, it\nprovided a mechanism that was aimed, for the most part,\nat prevention and settlement of conflicts between States.\nAs a result, the United Nations has often reacted\ninadequately to such challenges as the numerous conflicts\noccurring within States. The principles that constituted the\nbasis for traditional peacekeeping operations, in particular\nthe concept of consent of the parties, are often untenable\nin cases of so-called ethnic conflict. This leads us to the\nidea that the Charter to a great extent needs to be\nrethought and made to conform to current realities.\nIn this regard, Georgia supports the creation of a\nministerial commission to study the necessity of\nfundamental reforms in the Charter and in those legal\ndocuments that define the mandates of the United Nations\nspecialized agencies. Georgia also supports the proposal\nfor the appointment of a First Under-Secretary-General\nwho would be called upon to play a special role in\nensuring the success of programmes and plans of the\nvarious functional sectors of the Secretariat.\nUndoubtedly, the crux of the United Nations reforms\nis the enlargement of the Security Council and the\nimprovement of the activities of the General Assembly\nand of the other main bodies. Also important is the\nquestion of the optimal reallocation of authority between\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council. In this\nrespect, we reaffirm our unwavering position concerning\nthe inclusion of Germany and Japan among the permanent\nmembers of the Security Council and also concerning the\nenlargement of the Council, including adding one seat for\nthe Eastern European countries.\n22\n\n\nWe favour growing transparency in the work of the\nSecurity Council. From our point of view, it is important\nthat concerned States be able to participate in informal\nconsultations of the Council, at which substantive\ndiscussions take place and decisions are taken.\nThe international community should also be equipped\nwith reliable tools of justice to enable it to react not only to\nunlawful actions of States but also to those of individuals\nwho have perpetrated crimes against humanity. In this\nconnection, we call upon all the Member States to do all\nthey can to conclude successfully the diplomatic conference\nand to adopt a treaty on the establishment of an\ninternational criminal court by 1998.\nIn closing I would like to recall the initiative of the\nSecretary-General to hold a special session of the General\nAssembly in the year 2000, as a \u201cmillennium Assembly\u201d.\nVery little time remains before mankind enters the new\nmillennium, and we must do everything we can to see to\nthat the reformed United Nations becomes a genuinely new\nUnited Nations for the world order of the coming century.\nI am confident that Georgia, together with other States, will\noccupy a worthy place in it, as a democratic and prosperous\ncountry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me extend to you,\nMr. Vice-President, my warmest congratulations on your\nelection.\nThe Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, Mr. Jacques\nPoos, spoke on behalf of the European Union. I fully\nassociate myself with his statement.\nThe reform of the United Nations is inevitable. The\nnew imperatives of globalization and interdependence\nmust be recognized. Business as usual would inevitably\nlead to the marginalization of the United Nations in world\naffairs. I fully agree with Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nthat we should see these changes as an opportunity, not\nas a threat.\nReform is in the interest of all Member States,\nwhether big or small, whether industrialized or developing\ncountries. Where else but at the United Nations can we\ndeal with the truly global issues such as the new security\nthreats of uncivil society, environmental degradation,\nviolations of human rights and poverty? Given the nature\nof these issues, unilateral, bilateral or even regional\nefforts are of course good, but not enough. Not even the\nmost prosperous and powerful nations on earth can\n8\n\n\nsuccessfully solve them alone. Only the United Nations has\na global mandate and global legitimacy.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s proposals are well attuned to\nour thinking in Finland. The General Assembly should\nconsider these proposals as a coherent whole and give the\nSecretary-General the authority to act on them during this\nsession. For our part, we, the Member States, must shoulder\nour responsibility for those reforms that require action by\nGovernments.\nHuman rights must become an integral part of all\nUnited Nations activities. We very much welcome the\nSecretary-General\u2019s comprehensive approach in this regard.\nThe celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights next year must\nproduce practical results. The celebration is an opportunity\nto emphasize that human rights are universal rights that\nbelong to all individuals, irrespective of culture or political\nsystems. The duty of Governments is to promote, secure\nand protect these rights. Therefore, the international\ncommunity has the authority to deal with human rights\nviolations wherever they may occur. There is no difference\nbetween big or small States in this respect. Europe is by no\nmeans an exception. The common standards must be valid\neverywhere. The United Nations has a unique role to play\nbecause of its global reach. I personally respect and support\nregional arrangements and efforts to this end, but they must\nbe in accordance with common United Nations standards.\nThere is a genuine and growing demand for United\nNations action in the field. The United Nations response\ntoday is hampered by inadequate resources. I pledge my\nGovernment\u2019s full support to Mary Robinson, the newly\nappointed High Commissioner for Human Rights, in her\nimportant and challenging task.\nWe in Finland are very serious people. We try to\npractise what we preach. Promoting human rights, including\nminority rights, is an integral part of our domestic policy\nand naturally extends to foreign policy. As a new feature,\nthe Government intends to submit an annual report to\nParliament on the human rights situation in the world. We\nhope such reports can and will contribute to a more regular\nand informed public debate on human rights issues.\nThe United Nations has extensive experience in crisis\nmanagement and peacekeeping. Lessons have been learned.\nOne key lesson is the need to prevent emerging conflicts\nrapidly and coherently. Rapid decision-making is imperative\nboth in the Security Council and at the national level. Once\nthe political decisions are made, they should be\nimplemented effectively and without delay. That is why\nwe strongly support the establishment of a rapidly\ndeployable mission headquarters. Finland has contributed\nto it financially and is also ready to make personnel\navailable. We urge the Secretary-General to establish the\nheadquarters without further delay.\nThe recent local elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nwere undoubtedly a success. The implementation of their\nresults is the challenge for the coming weeks and months.\nThe Dayton peace process is advancing, but at a\ndisappointingly slow pace. Restoring normal living\nconditions will require major efforts by all the parties in\nthe region. The international community, the United\nNations and other organizations will have a tremendous\ntask in assisting people to help themselves in this\ndevastated region. The High Representative for the\nImplementation of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, Mr. Carlos Westendorp, deserves our full\nsupport in securing the implementation of the Sintra\nagreements. There is also a need for the continued\npeacekeeping presence of the Stabilization Force (SFOR)\nor its successor force.\nAfrica is the one continent most ravaged by violent\nconflicts and human suffering. The special session of the\nSecurity Council on Africa at the ministerial level is\ntherefore a timely initiative. Crisis prevention and\npeacekeeping capabilities in Africa should be developed\nas a priority. We welcome the efforts already under way\nwithin the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and\nother regional and subregional settings. However, these\nefforts need wider international support. Finland is\nprepared to continue to do its part by providing assistance\nin training. We are also organizing in Helsinki, Finland,\ntogether with the OAU, a broad-based international\nconference of non-governmental organizations to promote\ntheir international involvement in strengthening peace-\nbuilding in Africa.\nIn the Middle East, events over the past year have\ntaken a dangerous turn for the worse. Fulfilment of the\nobligations of the Oslo accords, and with it real\nimprovement in the daily lives of the Palestinians, is still\nthe best hope the parties have for a just and lasting peace.\nA turn for the better is first and foremost for the parties\nthemselves to achieve. We urge them to exercise restraint\nin actions and in words. Finland, together with its\nEuropean Union partners, is prepared to continue to play\nits part in supporting the peace process, but clearly the\n9\n\n\nparties themselves must play theirs for there to be a process\nto support.\nThe hopes for the peace process should not be\nbetrayed in the face of provocation, humiliation or\nfrustration. Terrorism is unacceptable. It only benefits the\nextremists on both sides.\nIn disarmament, the focus is shifting from weapons of\nmass destruction towards conventional arms, including\nsmall arms, as so many colleagues of mine have already\nmentioned here. The suffering caused by indiscriminate use\nof landmines is high on the United Nations agenda, and\nrightly so.\nFinland welcomes the Ottawa convention. It is a step\ntowards a truly global and effective ban on anti-personnel\nlandmines, a target which my Government strongly\nsupports. The Ottawa process contains a promise, but it is\nclear that much work is still needed. Participation in a total\nban, particularly by those who are major possessors,\nproducers and exporters of these weapons, must be secured\nthrough negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament.\nFinland will continue to participate actively in the\nConference\u2019s efforts to stop the further spread of anti-\npersonnel landmines through a global and effective treaty.\nThe positive trend in disarmament and\nnon-proliferation has been strengthened by the entry into\nforce of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the\nbilateral commitments made by the Russian Federation and\nthe United States regarding nuclear disarmament at the\nHelsinki summit. To assure further progress, these\ndevelopments should now be followed up by Russian\nratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the\nSTART II agreement.\nFinland has consistently advocated a strong United\nNations, mandated and capable of addressing socio-\neconomic and development issues in an effective and\ncoordinated manner. In today\u2019s world, globalization of the\neconomy, trade liberalization and the information revolution\nhave created an environment of interdependence. Poverty,\nthe root cause of so many other ills, can be eliminated only\nthrough sustainable development.\nFinland, together with the other Nordic countries, has\nlong spoken for a more unified United Nations system, both\nat Headquarters and at the country level. The Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s proposals go in the right direction. The creation\nof the United Nations Development Group is an important\nfirst step. Full integration at country level of all United\nNations activities, including those of the specialized\nagencies, must remain the goal.\nThe Economic and Social Council and the web of\norganizations and committees operating within it need to\nbe united in purpose and in action. The proposed reforms\ndo not suffice. The coordinating role of the Council\nshould be made real. To achieve this is the responsibility\nof the Member States. If we do not take action, the\nCouncil will sink into irrelevance.\nSimilarly, a more coherent United Nations response\nis required to provide protection and humanitarian\nassistance to the victims of disasters, whether made by\nman or nature. The Emergency Relief Coordinator must\nensure coherence and coordination in disaster relief. In\nthat role, the Coordinator must receive the full support of\nall the humanitarian agencies.\nOn the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of this\nOrganization, I remember, more than 150 Heads of State\nor Government pledged their resolve to bring an end to\nthe United Nations financial crisis. Today, two years later,\nonly 89 Member States \u2014 I checked the figure today \u2014\nhave paid their dues in full and without conditions, and\nmany of them did so late. More than half of the\nmembership have not. Yet there are very few Member\nStates whose non-payment stems from circumstances\nbeyond their control, the only waiver known to the United\nNations Charter. Non-payment is, in our view, a serious\nthreat to the future of the United Nations, not only\nbecause of the unfair burden put on Member States that\ndo pay, such as my country, but because it undermines\nthe commitment and the solidarity that we as Member\nStates share towards our common Organization and\namong ourselves.\nFinland understands the motivation behind the\nSecretary-General\u2019s proposal for a revolving credit fund.\nHowever, such a fund \u2014 as we have understood it \u2014\nwould use voluntary contributions to cover unpaid legal\ndues. The United Nations might gain some respite, but so\nwould the countries in arrears. Finland is not opposed to\nexploring this proposal if others so wish and if the\nestablishment of such a fund is accompanied by real\nsanctions in case of non-payment of assessed\ncontributions.\nYesterday, we heard the Secretary-General in his\nstatement ask the Governments assembled here to make\nthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly a\n10\n\n\n\u201cReform Assembly\u201d. This is a challenge that we and our\nOrganization cannot afford to fail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, I would like to\ncongratulate the President on his election to his high office,\nwhich convincingly proves that the international prestige of\nUkraine, one of the founders of the United Nations, is\nwidely recognized. For the current session, which is being\nheld in the spirit of renewal of this world forum, it is very\nsymbolic.\nI also with to express our appreciation to the previous\nPresident, Mr. Razali Ismail, for his considerable\ncontribution to the successful work of the fifty-first session\nof the General Assembly.\nKazakhstan believes that in the twenty-first century the\nUnited Nations should become a highly effective instrument\nthat will help to make a smooth transition to real\nmultipolarity, establish global economic partnership and\ndemocratize international relations. For our part, we stand\nready to contribute to the adoption within the United\nNations of important decisions on the urgent issues of\ntoday.\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has\nundertaken to carry out a daunting mission of reforming\nthe Organization. Nothing could be harder than to live in\ntimes of change; it is all the harder to be the maker of the\nchanges. This is why we are fully on the side of the man\nat the head of the United Nations, and we welcome his\ninitiatives and his course of action. Kazakhstan supports\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s proposals regarding a more\nefficient leadership and management structure, a new\nmanagement culture and structural transformations within\nthe Organization.\nWe support measures taken by the United Nations to\nensure sustainable development. In our view, the proposed\nUnited Nations Development Group deserves\nendorsement. At the same time, it is important to preserve\nthe independence and the distinctiveness of the funds and\nprogrammes that are being consolidated, especially the\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), a reputable\norganization that is doing so much for the sake of\nchildren, including its work in Kazakhstan.\nThe financial crisis of the United Nations is an\nurgent issue demanding a solution. The programme of\nreforms proposed by the Secretary-General provides for\nmeasures to redress the situation in which the\nOrganization has found itself. There is no doubt that the\nimprovement of the financial situation of the United\nNations depends on the fulfilment by Member States of\ntheir obligations to the Organization. Despite the\neconomic difficulties of the transition period, Kazakhstan\nis trying to honour its financial obligations. At the same\ntime, we consider it imperative to further improve the\nscale of assessment on the basis of real ability to pay.\nKazakhstan, as one of the States that have joined the\nsystem of stand-by arrangements, supports the\nstrengthening of the Organization\u2019s capacity to carry out\npreventive and peacekeeping activities. We welcome the\nSecretary-General\u2019s proposals on the issues of\ndisarmament and regulation of armaments, and we\nsupport his measures regarding human rights, organized\ncrime, drugs and terrorism.\nKazakhstan is ready to join in efforts to strengthen\nthe role of the General Assembly in dealing with burning\ninternational issues. Our country is in favour of convening\na special \u201cMillennium Assembly\u201d in the year 2000. This\nidea is in consonance with President Nursultan\n17\n\n\nNazarbaev\u2019s initiative to convene on the eve of the twenty-\nfirst century a special session of the General Assembly\ndevoted to reform.\nIn our opinion, United Nations reforms should be\ncarried out in an integrated manner, at different levels and\nin different directions. At the same time, it is impossible to\nignore that the key element of these reforms is the reform\nof the Security Council itself. Kazakhstan has repeatedly\ndeclared its support for Germany and Japan as candidates\nfor permanent membership of the Council. Supporting the\nenlargement of the Council in both categories of its\nmembers, we believe it is possible to include as its\npermanent members representatives of the developing\ncountries of Asia, Africa and Latin America in order to\nensure a balance of interests and an adequate reflection of\nexisting geopolitical realities. It is important to keep in\nmind, however, that to preserve the Security Council\u2019s\nefficiency, the number of its members should be limited. At\nthe same time, we think it is necessary to show proper\nrespect and to pay attention to other proposals coming from\nother States.\nKazakhstan has on several occasions used this high\nrostrum to stress the need to strengthen the United Nations\nactivities in the area of the environment. For our country\nthese activities have special importance. For this reason,\naddressing the nineteenth special session of the United\nNations General Assembly last June, the President of\nKazakhstan once again drew the attention of the\ninternational community to the acute environmental\nproblems inherited by our country. I refer to ecological\ndisaster areas of the Aral Sea and the former Semipalatinsk\nnuclear testing ground.\nThe problem of the Aral Sea has a global dimension.\nParticles of salt sediments from this region have been found\nin Europe, as well as in the Arctic Ocean. The Aral Sea\nregion is witnessing a disastrous shortage of fresh water, a\nworsening of the population\u2019s health and the degradation of\nthe natural environment.\nSome 470 nuclear explosions have been conducted at\nthe Semipalatinsk testing ground, which used to be the\nlargest in the world. Enormous damage has been caused to\nthe health of the population and the natural environment.\nWe believe that nuclear weapons represent a tragedy that\naffects all the peoples of the world. With that in mind, our\nHead of State has spoken about the responsibility of the\nnuclear Powers for the damage caused to the population\nand the natural environment of the States where nuclear\ntests were conducted. Such responsibility could be\nshouldered by setting up an international fund for the\nrehabilitation of the health of the population and the\nenvironment of the regions affected by nuclear-weapon\ntests.\nOur President\u2019s decision to close the Semipalatinsk\ntesting ground should be considered as a major\ncontribution to nuclear disarmament of historic\nsignificance. This month Kazakhstan hosted an\ninternational conference on nuclear non-proliferation,\ninitiated by President Nazarbaev. Participants visited the\nformer testing ground and became further convinced of\nthe need to assist Kazakhstan, which is overcoming the\nconsequences of nuclear tests conducted for more than\nhalf a century.\nIn this respect, the strengthening of environmental\nsecurity has the highest priority for the region of Central\nAsia. Accordingly, at a meeting held in Almaty last\nFebruary, the Heads of the Central Asian States adopted\na Declaration proclaiming 1998 a Year of Environmental\nProtection in our region and highlighting the need to\nestablish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia. We\nare grateful to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\nhis support for the idea of establishing such a zone, in his\nmessage addressed to the participants in the Semipalatinsk\nconference.\nAs a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty,\nKazakhstan is firmly committed to the non-proliferation\nregime, and considers it important to actively contribute\nto its further strengthening. Our State vigorously supports\nthe objectives of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty. We believe that the signing of this document was\none of the most important and historic events of this\ncentury, which is nearing its end. We call on all States to\nadhere to this Treaty.\nRecognizing the importance of a deep reduction in\nthe number of conventional weapons having\nindiscriminate effects, Kazakhstan took a decision to\ndeclare a moratorium, effective 6 August 1997, on the\nexport of anti-personnel mines, including the re-export\nand transit thereof.\nKazakhstan has taken consistent steps to strengthen\nsecurity and stability at the regional level. Nursultan\nNazarbaev\u2019s initiative to convene a Conference on\nInteraction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia,\nfirst put forward at the forty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly, is shaping up on the practical plane.\nWe are planning to convene, in 1998, a meeting of\n18\n\n\nForeign Ministers of interested States to discuss security\nissues in Asia.\nThe formation of a Central Asian battalion under the\nauspices of the United Nations has become a factor of\nstability in the Central Asian region and provides clear\nevidence of the implementation of the proposal made by\nour Head of State. Recently, its first exercises were\nsuccessfully conducted in Kazakhstan.\nThe signing of unique agreements between\nKazakhstan, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China on confidence-building measures and the\nreduction of armed forces in the border region should be\nconsidered as a major achievement in the area of\ninternational security.\nWe note with satisfaction the signing in June of the\nGeneral Agreement on the Establishment of Peace and\nNational Accord in Tajikistan, which represents a\nsignificant breakthrough in the settlement, under the\nauspices of the United Nations, of the longest-running\nconflict among the post-Soviet countries. Kazakhstan is one\nof the guarantors of the peace process in Tajikistan. We\nbelieve that all those concerned should ensure the adoption\nof practical measures to facilitate the implementation of the\nagreements concluded, the delivery of international\nhumanitarian assistance and the reconstruction of the\nnational economy.\nWe are seriously concerned by the continued armed\nconfrontation in Afghanistan. We in Kazakhstan are\nconvinced that peace in that country can be achieved\nthrough political negotiations, under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations, between all the parties involved in this\nconflict in order to establish peace and form a Government\nof national unity in that country, which has suffered so\nmuch.\nKazakhstan, which is committed to the ideas of\nrenewal, has firmly embarked on a course of economic\nreform and the democratization of social life. Reforms in\nour country have become irreversible. The privatization of\nthe economy is being completed, the level of inflation has\nbeen steadily low, the national currency is stable and liquid,\nand for the first time in a little more than five years of\nindependence we have registered economic growth.\nKazakhstan is open to the outside world and offers\nconsiderable investment opportunities. Our State is leading\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States in per capita\nforeign investments. We strongly believe that very soon\nKazakhstan will firmly take its place in global integration\nprocesses and become a fully fledged member of major\neconomic associations and organizations.\nWe should like to express our appreciation to the\nUnited Nations for its support for President Nazarbaev\u2019s\nproposal to create a joint body for Central Asia under two\nregional Commissions, the United Nations Economic\nCommission for Europe (ECE) and the United Nations\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the\nPacific (ESCAP). In a few days\u2019 time, the heads of these\nCommissions will come to our country. A special ECE-\nESCAP programme for Central Asian States is under\nway. A joint office of the two organizations is to be\nopened in Almaty.\nI would like to make special mention of the\nactivities of the Economic Cooperation Organization\n(ECO). Seven new States, including Kazakhstan, joined\nECO not very long ago. Nevertheless, the ECO member\nStates have managed to reach promising levels of\ncooperation and interaction. The declaration adopted at\nthe ECO summit last May provides an opportunity to\ncreate new transportation corridors and routes to transport\nhydrocarbons, and the ECO member States, as well as\nmany other countries in Asia and Europe, are equally\ninterested in their development.\nHow the Organization will look when it enters the\ntwenty-first century will depend on the decisions we take\nin the follow-up to our discussions of United Nations\nreform. Years ago, an enormous internal capacity was\nbuilt into the United Nations Charter. The United Nations\nwas designed for a world based on the principles of\npartnership and cooperation, not on all-out confrontation.\nAlso important is the fact that the United Nations Charter,\nwhich might be called an institutional pillar of the\nOrganization, is a highly balanced document, free of any\nvisible bias in one direction or another, and this has\nallowed it to become, one might say, a code of modern\ninternational relations that no civilized State has any right\nto ignore. The decisions that are being taken should be as\nbalanced as possible and should not amount to stop-gap\nand ad hoc measures. That is one of the main demands\nwith regard to United Nations reform.\nThe United Nations should come out of the reform\nprocess renewed, more effective and more efficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Furthermore, as his former colleague\nwhen I was Permanent Representative of my own country\nhere for many years, I am personally delighted at this\nwell-deserved demonstration of the confidence the\ninternational community has in him. It is therefore a\npleasure for me, on behalf of the delegation of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, to address to him and to the other members of\nthe Bureau our sincere congratulations and to assure him\nof our full support in the accomplishment of his mission.\n21\n\n\nI also extend my heartfelt thanks to his predecessor,\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, for his remarkable efforts to\ngive decisive impetus to the process of the reform of our\nOrganization.\nFinally, I should like to extend my warmest\ncongratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan, a worthy son of Africa,\non his illustrious election as Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations, and I pay heartfelt tribute to him for the\ngreat competence that he has unfailingly demonstrated at\nthe head of the United Nations. In less than a year he has\nbeen able to instil our Organization with a new dynamism\nthrough actions that bear witness to his firm will to\nstrengthen the effectiveness and credibility of the United\nNations and to improve its operations in facing the many\ncomplex demands of the world at the dawn of a new\nmillennium. We assure him of the support of the delegation\nof C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in his noble and exhilarating task.\nI also take this opportunity to extend my warm\ncongratulations to Mrs. Mary Robinson on her appointment\nto the post of United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights. We consider her strong personality to be a\nguarantee of success in the delicate and important mission\nwith which she has been entrusted. We assure her of our\ncomplete support in the exercise of her new functions.\nToday, regardless of what our assessment of the work\nof the United Nations may be, it is necessary to recognize\nthat it remains a unique and irreplaceable tool for dialogue\namong nations at the service of international peace and\nsecurity.\nClearly, it is unanimously held that the United Nations\nis useful and that it must exist; with equal unanimity we\ncall for its revitalization. The question of the reform of the\nUnited Nations is thus at the heart of this session, which\nstrikingly demonstrates how necessary and urgent it is. The\nSecretary-General rightly proclaimed this session the\nsession of reform.\nAdapting the United Nations to make it better able to\nenter the next millennium seems to be the great challenge\nof the reform to which we all aspire.\nBut before expressing my delegation\u2019s observations on\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s proposals for reform, I should like\nto share some of our major concerns, which I believe must\nbe taken into account if the continent to which my country\nbelongs is to experience real development commensurate\nwith its immense potential. I wish to speak about conflict\nmanagement in Africa and international cooperation for\nthe economic and social development of Africa.\nOne cannot fail to note that over 60 per cent of the\nagenda of the Security Council is devoted to situations in\nAfrica, and that of the 48 least developed countries, 35\nare in Africa.\nIn respect of conflicts in Africa, our continent has\ntaken charge of its own destiny. To this end, it established\nlegal instruments at the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) summit in Cairo in 1993, in the form of the\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\nResolution. If this venture is going to work Africa needs\nabove all the support of the international community in\nthe framework of a partnership with the United Nations,\nin accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter.\nThus in Liberia, at the end of a seven-year fratricidal\nwar which devastated that fraternal country and caused\nenormous damage to neighbouring countries such as\nGuinea and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire that had to deal with massive\nflows of refugees and displaced persons, the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) was able\nto broker a peace process which led to the election of\nMr. Charles G. Taylor as President of the Republic on 19\nJuly 1997 in elections that the OAU and the United\nNations recognized as just and democratic.\nIn the context of the meeting to support the\nreconstruction of Liberia which will take place tomorrow,\nI would like to make an urgent appeal to donor countries\nand international and non-governmental organizations to\nbe generous, because a reconstructed and prosperous\nLiberia can only benefit our entire subregion.\nWhile we are delighted at the positive development\nof the situation in Liberia, a military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat on 25\nMay 1997 put an end to the constitutional order in Sierra\nLeone by overthrowing a democratically elected President,\nMr. Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire immediately\ncondemned the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, which belongs to a bygone\nera.\nThe thirty-third meeting of heads of State and\nGovernment of the OAU, held in Harare from 2 to 4 June\n1997, by its decision 356 also condemned the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat,\nas did the Secretary-General of the United Nations and\nthe Presidents of the Security Council on 27 May, 11 July\nand 6 August 1997, who all demanded the immediate and\nunconditional restoration of constitutional order.\n22\n\n\nUnfortunately, the negotiations initiated by the group\nof five States mandated by ECOWAS with the\nrepresentatives of the junta in power in Freetown have so\nfar not succeeded in achieving the objectives of the\ninternational community. Therefore, the heads of State,\nduring the last ECOWAS summit, in Abuja on 28 and 29\nAugust 1997, were obliged to take a certain number of\nmeasures which we hope will be endorsed by the Security\nCouncil to allow the Committee of Five to resume, with the\ncomplete support of the international community, new\nnegotiations for a return to constitutional order in Sierra\nLeone, a country whose instability remains a serious threat\nto the fledgling Liberian democracy and the entire\nsubregion.\nIn the view of the OAU, ECOWAS and the Security\nCouncil, the Abidjan peace agreement of 30 November\n1996, signed by President Kabbah and the leader of the\nRevolutionary United Front (RUF), Mr. Foday Sankoh,\nremains the best framework for finding a definitive solution\nto the crisis in Sierra Leone. Once constitutional order is\nrestored, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is prepared to organize, together\nwith the other guarantors of this agreement and the parties\nconcerned, a conference aimed at reactivating the many\norgans of that agreement in order to find a lasting solution\nto this crisis.\nIn Central Africa, we remain profoundly concerned by\nthe fratricidal battles now taking place in the Congo. In this\nrespect, we wish to express our sincere appreciation to\nMr. Omar Bongo, President of the Gabonese Republic, for\nhis patient and courageous mediation in the inter-Congolese\nconflict. While urging him to continue his noble efforts, we\nregret the deterioration of the situation and above all the\nfact that no cease-fire has been accepted by the warring\nparties, which has prevented the establishment of an\nAfrican interposition force.\nIn the Central African Republic, we welcome the role\nof the Inter-African Mission to Monitor the Implementation\nof the Bangui Agreements (MISAB), which has helped\nstabilize the situation.\nIn respect of the crisis in the Comoros, we urgently\nappeal to all parties to give priority to dialogue and to\nrespond favourably to the OAU initiative with a view to\nholding a conference in Addis Ababa to find a solution. We\ninvite the international community to support the efforts of\nthe OAU and to give the Comoros all the economic and\nfinancial assistance it needs to confront the difficulties it is\nfacing, which are the root cause of the crisis.\nWith regard to Angola, we take note of the recent\nSecurity Council resolution 1130 (1997), which was\nadopted unanimously. While we welcome the recent\nmeasures taken by UNITA in response to the Council\u2019s\nappeal, we hope that it will persevere in that direction in\norder to meet all its obligations pursuant to the Lusaka\nProtocol.\nFinally, in respect of the question of Western Sahara,\nwe applaud the progress made during the series of\nmeetings under the auspices of the Special Envoy of the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations for Western\nSahara, Mr. James Baker III, with a view to holding a\nreferendum on self-determination.\nGiven the renewed upsurge of instability and conflict\nin many parts of Africa, we fervently appeal to the United\nNations to organize a regional conference in collaboration\nwith the OAU and ECOWAS to deal with the illicit\ncirculation of small arms in the West African subregion,\nin accordance with General Assembly resolution 51/45.\nIn the same context, we are delighted with the\nresults of the Oslo conference on anti-personnel\nlandmines, and in view of the human disasters that this\ntype of weapon continues to cause in Africa and the\nworld over, we urge all States to adhere to the results and\nrespect the terms.\nMy delegation believes that the present state of our\ncontinent requires a concerted policy of international\nsecurity and implementation of preventive strategies, and\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire intends to be actively involved. This is why,\nin defining recently new missions for C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s\narmed forces, President Henri Konan B\u00e9di\u00e9 specified that\nthey can henceforth participate in peacekeeping operations\nand that they stand ready to carry out possible protection\nand security missions which might be conferred upon\nthem by the international community.\nMore specifically, it seems to us increasingly\nnecessary to have a standing African interposition force.\nIn western Africa, for example, ECOWAS, drawing from\nthe experience of the ECOWAS Monitoring Group\n(ECOMOG) in the settlement of the Liberian conflict,\ncould envisage the reorganization of this force in order to\nmake it a genuine subregional force. In this context,\nconsultations for the establishment of a peacekeeping\nforce are under way in the framework of the Agreement\non Non-Aggression and Assistance in Matters of Defense\n(ANAD) which includes C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Burkina\nFaso, Benin, Niger, Mali, Mauritania and Togo.\n23\n\n\nThe elements of the ANAD peacekeeping force would\nbe coordinated in predetermined tactical or logistical\nmodules in a state of operational readiness on their\nrespective territories and could be sent into action at short\nnotice. These stand-by elements could be regrouped at the\nrequest of ECOWAS, the OAU or the United Nations.\nHowever effective our rapid-reaction capacity may be,\nwe will have to seek, above all, to strengthen the effective\nrule of democracy and the rule of law in each of our\ncountries in order to avoid crises turning into armed\nconflict.\nAbove all, every country must seek to achieve political\nstability and to promote social progress by establishing\nreliable democratic institutions based on freedom and\njustice and which guarantee the protection of the citizen and\nindividual rights. We must develop the elements of good\ngovernance and promote the emergence of responsible\nsociety.\nFor its part, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire under the leadership of\nPresident Henri Konan B\u00e9di\u00e9, is endeavouring day by day\nto strengthen democracy and the rule of law by resolute\naction towards a peaceful democracy.\nRecent measures in this connection have been\nannounced, including the forthcoming opening of the\nGovernment to the opposition, the granting of status to the\nleaders of the opposition parties represented in Parliament;\nthe creation of a Senate whose President will be acting\nHead of State in the event of a power vacuum; and the\ncreation of a National Commission for monitoring and\narbitration of elections. It will be presided over by a judge\nand made up of personalities and representatives of the\nleading political parties, along with international observers\nfrom the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the United\nNations, the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS), the European Union and the Canadian\nElectoral Committee. All of those elements are contributing\nto speeding the progress of democracy in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\nLastly, our people remain profoundly committed to the\nculture of peace, and it is to that commitment that C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire owes its unquestioned political stability, based on\nthe constancy of social dialogue and on the desire for\nshared progress that strengthens social unity. That is why\nmy delegation, along with a number of co-sponsors, intends\nto submit to this session of the General Assembly, as it did\nat the summer session of the Economic and Social Council\nheld last July at Geneva, a draft resolution proclaiming the\nyear 2000 as the international year for the culture of peace.\nMy second subject of concern relates to the effects\nof globalization on African economies with respect to\naccess to foreign markets, the volume of official\ndevelopment assistance and favourable treatment for\nforeign debt.\nWith regard to access to foreign markets,\nglobalization, carried out in the name of liberalization and\ncompetitiveness, has led to the erosion and even the\neradication of preferences that allow the goods of our\ncountries to gain access to the markets of developed\ncountries. We must be given time to adapt, or be\ncompensated in some other way, if our countries are to\nparticipate in international trade to their full potential. We\ncommend the recent United States initiative, \u201cGrowth and\nopportunity in Africa\u201d, which is aimed, inter alia, at\npromoting the access of African goods to the American\nmarket.\nWith regard to the effect of globalization on the\nvolume of official development assistance, we note that\nfor all the enthusiasm for the development of the private\nsector \u2014 development which we welcome, recognizing\nthat private investment is the driving force of economic\ngrowth \u2014 a trend towards a decline in official\ndevelopment assistance, despite its importance in the fight\nagainst poverty in our countries. That trend concerns us,\nbecause official development assistance is essential in\nsupporting our domestic efforts, above all in sectors\nrelated to the development of human resources. We\ntherefore urge the donor countries to redouble their efforts\nto achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of their gross\ndomestic product.\nLastly, with regard to the question of foreign debt,\nthere is now broad agreement that without favourable\ntreatment for the stock of African debt, particularly in the\nmost heavily indebted countries, no economic recovery\nprogramme can produce the desired long-term positive\neffects. We must therefore insist that serious consideration\nbe given to measures in this regard. We welcome the\nmeasures recently taken in favour of Uganda, Bolivia and\nBurkina Faso within the framework of the debt-alleviation\nInitiative of the International Monetary Fund, the World\nBank and the Paris Club. I am delighted to learn that my\nown country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, along with Mozambique and\nGuyana, will be the next to benefit from that Initiative. I\nwould also note that my country is involved in a\nsatisfactory dialogue with the London Club with a view\nto a significant restructuring of our commercial debt.\n24\n\n\nTurning to the question of United Nations reform,\nwhich lies at the heart of this session, we must distinguish\nbetween two aspects that dovetail to form a single coherent\nand logical unit. We have on the one hand the reforms\nbeing set in motion by Member States and on the other the\nprogramme of reforms proposed by the Secretary-General\nin his report (A/51/950) of 14 July 1997.\nWith regard to the reforms being driven by Member\nStates, I would refer to the activities of various open-ended\nWorking Groups of the General Assembly. Having\npersonally been privileged to conduct the consultations that\nled to the establishment of three of those Groups during my\nown term of office as President of the forty-ninth session,\nI am pleased to note the relatively positive results of two of\nthem: the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on An\nAgenda for Development and the Open-ended High-Level\nWorking Group on the Strengthening of the United Nations\nSystem. The States participating in those Groups have\nshown a magnificent spirit of solidarity.\nThe Agenda for Development, adopted last June by\nthe General Assembly, is an important stage in the dialogue\nbetween nations on international cooperation for\ndevelopment. It establishes the consensus framework within\nwhich developed and developing countries can work to\nestablish on a more solid basis a renewed and strengthened\npartnership for development based on mutual advantage.\nThe Open-ended High-Level Working Group on the\nStrengthening of the United Nations System, which has had\nto deal mainly with the revitalization of the General\nAssembly and the Secretariat, has produced\nrecommendations that are part of the dynamics of the\nreforms proposed by the Secretary-General, inter alia, to\nrationalize the work of the General Assembly and its\nsubsidiary bodies. My delegation is pleased with those\npositive results.\nWith regard to the High-Level Open-ended Working\nGroup on the Financial Situation of the United Nations and\nthe Open-ended Working Group on the reform of the\nSecurity Council, we cannot help but feel frustrated that\nthey are apparently bogged down and have not made the\nexpected progress.\nWe are all aware of the crucial importance of the\nfinancial situation of the United Nations. The success of the\nentire reform process depends on a solution to that\nquestion. We should like to reaffirm here the need for all\nMember States to fulfil their obligations under Article 19 of\nthe Charter, namely, to honour their financial obligations\ntowards the United Nations fully, on time and without\nconditions. Similarly, we express our complete support for\nthe principle of capacity to pay as a basis for the scale of\nassessments. We believe it is necessary to deal with those\nquestions courageously and responsibly in order to\nprovide our Organization with a viable, sound and solid\nfinancial base.\nTurning to the important question of Security\nCouncil reform, our position is that of the African Group\nas defined at the recent Summit Meeting of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) at Harare, which\nstressed that the new configuration of the Security\nCouncil must reflect the realities of today\u2019s world through\na geographically equitable representation of all the regions\nof the world. In that connection, my delegation, while in\nfavour of the admission of Germany and Japan as\npermanent members of the Security Council, is of the\nopinion that Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, as\nwell as Asia, should also be represented as permanent\nmembers of the Security Council.\nThe new permanent members should have the same\nprerogatives as the present permanent members, in\nparticular as regards the right of the veto, which, if not\ndone away with entirely, should be restricted to the\nconditions set forth in Chapter VII of the Charter.\nTurning to the reforms proposed by the Secretary-\nGeneral, I want to express my delegation\u2019s sincere\ncongratulations on the work accomplished. These reforms\nare the broadest and most profound that we have ever\nseen. My delegation therefore supports them\nenthusiastically.\nIt is our expectation that this reform process will\nlead to the promotion of the economic and social\ndevelopment of less developed Member States, the\nstrengthening of multilateralism and an increase in the\nUnited Nations effectiveness and credibility.T o\naccomplish that, we must see to it that the reform\nexercise is not confined to an obsessive desire purely and\nsimply to reduce costs.\nThe measures aimed at increasing the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s guidance and management capacity seem to us\namply justified. In fact, the presence of a Deputy\nSecretary-General, a Senior Management Group and a\nStrategic Planning Unit will provide the Secretary-General\nwith an internal support mechanism that will considerably\nstrengthen his authority and his overall control system-\nwide.\n25\n\n\nThe new configuration of the Secretariat organizational\nchart is attractive in its concision and coherence, but above\nall in its objective of effectiveness. Nonetheless, the\ncomprehensive measures aimed at regrouping 12 entities\nand administrative units into five services should not result\nin either a decline in the programme level of operational\nactivities for development or in a decrease in the quality of\ntechnical cooperation services due to a reduction of staff.\nIn the same context, the establishment of a\nDevelopment Group composed mainly of the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), the United\nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) should not affect the dynamic\nnature of their activities in the field.\nLastly, the proposals of the Secretary-General to\nrefocus the work of the General Assembly on high-priority\nquestions and to reduce the duration of its sessions reflect\na concern for rationalization that we fully support.\nWe agree with the Secretary-General\u2019s statement that\nreform is a continuous process and not a one-time event. In\nfact, this reform is the result of an entire series of\nreflections that began in the 1970s within and outside the\nUnited Nations system to adapt it to the changes that have\ntaken place since 1945. I have in mind the report of the\nFord Foundation, the Bertrand report, the work of the\nCarlsson group and the work of many universities in the\nUnited States and in Europe, whose research clarified many\naspects of our debates, especially during the work of the\nworking groups on the different aspects of reform.\nNonetheless, any reform is above all part of a certain\nlogic aimed at achieving an objective. But its success in the\nfinal analysis will depend on the quality of the individuals\nwho are going to implement it, and above all on the\npolitical will of the States that will be called upon to work\ntogether to respect the spirit of compromise that made it\npossible to arrive at the package.\nFor its part, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is prepared to participate\nactively with other delegations when the time comes in the\nconstructive consideration of the Secretary-General\u2019s\nproposals for reform. Their consequences involve all of us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I would like\nto extend to you, Sir, my sincere congratulations on your\nelection to the presidency of this session of the General\nAssembly. Your election is well-deserved recognition of\nyour great personal qualities and a tribute to Ukraine. We\nwish you success in the exercise of your duties.\n23\n\n\nMy delegation would also like to extend its\nappreciation to the Permanent Representative of Malaysia\nto the United Nations, Mr. Razali Ismail, for his excellent\nwork during the previous session of the General Assembly.\nWe also extend our sincere thanks to Mr. Kofi Annan,\nwho in carrying out his mission as the Secretary-General of\nour Organization has demonstrated a remarkable spirit of\nhard work and commitment during a particularly difficult\ntime for the United Nations in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and in the complex task of restructuring\nand strengthening of this institution.\nThe most noticeable feature of the world as the end of\nthe century approaches is the generalized spread of\ndemocracy. Almost all the nations of the world share this\nway of life, thereby giving the end of the century a\ncharacter which has no parallel in past centuries. We are\nfinally living in an era of democracy after a long night of\ndictatorship and totalitarianism in various parts of the globe.\nBut this universalization of democracy goes hand in hand\nwith something which \u2014 for lack of a better name \u2014 we\nmight call the malaise of democracy. Dissatisfaction can be\nheard everywhere; this political system is being called into\nquestion in the name of development and prosperity.\nDemocracy with extreme poverty is not the model we seek.\nRepresentative government is a political gain of the\nmodern age, but it is only the halfway point on the road to\nfull human development. It must be accompanied by other\nelements which are essential to a life of dignity: wellbeing,\njustice, involvement and a full understanding of the human\nbeing as both the root and the fruit of all our efforts.\nIf there is one thing which we will have to do in the\nfuture, particularly in forums such as the General\nAssembly, it is to find formulas that can provide for a\nworkable relationship between democracy and development,\nbetween prosperity and equity, and between growing wealth\nand disappearing poverty.\nThe United Nations faces challenges and expectations\nwith regard to this serious matter of the viability of\ndemocracy. There is perhaps today no more important task.\nIf freedom, the essence of this political system, is\ndisparaged in the name of growth without values, then the\nloss of generations sacrificed on the battlefields in this\ntortured century will lose all meaning. That danger does\nexist, and those of us who know from our own painful\nexperience the crimes that can be committed in the name of\nprogress have a duty to alert everyone to it.\nIn recent years, five successive Governments have\ncome to power legitimately in Honduras through free\nelections. This is unprecedented in our history and it\nallows us to say that we are indeed practising democracy,\nwhich is a lesson we never finish learning. Our\nexperience shows once again that free elections, while\nbeing the basis of Governments, are not in themselves\nsufficient to consolidate the system or to guarantee the\ncomplete satisfaction of the people.\nSince 1994 we have been trying to involve our\npeople more in major national decisions and we have\nbeen trying to pay more attention to their needs through\nan open dialogue. This is part of our belief that it is\nessential to move forward from formal democracy to real\ndemocracy, if we want it to be more than a constitutional\nexpression and become part of the living culture of our\npeople.\nDemocratic culture as a way of life requires constant\nvigilance to bolster its credibility and to legitimize its\nexistence every day. This is why in our part of Central\nAmerica, Honduras, we have regarded it as essential to\nback up this form of government with an ongoing\nreaffirmation of its ethical values and a resolute campaign\nagainst all forms of corruption, which is one of the worst\nand most vexatious enemies of democracy.\nIn late November this year, Honduras will hold\nanother election to change its Government. I am pleased\nto be able to report to the international community that\nthis process will be free and transparent and that once\nagain the people will decide the Government for the next\nfour-year term.\nEconomic indicators provided by national and\ninternational institutions agree that at the end of our\nmandate there has been a significant improvement in the\nHonduran economy. We are pleased to be able to hand\nover to the new authorities a country that is in better\nshape than it was when we began our term. This could\nwell be the real meaning of democracy: constant\nimprovement in living conditions and moving from one\nlevel to another through successive Governments \u2014 with\nthe free vote of the people being the final judge of what\nis to be done.\nThe Honduran way of finding common ground in\norder to reach agreement on the kind of country we want\nhas been to establish permanent interaction between the\ngovernors and the governed.\n24\n\n\nThese last four years of government have to a large\nextent been an ongoing debate with civil society, the\nhealthy results of which confirm, on the one hand, the\nadvantages of participation and, on the other, the capacities\nof Government. This is what democracy teaches us, its\nmost valuable lesson.\nMuch indeed remains to be done, but we are on the\nright track. We have established solid juridical bases. We\nhave made tangible progress and are building a dynamic\nState respectful of the law, dependable in justice and, above\nall, conscious of the enormous needs of the Honduran\npeople and their inalienable right to be the principal focus\nof development. The social expenditures of the Honduran\nState in 1998 will account for over 30 per cent of our\nnational budget. This is a clear message to our people.\nIt is well known that Honduras is part of the great\nCentral American family. We were united in the colonial\nperiod and we were united when we attained independence.\nSeparation and fragmentation have simply been a long\nparenthesis, occasionally interrupted by fleeting attempts at\nunity. What is important, however, is the will of our\ncountries, repeatedly expressed, to come together again and\ntheir demonstrated desire for union, which has always\nsought new forms of expression and can be wiped out\nneither by the passage of time nor by setbacks of any kind.\nFrom 1994 to today, two major events have marked\nlife in Central America. The Alliance for Sustainable\nDevelopment (ALIDES) was signed in 1994 and an\nagreement was reached to initiate the gradual and\nprogressive establishment of the Central American union as\nthe higher expression of the community association laid\ndown in the 1991 Tegucigalpa Protocol, contained in the\nNicaragua Declaration of 2 September 1997.\nThe Alliance represents a radical change in the\nintegration agenda of Central America, a new concept of\ndevelopment, making it integral to and indivisible from the\nbenefit of the human individual. Sustainable development,\nas advocated by ALIDES, is a recognition that growth may\nbe pursued while protecting the future \u2014 we can grow\ntoday without jeopardizing the development of generations\nto come.\nIt is also an alliance with nature, a new relationship\nand a revaluation of our resources. It seeks to avoid the\nnegative consequences of a short-term approach and to look\nto the lasting prosperity of our peoples. Lastly, it exploits\nour new competitive advantages: our situation as an\nisthmus, our long coastlines, our inter-ocean facilities, our\nmagnificent biodiversity and the beauty of the Caribbean\nregion. We are committed to building ALIDES. It is\nfitting to acknowledge that the originality of our approach\nhas been recognized at the world level and is being\nendorsed by important entities.\nThe main content of the Nicaragua Declaration that\nI have just mentioned is the agreement on Central\nAmerican union. While we have been working on\nregional integration, the absence of a political lodestar has\nwrought a lack of coherence at the regional level. We are\nnow resolved, however, to deal with this lodestar and this\npolitical dimension in a gradual and progressive approach\nthat does not run roughshod over history. This will bring\nus together and define us, giving substance to the vision\nof Central America shared by the rest of the world.\nOur decision is neither utopian nor romantic,\nalthough we are such stuff as dreams are made on, as\nShakespeare says. We are not talking here of utopias or\nromanticism. Our decision is simply an act of maturity, a\nrealistic recognition of the needs created by our internal\ndevelopment and by external demands which, if we are to\nsurvive with dignity, will require us to make enormous\nefforts that, in our case, transcend our capabilities as\ndivided, individual States.\nWe have established a working committee to draft\nthe bases and principles for Central American union. By\nthe end of the year, we should have the relevant\ndocuments. The process will culminate in the signing of\nthe formal commitment to political unity.\nThose who are familiar with Central American\nhistory and aware of our current efforts in the various\nfields of integration know that Central American union is\nnot simply an act of faith; it is, rather, a work of\nengineering, an enormous undertaking that, taking into\naccount the unique qualities of each of our States, is the\nkey to the exercise of joint sovereignty.\nThe peoples of the United Nations must be informed\nof this important decision. That is why the five Central\nAmerican Presidents are here, in this highest world forum,\nspreading the good news of this political decision.\nThrough the representatives here, we wish the world to\nlearn of this great decision and to accept our aspirations,\nwhich are shared by other regions of the world. In this\ncontext, my country reiterates its endorsement of the right\nof the Republic of China to become a Member of the\nUnited Nations family. We support the work of that great\nnation, which is seeking ways to participate fully in this\n25\n\n\nand in other international forums without any form of\nexclusion or hegemony.\nI wish now to refer to Honduras\u2019s support for the\nprocess of deep-rooted change in the United Nations, both\nin its various fields of operation as well as in its internal\ndecision-making organs. The world in which the United\nNations was created was not what it is today and we must\ntherefore keep up with the times.\nOn the question of the Security Council, we would\nrepeat what was said at the forty-ninth session of the\nGeneral Assembly and reiterate our belief that a solution to\nthe question of the size of the Council\u2019s membership cannot\nbe rushed. Moreover, my country endorses the statement on\nthe strengthening of the United Nations and Security\nCouncil reform adopted at the eleventh Summit of the Rio\nGroup. This stated that the Latin American and Caribbean\nregion must be taken into account in any proposal relating\nto an increase in the Security Council\u2019s membership.\nWe are pleased at the mine-clearance work that has\nbeen carried out with international support. In the case of\nHonduras, this work is particularly important because of the\nlives taken and mutilations caused by this inhumane\npractice that is now receiving universal condemnation, a\ncondemnation that we firmly and decidedly support.\nFinally, we would like to express once again how\npleased we are at the regional and world treatment of the\nsubject of corruption. As the world becomes aware of how\nthis scourge affects the development and peaceful existence\nof peoples, we will finally make progress towards\nvanquishing it in the various parts of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, Sir, allow\nme to congratulate you on your election as President of\nthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly of the\nUnited Nations and to wish you success in the execution\nof that responsible and lofty function. I am especially\npleased that the General Assembly has elected to this very\nresponsible function a very competent representative from\nUkraine, a friendly country with which the Republic of\nMacedonia is developing successful cooperation.\nThe Republic of Macedonia attaches great\nimportance to the fifty-second session of the General\nAssembly. On the threshold of the twenty-first century,\nthe interdependence of peace and global development is\na standard that must be respected. It is dangerous for\nsome to develop while others continuously regress. This\ntrend can only be a source of conflicts, of confrontation\nof interests, even of wars. Consequently, there is no\nalternative to the strengthening of peace through the\npromotion of international cooperation, and our\nOrganization faces the serious responsibility of being even\nmore efficient and more focused on essential issues. This\nis the direction that the Macedonian delegation will also\npursue.\nI applaud the fact that the Organization is headed by\nMr. Kofi Annan, a very competent reformer who believes\nin the irreplaceable role of the United Nations as a\nguarantor of international peace and security. His\nprogramme for United Nations reform, as contained in his\nreport of July of this year, is one of the most topical\nissues before the Organization. We believe that the\nessential changes that have been proposed take into\naccount the basic consideration that the United Nations\n4\n\n\nremain a democratic institution representing the interests of\nall Members. We too, much like the Secretary-General,\nwish the Organization to be a promoter of new changes, a\ntrue centre where countries can harmonize their activities in\nbuilding a better world. Whether the United Nations will\ntruly become such an organization will depend on all of us,\nand the Republic of Macedonia will continue to make its\ncontribution to that end. In that context, the emerging\npriorities are as follows: a stronger General Assembly,\nreform of United Nations organs, and above all of the\nSecurity Council, a reduction in the number of ad hoc\nbodies, greater transparency of operations, and maximum\ncontrol over the budget of the Organization, financial\nspending and contributions.\nAllow me to address some of the priority tasks that\nthe United Nations will have to face in the coming period,\ntasks which should not be placed in the background because\nof the reform of the United Nations. Indeed, that reform\nmust be in the service of a more efficient resolution of the\nbitter issues that burden the international community. The\ncredibility of the United Nations will to a large measure\ndepend on this, for in the coming period much energy will\nhave to be devoted to ending existing crises and conflicts\nand to preventing the eruption of new ones.\nThe United Nations has become renowned for its\nsuccessful peacekeeping operations. I should like to use this\nopportunity to express my highest appraisal of the presence\nof the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force\n(UNPREDEP) in the Republic of Macedonia, as well as my\nappreciation to all the participants in that operation, which\nhas helped prevent a spillover of the conflict from some\nparts of the former Yugoslavia to my country.\nWith regard to the crisis in Albania, my country has\nconstantly felt the need for the effective presence of the\nUnited Nations peacekeeping forces. The cooperation\nbetween the Macedonian Government and UNPREDEP, one\nof the most successful preventive operations in the history\nof the United Nations, is truly excellent. My pleasure is\nincreased by the reports of the Secretary-General that\ncontain the same assessments. The mission of UNPREDEP\nis ongoing. We believe that it should continue, for the\npresence of peacekeepers in the Republic of Macedonia\nserves not only as a dam preventing the existing crisis\npoints in the Balkans from overflowing, but also as an actor\nworking for peace, security and stability in the country\u2019s\nsouthern regions.\nIn that context, the Republic of Macedonia has\nwelcomed and follows closely the implementation of the\nDayton Accord. It is a matter of principle that the\nindicted war criminals be brought to justice. The\ninternational community, epitomized in the United\nNations, must not allow the Dayton Accord to fail. Hence,\nit is imperative to give impetus to further engagement by\nthe Organization, in coordination with the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union, in\nsustaining the peace process. A particularly important part\nof that effort, I would emphasize, is the normalization of\nrelations between the Balkan countries, on the basis of\ngood-neighbourliness and mutual respect. Within its\ncapacities, the Republic of Macedonia has made and will\ncontinue to make the maximum contribution to that effect.\nThe agenda of this session of the Assembly also\nincludes the development of good-neighbourly relations\nbetween Balkan countries, in accordance with resolution\n50/80, adopted following our proposal at the fiftieth\nsession of the General Assembly, and the election of new\nmembers of the Security Council for the term from 1998\nto 1999. Allow me to address these issues briefly.\nThroughout the twentieth century, the Balkans has\nremained a concern for the international community due\nto the many wars waged in this region. The Republic of\nMacedonia has unequivocally opted for peace there. In\nthis context, we are engaged in an active policy of good-\nneighbourliness and mutual cooperation with all Balkan\ncountries. This can also be seen through resolutions 48/84\nand 50/80 B proposed by the Republic of Macedonia and\nsponsored by many Balkan countries \u2014 but not just\nBalkan countries \u2014 and adopted with the vast support\nand consensus of the General Assembly. The Republic of\nMacedonia is committed to respecting the territorial\nintegrity and sovereignty of the Balkan States and the\ninviolability of international frontiers, and to advancing\nmutual cooperation in all spheres. We are particularly\ncommitted to the institutionalized and functional\nintegration of the Balkans in the European integration\nprocesses. During this session, our delegation will submit\na draft resolution for the development of good-\nneighbourly relations in the Balkans. I hope that the\nGeneral Assembly will adopt it by consensus.\nAs long ago as 1994, my country, the Republic of\nMacedonia, submitted its candidacy as a non-permanent\nmember of the Security Council from the Eastern\nEuropean group of countries, for the term from 1998 to\n1999. I also announced our candidacy during my address\nto the Assembly last year. I am pleased that many United\nNations Members have expressed great understanding of\nour motives and arguments, and have supported the need\n5\n\n\nfor one Balkan country to be elected as a member of the\nSecurity Council. We very much appreciate the support for\nand confidence in our candidacy that we expect to receive\nfrom the Assembly. We would like to make our own\ncontribution to the activities of the Security Council and the\nUnited Nations as a whole by incorporating our own policy\nof peace and democracy into those activities on the issues\nwhich fall within those organs' areas of responsibility. I\nwould like to assure the Assembly that our delegation on\nthe Security Council will act in full accordance with the\nCharter of the United Nations. In the period that lies ahead,\nUnited Nations bodies will continue to deal with Balkan\nproblems and the general Balkan situation. This is reality.\nFor these reasons, it is quite logical that the Republic of\nMacedonia, as a Balkan country, be elected to this function.\nIt will be a great honour for us to shoulder this\nresponsibility, and, at the same time, a great obligation for\nwhich we have long been preparing.\nThe processes of democratic transformation in many\ncountries in the world will undoubtedly continue at the\nsame pace in the twenty-first century. This trend will\ninevitably influence the character of overall and\ncomprehensive international relations in global proportions.\nThe United Nations and other organs within its system must\ninevitably take part in these changes. Only if the rules of\ninternational law are abided by and the real situation on the\nground is respected can a better and more humane world be\ncreated and thus our trust in our Organization increased. I\nam confident that the reforms that have been announced, or\nrather their consistent implementation, will lead to an even\ngreater affirmation of the United Nations and its\ncommitment to combating policies of force and domination\nand to supporting peace, cooperation and the balanced\ndevelopment of all countries and peoples. In a word, we are\nconfident that in this way the United Nations will be even\nmore efficient in responding to the objectives and ideals of\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI congratulate you,\nSir, on assuming the presidency of the fifty-second\nsession of the General Assembly and pledge to you our\nfull support and cooperation. I also pay tribute to your\npredecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail, whose devoted\nefforts enabled the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly to come to grips with some of the core issues\naffecting the future of the United Nations.\nWe meet at a time when a number of profound\nquestions loom large over humankind. Does the\ninternational community possess the necessary will and\n5\n\n\nmeans to make the twenty-first century an era of wider\npeace, deeper justice and greater prosperity? Can we\neradicate poverty and protect the environment? Are we able\nto ensure that fundamental human rights are respected and\npromoted throughout the world? Can we reinvigorate the\nUnited Nations so that it can be the means to advance these\nends? To each of these questions we can and must respond\nin the affirmative.\nThe Secretary-General, through his recent reform\nproposals, has provided the international community with\na timely compass to help guide the way. In the view of my\ndelegation, the Secretary- General's latest proposals contain\na wide spectrum of reforms designed for the overall\nenhancement of the United Nations system. We are\nconfident that many of the Secretary-General's ideas can be\ntranslated into action through open-minded deliberation,\nwith the full participation of Member States at this session.\nIn this respect, I wish to recall the statement of 10 August\nby the Group of 16, including the Republic of Korea, which\nexpressed support for the Secretary-General's reform\ninitiatives.\nWhile institutional reform is a prerequisite for a more\nefficient United Nations, it is clear that without more\nreliable financial support the Organization cannot make an\nefficient transition into the twenty-first century. Only when\nMember States discharge their financial obligations in full,\non time and without conditions will the United Nations\nsafely and smoothly reach its ultimate destination of\nensuring a better future for humankind.\nIt is in this spirit that Korea has made it a firm policy\nto pay its assessed dues in full and on time. We will\nactively participate in concerted efforts to adopt a more\nequitable scale of assessment at this session. My\nGovernment will consider a gradual move from the\ncontributors' Group C to which Korea presently belongs, to\nGroup B in terms of peacekeeping assessment. This is a\nreaffirmation of our enduring commitment towards both the\nfinancial viability of the United Nations and its efforts to\nmaintain international peace and security.\nAnother crucial task before us is the reform of the\nSecurity Council. At the last session, my delegation actively\nparticipated in deliberations on the issue, on the basis of\nour own experiences as a Council member. We share the\nview that the profound changes in international relations\nover the past several decades fully warrant expansion of\nCouncil membership. Given the diverse and sensitive\nconcerns of all Member States, however, this issue must be\nhandled with the utmost prudence and seriousness. Every\neffort should be made to work out a consensus formula,\nwhile bearing in mind that haste makes waste.\nOne of the most significant and promising\ndevelopments in international relations over the past half\ncentury has been the emergence of a considerable number\nof medium-power countries with the capability to make a\nmeaningful contribution to the cause of international\npeace and security. Any plan to reform the Council\nshould provide those countries with opportunities to serve\non the Council with reasonable frequency, commensurate\nwith their capabilities and contributions.\nWe also believe that Council reform should be based\nupon consideration of the problems and shortcomings\nassociated with the Council's operations thus far,\nparticularly with respect to the system of permanent\nmembership and the right of veto. Convinced that more\ncan be done to make the Security Council a more\nrepresentative, efficient and democratic body, we will\nremain open-minded and flexible with regard to any\nproposals that can move this important process in the\nright direction.\nAs a member of the Security Council for the 1996-\n1997 period, the Republic of Korea has made its due\ncontribution to the cause of international peace and\nsecurity. We have actively participated in reaching\nimportant decisions to enhance peace and stability in the\ncountries of some parts of the third world that have been\nplagued by civil conflicts over the past several years. We\nalso organized, during Korea's presidency of the Council\nlast May, an open debate on the refugee issue. The debate\nresulted in the adoption of a presidential statement in June\non protection for humanitarian assistance to refugees and\nothers in conflict situations. This clearly reflects the fact\nthat the Security Council has come to recognize that\nsecurity applies to people as much as to States in an era\nof intra-State conflicts.\nDespite many positive developments in the security\nlandscape of the post Cold-War era, the non-proliferation\nof weapons of mass destruction remains a priority concern\nto people and Governments alike. My Government\nbelieves that universal adherence to the existing non-\nproliferation regimes represents an essential step towards\nrealizing that common objective. In this regard, we\nwelcome the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons\nConvention, and urge those States which have not yet\nacceded to the Convention, including North Korea, to do\nso at the earliest date.\n6\n\n\nThe proliferation and indiscriminate use of anti-\npersonnel landmines has been the cause of enormous\nhuman suffering and injury, particularly among civilians.\nGiven the magnitude of the scourge of anti-personnel\nlandmines, the Republic of Korea has decided to extend for\nan indefinite period its moratorium on the export of anti-\npersonnel landmines, which was to expire at the end of this\nyear. We believe, however, that each country's legitimate\nsecurity concerns should be given due consideration in\naddressing this matter.\nI wish to reiterate that, while we fully support the\nnoble crusade to protect innocent civilians from anti-\npersonnel landmines, a sweeping ban cannot be a\nsatisfactory answer for a country like the Republic of\nKorea, which faces the real and present risk of a recurrence\nof all-out war, and whose heavily populated capital is only\n25 miles from the military demarcation line. In our view,\nthe draft convention adopted in Oslo two weeks ago does\nnot fully accommodate concerns which we have\nconsistently expressed, or the exceptional nature of the\nsecurity situation on the Korean peninsula.\nThe international community has consistently\nendeavoured to wipe out all forms of terrorism from the\nface of the earth. However, terrorism still persists as one of\nthe major threats to international peace, exacting a heavy\ntoll on innocent lives. The Republic of Korea has\nexperienced many barbaric and cowardly acts of terrorism\nand still lives under its constant threat, including recent\nopen threats aimed at our free press. We strongly support\ninternational efforts to combat terrorism and underline the\nimportance of upholding the principle of zero tolerance.\nGiven the global spectrum of terrorism, we also believe that\nthe United Nations can play a central role in strengthening\nthe international anti-terrorism regime. In this regard, we\nlook forward to an early adoption of the convention for the\nsuppression of terrorist bombings.\nIn this era of interdependence among States, the\ninternational community cannot remain indifferent to the\nunder-development of much of the world. My delegation\ntherefore welcomes the adoption of the Agenda for\nDevelopment at the previous session of the General\nAssembly and the Secretary-General's reform proposals\ndesigned to enhance the United Nations economic and\nsocial initiatives as well as its development activities. For\nthat reason, we support the Secretary-General's suggestion\nto enhance the coordinating role of the Economic and\nSocial Council and to strengthen cooperation between the\nUnited Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions. We\nexpect that the various proposals for a funding modality for\nUnited Nations development activities will be discussed\nfully at this session.\nKorea, now a member of the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development, will participate\nmore vigorously in South-South cooperation projects with\na view to playing a bridging role between developed and\ndeveloping countries. In an effort to expand assistance to\nthe least developed countries, we have participated in\nbilateral cooperation projects with the Economic\nCommission for Africa since 1995, and we plan to\nundertake a programme for the development of Africa for\nthe period 1998 to 2000.\nMy Government, jointly with the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, established in Seoul this past\nMay the International Vaccine Institute. This Institute is\ndevoted to the research and development of vaccines for\nchildren around the world, particularly those in\ndeveloping countries. The inaugural meeting of its board\nof trustees is scheduled to convene in Seoul next month.\nWe look forward to generous support from Member\nStates for this worthy goal of keeping our children free\nfrom debilitating diseases.\nTurning now to environmental issues, my\nGovernment welcomes the adoption of the Programme for\nFurther Implementation of Agenda 21 at the nineteenth\nspecial session of the General Assembly and stands\ncommitted to participating faithfully in its implementation.\nIn particular, we are pleased that Korea's proposal to\nconduct a feasibility study on the transfer of publicly\nowned technology was supported by developed and\ndeveloping countries alike and was included in the\nProgramme. The results of the feasibility study, which is\nbeing funded by my Government, will be presented at the\nsixth session of the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment next April. Through these efforts, we hope\nto expedite the transfer of environmentally sound\ntechnologies and to promote international cooperation for\nenvironmental protection.\nDuring the special session, there was also an in-\ndepth discussion on the safe management of radioactive\nwaste, an issue of serious concern to many countries. My\nGovernment attaches great importance to the fact that the\nspecial session adopted a comprehensive set of\narrangements on the environmentally sound management\nof these dangerous wastes. We strongly urge that these\narrangements be firmly and strictly adhered to and\nrespected.\n7\n\n\nWith regard to the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change, we hope that a realistic and\nachievable outcome will emerge at the Kyoto Conference\nto be held in December this year.\nNext year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\nadoption and proclamation of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights. In 1998, we are also to undertake the five-\nyear mid-term review of the implementation of the Vienna\nDeclaration and Programme of Action adopted in June\n1993.\nIn the view of my delegation, human rights is an area\nwhere the United Nations has made significant contributions\nover the past half century, not just as an international forum\nfor discussion, but also as a centre for coordinated action.\nSeen from this perspective, the consolidation of the Office\nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the\nCentre for Human Rights, as proposed in the Secretary-\nGeneral's report, should certainly inject new vitality into\nUnited Nations efforts to enhance the coordination of its\nactivities in the area of human rights. I wholeheartedly\nwelcome Mary Robinson's assumption of the post of High\nCommissioner.\nMy Government also welcomes the remarkable\nprogress made by the Preparatory Committee on the\nEstablishment of an International Criminal Court, which we\nbelieve will serve as an effective deterrent against violations\nof international humanitarian law. We expect that the\nforthcoming conference in Rome will adopt the statute of\nthe court, paving the way for its establishment at the\nearliest possible date. From a historical perspective, the\ncreation of a permanent international criminal court will set\na benchmark for the attainment of international criminal\njustice in the coming century.\nAs rightly pointed out in the Secretary-General's\nreport, the developments in the present decade have clearly\nstrengthened the argument that respect for human rights is\na precondition for political stability and socio-economic\nprogress. One of the United Nations' most compelling\nresponsibilities is to further promote universal respect for\nhuman rights and deter gross human rights abuses and\npolitical oppression. In this context, we are gravely\nconcerned at the dire human rights situation in North\nKorea. We truly hope that, in the not-too-distant future, our\ncompatriots in the North will come to enjoy basic human\nrights and freedoms, as other peoples do around the world.\nLet me now turn to the situation on the Korean\nPeninsula. In April last year, the Republic of Korea and the\nUnited States jointly proposed four-party talks, involving\nthe South and the North of Korea, the United States and\nChina, which aim to establish a permanent peace\nmechanism on the Korean Peninsula and build mutual\ntrust between the two sides of Korea. The four-party\ntalks, when realized, will offer rare chances of facilitating\npeace and security on the Korean Peninsula and\nthroughout North-east Asia.\nIf inter-Korean relations are to move forward and the\noutstanding problems of the Peninsula are to be resolved\npeacefully, there is no alternative to dialogue and\nreconciliation between the South and the North of Korea.\nWe sincerely hope that North Korea will realize the\nimportance and value of improved inter-Korean relations\nthrough its participation in the four-party talks. While the\ntalks are in the interest of all concerned, no one stands to\nbenefit more than North Korea itself. The construction of\na solid and durable peace structure on the Korean\nPeninsula will also produce generous dividends which can\nhelp North Korea in addressing a host of domestic\nchallenges it faces, including its economic difficulties.\nIt is regrettable that the recent preparatory meetings\nfor the four-party talks ended without any tangible result.\nNevertheless, we will continue our patient effort to\nengage North Korea in a process of dialogue. We\nappreciate the continued support of the international\ncommunity to this end.\nIn the meantime, the Republic of Korea will\ncontinue to provide humanitarian assistance to North\nKorea. The plight of innocent civilians in the North and,\nin particular, vulnerable groups such as malnourished\nchildren, is a matter of serious concern for the\nGovernment and people of the Republic of Korea. As a\nmatter of priority, my Government will provide assistance\nto the vulnerable children in North Korea in close\ncooperation with the United Nations Children's Fund and\nother interested countries. In this connection, we would\nlike to stress the vital importance of transparency in the\ndistribution process. We hope that such transparency can\nbe enhanced through more effective monitoring by the\ninternational organizations concerned.\nThis year has seen some positive developments in\ninternational efforts to resolve the long-standing North\nKorean nuclear issue. The 1994 Geneva Agreed\nFramework has now entered the implementation stage,\nwith the ground-breaking ceremony for the light-water\nreactor project in North Korea last month under the\nauspices of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development\n8\n\n\nOrganization (KEDO). For the first time in nearly five\ndecades, over 100 engineers and technicians of both sides\nof Korea are working together on the construction site. We\nhope that this welcome development will be a harbinger of\na new era in inter-Korean relations. My Government takes\nthis opportunity to express its appreciation to all those\ncountries which have extended generous financial\ncontributions to KEDO.\nWhile the ongoing light-water reactor project\nundertaken by KEDO is an important step forward in\neliminating the threat of nuclear proliferation in the Korean\npeninsula, it must be emphasized here once again that the\nultimate resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue is\npossible only when North Korea complies fully with its\nsafeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy\nAgency, as well as with the Joint Declaration on the\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula signed by the\nSouth and North Korea in 1991.\nWhen the United Nations was founded in 1945, who\ncould have foreseen the extent to which international\nrelations would develop during the next half-century? No\ndoubt, a number of geopolitical structural changes will\noccur in the coming century as well.\nAt the threshold of the twenty-first century, this\nsession of the General Assembly could well prove to be a\nturning point by providing a forum for reconfiguring the\narchitecture and priorities of the Organization. Facing a new\narray of challenges, this session should point the way\ntowards a brighter future and a renewed sense of optimism.\nTogether, we can forge a stronger United Nations and,\nthrough it, the foundation for a century of peace, prosperity\nand justice. The Republic of Korea stands ready to do its\ndue part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the fifty-\nsecond session of the General Assembly. I also thank our\noutgoing President, Mr. Razali Ismail, for his untiring\nefforts. He catalysed a change in our approach to Security\nCouncil reform and set a new trajectory for it.\nFor several years, we have all recognized the\nimperative of United Nations reform. Today, the issue of\nthe moment is still reform. This summer, the Secretary-\nGeneral challenged us with a package of reforms that he\naccurately described as the most extensive and far-\nreaching in the 52-year history of this Organization. This\nis, of course, not the first time a Secretary-General has\nattempted to remake this Organization. But now that the\nmore extravagant of post-cold-war hopes for the United\nNations have faded, I believe that this package represents\na more focused, realistic and practical approach. We\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for his initiative.\nThe Secretary-General's objective clearly is to enable\nthe United Nations to do better what we all require it to\ndo. We all take the United Nations importance as\naxiomatic. Therefore, his intention to reconfigure the\nUnited Nations management and strengthen the United\nNations ability to perform its core functions should be\ngenerally acceptable to the majority, even if every\nparticular element of his proposals has not been fully\nelaborated or may not be entirely to everyone's taste.\nIn the larger interests of this Organization, we should\nall welcome the thrust of the Secretary-General's\nproposals and not take issue with too many details.\nSingapore adopts such an approach. We have, for\nexample, questions about some specific details of his\nproposals to place the United Nations finances on a\nsounder footing and to streamline its operations. But we\nhave nonetheless contributed actively to the effort to\nstreamline budgetary and administrative procedures in the\nSecretariat and will continue to do so.\nBy taking a pragmatic and eclectic approach, we\nhope to help move the reform process forward, even if we\nmay have questions on specific aspects. We will continue\nto work with the Secretary-General and other Member\nStates to make the United Nations a more efficient and\neffective Organization \u2014 one that will serve the interests\nof all its Members, big and small, developing as well as\nindustrialized.\nThe Secretary-General's proposals on the United\nNations management, administration and structure have\nsometimes been directly or indirectly linked to the\nongoing effort by Member States to prepare the United\nNations political leadership for the twenty-first century\nthrough Security Council reform. We are not confident\nthat this is the correct approach. We have been engaged\nin this broader effort for almost four years. It is a fact\nthat the process has been difficult. Progress has been\nslow. We have reached the conclusion that the prospects\nfor further progress are not good.\n9\n\n\nWe have arrived at this conclusion with great\nreluctance and without rancour. Progress has not been slow\nbecause of the ill will of one State or another. Prospects for\nfurther progress are dim not merely because one country or\nanother has lacked the will to cut through the web of vested\ninterests. The reasons are more fundamental. They go\nbeyond the volitions and intentions of individual countries\nand are embedded in the nature and inescapable realities of\ninternational organization in an international system that is\nstill largely defined by relations between sovereign States.\nNo great Power, or even a Power with aspirations to\ngreatness, has ever been willing to submit its own vital\ninterests to United Nations jurisdiction. This fact of\ninternational life underlies the current reform stalemate. The\nnecessity of United Nations reform may be widely\naccepted. But what the great Powers want is not a strong\nUnited Nations per se. They want a United Nations just\nstrong and credible enough to serve as an effective\ninstrument of their will and policies. It is only small\ncountries that are more inclined to take the United Nations\non its own terms and in its own right. Small countries are\nnot necessarily more virtuous \u2014 we merely have fewer\noptions.\nThis reality has been underscored by our discussions\non Security Council reform. The really crucial decisions\nthat will allow Security Council reform to move decisively\nforward or stall it indefinitely are going to be taken in\nWashington, London, Paris, Beijing or Moscow. It has not\nbeen clear that the current permanent members really want\nchange except on their own terms and in circumstances that\nwill not erode their current status and prerogatives. Critical\nambiguities in their positions have held up progress and\nwill continue to do so unless clarified.\nOne school of thought is that we should decide on\nSecurity Council reform during this General Assembly. I\ncan well sympathize with the frustrations of those who feel\nthat the current debate is going nowhere. But precisely\nbecause this is so, we need to ask: What is it that we are\ngoing to decide upon? The answer is far from clear. Indeed,\nthe entire Security Council reform process is in danger of\nbeing lost in a wilderness of logical contradictions and\nambiguities. Please permit me to spell out some of these\ncontradictions and ambiguities.\nSeveral permanent members have been categoric only\nin their desire to see Japan and Germany as new permanent\nmembers. Many other countries, including my own, would\nagree that, when general agreement is reached on the\nexpansion of the Security Council, Japan and Germany\nshould be new permanent members. But an equally large\nnumber of countries, and I believe Japan and Germany\nare among them, would also agree that any general\nagreement on expansion must include some developing\ncountries as new permanent members to reflect new\ninternational realities.\nOn this point most permanent members have been\nfar less clear. When challenged, several of them have\nrecently for the first time conceded that in addition to\nJapan and Germany they would in principle be willing to\naccept three permanent seats for developing nations from\nthe regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America. This is\nwelcome progress. Nevertheless, important ambiguities\nstill remain.\nHow will the three developing countries be chosen?\nIt has been suggested that individual countries be chosen\nby a two-thirds vote of the membership as a whole. It has\nalso been suggested that they could be subject to some\nsystem of rotation within the regions.\nBoth, however, are problematic concepts. Can a\ncountry really legitimately represent a region if it is\nchosen outside the region? Will the two-thirds\nmembership prescribed by the Charter really be\nsufficiently familiar with conditions outside their own\nrespective regions to make an informed and legitimate\nchoice, binding on regions of which they are not\nmembers? Then, conceptually, is it not inherently\ncontradictory for a member to be said to be permanent\nbut nonetheless be subject to rotation? Who will such a\nmember represent: its own national interests or the\nregion's interests? Can it really represent the latter?\nIndeed, what is the regional interest? How will it be\ndetermined? Is the regional interest necessarily\nsynonymous with the interests of the larger members of\na region? Can a rotational system work for any region\nexcept Africa, where it is already an established\nprinciple?\nNone of these questions will be easy to answer.\nThey have been debated for the last three years without\nsatisfactory answers. But unless there are clear answers,\nmy concern is that suggestions for a differentiated\nselection process for permanent members from among the\nnewly industrialized and newly developing countries will\nonly lead to permanent stress, divisions and conflict for\nmost regions, or it will lead to a two-stage decision-\nmaking process where the elevation of Germany and\nJapan will not for many years, if ever, be matched by any\ndegree of consensus for the developing nations of Asia,\n10\n\n\nAfrica and Latin America. Such a discriminatory situation\nwould be clearly unacceptable to a majority of Member\nStates, including many of those that aspire to permanent\nstatus.\nBut even if we could simultaneously reach agreement\non the identity of the three permanent members from\namong the developing countries, together with Japan and\nGermany, there are further complexities of equal\nimportance. What will be the status of the new permanent\nmembers?\nEven those current permanent members that have\nstrongly supported Germany's and Japan's aspirations have\nbeen silent on whether Germany and Japan should have the\nveto. Even treaty allies of Japan and Germany, countries\nthat have pledged to go to war at their side and for them,\nhave taken no position on this crucial question. This, in our\nview, makes it even more difficult to believe that any\ndeveloped country permanent member would ever allow\nany developing country to acquire the veto, even though\nthey have made it clear that they want to retain unrestricted\nuse of the veto for themselves.\nThe powers of new permanent members are not\nquestions that can be deferred to a later date merely to\nmake it easier to quickly determine the identity of the new\npermanent members. They are intrinsic to the very notion\nand definition of permanent membership. Is a new\npermanent member really a permanent member if it does\nnot have the same powers as the original five permanent\nmembers?\nArticle 27 has been controversial from the very\nfounding of the United Nations. There is now a wide\nconsensus that the use of the veto should be curtailed with\na view to its eventual abolition. The reality, of course, is\nthat this is not going to happen any time soon. Any attempt\nto curtail the veto will be vetoed. Undemocratic though it\nmay be, the veto will be with us for the foreseeable future.\nAnd it is not without a certain utility in so far as it helps\nprevent conflicts among the major Powers which could\nundermine the United Nations. It has been argued that the\nveto acts as a fail-safe mechanism. The veto will prevent\nthose countries that are so essential to the maintenance of\npeace and security and to the operation of the United\nNations that they deserve permanent status from being\ncompelled to take any action that would lead to conflicts\namong themselves.\nNow, if this justification for the retention of the veto\nby the original five permanent members has any validity,\nthen the question that arises is whether any new\npermanent member that is not given the veto is really\ndeserving of that status? Would such countries really\nenjoy the international stature and the capability and clout\nto make such a crucial contribution to international peace\nand security as to warrant being given permanent status?\nAnd if not, why give them permanent status? Could they\nnot make financial and other contributions to the United\nNations in some other, way as many countries with no\nsuch aspirations already do? If there is a need for new\npermanent members, and I believe there is a need, then\nthe veto is not a question that can be postponed or\ndiscussed separately from the issue of their identities.\nThree out of the five current permanent members\nhave also been adamantly opposed to the expansion of the\nSecurity Council beyond a total of 20 or 21 members.\nThis effectively blocks any expansion of the Security\nCouncil.\nLet us suppose that agreement is reached on the\nidentity of the five new permanent members: Japan and\nGermany and three from the developing countries,\nwhichever they may be. But if the current permanent\nmembers that argue against an expansion of the Security\nCouncil beyond 21 members remain firm in their position,\nthis would mean only one additional non-permanent seat\nfor the 165 remaining members of the United Nations, all\nof which have a desire and a right to serve the United\nNations on the Security Council at least occasionally. This\ninequitable arrangement would certainly be rejected by\nthe majority. Moreover, creating five new permanent\nmembers in a Security Council of 21 will seriously upset\nthe present balance between permanent seats and non-\npermanent seats. This is also a situation which will not be\nacceptable to the majority of the Member States. It will\ncertainly not command the support of the two thirds of\nthe membership required by the Charter to effect any\nchange to the Security Council's present composition.\nThose that have argued for an expansion of the\nSecurity Council to no more than 21 members have done\nso on the grounds that this is the maximum number that\ncan function effectively and efficiently. These are\nconcerns that we should all share. Nobody wants an\nineffective or inefficient Security Council. But no one has\nyet made a convincing argument that a Security Council\nof, say, 26 members, as has been proposed by the Non-\nAligned Movement, would be any less efficient or\neffective than a Security Council of 21. This is of course\nassuming that effectiveness and efficiency are not\nnarrowly defined as merely making it more difficult for\n11\n\n\nany of the current permanent members and their allies to\nensure that nobody can prevent them from having their own\nway.\nIn any case, can we really decide on the effectiveness\nand efficiency of an expanded Security Council before we\nknow what the powers of the new permanent members are\ngoing to be? This leads us into a tautological situation. We\ncannot know how an expanded Security Council consisting\nof an expanded number of permanent members will operate\nbecause, as I argued a moment ago, the definition of what\nconstitutes a new permanent member cannot be separated\nfrom the question of the veto. And the current permanent\nmembers have refused to pronounce on this. At this point,\neffectiveness and efficiency as an argument against a\nSecurity Council of more than 21 breaks down completely.\nI could go on with my analysis. But I hope I have\ndemonstrated that several critical aspects of the positions of\nthe major countries on Security Council reform need further\nclarification before progress can be made. I do not believe\nthat the ambiguities and contradictions are going to be\nresolved soon. They are the natural consequence of\nsovereign States pursuing their national interests.\nThe position of permanent members will have a\ndecisive influence on whether or not Security Council\nreform moves forward. As things presently stand, it seems\nclear that what will not evoke a veto from any of the\ncurrent permanent members will not command the support\nof the two-thirds membership required to make the\nnecessary Charter changes. At the same time, what would\nattract the support of the vast majority of United Nations\nMembers is more likely than not to provoke a veto. This is\nwhere, like it or not, we currently stand.\nA similar case could be made on the closely related\nquestion of financial reform. This too, has its own deep\ncomplexities; its own intrinsic contradictions between what\nwould be acceptable to the majority and what the major\nPowers want. Not every change is necessarily for the better.\nWe should therefore make progress cautiously, especially\non such fundamental questions. This is why the Non-\nAligned Movement has wisely decided that efforts at\nrestructuring the Security Council should not be subject to\nany imposed time-frame.\nOf course, there has been an evolution in the positions\nof the major Powers over the last four years. There will be\nfurther positive changes over time. But it will certainly take\ntime. No country readily changes the status quo if it\nbenefits from the status quo.\nMy point is therefore that, given this reality, it\nwould be a historic mistake to artificially link the\nSecretary-General's managerial, administrative and\nstructural reforms to far more contentious questions of\nSecurity Council or other matters that would require the\nsupport of the two-thirds membership needed to effect\nCharter amendments as defined in Article 108. There is\nno need to handicap ourselves in this way. Not all aspects\nof the Secretary-General's proposals are equally\nacceptable to all Members. But, taken as a whole, it will\nbe far easier to reach a general agreement on more\naspects of the Secretary-General's proposals if they are\nconsidered in themselves and not linked to more\npoliticized and therefore more intractable questions.\nThis is not to say that Security Council or financial\nreforms are unimportant. Of course, they are important.\nWe should continue to work on them. The issues I have\nraised are complex. But there is no avoiding them. I\nremain confident that with patience and sincerity we will\neventually find our way out of the thickets of ambiguity\ninto which we have wandered. I am confident that we will\neventually succeed in our common endeavour to enhance\nthe ability of the Security Council to exercise leadership\nin the management of global affairs and enhance its\nlegitimacy to do so.\nBut this is only one facet of United Nations reform.\nThe Security Council is not necessarily the only United\nNations body that is important, nor even always the most\nimportant. The Security Council is empowered to act on\nbehalf of the membership as a whole on questions of\ninternational peace and security. It has no direct mandate\nto act on behalf of the membership as a whole on many\nother urgent international questions. International peace\nand security are no longer the only definition of high\ninternational politics. Development and the environment\nare two areas that are obvious and of increasing\nimportance. Such issues in which the Security Council is\nnot the lead United Nations body have risen in\nprominence on the post-cold-war international agenda.\nThey will remain high priorities for the majority. There\ncan be no legitimate leadership role for the United\nNations that does not deal with such issues.\nHerein lies the critical importance of the Secretary-\nGeneral's proposals. They can make an immediate and\ntangible difference to issues affecting the entire\ninternational community which are beyond the scope of\nthe Security Council. Action on the Secretary-General's\nproposals, therefore, should not have to await general\nagreement on Security Council reform. By focusing on\n12\n\n\nhis proposals, by subjecting them to a thorough and positive\ndiscussion, I believe we can move urgently needed United\nNations reforms forward at a faster pace than has hitherto\ncharacterized the reform process. And we can still remain\nseized of, but not hostage to, issues that may take more\ntime to command general agreement or that require Charter\namendment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to begin by\ncongratulating the President on his unanimous election to\npreside over the fifty-second session of the General\nAssembly of the United Nations. It is my hope that at this\nsession the Assembly will be successful in bringing nations\ncloser to each other and in finding ways to address the\nchallenges that face all countries and nations, north and\nsouth, east and west.\nI also wish to congratulate his predecessor,\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for the manner in\nwhich he carried out his duties.\nWe mark this year the twentieth anniversary of the\npeace initiative of the late Prime Minister of Israel,\nMenachem Begin, and the late President of Egypt, Anwar\nSadat. Those leaders, with their historic decision and their\ncourageous leadership, pioneered the way towards the first\npeace treaty between Israel and an Arab neighbour, Egypt.\nThroughout their entire history, the people of Israel\nhave aspired to live in peace. Together with our constant\ncall for peace with our neighbours, we have not spared any\neffort to seek, whether through direct or indirect contacts,\na partner in this effort. Today, too, we continue to seek\nchannels for dialogue and to build bridges to peace.\nIn recent years, since 1991, after the principles for\nnegotiating peace in the Middle East were laid down at\nMadrid, we have achieved a number of important\nadvances with the establishment of full peace between\nIsrael and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the\nsigning of interim accords with the Palestinians.\nNevertheless, the road to full peace is still long, and\nnegotiations with the Palestinians and with Syria and\nLebanon still lie ahead of us.\nImmediately after the last elections, the Government\nof Israel accepted the need to continue to advance the\nOslo accords and has acted to implement them. In the\npast year we have spared no effort to implement those\naccords, but, unfortunately, the trust that is the lifeblood\nof the entire process has been undermined as a result of\nthe failure of the Palestinians to carry out their\ncommitments according to the agreements they have\nsigned.\nIn the past year, while pursuing these efforts, we\nhave endured many tests and have suffered ongoing\nterrorist attacks and bloodshed. Our deep-rooted aspiration\nfor peace, security and tranquillity has been stained by the\nshedding of innocent blood, by the murder of men,\nwomen and children cut down by barbaric terrorist\nattacks. Yet despite our deep sorrow and mourning over\nthe loss of those innocent lives, the hope for peace has\nnot been extinguished in the hearts of the citizens of\nIsrael.\nThe citizens of Israel have taken upon themselves\ngreat risks for peace, but there is none among them who\nis willing to continue to pay the bloody price that is being\ndemanded in the name of peace. We must break this\ntragic and violent cycle. It is only through joint action in\nconfronting the terror that trust will be re-established and\nthe doubts regarding intentions be removed.\nAs I stated in my remarks at the fifty-first session of\nthis Assembly, all Israel is united in its deep desire for\npeace and for a life of calm and security. In Israel, both\nright and left are united in this quest.\nIf trust can be restored, if the principle of reciprocity\nis honoured, it will be possible for us to proceed. We\nhave already proved our willingness to do so, through our\ndecisions and actions since taking office and in the\nsigning and implementation of the Hebron agreement in\nall its aspects.\nPeace cannot live side by side with continued\nincitement, hostility, violence and terror. Peace means, in\nessence, the unequivocal and irreversible abandonment of\n25\n\n\nviolence. Dialogue, negotiation, compromise and the\nhonouring of agreements \u2014 those are the path to peace.\nThese principles apply throughout the world and must\napply also in the Middle East. The existence of two parallel\ntracks, one on which negotiations are pursued while a\nsecond track of violence, terror and bloodshed continues\nunimpeded, is totally unacceptable. This is a direct\nchallenge and affront to the very concept of peace.\nTerror does not suddenly erupt from nowhere. It is not\na spontaneous phenomenon. Too often we have seen\nterrorist leaders and their organizations adopt the facade of\ninnocent and peaceful organizations, charitable and welfare\norganizations, while under this cover they contribute to the\npreparation and perpetration of vicious terrorist attacks.\nTerror can be likened to a volcano ready to erupt at any\nmoment, whose boiling lava threatens to destroy all who lie\nin its path.\nThose who resort to terror are seeking not only to kill\nIsraelis but also to hurt their own brethren. Terror cannot be\naccepted as a legitimate tool for resolving differences. It\nmust be rejected, absolutely and unequivocally, and it must\nbe fought unrelentingly. We will not agree to live under its\nconstant threat.\nThe words of the President of the United States and of\nthe Foreign Minister of Russia at this Assembly just a few\ndays ago are important and should guide us all in this\nmatter. I quote President Clinton when he spoke from this\nvery rostrum:\n\u201cterrorism is always a crime and never a justifiable\npolitical act.\u201d [See Official Records of the General\nAssembly, Fifty-second Session, Plenary Meetings, 5th\nmeeting]\nThus, the international community bears the responsibility\nfor ensuring that terrorism enjoys no political support,\nrecognition or legitimacy, not even implicitly.\nIn the 1993 Oslo accords, the Palestinian Authority\nand Arafat, its leader, undertook in the name of the\nPalestinian people to fight terrorism. They reaffirmed this\ncommitment again in the 1995 Interim Agreement, again\none year ago at the Washington summit and again in the\nHebron agreement. Much to our consternation, it has been\nproved that this commitment has not been upheld as\nrequired, thus causing the present crisis of confidence.\nIsrael stands firmly upon its call to the Palestinian\nAuthority to fulfil its promise to fight relentlessly against\nterror. The Authority must act jointly and in full\ncooperation with us against terrorism and violence. We\nseek neither to dictate nor to coerce. We seek merely the\nimplementation of signed agreements. The fight against\nterror, in our humble opinion, is also in the Palestinian\ninterest.\nIn response to the repeated crises in the process\ncaused by the failure of the Palestinian Authority to live\nup to its commitments, Israel proposes a binding code of\nconduct for relations between us. This code should\ninclude, first, the rejection of violence as a means for\nachieving political goals; secondly, preservation of the\nframework of direct negotiations and agreement to refrain\nfrom attempts to transfer disputes and negotiations onto\nthe international stage; thirdly, the institutionalization of\npermanent channels of communication, including in times\nof crisis; fourthly, a cessation of incitement and the call\nto violence and jihad, and their replacement with the\nlanguage of reconciliation and mutual respect; and, fifthly,\nthe advancement and encouragement of normalization and\nsupport for regional activities.\nThe purpose of this code of conduct is to facilitate\nuninterrupted negotiations and crisis management, and to\ncreate an atmosphere of dialogue. This code must respond\nto the sensitivities and needs of both sides. We believe\nthat the adoption of the above principles will allow us to\novercome the present crisis and help in preventing future\nones as the negotiations proceed. These rules of the game\nwill also contribute to renewed trust between the leaders\nand greater confidence between the peoples.\nIn the wake of the visit to the Middle East of the\nUnited States Secretary of State, renewed agreement has\nbeen reached to continue the efforts at restoring the peace\nprocess to its proper track. We have been conducting\nintensive talks in recent days, with the assistance of the\nUnited States, both in Washington and here, with a view\nto resuming the negotiations and advancing our efforts to\nreach a permanent settlement with the Palestinians.\nIsrael values and appreciates the action of the United\nStates Secretary of State and her commitment and efforts\nto extricate the peace process from its current impasse, to\nbring the parties closer together and to ensure the success\nof the negotiations. We are fully committed to these\nefforts.\n26\n\n\nIsrael reaffirms its proposal to conduct accelerated\nnegotiations, according to an agreed timetable, on\npermanent status. We propose conducting negotiations in\nwhich the sides will agree upon the desired outcomes and\nthe way towards achieving them. This proposal is intended\nto hasten the attainment of a peaceful settlement, not to\ndelay it. This is also our call and our proposal to the\nPalestinian Authority.\nThe international community can play an important\nrole in facilitating the dialogue between the sides, which\nwill make it possible for us to resolve our differences\nthrough direct negotiations. It is only through direct\nnegotiations that we can bring this process to a successful\nconclusion. One-sided international declarations, dictates or\npressures will not help. Attempts to internationalize the\ndispute and to transfer the arena of negotiations to the\nUnited Nations and other international forums only serve to\ncreate unnecessary obstacles and to make already\nentrenched positions more rigid.\nThe comprehensive peace we yearn for will not be\nachieved until we reach peace agreements with Syria and\nLebanon. It is imperative to reach understandings and\nagreement that will enable us to renew negotiations and to\nresolve all the matters at issue between us. We expect to\nfind in Syria and its leadership a partner in the search for\na just peace. If Syria has indeed made a strategic choice in\nfavour of peace \u2014 the \u201cpeace of the brave\u201d, as claimed by\nits leadership \u2014 then we must explore together every\npossible avenue, at any place and at any time, for renewing\nthe talks between us.\nIsrael cannot accept the continued violence and terror\non its northern border. The terrorist activities of\norganizations such as Hezbollah and the fear of Katyusha\nrockets and attacks upon our cities and towns bear the\nthreat of ongoing regional tension and continued bloodshed.\nThere is no territorial dispute between Israel and Lebanon.\nWe wish to see a sovereign, free and independent Lebanon\nacting determinedly against the terrorist organizations that\noperate from its territory.\nIf we are to reach peace, we cannot make do only\nwith agreements and contracts. The reality of peace means\nnormalization, open borders, freedom of movement,\ncommerce and cooperation for the benefit of the entire\nregion. These are the soul and essence of peace.\nNormalization is not a prize or a gift for Israel alone.\nThe decisions of the Foreign Ministers of the Arab\nLeague at their recent meeting in Cairo, just over one week\nago, stand in direct contradiction to the aspirations for\npeace and undermine its foundations. The attempts to\nprevent normalization with Israel, to freeze the level of\nexisting relations with it, to close liaison and interests\noffices between Israel and Arab neighbours and to\nreactivate the Arab boycott add up, in practice, to a\nboycott of peace itself. This is a destructive policy which\nis reversing the process.\nThe ongoing and intentional freeze of the\nmultilateral talks also has a deleterious effect on the\nentrenchment of peace. The multilateral talks were meant\nand should serve as a platform and incentive for building\npeace. We must promote the bilateral and multilateral\nchannels alike and not make one conditional upon the\nother, nor create further obstacles and barriers on the road\nto peace. The question mark hanging over the regional\neconomic conference scheduled to take place later this\nyear in Doha, Qatar, is further evidence of this negative\ndrive.\nThe countries of the Middle East that are party to\nthe peace effort have a common interest in regional\nstability and the advancement of prosperity and well-\nbeing for all the nations of the region. We face together\nthe growing shortage of water and the ever-expanding\ndesert. We are also facing dangers from within our region\nthat threaten to undermine the stability of the regimes of\nvarious nations and to plunge the entire region into\nviolence, war and bloodshed.\nIt was only a few years ago that the entire world\nwas forced into forming a coalition to combat an\naggressive dictator who sought to conquer a neighbouring\ncountry and to terrorize our entire region. Today, we face\nnew and even more extreme dangers, but the lessons of\nrecent experience have not been learned and many\ncountries turn a blind eye to the threat.\nThe leadership of Iran continues to speak in terms\nthat threaten the State of Israel and call for its destruction.\nYet the international community continues to remain deaf\nand refuses to speak out against Iran's policies,\ndeclarations and actions.\nIran's efforts, like those of Iraq, to acquire\noperational weapons of mass destruction of all kinds\nrepresent the greatest threat to security and stability in the\nMiddle East and beyond. The ramifications of Iran's\nweapons programme extend far beyond the geographical\nconfines of our region. They threaten the security of other\n27\n\n\nmembers of the international community and their interests.\nIsrael reiterates its call to the members of the\ninternational family of nations \u2014 and at their head the\nUnited States, Russia and the members of the European\nUnion and of the Commonwealth of Independent States \u2014\nto exercise the full weight of their influence and to take\nconcrete steps to prevent this development, which\nrepresents a threat to the existence of the State of Israel.\nAfter the establishment, as we hope, of peace treaties\nbetween Israel and every country of the region, it will be\npossible to create a regional security system that would\nprovide multilateral and shared solutions to the range of\nsecurity problems in the Middle East, including a mutually\nand effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical,\nbiological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. These\nare our goals and we must act to achieve them.\nIsrael is an active and responsible member of the\nfamily of nations represented in this body. However, 50\nyears after the United Nations adopted, on 29 November\n1947, the resolution calling for the establishment of the\nState of Israel, we are still denied our equal rights in this\nOrganization.\nWe attach great importance to the fundamental reform\nof the United Nations work. We also share the opinion of\nother United Nations Member countries that believe that the\nOrganization urgently requires greater efficiency and a\nredirecting of its valuable but limited resources towards its\ntruly important tasks. At the same time, we are convinced\nthat no reform can be completed so long as the question of\nIsrael's membership of a regional group remains unresolved.\nWe call upon this Organization to correct this anomaly.\nMuch to our chagrin, in the last year we have seen an\nintensification of the political campaign waged against\nIsrael at the United Nations. This campaign only impedes\nthe peace process and further undermines confidence\nbetween the parties. We call upon the Member States to\nrefrain from lending their support to such resolutions. The\ntime has come for this Assembly to reduce the number of\nresolutions on the Middle East that it adopts each year and\nto contribute positively to creating an atmosphere conducive\nto direct negotiations between the parties.\nAs part of Israel's international and regional\ncommitment and of its credo as a State, we are engaged in\ncooperative programmes with many countries, with which\nwe share the experience and knowledge we have acquired\nin various fields. Israel attaches great importance to its\ninternational cooperation programme and to assisting\nvarious peoples to address the challenges of development\nand the hazards of nature, hunger and disease.\nOver more than three decades, tens of thousands of\ntrainees have participated in courses in Israel and in their\nown countries within the framework of Israel's\ncooperation and assistance programme in the fields of\neducation, health, agriculture, industry, social affairs and\nleadership. We are especially proud of the participation in\nrecent years of trainees from Arab countries, amongst\nthem Palestinians. These trainees are emissaries of\ngoodwill, ambassadors of peace, who bear with them the\nmessage and the great hope of human well-being. As in\nthe words of the prophet:\n\u201cEach shall help his neighbour and make him\nstrong\u201d.\nThis year, the Jewish people in Israel and around the\nworld marks the jubilee of its national revival. Fifty years\nago, the Jewish people restored its national sovereignty in\nits ancient homeland. Throughout the dark days of our\n2,000-year dispersion, we dreamt of the day that we\nwould renew our national life in the land of our\nforefathers, the land of Israel.\nIt is the privilege of our generation to fulfil this\naspiration. The Jewish people has returned and built up its\nland. The Jewish people is once again gathering in its\nancient home and has succeeded in building a vibrant\nand democratic society, a flourishing economy, science,\nresearch and industry.\nFor the past 50 years, we have laboured to ensure\nIsrael's security and independence, while always seeking\npeace and good-neighbourly relations in our region. Fifty\nyears on, the State of Israel is an irremovable reality.\nThis week, we mark the beginning of the Jewish\nnew year. At this holy time, every Jew turns his eye\ntowards the heavens with a prayer in his heart for the\npeace of the world, the end of misery and a new dawn of\nhope for all. On this day of remembrance, the blow of the\nshofar is accompanied by the prayer:\n\u201cmay the year and its troubles pass and a new year\nand its blessings begin\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe fifty-\nsecond anniversary of the United Nations is yet another\nhistoric moment for us all. Our shared presence here is\nevidence that as Members of this great institution we have\nan opportunity to realize our collective aspirations and\nexpectations. It is necessary therefore for the Organization\nto ensure that the concerns of Member States, particularly\nthose in the developing world, are not compromised or\nseen as secondary to the process.\nIt is essential that the United Nations become a\ncatalyst for improving the quality of life of our citizens\nand a champion of our fundamental rights and freedoms.\nSuch challenges will require much commitment and\nstrategic thinking. I believe that if we succeed we will\nhave laid the foundation for peace and international\nsecurity for generations to come.\nWith our nations and peoples standing at the\ncrossroads of tremendous change, and with heightened\n\n\nexpectations in the fields of human development and\npoverty eradication, the United Nations must be allowed to\nassume an even greater role. Saint Kitts and Nevis\nmaintains that the United Nations has the necessary\ninstitutional capacity to encompass our collective ambitions\nand simultaneously to resolve many of the problems facing\nnation-States.\nIn the light of the fundamental importance which my\nGovernment attaches to a reformed, more functional United\nNations, we welcome the appointment of His Excellency\nMr. Kofi Annan as Secretary-General. His commitment to\nand wide experience in this institution will help provide the\nUnited Nations with the crucial leadership it needs at this\ncritical juncture in the Organization s history.\nAs we march into a new millennium, with its\nincreasing uncertainties and complexities, the United\nNations and its membership will have to recommit\nthemselves to human development in all its facets.\nOtherwise we will have failed in this decade to accomplish\nour mandate of poverty eradication.\nThe growing reduction in much-needed aid and\ntechnical assistance to the developing world threatens the\nfurther marginalization of our poor countries. This means\nthat countries will grow to depend more on the United\nNations. We therefore urge the United Nations to work\nmore closely with developing countries to devise new ideas\nand pragmatic approaches to improve the standard of living\nof the world's poor. This reality, we think, lends greater\nurgency to the Secretary-General's proposals for reform. In\nthis regard, the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis\nencourages wide discussion of the extensive and far-\nreaching reform proposals with the aim of arriving at\nconsensus.\nWe believe that it is vital to restructure and\nconsolidate some of the different areas of services that the\nUnited Nations provides. However this must herald real\nchange and increased benefit for Member States. We cannot\nsupport a mere transfer of resources from one organ to\nanother without proper safeguards to ensure efficiency and\naccountability. In the same vein, we hope that development\nreforms will not sacrifice the effectiveness and\ndistinctiveness of existing organs. In order for the\ndeveloping world to achieve sustainable growth, we need\nthe expertise, we need the resources and we need the\ninstitutional capabilities of existing United Nations funds\nand programmes.\nAs we work towards greater efficiency in the\nmanagement and administration of services, it is\nimportant not to undermine positive past achievements.\nMember States must refrain from marrying\nconditionalities to the process of reform, especially when\nthese very conditionalities hinder substantial progress in\nthe reform process itself. Saint Kitts and Nevis therefore\nsuggests that in order for reforms to work they must of\nnecessity balance and protect the interests of Member\nStates, not simply appear to reward or benefit a privileged\nfew. Reform is not about creating mechanisms that\nmerely restructure the obligations of States to the\nOrganization. Reform should not be used as an\nopportunity to compensate current economic strength.\nDecisions on permanent and non-permanent membership,\nas part of the reform process, should be the result of a\nprocess of debate and consensus-building.\nMy delegation expects to see greater emphasis on\ngeographic representation and on correcting old\ninequalities that continue to plague us today. Saint Kitts\nand Nevis appeals to all States to be careful not to\nconfuse the need for genuine systemic reforms with\nlegally assessed financial obligations to the Organization.\nNations demanding reform should also be willing to\nreform incongruous attitudes and perceptions of the\nUnited Nations. We must honour all our responsibilities\nto the Organization. Progress will require that we all work\nmore closely together to confront the multitude of\ncomplicated problems, old and new.\nTo this end, let us challenge ourselves to find\ncommon ground and assist the United Nations in\ndeveloping the appropriate ideas and strategies that\npromote our common agenda. This may not be easy;\nhence the Organization will need to establish a mutually\nbeneficial relationship between policy makers in\nGovernment and the business community.\nOn this note, I should like to acknowledge the\nmagnificent contribution of Mr. Ted Turner to this\nOrganization. He has shown himself to be an exceptional\ninternational citizen. We trust that this humanitarian\ngesture of support for the Organization and its work will\nmake a noticeable impact on the areas designated, and\nthat it will challenge others of like mind to demonstrate\ntheir support for the Organization as well.\nThis show of support is a reminder that only the\nUnited Nations can provide the kind of impartial and\ncomprehensive leadership that Member States want. Only\nthe United Nations, with 50 years of successes and\n2\n\n\nfailures as a world institution, has the unique experience to\ndevelop essential capabilities to serve its membership. The\nUnited Nations has the competitive edge. A United Nations\nreformed to deal with the modern challenges of a modern\nera can work, but only if it is allowed to work.\nI appreciate well the power of national imperatives and\nindividualism. I also understand well the concerns about\nsupranational institutions. Nevertheless, we have come too\nfar to surrender our global destiny to fear and\nmisconceptions.\nWhen we speak of the development of the human\nperson yet fail to appreciate that economic rights are as\nfundamental to human dignity as are human rights, we do\ngreat disservice to the cause of human rights. However,\nwhen we acknowledge these rights then we give more\nsubstance to social stability and the process of true\ndemocracy.\nDemocracy is not new to the Caribbean region. It is a\nway of life, a tradition for our region. We see it as the most\npractical and useful system of government to advance our\npeople. However, democracy is not simply about\ninstitutions or processes. It is about creating an enabling\ngovernment and an enabling environment in which the\nordinary person \u2014 the impoverished, the disillusioned, the\neducated and the rich \u2014 feels included and feels that he or\nshe can participate in the decision-making process and feels\nthat his or her dreams can be truly realized.\nBecause we regard democracy as the most efficient\nand viable vehicle for sustainable human development, it\nmust deliver and be seen to deliver. The people must be\nreassured that they can and indeed will rise from the\nquicksand of poverty through the promise of development.\nIf we fail to deliver on the promise, then democracy will\nfail. If democracy fails, poverty becomes entrenched and\nchaos becomes inevitable.\nThe condition of poverty has for too long been linked\nwith the destiny of small States. The apparent ease with\nwhich both are dismissed is a source of grave concern to\nthe Government and the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\nToo little attention is being paid to the economic hardships,\npolitical disruptions and social dislocations which we are\nforced to endure as small developing States. Instead of\nseeing crucial support from the developed world, we are\nwitnessing increased tendencies towards isolationism and\nneglect.\nIn the current wave of globalization, economic\nstability has become the soft underbelly of Caribbean\nsecurity, democracy and prospects for sustainable\ndevelopment. If these economies are not strengthened and\ngiven appropriate assistance, one lays waste to the\ntremendous intellectual talents in these countries and\nexposes the political and social fabric to the nefarious\nforces that lurk in the region.\nOur small countries need institutional support and\npartnership to help in preparing our youth to adapt their\nknowledge and skills to changing world circumstances.\nSuch preparation will help make them self-sufficient and\nmore responsive to the unpredictable changes taking place\naround us.\nAdditionally, we must create jobs on a continuous\nbasis to inspire our young people and put life's basic\nneeds within reach of their parents. We must not overlook\nthe crucial link between economic growth and long-term\npolitical and social stability. Sustainable development in\nthe Caribbean is in everyone's best interest.\nMy Government does not subscribe to conspiracy\ntheories, but it is acutely aware of the ease with which we\ncan all fall victim to the conspiracy of silence and the\nconspiracy of neglect. Our economies are under siege; our\nway of life is threatened; the growth of our countries and\npeople is undermined by forces which are better able to\nexploit globalization and trade liberalization.\nNo one in good faith can accuse us of complacency.\nOur countries have worked hard to keep pace with current\neconomic trends. We have tightened fiscal and monetary\npolicies, and we are monitoring them very closely. We\nhave run the gauntlet of social and economic measures\nsupposedly structured to ensure the economic growth and\nsurvival of our various economies.\nThe road we have travelled has been a difficult one,\nand we have learned valuable lessons. Still, we continue\nto suffer exclusion from developed countries' markets for\nour various products. As a direct consequence, the private\nsector has become sceptical of its very survival and\nprofitability.\nOur banana-producing countries in the region have\nsuffered a tremendous and potentially devastating blow in\nthe wake of the recent panel ruling of the World Trade\nOrganization (WT0) on the banana regime of the African,\nCaribbean and Pacific group of States (ACP). It is\ninconceivable that the insignificant but important\n3\n\n\npercentage in access that ACP countries share in this\nmarket can pose any meaningful threat to the collaborative\ninterests of multinational producers.\nOur banana and sugar industries are major employers\nand foreign exchange earners; yet, without regard for our\nsurvival, they are being challenged with the ultimate\nobjective of dismantling them completely. At the same\ntime, we still do not have ready access to essential\ntechnologies vital to making our industries and human\nresources more competitive and more efficient.\nWe contend that trade liberalization, without the\nproper mechanisms to protect the small and the weak, does\nnot promote fair trade. Where is the fairness of fair trade?\nHow, therefore, will our small island developing States find\nnew and sustainable ways to respond to the growing needs\nof our population? How will we be able to stem the brain\ndrain, the migration of human resources searching for a\nbetter standard of living?\nOur countries have undertaken to diversify our\neconomies despite the obvious dislocations within our\nsocieties. We remain committed to democratic institutions,\nand we continuously allocate scarce resources to human\ndevelopment. Our Governments in the Caribbean have been\nworking more closely with the private sector as true\npartners in development. We have enacted legislation to\nfacilitate increased investment opportunities and to\nencourage foreign direct investment and domestic savings.\nNonetheless, with every step we seem to fall prey to\nthe perpetual and constantly evolving demands for more\nextensive changes without any regard for the effects on our\ncountries and our people. Globalization, with its insatiable\nappetite, and the ravenous forces of unrestricted free market\nand trade liberalization are forever famished. Why must the\nrules which are always in a state of constant flux be to the\ndetriment of small resource-poor States?\nIn the coming years, not only will we still be\nstruggling to combat poverty, but the concepts of\nsovereignty and governance will also be seriously\nchallenged as we endeavour to cope with the complex\nimplications of forces that face our societies and menace\nour democracies. The transnational nature of information,\nof capital, of labour and of technological advances will not\nspare our tiny countries the trying consequences unleashed\nby globalization.\nDespite these difficulties, Saint Kitts and Nevis will\nnot become a nation of mendicants. We will give priority\nto the right of our citizens to economic well-being. For\nwhat good would it do if our people achieve their human\nright to exist but are denied the right to live dignified\nlives?\nThe Labour Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis\nhas undertaken to build 1,000 new, affordable homes by\nthe end of this century. We believe that all our citizens\nhave the right to live in dignity and to have access to the\nbasic necessities of life. We have already turned over 100\nnew houses, and by the end of this year we expect 300\nfamilies to be moving into new homes in Saint Kitts and\nNevis. This is the commitment of the Government of\nSaint Kitts and Nevis to the development of its citizens.\nI have said in the past, and I maintain now, that we\nmust abandon the practice of using gross national product\nper capita to measure standards of living for people in the\ndeveloping world. How can the developed world and\nmultilateral agencies deny assistance to countries on the\nbasis that such a country has reached this artificial\nthreshold? Are people in the developing world not entitled\nto a higher standard of living, or must they always\nstraddle the boundaries of poverty and exist only at levels\nwhich the developed world considers acceptable indicators\nof human progress?\nIt is important for us to dedicate our energies to the\nlogic of prevention. In Saint Kitts and Nevis we believe\nstrongly that prevention is better than cure. We believe in\nenabling our peoples to have a life free of poverty and\ndespair. The Secretary-General has called for greater\nefficiency in management, greater resource mobilization\nand redeployment of potential savings to the development\nfields. This is long overdue.\nIt is also the duty of Member States to ensure that\nnew resources are targeted at development. Such a\nprocess will have to be guided by and nourished with\nvision, political will and an appreciation of the global\nimperatives of sustainable development and poverty\neradication. It will involve foresight, profound analyses,\nand a willingness to look beyond national self-interest.\nWorking together to shape our collective destiny could\nenable us to reduce the risks of future political and social\nconflicts.\nI believe firmly that the special circumstances and\nvulnerability indices of small States must be at the\nforefront of international debate. If there were ever a\nquestion as to the vulnerability of small States, I\nchallenge the Assembly to recall the unfortunate situation\n4\n\n\non the Caribbean island of Montserrat. This reality clearly\ndemonstrates that it takes only one disaster, only one\nviolent act of nature, only one volcanic eruption to dislocate\nan entire population, decimate an entire economy and\ndestroy the entire social fabric of a people. The\nGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis, like other Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM) countries, has extended a willing\nhand of health and social support to the people of\nMontserrat. We continue to provide employment and other\nbusiness opportunities to those who have come to our\nshores in Saint Kitts and Nevis from the island of\nMontserrat. I urge the international community to join the\nCaribbean in taking prompt, decisive and tangible steps to\nassist the people of Montserrat.\nMontserrat is a microcosm of our precarious existence.\nHence, we urge the international community to fulfil its\npromises under the Barbados Programme of Action and\nother commitments to the developing world. Our survival\nas a region is intimately interwoven with our environment,\nand our physical and economic limitations should not be\nfurther burdened by the transshipment of hazardous waste\nthrough our waterways. Such actions are a flagrant violation\nof our human rights and an affront to our sovereign dignity.\nAs we work to fulfil the dreams of those who came\nbefore us, I trust that we will succeed in developing\nconfidence in the capabilities of the United Nations and\nentrust it with realizing our common objectives. At the\nsame time, there will be occasions when we must challenge\nourselves to appreciate that some problems in international\naffairs require indigenous approaches and remedies. We\nmust, therefore, yield to such imperatives.\nOne case in point is the Middle East, where the\ncurrent crisis calls for a nurturing of mutual trust and a\nclear willingness to understand the need for all the parties\nto come to the bargaining table. Saint Kitts and Nevis\nbelieves that durable peace and security are the common\ndesires of the nations involved. Success requires boldness\nand commitment. Genuine progress will come not from\nviolence, recrimination and mistrust, but through partnership\nand dialogue. Saint Kitts and Nevis urges both sides to use\nnegotiation and creative confidence-building measures in\naddressing their differences\nSaint Kitts and Nevis also urges the Chinese people on\nboth sides of the Taiwan Strait to commit their collective\nenergies to the pursuit of common approaches to resolving\nthe current impasse that divides them. The Government of\nSaint Kitts and Nevis maintains that progress on this issue\nrequires sustained dialogue, political will and the goodwill\nof all. We also believe that the remarkable strides the\nChinese people on Taiwan have made in the last two\ndecades should not be squandered. The international\ncommunity can benefit, and stands to benefit significantly,\nfrom the economic, technological and social advances of\nTaiwan.\nIn conclusion, fulfilling the expectations of our\ncitizens is not a simple task, but we cannot and must not\nbecome discouraged. I hope, therefore, that as we\nendeavour to accomplish our goals Member States will\nnot continue to make unreasonable demands on this\nOrganization while refusing it the requisite tools and\nresources for appropriate action. Our world needs a\nstronger United Nations. Our countries and our peoples\nneed its intellectual supervision and potential for\nimpartiality. Let us not try to relegate it to the periphery,\nlest we risk serious consequences in the future. Let us\ncommit to writing a history of which we can be proud,\nlest history should hold us in contempt for squandering\nour children's heritage. Let this session of the General\nAssembly be a watershed when collective efforts were\ntranslated into appropriate action and well-deserved\nresults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am privileged today to be able to congratulate\nthe President, on behalf of the Government of the\nRepublic of Vanuatu, on his election to preside over the\nAssembly at a period critical to the life of the\nOrganization and its role in future relations between our\ncountries and peoples. I should like to assure him of the\nfull support and cooperation my delegation and my\ncountry will lend him and his country, Ukraine, during his\nmandate.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express\nthe warmest congratulations of the Government and\npeople of Vanuatu to the President of the preceding\nsession, Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, on the\nrole he played during a period in mankind\u2019s history that\n15\n\n\nwill be noteworthy for a series of events that were\nimportant both on an international level and on various\nregional levels.\nThis is also a special opportunity for me to welcome\nthe new Secretary-General of the Organization, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, and to reiterate the support of the Republic of\nVanuatu for him in carrying out his mandate as Secretary-\nGeneral and, in particular, for the new initiatives he has\ntaken and committed himself to take in the process of\ndialogue and consultation with all Member States with\nregard to the future of the Organization.\nAfter more than 50 years of existence, the United\nNations today finds itself facing an economic and\ninternational political situation that is increasingly complex\nand particularly more difficult for small developing\ncountries in general, and especially so for the least\ndeveloped small island countries, like the Republic of\nVanuatu.\nThis situation should be recognized as one of the\nmajor challenges to the international community and one\nthat must be dealt with through more committed\ninternational cooperation, particularly favourable treatment\nbeing given to meet the specific needs of those countries\nand populations that are its victims.\nFor the Republic of Vanuatu, the highest priority\nremains the economic development and social well-being of\nits population, more than 80 per cent of whom live in rural\nareas or on islands far from the administrative and\ncommercial centre.\nThe maintenance of political stability and social\nharmony in a country depends and will continue to depend,\nfirst and foremost, on the country\u2019s orientation and\neconomic development process. The rhetoric of certain\ndevelopment partners in trying to make their technical and\nfinancial assistance contingent on the political commitment\nof government leaders and on the maintenance of peace is\nfutile with regard to the Pacific region. Such rhetoric tends\nrather to challenge the very integrity of these leaders and\ntheir commitment to socio-economic development in their\nrespective countries.\nGenuine international cooperation must not only be\nbased on the high-priority socio-economic needs of the\ndeveloping countries and on the interests of the donors; it\nmust above all be anchored firmly in respect for the\nprinciples of sovereignty and mutual acknowledgment of\nthe competence of the national political authorities in the\nexercise of their functions in office. In the framework of its\nrestructuring and in the context of new international\nchallenges, the United Nations is called upon to play a\nleading role in international cooperation on the basis of\nthese new elements.\nIn this regard, the Government of Vanuatu most\nwarmly welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative to\nestablish a special development account for the\ndeveloping country Members. I also wish to recall the\nimportance and role of regional and subregional forums\nin the process of establishing and strengthening\ninternational cooperation. In our part of the world, the\nSouth Pacific Forum and the Melanesian Spearhead\nGroup are concrete examples of such cooperation and\ntheir initiatives deserve the recognition and support of the\ninternational community.\nOn 24 October 1995, during the commemoration of\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the entry into force of the\nUnited Nations Charter, the head of the delegation of\nVanuatu declared from this rostrum the support of the\nRepublic of Vanuatu for the reform and rational\nmanagement of the United Nations system. Today, I\nreaffirm the support of my Government and congratulate\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for the courage and\ndetermination that he has demonstrated in drafting and\nimplementing this crucial reform. I fully share the\nSecretary-General\u2019s point of view when he emphasizes in\nhis report that \u201cReform is not an event; it is a process\u201d\n(A/51/950, para. 25).\nIt is well known that, throughout today\u2019s world,\nreform is also the sine qua non for a State\u2019s sustainable\neconomic and ecological growth and development.\nIndeed, the global challenges that States must face require\nthe constant review and ongoing reform of development\npolicies and of the institutions of state, in order that the\nlatter may become instruments and tools adapted to and\nhoned for the accomplishment of specific tasks, while\ncontributing to the vision of development that we have set\nfor ourselves.\nSeventeen years after attaining its independence, my\ncountry, Vanuatu, has made great social and economic\nstrides. However, the disproportionate challenges facing\na small island State such as Vanuatu determined us to\ninitiate a reform programme early this year. This global\nreform programme, as we call it, covers the formal and\ninformal economic sector as well as the public sector, in\nthe broad sense of that word. With our reform, we would\nequip our country with the means to meet the major\ndevelopment challenges of the twenty-first century and to\navoid or reduce the effects and risks, natural and\n16\n\n\notherwise, that stalk all developing countries and small\nisland States in particular.\nThis vision of the future that we have crafted for our\ncountry requires the creation of dynamic economic\nconditions in which the private sector is the major\nprotagonist. In most cases, attempts by Governments to act\ndirectly in the production of goods and services have purely\nand simply failed. It also requires the establishment and\ndevelopment of appropriate institutional machinery for\ntechnical and financial assistance that will promote the\ncreation, development and growth of private enterprise\nwhile placing greater responsibility in the individual.\nAs the General Assembly is aware, it is not enough to\ncreate conditions for the development of a dynamic private\nsector that is a driving force for growth if we seek\ndevelopment that is economically and ecologically\nsustainable and fair. Indeed, in our case, we consider the\nreform and revitalization of the State as another sine qua\nnon of this sustainable and fair development.\nHence, public administration must be made more\neffective and freed from any adverse political interference,\nallowing us thus to reestablish transparency, confidence,\nstability and the security of private investment. Our reform\nis designed above all to eliminate existing injustices and not\nto create others, which would represent failure and\nbacksliding. With our reform, we seek equitable\ndevelopment that takes into account the development needs\nof our children and of generations to come. The\nredistribution of the benefits of reform and the situation of\nwomen, children and other disadvantaged groups must be\nseriously considered in the implementation of this reform.\nGuaranteed fairness requires the assignment of the\nhighest priority to education through the allocation of\navailable resources. Only an up-to-date and high-quality\neducation will equip each individual with the necessary\nskills and allow him to satisfy his basic needs and maintain\nhis dignity.\nIt must be clear to all that the decision of the\nEconomic and Social Council on 18 July to graduate my\ncountry, the Republic of Vanuatu, from the list of least\ndeveloped countries was a surprise. I take this opportunity\nto reiterate the position of the Government of Vanuatu, as\nreflected in the official correspondence between my\nGovernment and the Secretary-General, the President of the\nEconomic and Social Council and a certain number of\nfriendly countries Members of the United Nations.\nWhile recognizing the sensitive nature of this\nquestion, the Government of Vanuatu solemnly calls on\nthis Assembly to consider putting off the question of\ngraduation to the year 2000, when the indicators for\nidentifying least developed countries will be finalized by\nthe Committee for Development Planning.\nMy Government recently launched a global reform\nprogramme and will need the full support of the donor\ncommunity in order to implement our reform and give our\ncountry the infrastructure indispensable to our growth.\nSimilarly, during the Global Conference on the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates held in Barbados, it was decided to develop\nindicators for the vulnerability index appropriate to this\ncategory of United Nations Member.\nIn this context, we consider the decision of the\nCommittee for Development Planning to be premature\nand in no way reflecting the spirit of that United Nations\nresolution. Moreover, with more than 80 per cent of our\npopulation living in the countryside on food-producing\nsubsistence agriculture; a well-paid expatriate population;\nand official development assistance equal to the State\u2019s\nannual budget and representing 20 per cent of our gross\ndomestic product, we feel that the Committee for\nDevelopment Planning\u2019s decision can only stem from a\nlack of adequate information.\nWe do not understand why least developed countries\nin the same situation as Vanuatu are treated differently\nand demand that we receive exactly the same treatment as\nany that, like us, meets two of the current identifying\nindicators for least developed countries, as laid down in\nthe Committee\u2019s report.\n(spoke in English)\nAs recognized by the Rio Conference and the Global\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small\nIsland Developing States, held in Barbados, the issue of\nenvironment and its close association with the concept of\ndevelopment has become highly complex and sensitive.\nThe convening of international conferences and the\nformulation of international treaties such as the\nFramework Convention on Climate Change are a clear\ndemonstration of the significance of environmental issues\nin our development efforts.\nSmall island countries like Vanuatu and other Pacific\nisland countries have taken some tough decisions to\n17\n\n\nintroduce restrictive measures internally in support of the\ninternational call for environment protection. They have\nalso committed their Governments and nations to the\nprinciple of instituting a legally binding instrument which\nwould guarantee the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions\nto an internationally accepted level.\nTo the Pacific island countries, particularly the low-\nlying nations, a failure to fully address the issue at hand\nand to reach an acceptable solution could put into question\nthe commitment of the international community, and could\nconstitute a great security risk for our islands and our future\ngenerations.\nThe Republic of Vanuatu recognizes the United\nNations initiatives and engagement in the globalization and\nliberalization of trade. The building up of the multilateral\ntrading system since 1995 is a manifestation and reflection\nof the United Nations effort and desire to create a global\nand uniform trading environment that is conducted and\nbased on the new rules and obligations provided in the\nMarrakesh Declaration.\nMy country has embarked on a wider process of\nconsultations to seek membership of the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO). The challenges and opportunities\noffered by this new regime are considerable, and therefore\nweaker economies like ours require time to adjust to their\neconomic policies in order to accommodate the prescribed\nobligations and requirements of the multilateral trading\nsystem.\nIn this context, we would like to develop a common\napproach through the United Nations system, as well as the\nEuropean Union, as our partners, in coming to terms with\nthe demands and obligations of the newly established\nmultilateral trading system. While all of us, in particular\nsmall islands and least developed States, recognize the need\nto come to terms with the World Trade Organization, we\ncannot and should not allow ourselves to be unduly\npressured by its demands on these matters where we need\nto protect our trade preferences and interests.\nWhat we perceive to be negative and of less relevance\nto us in the World Trade Organization must be changed\naccording to our interests. There needs to be scope for all\nthe small and vulnerable States to be accorded sufficient\ntime to undertake reforms in trade and investment\ncompetitiveness with a view to creating a positive impact\non the economy, particularly in their efforts to source\nprivate capital flows and foreign direct investment.\nAllow me at this point to refer to the future relations\nbetween the 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific States\n(ACP) and the European Union when the current fourth\nLom\u00e9 Convention expires in the year 2000. After some\n25 years, it is important to take stock and reflect on the\nchallenges, opportunities and weaknesses of the\nConvention by reviewing the existing framework of\ncooperation. From a wider ACP perspective, there is\ngenerally a stronger desire and willingness to retain and\nstrengthen the existing framework of cooperation in the\nareas of political, economic, trade and development\nassistance.\nI would like to take this opportunity to strongly urge\nthe international community, through this fifty-second\nsession of the General Assembly, to recognize that there\nare realities which continue to warrant the need for\ncontinuity of the partnership between the ACP States and\nthe European Union beyond the year 2000.\n\nIn conclusion, allow me to reaffirm my\nGovernment\u2019s support for the process of reforming our\ngreat Organization which was begun by Mr. Kofi Annan\nin order to enable it to deal successfully with the\nchallenges of the twenty-first century."

        "file_text": "\ufeffErnesto Che Guevara, Commander, Minister and\nhead of the Cuban delegation to the nineteenth session of\nthe General Assembly, stated 33 years ago, from this very\nrostrum:\n\u201cWe wish to see this Assembly stretch its limbs\nand march forward; we want the Committees to begin\ntheir work, which should not stop at the first\nconfrontation.\u201d [Official Records of the General\nAssembly, Nineteenth Session, Plenary Meetings,\n1299th meeting, para. 81]\nAnd, as if he could already see the present, he added:\n\u201cImperialism seeks to convert this meeting into a\npointless competition in oratory, to prevent it from\nsolving the serious problems of the world; that design\nwe must frustrate.\u201d (Ibid.)\nAt that time, on our planet some 700 million people\nwere illiterate; 200 million were unemployed; and over 1\nbillion were eking out a precarious existence. That reality\ncontravened the principle that humans are the source of\ndevelopment, as well as its agents and beneficiaries, and\nshould be considered, above all, as the justification and\npurpose of development.\nAs the years went by, the situation worsened. Today,\nnot only are the industrialized nations imposing conditions\non or denying outright a meagre share of their plentiful\nresources as official development assistance for the\ndevelopment of the poorest nations, but some of them, like\nostriches, are burying their head in the sand and\ndisregarding that obligation.\nAlthough missions to Mars are widely publicized and\nassurances are given that the world economy is growing,\nthe distressing truth remains that today in the world a\nbillion people are illiterate; as many are unemployed or\nunderemployed; and more than 2 billion are living under\nsubhuman conditions.\nAmong these, we note with dismay, are the 425,000\nchildren worldwide who, since Tuesday, 16 September,\nwhen this session started, have died from preventable\ndiseases. Those 425,000 children were sacrificed in the\nname of efficiency, quality and consumption \u2014 a pattern\nof consumption that today requires an irrational and\nunsustainable development, to which those children never\neven had access.\nTime is not just slipping by; we are letting it slip\nthrough our fingers. With it, we are losing also our\nopportunities to save our planet, which is sick and beset\nin a thousand ways because the men and women who\nhave been gathering here for the last 52 years on behalf\nof our peoples have in many cases been unable\nconsistently to translate words into deeds.\nWhy, on the threshold of a new century, should we\nallow such a crime to take place? Where is that promised\nland, that higher society, that paradise craved by millions\nof human beings? How can we dream today, when the\noverwhelming majority of human beings cannot even\nsleep because violence, hunger and disease keep them\nawake?\nOver five decades ago, the nations of the world\ndecided to unite against war and to work in peace for\nprogress and cooperation among peoples. But since then,\nno one has enjoyed real and lasting peace. As many\npeople have become the victims of violence and armed\nconflicts in the wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall as\nwere killed in the 15-year Viet Nam war.\nOur memory has become so short that those same\npeople who raised their voices against the German\ncapital\u2019s concrete wall now justify, promote and even\nstand up for a 10-times larger and much more heavily\nfortified wall that would divide the poor South from the\ndeveloped North, along the Rio Grande all the way to\nBaja California, and which very few dare to denounce.\nLikewise, an absurd hypocrisy allows military\nexpenditures to be the number one business in the world,\nwith close to $900 billion in circulation, followed by drug\nsmuggling, with upwards of $500 billion, while as much\nmoney is invested in a modern bomber as would be\nrequired to relieve the foreign debt of the 20 countries\nmost heavily burdened by that scourge.\n\u201cDivide and conquer\u201d: the Roman maxim for\nsubduing the ancient world is increasingly and ever more\nforcefully becoming the slogan of the era of outer space\n27\n\n\nand information superhighways. The only form of concerted\naction that seems to be fully consolidated is the one that,\nfrom here, proposes and undertakes humanitarian\ninterventions and operations aimed at enforcing,\nmaintaining or consolidating peace and democracy in the\nwake of conflicts; preventive and early-warning actions; and\nall those various ways of disguising new wars.\nIf we fail to stop this, the upcoming third millennium\nwill not find peaceful and generous comity among nations.\nNor will it bring any closer the anticipated miracle of\nmultiplying loaves and fishes for all through development\nand rational exchange. On the contrary, consumerism,\nenvironmental deterioration, illiteracy, xenophobia,\nterrorism, drug addiction, famine, AIDS, prostitution and all\nthose visible symptoms of the human rationality\nimmunodeficiency syndrome that our planet is suffering\nfrom will devour us. Can it be, as one poet says, that\npeople are mean and undeserving and we should therefore\naccept the idea that the already foreseen end of history will\nbe followed by the end of the human race?\nIf we resign ourselves to the fact that 285 people can\npossess riches equal to the ill-apportioned wealth of 2.5\nbillion other human beings, it might be that a doomsday of\nsimilar proportions awaits us should we fail to change the\ncourse of events. Just one detail: were it not for the 2.5\nbillion people doomed to sacrifice, it would be very\nunlikely that the other 285 people could survive, regardless\nof how much more wealth they would be able to\naccumulate.\nAll these problems belong to this world, not another.\nThey are ours, as much as these \u201cDisunited Nations\u201d, which\nwe are unable to cast into a true gathering of Governments\nand peoples designed to change and save our planet.\nIn the light of these problems, many of us wonder\nwhether the words of a powerful minority are worth more\nthan the lives of that overwhelming majority of human\nbeings who for many reasons are not only deprived of their\nright to say a word, but also lack the resolution and the\npower to exercise that right when they do have it.\nWe also wonder how there can be talk of\nmultilateralism when we see an endlessly increasing\nunilateralism and when the so-called de-ideologized world\nimposes on us a sole and exclusive ideology. Something is\nwrong when speeches on plurality are made while attempts\nare made to impose uniformity on the world; things are\neven worse if, instead of everyone having the same rights\nand duties \u2014 as should be the case \u2014 in fact, a few have\nmore and more rights whereas the vast majority only get\nmore and more duties.\nWe dedicated the decade which is just concluding to\ninternational law with a view to honouring it with\nconcrete actions. However, in this very building there\nhave been talks and negotiations about, and even votes\nagainst, these principles and international law itself. We\nshould ask ourselves once again when we will actually\nconclude the agreements on nuclear disarmament, and\nwhen the use of force or threats will be once and for all\nbanned in international relations. Why allow certain\nPowers to pursue with impunity the arms race, their\nmilitary hegemony and the defiant nuclear tests in\nlaboratories and computers while they try to ban them for\nthe rest?\nHow can we stop those who split whole nations\napart, prevent their peaceful reunification and finance and\narm regimes that violate human rights? All the\nendeavours to establish a new, just and equitable\neconomic world order, free of humiliating conditions and\nrestrictive and onerous practices, are brutally challenged\nby a powerful minority that reserves the worst and\ncruellest of the infernos for the rest of the planet.\nA handful of the rich will never be able to represent\nthe vast multitudes of human beings, deprived every day\nof their right to know that they are human, multitudes on\nwhom cultural transnationalization imposes an information\norder capable of homogenizing even the news of their\nvery lives. Nor can one accept that the select club should\ndecree in a totalitarian way the political and juridical\norder of the peoples, without even asking who we are,\nwhere we are coming from and what we rely upon to go\nwhere we sovereignly wish. Those belonging to that club,\nand they alone, are the ones primarily responsible for the\nfact that today cardinal principles of international law,\nsuch as self-determination, national independence, non-\ninterference in domestic affairs, and particularly respect\nfor the sovereignty of States are questioned.\nThat is why Cuba asserts our right to differ, and\nwhy we reiterate the position expressed by our President\nmore than three decades ago:\n\u201cAs long as the concept of sovereignty exists as a\nprerogative of nations and independent peoples, as a\nright of all peoples, we do not accept the exclusion\nof our people from that right. As long as the world\nis guided by those principles, as long as the world is\nguided by those concepts, which have universal\n28\n\n\nvalidity, because they are universally accepted and\nenshrined by the peoples, we will not accept being\ndeprived of any of those rights; we will not relinquish\nany of those rights.\u201d\nFor us there is absolutely no doubt that sovereignty\ncontinues to be a concept and a prerogative of independent\nStates, and that in today\u2019s unipolar world that principle has\neven more force and validity than ever before.\nEconomies, cultures and peoples are subjugated under\nthe drum roll of globalization; development becomes as\nremote as stars to which we cannot travel, and wealth is\nincreasingly polarized. Under the impulse of this\nglobalization, vaunted new technological and scientific\ndisplays are poisoning the environment, crushing\nbiodiversity and condemning to extinction the most\nprecarious and wonderful of all species: mankind.\nIt would be good if that global interdependency could\nstop the frantic consumption, balance national development\npatterns, make economies sustainable and multiply the\nriches of the peoples. Even better, if ideas are to be truly\nglobalized, let us welcome the clamour for urgent reform of\nthis United Nations, as remote from its own origins as it is\nunable to cope with the era in which we are living. That\ncould be dreamt of, if at least the reform started with a\ncomprehensive and inclusive endeavour, democratizing all\nits bodies while preserving its universal character, its\npolitical essence and its intergovernmental nature.\nIt is high time to go beyond the rhetoric in which we\nhave been immersed for two years, since we celebrated the\nfiftieth anniversary of the Organization with talk of reform,\nwith talk about transformations, without saying what, who,\nhow and when. If we are to be occupied, and not only\npreoccupied, with reform, let us reject, as incompatible with\nthis Organization, the corporate and transnational approach\npromoted by some of the main United Nations contributors,\nas if this building were a stock exchange and the just\ndesires of the peoples were mere merchandise.\nThe reforms must permit the General Assembly to\nreally exercise its prerogatives, including those which have\nbeen usurped, while preserving the principle of equality of\nall Member States, whose genuine political will is essential\nto advance. Intergovernmental participation in considering\nand adopting decisions on any reform package should be a\nfundamental precondition if we really want to tend to the\nneeds of the historically forgotten majority in the world.\nLikewise, our peoples, especially the poorest ones, will\nunderstand only those decisions that are reflected in their\nlives and homes \u2014 not those that satisfy only their\nGovernments.\nCuba also advocates reform that especially\nstrengthens United Nations structures and activities that\nare related to the promotion of economic and social\ndevelopment. The simplification, rationalization or\nreorientation of those structures must be the result of a\nprocess that always guarantees full completion and\nimplementation of all programmes, mandates and\nactivities in those areas.\nThe United Nations should recover its real decision-\nmaking capacity in other critical issues, such as those\nrelated to free trade, development financing and other\nmonetary topics. Any measure handing that role over to\nthe main contributors must be blocked.\nFurther, we should all endorse again the Charter\nobligation to contribute to stable and unconditional\nfinancing, making possible the effective and efficient\nimplementation of all programmes, priorities, mandates\nand activities approved by the General Assembly. The\napproval of a budget for each programme reflecting the\ntotal resources required for the Organization to carry out\nall its activities will be a cornerstone of that endeavour.\nAlong these lines, we oppose any formula based on\nthe extortion and pressure that are exerted by some\ncountries, particularly by the country which is the main\ncontributor to the United Nations \u2014 as well as its deepest\ndebtor, economically and morally speaking.\nBut to achieve the more democratic, efficient and\ndynamic United Nations we are dreaming of, it is\nessential that the reforms reach the heart of one of its\nprincipal organs: the Security Council must stop being a\nbunker impenetrable to the General Assembly\u2019s demands\nfor an equitable and fair expansion. While some of the\nrichest and most powerful States are already taking long\nstrides towards any new seats that might appear, there are\nattempts to mislead, and even to deny the right of the\nthird world to its due representation on the Council on an\nequal footing with the rest of the permanent members.\nWorse yet, the saw of division is once again cutting\nthrough the body of the poor to the benefit of the big\nindustrialized countries.\nLet us reach agreement once and for all. If we want\nreal security, what we agree upon must not further\nincrease the appalling imbalances that today insult and\nexterminate us. Hence the importance of reforming the\n29\n\n\ncomposition and procedures of the Security Council, and of\nrectifying the largest existing imbalance, by enabling\ndeveloping countries to become members based on\nequitable geographical representation and simultaneity of\naccession by new members.\nThe Council will never be secure until transparency,\ndemocracy and the participation of non-member States\nforever take the place of the present dangerous and\nconcealed manoeuvres. Peace will never be guaranteed until\nthe obsolete and antidemocratic institution of the veto\ndisappears, or is at least restricted pending its final\nelimination. That is the only way to prevent the abuses of\npower that today prevail in this Organization and in the\nSecurity Council. By confronting these abuses together, we\nwill prevent the coercive policies and unilateral measures\ngenerated by certain States from becoming multilateral.\nI know a teenager who is the pride of his parents. He\nlikes baseball, is a good student and dreams an ocean of\ndreams. But it has recently been discovered that he suffers\nfrom leukaemia. The medicines to cure him exist, and the\ntreatment could cost less than $15,000 if we act in time.\nCuba has been forced to arrange a discrete transaction to\nobtain through friendly third parties, and at a total cost of\n$60,000, the medicines to save that child\u2019s life.\nThat is the blockade: for the price of four treatments,\nwe could afford only one. With the money to save four\nlives, only one will be saved. But this is not the only\nexample. Despite its very limited income, Cuba continues\nto pay hundreds of millions of dollars in price differences,\nsurcharges, freight and other additional charges in its\nimports of fuel, food, medicines and other basic products.\nFinancial credits crucial for the economic recovery and\ngrowth were suspended or postponed or became more\nexpensive, while all markets labelled us as a \u201crisk\u201d for fear\nof the unilateral punishment that could fall on Governments\nand banks if they lent us money.\nOn top of all of that, and because of the protectionism\nof pharmaceutical patents, Cubans have been deprived of\nfree access to medicines that have appeared on the market\nsince 1979, including third-generation antibiotics and other\ndrugs to treat AIDS and cancer.\nCuba has no need to exaggerate the facts. It suffers\nthem first, contemplates them afterwards, and always\nexposes them with a calm sense of responsibility. The tale\nof a giant Goliath against a small David could have been\ntaken from the Bible, but the minstrels and chroniclers of\nthe next millennium will find plenty of inspiration in the\nconflict between the United States and Cuba.\nAlmost 40 years of resistance and of defence of our\nbold ideals of independence against our brutal neighbour\nwho covets and loathes us provide us with the authority\nto speak. More than 35 years of struggle against the cruel\nand inhumane economic, commercial and financial\nblockade by the United States of America support our\narguments. Every new charge made by Cuba is supported\nby more than $60 billion in losses \u2014 and that is not a\nfull assessment \u2014 by an economy distorted by the war\nconditions imposed on us, and by the incalculable human,\nphysical and psychological damage we have sustained.\nEvery year sees an increase in the number of\ncountries that vote by an overwhelming majority to put an\nend to that dirty, savage and silent war. Yet the blockade\nnot only remains in effect, but has been cruelly and\narrogantly strengthened before the very eyes of the world,\nwhich remains hamstrung in the face of the power of the\nEmpire.\nWhere are the courage and bravery that turned our\nspecies into a giant? Why should we tolerate the\ndiplomacy of intimidation and blackmail? For how long\nwill the world sit on its hands and watch so merciless a\ncrime?\nIt was such impunity that gave free rein to those\nwho expedited the enactment of the criminal Helms-\nBurton Act as a new escalation of the blockade and as\nadditional and convincing proof of a threat that goes\nbeyond all borders. It is extraterritorial from top to\nbottom, because it was conceived and implemented\nagainst another sovereign State, with which they\nhypocritically maintain they are not at war; at the same\ntime, it is extraterritorial against the rest of the world,\nupon which they are attempting to impose the narrow\njurisdiction of a clumsy national legal artifice.\nThis abhorred and oft-condemned imperial recipe has\nnot met with any actions forceful enough to stop it. Its\nadoption gave rise to other aberrations, such as the\nD\u2019Amato-Kennedy Act; and state and federal legislation\nof the same kind proliferates in that country.\nSimilar measures already affect more than 35\nsovereign States \u2014 that is, 2.3 billion people, accounting\nfor 42 per cent of the world\u2019s population and a potential\nmarket of $790 billion. These data, provided by the\nUnited States President\u2019s Advisory Council on Export\n30\n\n\nControl and the American Institute for International\nEconomy, prove that such extraterritorial policies also result\nin harm to the American people themselves, who in one\nyear alone lost half a million jobs and more than $1 billion\nin salaries because of them.\nInsane politicians and legislators end up by restricting\nthe very values of freedom upon which that great country\nwas founded and, in its name, prevent millions of American\nyouth from gaining access to information about a world\nfestival of youth and students held in Havana last summer.\nThose who attempt today to cross that new iron curtain risk\n$250,000 dollar fines and up to 10 years in prison. Despite\nthose threats, about a thousand young men and women\nfrom the United States challenged the veto on their\nfreedom \u2014 no one could prevent them \u2014 and attended the\nHavana festival anyway.\nSuch policies and concepts also affect the vast\nmajority of our countrymen living in the United States, for\nyears victims of criminal organizations and their hirelings\nbased in Miami, used in the dirtiest deals and electoral\nmanoeuvres, and even used as cannon fodder against their\nown people and their own motherland. Among them, a\nsilent majority of immigrants is emerging ever stronger\nevery day, rejecting the genocide against their motherland.\nDespite all this, the raving obsession of the reactionary\ncircles never seems to stop, as a true tyranny attempts\nincreasingly to reach out for the goal of world power.\nToday, new bills are being debated in the Congress in\nWashington, blooming under the shelter of instruments\nalready approved in the Helms-Burton legal atrocity.\nToday, independent nations are being bullied every six\nmonths so that they can obtain a sovereignty certificate\nfrom the White House Oval Office to avoid retaliation for\ntheir relations with Cuba.\nToday, attempts to curb free trade with false excuses\nof national security are jolting the newly born World Trade\nOrganization, and their doubtful seriousness begins to worry\nthe most distinguished United States authorities.\nToday, deals are made behind the backs of peoples,\nGovernments and Parliaments to impose moratoriums on\ninvestments, and secret pseudo-legal arguments, based on\ndubious morality, are concocted to disguise the\nshamelessness of those who yield to pressure.\nToday, there are blacklists of foreign companies and\nbusinessmen who do not submit to the rules, therefore\nbeing denied entry to that country, which regards itself as\nsuper-free. Visas are also denied to their spouses and\nchildren, to force them to yield to the empire\u2019s will.\nToday, there are Governments that receive or await\ncertificates of good democratic behaviour, certificates that\nthey are defenders of selected and manipulated rights or\nare outstanding anti-drug enforcers, in order to gain\naccess to a fast track to a free trade agreement, a trade\ncredit or development aid.\nToday, European citizens are being blackmailed by\nattorneys, indicted and unjustly found guilty by United\nStates courts, which boast about their impartiality, under\nsuch illegalities as the Helms-Burton Act.\nToday, there are imperialist diplomats, clones of\npolicemen, who share the stage with famous Hollywood\nstars and who parade arrogantly among the Governments\nand Parliaments of the world, with their siren song and\ntheir well-known threats and offers of charity in exchange\nfor the most abject complicity.\nAll of this madness has revived official and covert\noperations, mercenaries, spies and assassins, as ready now\nas in the worst days of the cold war to plot and unleash\nterror against human beings and even employ aggressive\nbiological agents against our economy.\nNo one, absolutely no one, has lifted a finger in the\nUnited States Government to stop them. Diehard sectors\nhave usurped their constitutional rights in order to\nexercise that power, and are obstructing them in the\nmeanest and pettiest way.\nThe same gang of ultraconservatives and gangsters\nis responsible for the acquittal of hijackers and impedes\nthe use of the term \u201cterrorists\u201d, while with a silent and\nmysterious complicity they are bolstered, funded,\norganized, armed, trained and assigned to intelligence\nmissions.\nDisguised as tourists, defenders of human rights or\nphilanthropists, those who today stir up greater and more\npainful confrontations between Cuba and the United\nStates are identical to those who 35 years ago were\ninvolved in the climate of aggression which led to the\nmissile crisis in October 1962.\nUnfortunately, there are people in the world who do\nnot see, or, even worse, do not want to see, these facts,\n31\n\n\nand from their sanctuaries they worry about our problems,\nstudy us, advise us to surrender, design our future with the\nsame ingredients as our past, and even urge us to bear\neverything with the utmost patience.\nBelieve me, it is very hard to understand, for example,\nthe uneasiness caused by the lack of a variety of dishes on\nthe Cuban table, when there is not the least concern for the\nmillions of human beings to their south without tables or\ndishes, and often without even a slice of bread. We shall\nnever understand or accept the longed-for renunciation of\nwhat we are and what we have been as the contemptible\nprice that the people of socialist Cuba, like any other\npeople in the world, should pay for an uncertain\ncoexistence with a neighbour as disrespectful and arrogant\nas it is powerful.\nThe moral and legal support of 136 votes in this\nAssembly encourages and comforts us in our struggle. But\nit has not been enough to overcome the persistent arrogance\nof the one who thinks himself the divine judge and lacks\nthe humility to admit the failure of a mistaken policy.\nAlthough their representatives may, as usual, leave the\nChamber, we know they are listening. Therefore, on behalf\nof the people of free Cuba we wish them to know and to\nconvey to their Government and Congress that we have\nabsolutely no fear of them.\nWe also know that only international pressure can\nprevent these forms of aggression against Cuba, or any\nother sovereign State, from multiplying.\nFor these reasons, and because of our commitment to\nthe millions of Cubans whom we represent and on whose\nbehalf we now speak, we confirm that if our stubborn will\nto resist costs us our lives, so be it a thousand times over.\nNever shall we submit again to being slaves of a haughty\nand arrogant empire that refuses to recognize pluralism or\nboundaries, an empire that decides to blockade our\nexistence and kill all hope.\nOur experience confirms to us today, more than ever,\nthat only the spirit of sacrifice, the loving, valiant, free and\nselfless unity of our people and Government, can give us\nthe strength of character of Quixote to stand up to such\ngigantic hardships.\nThat is how we have been able to resist, along with\nthe most generous solidarity and understanding of thousands\nof millions of people.\nDesiring only the noblest satisfaction, our people\nvolunteer and join in the titanic task of putting an end to\nthe cataclysms shaking the Earth and fighting for the\nadvent of a new millennium of emancipation, peace,\nsecurity and development for all nations.\nWe ask for nothing, absolutely nothing, in return.\nWe can only offer the example of having stoically\nendured the harassment of the greatest Power in history,\nof maintaining our principles and of continuing to believe,\nwork and move forward when many thought we had\nstopped and were dying.\nThe father of our independence said,\n\u201cWe Cubans do not seek and do not want anything\ngreater than honour, homeland and freedom.\nEverything else will come for sure and in bulk after\nall that. What we need is to succeed.\u201d\nAnd our existence today is reason enough for us to assert\nproudly that we have already succeeded.\nBecause of that unique experience, we can also say\nthat this is a solemn and decisive time.\nThe imperial Power that wants to subjugate the\nworld is no match for us if we stand together.\nWe are a great and very powerful majority.\nThere will be no place in history for those who stay\non their knees. Let us all rise, united!"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset, Sir,\nto congratulate you on your election as President of the\nfifty-second session of the General Assembly. Eritrea joins\nin the expressions of recognition of your attributes by\nprevious speakers. You are presiding over an Assembly\nsession that will be remembered for focusing not only on\ncrucial international issues but also on the reform of our\nOrganization. While wishing you success in your\nleadership, I also assure you of the full support and\ncooperation of the Eritrean delegation.\nI also seize this opportunity to pay tribute to the\nPermanent Representative of Malaysia, His Excellency\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, for the way he conducted the\nwork of the fifty-first session, and to thank him for his far-\nsighted proposal on the reform of the Security Council.\nLikewise, I wish to extend sincere gratitude to the new\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nfor the efficient and dynamic way he is discharging his\nduties.\nWe are meeting at a critical juncture of history. After\nalmost 50 years the dark and ominous clouds of world\nconflict no longer loom threateningly over the horizon.\nThose grim days are over. In the last few years we have\ntaken great strides towards making the world safer for\nfuture generations.\nThe road to disarmament has been made easier with\nthe signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\n(CTBT) by 146 world leaders in 1996. The world has also\naccelerated efforts to eliminate anti-personnel landmines.\nMore importantly, there seem to be clear indications of a\ngreat change in values, attitudes and perceptions which will\nfoster the creation of cooperative relationships among the\nStates of the world, thus promoting new perspectives of\ncommon policies to solve mutual problems.\nTrue, we should, at the same time, remember that old\nand new conflicts continue to plague the world. Thus,\ndestabilizing factors such as the marginalization of nations\nand peoples, transnational crimes, the use of violence and\nthe threat of violence as instruments of national policy\nstill haunt our planet. In addition, old and new conflicts\nin Europe, Asia and Africa seem to threaten or reverse\nthe global gains achieved in the last few years. It is hoped\nthat these will be the exceptions rather than the rule and,\nas relics of the past, will be swept away in the near\nfuture. In this respect, it is encouraging to note that the\nSecurity Council held, during the second week of the\nGeneral Assembly, an unprecedented ministerial meeting\non the security situation in Africa. This will encourage the\nUnited Nations to play a more meaningful and credible\nrole in supporting regional initiatives to solve regional\nconflicts.\nThus, perhaps for the first time, there is an\nopportunity to undertake a common, realistic and critical\nreappraisal of our involvement in world affairs and to\ncome to an agreement on the role of the United Nations.\nThe Members of the United Nations, both old and new,\nmust welcome this opportunity to demonstrate their\nreadiness to tackle these new global problems and the full\nintent of the contribution they can make to empower the\nUnited Nations to become a strong and relevant force in\ninternational relations.\nIn recent years, there have been persistent requests\nfor a change in the structure and mission of the United\nNations. There is undoubtedly need for reform. The most\nobvious reason is the fact that today the Organization\nremains essentially the same entity that was created over\n50 years ago in San Francisco. Its membership has more\nthan tripled since then, with at least two dozen new States\njoining since 1990. Yet, its structure remains essentially\nthe same. Also, the problems that face the world are so\nradically different that there is a dire need for the\nreorganization of priorities in the Organization\u2019s mission.\nAlthough it is true that different States, or groups of\nStates, will have different perceptions of what needs to be\nchanged, the following are, in the opinion of my\ndelegation, the most important issues that must be taken\ninto consideration if change is to be meaningful and\ncredible.\nFirst, there are only two major challenges\nconfronting the world today: development and security.\nThese are, of course, interdependent. It is evident that\nthere will not be any development without peace. Yet,\nwithout development that improves the livelihood of\npeople, the task of guaranteeing peace will be extremely\ndifficult. The assaults on these two problems must be\nmade simultaneously, and all of our actions should be\n9\n\n\ntaken with an eye to solving both. Hitherto, emphasis has\nbeen on security to the detriment of development, with\ncatastrophic results. Since the reason for this disparity,\nnamely the cold war, no longer exists, it should not be too\ndifficult to put a little more emphasis on development.\nLately, however, there has been a growing emphasis on the\npolitical rather than the economic aspects of\ndevelopment \u2014 that is, on democracy and human rights.\nTrue, people everywhere are clamouring for the right to be\nfree from dictatorships and to participate meaningfully in\ndecisions which affect their lives, and they must be strongly\nsupported in this. However, it must also be realized that the\nmeaning of human rights and democracy is being\nchallenged and questioned, and they are being given\ndifferent interpretations. Whatever the case, any effort to\napply standards of democracy and human rights, however\ndefined, will not be successful unless the root causes of\nunderdevelopment and poverty are effectively addressed.\nAny reform of the United Nations should, therefore,\nempower it to promote sustained economic growth in\ndeveloping countries even more energetically. Only this will\nhelp to develop good governance, that is, democracy and\nhuman rights and stability, and will militate against inter-\nand intra-State conflicts.\nSecondly, the United Nations belongs to all of its\nMembers. Thus, the increased participation of all of its\nMembers in its activities is a right that must be exercised\nto safeguard against the arbitrary abuse of its powers and\nfunctions. Such a development would enhance\nimmeasurably its effectiveness as a guarantor of peace. It\nis hardly possible to speak sincerely of a universal\norganization whose major decisions, taken by a few, will be\nbinding upon the rest of the world. It is no longer\nacceptable to the rest of the world that a relatively small\nnumber of States, even after the proposed increase of\nmembership in its major decision-making organs, should, in\nthe name of international peace and security, dictate the\nagenda of the United Nations or impose a system of\ninternational conduct. Indeed, it is sad to note that the same\ncountries that make democracy a condition in their foreign\npolicies are adamant about maintaining an elite club of\nStates in the consideration of Security Council membership.\nIn any case, any future system must eschew cold-war\ndoctrines and principles and give equal emphasis to social\njustice. Peace and justice are interrelated and cannot be\nmutually exclusive. There is thus no longer any excuse to\ndeny equitable representation in the major organs of the\nOrganization and undemocratically to deprive States of the\nopportunity to participate in the making of decisions which\nwill affect their destinies and the welfare of their peoples.\nThe United Nations will be in danger of being\nmarginalized if it does not take into account the needs\nand aspirations of most of its Members and does not build\ntrust between its Members, big and small, rich and poor,\nweak and strong. It can build such trust and mutual\nconfidence only if it makes sure that democratic norms\nand principles are accepted and practised by all its\nMembers.\nThirdly, this is the age of decentralization. Whenever\npossible, therefore, the United Nations must create the\nappropriate modalities to enable regional organizations to\nassume tasks which they will be able to execute more\neffectively. To this end, the General Assembly must take\nthe necessary steps to ensure a relevant role for regional\nand even subregional organizations, without losing its\nleadership role or eliminating its support.\nFourthly, the urgency of reform is recognized, but it\nwould be counterproductive to rush into decisions whose\nimplications we shall live to regret. Those who resent the\nveto power of the five permanent members of the\nSecurity Council would be well advised to take the time,\nand to allow others to take the necessary time, to study\nissues before they make final decisions on such weighty\nmatters.\nSince its independence in 1993, Eritrea has\nembarked on a course of nation-building, reconstruction\nand renewal. In this endeavour, we were inspired by the\neternal ideas of our struggle, which enshrines justice,\nequity, human rights and equal opportunity to all,\nincluding, in particular, hitherto marginalized groups.\nIn the last six years \u2014 for we liberated our country\ntwo years prior to our declaration of formal\nindependence \u2014 we have taken the necessary measures\nto establish a regime of peace and marked stability in a\nregion of the world in which they have been absent for\nseveral decades; consolidate our profoundly democratic\ntradition of struggle by adopting a new constitution and\nholding our first democratic regional elections; create a\ndevelopment-oriented State and government structure;\nensure a corruption-free society; build schools and health\nfacilities in most regions of our country; and formulate an\neconomic and financial policy which fosters an\nenvironment that encourages investment and has thus\nmade our country a new frontier of widely expanding\nopportunities. These policies have yielded good political,\neconomic and social dividends that have enabled us to\nlook to the future with hope and optimism.\n10\n\n\nIn our foreign relations, we have been guided by two\nbasic principles. The first is our deep conviction that, where\nthere is goodwill, all can be resolved through peaceful\nnegotiation without recourse to violence. A natural corollary\nof this belief is the firm conviction that all States,\nregardless of their ideological orientation, can live together\nin peace. This tenet underlies Eritrean foreign policy and\nhas guided its relations with all the countries of the two\nregions \u2014 the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa \u2014 in which\nit is located.\nThis has enabled it to establish an exemplary, close tie\nof friendship with Ethiopia, our erstwhile adversary. These\nclose relations and friendship have widely manifested\nthemselves over the last four years as we have coordinated\nactivities in the political, economic and social fields. It has\nalso helped us to defuse conflict and to arrive at a mutual\nagreement to resolve the conflict between us and the\nRepublic of Yemen over the Eritrean Hanish-Zukar\narchipelago on the Red Sea by the peaceful means of\narbitration. The State of Eritrea has time and again affirmed\nits adherence to the Agreement of principles of 21 May\n1996 and expressed its commitment to abide by the\ndecisions of the Arbitration Tribunal. Since both parties\nhave committed themselves to abide by the decision of the\nArbitration Tribunal, my Government feels that the dispute\nis already solved.\nUnfortunately, even the best of goodwill and intentions\ncould not help avert bad relations with our other neighbour,\nthe Sudan, which is bent on conducting a bad-neighbour\npolicy, is at odds with almost all of its neighbours and with\nothers beyond, and has, because of its avowed policy of\nexporting terrorism abroad, become an international pariah.\nThe second pillar of Eritrean foreign policy is an\nunswerving devotion to justice and equity. This policy\nemanates from Eritrea\u2019s subjection to the horrors of\naggression and colonization at the height of the cold war.\nAt that time, our pleas to the United Nations and the\ninternational community fell on deaf ears. Because of this,\nwe are convinced that there are no substitutes for justice\nand equality for the purpose of ensuring the maintenance of\npeace in the world. These, too, have influenced our search\nfor friendship and cooperation with our neighbours as well\nas with other States. They have also underlined our efforts\nto bring peace and stability to our region and to achieve an\nearly end to the fratricidal conflict in Somalia, a just and\nfair resolution of the Sudanese conflict, and the\ndevelopment of economic, commercial and political\nrelations among countries of the region.\nThe conflict that has ravaged the Sudan for about\ntwo decades must be brought to an end. The absence of\npeace in the Sudan has had severe consequences for most\nof its neighbours. Thus, they have a substantial interest in\nthe restoration of lasting peace, security and stability in\nthe Sudan.\nTo this end, those of its neighbours which are\nmembers of the Intergovernmental Authority on\nDevelopment (IGAD) have, both collectively and\nindividually, exerted much effort during the past seven\nyears to promote an inter-Sudanese peace process. None\nof the members of IGAD has an interest other than\nushering in peace in the Sudan. All have favoured and\nencouraged dialogue, compromise and tolerance. They\nwere convinced that peace could be achieved on the basis\nof the Declaration of Principles formulated by IGAD after\na serious assessment of the objective reality prevailing in\nthe country. It is regrettable that until last month the\nSudanese regime had done all it could to subvert the\npeace process it had willingly accepted. It has now\naccepted the Declaration of Principles. We hope it will\nrespect its commitment and implement the provisions of\nthat Declaration. If and when it does, it will bring our\ninitiative to a successful conclusion and usher in peace\nand stability in the Sudan.\nI also wish to refer to the efforts made by IGAD\nconcerning the tragic situation which still exists in\nSomalia. It will be recalled that the members of IGAD\nhave both collectively and individually expressed deep\nconcern that this grave situation has continued for many\nyears and that no workable solution has yet been found.\nMany attempts to bring the concerned parties to the\nnegotiating table have failed. Where they have succeeded,\nno agreement could be achieved. Where agreements have\nbeen reached, they have been broken soon after.\nIn the global context, my country is fully convinced\nthat international cooperation is of vital importance. To\nensure sustainable development, Eritrea has been engaged\nin fostering regional integration and international\ncooperation because it is firmly aware of the importance\nof partnership in development. Eritrea believes that\npartnership can be ensured only when independence of\nchoice and recognition of equality and mutuality exist.\nWe in Eritrea are convinced that the world will\nbenefit from a strong, purposeful and dynamic United\nNations. We will therefore contribute, however modestly,\nto the creation of the conditions necessary to make it a\nreal force which will ensure international peace and\n11\n\n\nsecurity that is broadly defined and premised on\ndevelopment.\nWe note with great interest and welcome the\nSecretary-General\u2019s proposals for reform. We are studying\nthem with care. We fully endorse the values and principles\nunderlying the objectives of reform, as enunciated in the\nSecretary-General\u2019s address to the current Assembly,\nparticularly his reference to the new paradigms of\ncooperation.\nToday, I assure the General Assembly of our\ncommitment to the United Nations and to its new principles\nand purposes and its vision of a new world, as well as its\nsincere commitment to promoting genuine peace and\ndevelopment and defending the cause of small, weak States\nand vulnerable peoples. One would think that a nation like\nEritrea \u2014 which had been systematically betrayed by the\nUnited Nations during the past four decades \u2014 would have\nsecond thoughts about committing itself to the\nOrganization. However, we always believed that there was\nnothing wrong with the message of the United Nations, and\nwe had subscribed to it even in our days of struggle. Surely\nwe cannot blame the message for the shortsightedness of\nthe messengers. We urge others who share our feelings to\njoin us in giving the Organization the wholehearted support\nit now deserves and needs if it is going to be as effective\nas we wish it to be.\n\n\n\n\n"

He deserves every assistance and support\nfrom all Member States of the Organization.\nWith great enthusiasm for capitalizing on the\nopportunities created by the end of the cold war, we\nembarked on a journey to revitalize the United Nations and\nto reform the way it functions, making it more effective and\ncapable of playing the central role it is entitled to in\nmaintaining the world order, and perhaps shaping a new\nworld order for the future.\nHowever, as the discussions continue, the views\nremain far from consensus, even on the single issue of\nrestructuring the Security Council, which I agree is\nimportant and pivotal. But at this point we should remind\nourselves that in our approach to reform we should be\ncovering the whole spectrum of political, social, economic\nand legal activities of the United Nations and its\nspecialized agencies.\nIt is rather disappointing that the focus is at present\nmainly on the restructuring of the Security Council.\nFurthermore, the proposals made so far on this issue are\nsadly inadequate, and many suggest the creation of a new\nform of idiosyncrasy.\nIn the absence of a formula which is comprehensive\nand just, we may as well suggest the following.\nFirst, increase the number of non-permanent\nmembers in the Council to an appropriate level, reflecting\nthe growth of the membership and its present diversity.\nSecondly, amend paragraph 2 of Article 23 of the\nCharter to enable the non-permanent member States to be\nre-elected for any number of consecutive terms, so that\nthose who seek to occupy a seat in this important body on\na continuing basis can do so as long as they enjoy the\nconfidence and support of the Member States.\nThirdly, encourage the permanent members of the\nSecurity Council to agree among themselves on an accord\nwhich will remove or at least minimize the common\napprehension arising from the fear of their misusing the\nveto power.\nMy delegation applauds the efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral to bring much needed reforms to the\nadministrative and financial functioning of the\nOrganization. The proposals that he submitted to the\nAssembly on 16 July 1997 deserve our careful\nconsideration, as they contain far-reaching and\nconstructive arrangements which will at least help the\nUnited Nations emerge from its present difficulties.\nThe enthusiasm which followed the end of the cold\nwar also provided us the opportunity to meet in several\ninternational conferences to deal with some of the issues\nof true concern to all of us. These issues include the\nenvironment, social development, population, women,\nhuman settlements and food security. At those meetings\nwe adopted ambitious action plans, reaching the\nconclusion that sustainable development should be the\ncore of the achievement of our objectives. Yet without the\ngenuine and sincere will of the international community\nto honour their commitments, the action plans, which bear\nenormous price tags, cannot be implemented effectively.\n11\n\n\nThis stark truth dominated the special session of the\nGeneral Assembly in June this year, when we noted the\nlack of progress in the international action called for in the\nhistoric Agenda 21 of the 1992 Earth Summit.\nThe emission of greenhouse gases is continuing\nunabated, polluting the environment and warming the global\natmosphere more and more. If the latest predictions of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on\ngreenhouse-gas emissions and global warming were to\ncome true, then by the year 2100 almost 80 per cent of the\nlow-lying island countries, including my own, would be\nsubmerged in the sea.\nFor the Maldives and other small island developing\nStates, which are most affected by the degradation of the\nworld\u2019s environment, the lack of progress in international\naction is most lamentable. We are not only fearful of an\nimpending danger, we are also anxious that unless the\nworld acts now and swiftly, it may be too late for us to\navoid environmental catastrophe.\nIf we care to halt and reverse this lurking threat, we\nneed the unwavering commitment and cooperation of the\nentire international community. And there is nothing we can\ndo on our own.\nEver since my President, Mr. Maumoon Abdul\nGayoom, apprised this Assembly in 1987 of the impending\nenvironmental disaster that rising sea levels posed to our\ncountry, the Maldives has been warning vigorously, at\nnational, regional and international levels, of this problem.\nToday I am happy to state that at the national level we\nare continuing successfully to create environmental\nawareness by involving non-governmental organizations and\nthe private sector. We have also successfully implemented\na few projects to protect and preserve the environment. For\ninstance, under the two-million-tree national programme the\npeople of the Maldives have planted eight trees per person\nin the last two years. I wonder what a spectacular impact\nwe could have on our planet if we could plant eight trees\nper person in the entire world over the next two years.\nAt the regional level, the Delhi Declaration of the\nEnvironment Ministers of the South Asian Association for\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) stands as testimony to our\nregional efforts. The Declaration, which reflected the\ncommon position of our region on global environmental\nissues, was presented to this Assembly by President\nGayoom at its nineteenth special session. Another important\nmeeting of SAARC environment ministers is scheduled to\nbe held this month in the Maldives.\nAt the international level, we are working closely\nwith the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) to\npursue our cause. We attach the utmost importance to the\nswift and steady implementation of the Barbados\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States, and once again we call\nupon the developed countries to fulfil their commitments\nand pledges of support.\nIn this connection, we call upon the industrialized\ncountries to follow the examples set by the United\nKingdom and the European Union during the nineteenth\nspecial session of the General Assembly and to commit\nthemselves to legally binding and meaningful targets to\nreduce their greenhouse-gas emission levels.\nFor the Maldives, a country that will be affected\nseverely, if not fatally, by climate change, it is hard to\naccept a target below the 20 per cent reduction level by\nthe year 2005, as contained in the AOSIS protocol, as a\nmeaningful reduction.\nLast month the Maldives hosted the thirteenth\nsession of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic\nChange, which was regarded not only as a very important\nmeeting on the subject, but also a very timely one, as the\nworld is looking forward eagerly and with great optimism\nto the forthcoming third session of the Conference of the\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change in Kyoto.\nMy country and many other small States in the\ndeveloping world, especially those among the least\ndeveloped countries, have placed our trust in the United\nNations to help us face and overcome the inherent\nconstraints we have as we continue our quest towards\nprogress and prosperity. We also look to the United\nNations to develop policies and take effective measures to\nprotect us from threats, whether economic or political,\nand alleviate our sufferings from environmental\ncalamities. The fact is that we cannot on our own face the\nodds and that our economies are more vulnerable than\nthose of larger and more prosperous States. Protection of\nthe weaker should not be seen as a burden, but rather as\na shared responsibility of all, recognizing the realities of\nour diversified membership in this Organization.\nWhile liberalization of the world economy may have\nboosted the prospects for some of the developing\n12\n\n\ncountries to successfully integrate themselves into the new\ninternational trading arrangements, those with little access\nto the world market, capital and new technologies find\nthemselves becoming marginalized, away from the\nmainstream of the world economy.\nThe gap between the rich and the poor is continuing\nto grow unabated. Several developing countries, and\nparticularly the least developed of them, still continue to\nsuffer from endemic poverty, which is compounded by the\nsevere debt burden and leads to political and economic\ndislocation.\nThe overall decline in official development assistance\nover the years has aggravated the conditions of the least\ndeveloped countries. Unless the developed countries fulfil\ntheir commitment to reach the United Nations accepted\ntarget of dedicating 0.7 per cent of gross national product\nto official development assistance and intensify their efforts\nto reverse the present downward trend, hopes for the least\ndeveloped countries will remain as grim as ever.\nThe Committee for Development Planning, at its\nthirty-first session, held in May this year, proposed in its\nreport that the Maldives be graduated from the least\ndeveloped countries list at the time of the next review in\nthe year 2000, if we continue to prosper at the present rate.\nWe are overwhelmed to see our development efforts\nbeing rewarded with a decision of expulsion. Over the\nyears, my country has successfully cleared numerous\nhurdles in the path of socio-economic development, despite\nits limited resources. We were able to improve the per\ncapita income, raise the standard of living of the people and\nprovide basic services to the community and individuals at\nhigher levels than many others in the least developed\ncountry category.\nThis success was in large measure due to the stable\npolitical climate that we enjoyed, which in turn provided us\nthe opportunity to implement carefully planned, action-\noriented policies and strategies. At the same time, we could\nnot have achieved these happy results without the support\nwe received from friendly countries and multilateral\norganizations.\nHowever, if one were to consider these few\nachievements against the background of an extremely\nfragile economy deprived of natural resources, and a high\ndependency on tourism and fisheries \u2014 both of which are\nsusceptible to global economic change and environmental\nand other external factors \u2014 the whole scenario could\neasily change from a happy and promising one to an\nobscure and insecure one. The vulnerability of our\neconomy compels us to continue to depend on external\nresources, to build infrastructures that we cannot build on\nour own and to develop our own needed human resources\nfor further development.\nFurthermore, the smallness of our countries has also\nmade us vulnerable to the activities of drug-trafficking,\nmoney-laundering, terrorism and other forms of organized\ncrime carried out by criminals who are looking for new\nterritories to operate from. We therefore need to remain\nclose to our development partners in a relationship of\ntrust, which is far beyond kindness and charity. Therefore,\nmy delegation would like to stress the importance of\ndeveloping and applying a vulnerability index for the\nsmall island developing States as a basic and meaningful\ncriterion for determining the status of least developed\ncountries, recalling the content and the spirit of resolution\n51/183.\n\nI cannot overemphasize the important role that the\nregional organizations are playing in international\nrelations: fostering mutual trust and understanding and\nopening up greater prospects for the promotion of peace,\nstability and socio-economic cooperation within the\nregion.\nThe activities of the South Asian Association for\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC), to which my country\nproudly belongs, are no exception. In fact, I am happy to\nstate that the ninth SAARC summit, held in the Maldives\nin May this year, has adopted far-reaching and bold\ninitiatives that will bring the countries of South Asia\ncloser to each other and enhance further cooperation\nbetween them in the economic and technical fields.\nAmong other important decisions, we have pledged to\neradicate poverty from our region as early as possible,\npreferably by the year 2002. We have joined hands to\naccelerate our efforts to achieve trade liberalization and\nestablish a free-trade area by the year 2001. We have\nalso, for the first time, decided to begin informal political\nconsultations in order to enhance and foster good-\nneighbourly relations, relieve tension and build trust and\nconfidence between and among Member States.\nThe alarming level of tension that exists on the\ninternational political scene is of utmost concern to us. In\nthe recent past, we have witnessed in various regions of\n13\n\n\nthe world the reigniting of old conflicts the emergence of\nnew and serious ones that possess the intensity to stretch\nthe United Nations to its limits.\nThe dangerous developments unfolding in the region\nof the Middle East have brought into question once again\nthe credibility and effectiveness of the United Nations. The\npresent Israeli Government\u2019s arrogance towards and utter\ndisregard for United Nations resolutions and the agreements\nthat they themselves reached with the Palestinians under the\nOslo accords have shattered the little hope that the people\nof Israel, Palestine and the international community at large\nhad for a lasting solution to this age-old conflict. Recent\nevents have drastically diminished the confidence that is so\nessential for the success of the process, leaving us to\nwonder if peace will ever come to this region.\nThe General Assembly met twice in emergency\nsession this year to consider the issue. At those sessions,\nthe international community almost unanimously rallied\nbehind the Middle East peace process and demonstrated its\ngenuine and unwavering support. While my delegation fully\nshares the view that continued negotiations in good faith\nbetween the two parties is essential for a permanent\nsolution to the conflict, we strongly believe that the United\nNations also has an important and crucial role to play in the\npeace process. The decisions of the General Assembly and\nthe Security Council must be respected and fully\nimplemented without any preconditions. We call on both\nparties to respect the agreements reached so far and to\nexercise maximum restraint in resorting to activities that\nmay undermine the peace process.\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina may have\nfaded a little from the headlines of the international press,\nbut we must realize that our job will not be complete unless\nand until the perpetrators of genocide and other brutal\ncrimes in that country are brought to justice.\nIn the field of disarmament and arms control, the\ninternational community has achieved considerable success.\nThe indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the adoption of\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and\nthe entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention\nare testimony to this. The Maldives attaches utmost\nimportance to the efforts of global and regional\ndisarmament and arms control, and vehemently supports\nthem. It was in this spirit that we signed the CTBT two\ndays ago.\nContrary to our expectations, the era of peace and\neconomic prosperity of the post-cold-war era has so far\nproved elusive. Outbreaks of violence and ethnic strife in\nseveral parts of the world have precipitated unbelievable\nlevels of human suffering. Conflicts within States have\ncrossed national boundaries and ignited conflicts of\ninternational proportions. Unless the United Nations is\nequipped to act swiftly on such symptoms of rupture,\nlarge numbers of people will remain in the shadow of\nconflicts. We should redouble our efforts to deliver on the\npromise of peace, human rights, fundamental freedoms\nand economic prosperity contained in the Charter of this\nOrganization.\nThe United Nations should not be solely a political\nforum. It was meant to cover the wide spectrum of all\nhuman activities with institutions for social as well as\neconomic matters. The disparities vividly observed around\nthe world, a half century after the creation of the United\nNations, prove that none of the institutions has diminished\nin importance. They were created to remedy these\nimbalances among States and to contribute to justice,\nequality and peace. They were established to build and\nconsolidate a climate of cooperation, to help each other\non the basis of moral and ethical obligations and not\nmerely of charity. They were erected to help the poor \u2014\nnot just some of them, while neglecting others; to help\nchildren \u2014 not just some of them, while neglecting\nothers; to consolidate human rights \u2014 not just some\naspects of it, while neglecting others; and to further peace\nand prosperity for all mankind \u2014 not just for certain\nsegments of humanity.\nIf we want the United Nations to perform the duties\nthat we have entrusted to it, then we should ensure that\nwe honour our financial obligations to it. My delegation\nis convinced that without a firm and sound financial\nfooting, even our reform efforts will be totally\nmeaningless.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, at the outset, to\nconvey to you, Sir, on behalf of my delegation, my warm\ncongratulations on your election as the President of the\nfifty-second session of the United Nations General\nAssembly. I am confident that your work will meet with\ngreat success throughout the session, particularly in guiding\nus in the task of reforming and restructuring the United\nNations in preparation for the challenges ahead.\nI would like to pay tribute to your predecessor,\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, Permanent Representative of\nMalaysia, for the excellent manner in which he conducted\nour deliberations during the previous session.\nI also take this opportunity to commend the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his vision and\ndevotion to the service of the United Nations.\nThe creation of the United Nations by the founding\nfathers was a courageous decision. Although their\nobjectives are yet to be fully realized, Kenya is convinced\nthat they are still valid, and we remain fully committed to\ntheir achievement. The world has undergone tremendous\ntransformation since the signing of the United Nations\nCharter in San Francisco 52 years ago. We have\nwitnessed the end of the East-West military and political\nrivalry, which at times crippled decision-making in the\nUnited Nations system. New opportunities have emerged\nand the role of the United Nations has diversified, with\nthe international community placing greater expectations\non the Organization.\nUnder the able leadership of His Excellency\nPresident Daniel T. arap Moi, Kenya has undertaken bold\npolitical and economic reforms whose benefits we are\nbeginning to realize. We are committed and determined\nto continue forging national unity to enhance the process\nof democratization and socio-economic development.\nIt is against this background that I wish to address\nsome of the issues contained in the agenda of this session.\nIn recapping the events of the past years, we note\nthat the United Nations has made efforts to secure\ninternational peace and security. We regret that the peace\ndividend expected after the cold war has not materialized.\nInstead, the total volume of assistance to developing\ncountries has declined, and the scourge of conflicts in\nvarious parts of the world, and in Africa in particular, has\nrevealed the frightening proportions of ethnic and\nnationalistic hostilities and humanitarian crises. Intra-State\nconflicts have torn some of our nations apart, as they\npose threats to security, social cohesion and economic\nprogress.\nSome of these conflicts have proved difficult to\nprevent, manage or resolve. They have caused diversion\nof resources from developmental purposes to non-\nproductive use. Kenya believes in the peaceful resolution\nof conflicts and encourages the settlement of disputes\nthrough negotiations, mediation, conciliation and\narbitration as opposed to use of force. His Excellency\nPresident Daniel T. arap Moi, along with other leaders in\nAfrica, has spent considerable time and resources\ncoordinating peace initiatives in southern Sudan, Somalia,\n14\n\n\nBurundi, Rwanda and the former Zaire, among other places.\nWe are happy to report that the stalled peace process\nconcerning the conflict in southern Sudan was re-energized\nfollowing the extraordinary Summit of the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) held\nin Nairobi on 8 and 9 July 1997, at which the Sudanese\nGovernment accepted the Declaration of Principles, which\ncalls on all factions to work together. In addition, during\nthe IGAD Ministerial meeting held in Nairobi on 22\nSeptember 1997, the parties to the conflict agreed on 28\nOctober 1997 as the date for the next meeting. Kenya\nbelieves that the parties must have the courage and political\nwill to negotiate in good faith. It is equally important for\nthe international community to actively support this process\nby making financial resources available as well as by\nexerting pressure on all the parties to rededicate themselves\nto finding a lasting solution to the conflict. We pay tribute\nto the IGAD Partnership Forum for its supportive role vis-\n\u00e0-vis the IGAD initiative.\nThe prolonged conflict in Somalia remains a matter of\ngreat concern to Kenya. The continued absence of that\nsisterly State among the family of nations is indeed\nregrettable. We maintain that reconciliation of the warring\nfactions is critical to finding a just, lasting and\ncomprehensive peace settlement to the conflict. The\ninternational community, in particular the Intergovernmental\nAuthority on Development, the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) and the United Nations, has an important role\nin assisting in the process of reconciliation.\nThe crisis in the Republic of Congo is similarly a\nmatter of grave concern to Kenya. We are concerned that\nthree months have elapsed since the President of Gabon,\nOmar Bongo, called upon the Security Council to deploy a\nUnited Nations force to assist in normalizing the situation\nin that country. We wish to reiterate the OAU position\nstated at the recent Security Council ministerial meeting \u2014\nnamely, that there is a need for urgent intervention by the\nUnited Nations.\nLikewise, the situation in Burundi is also of concern\nto my country. We support the efforts by Mwalimu Julius\nNyerere to find a negotiated solution to the problem in that\ncountry. We urge President Pierre Buyoya to take into\naccount the concerns of the subregion and the international\ncommunity in general and work towards a negotiated\nsettlement.\nKenya wishes to reiterate the position taken on the\nconflict in Sierra Leone by the thirty-third session of the\nOAU Conference of Heads of State and Government, held\nin Harare, Zimbabwe, in June 1997, that the international\ncommunity desist from recognizing the military junta. We\nsupport the efforts by the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) in the search for a solution to\nthe crisis in that country and urge the junta to return\nSierra Leone to constitutional rule. We are convinced that\nquick and effective action by the international community\nis necessary, as underscored by President Tejan Kabbah\nduring his intervention before the Assembly on 1 October\nlast.\nMy Government is also concerned with the political\ndevelopments in the Islamic Federal Republic of the\nComoros. We support the efforts by the Organization of\nAfrican Unity aimed at bringing the Government and\nother parties together with a view to seeking a solution to\nthe problem. We urge the people of the Comoros to work\ntowards maintaining the sovereignty, national unity and\nintegrity of their country.\nKenya has been involved in the peace process in\nAngola since 1975. We are encouraged by the progress\nthat has been made towards finding a peaceful solution to\nthe prolonged crisis in that country. However, we wish to\nreiterate the need for both parties, in particular UNITA,\nto cooperate fully in the implementation of the Lusaka\nProtocol, the agreed framework for peace in Angola. At\nthis point in time, any alternative will only hurt the\npeople of Angola.\nOn a positive note, we are encouraged by the\ncooperation between the United Nations and ECOWAS\nthat enabled Liberia to hold successful elections, won by\nPresident Taylor. In this regard, we commend the efforts\nof ECOWAS, the international community and the\nLiberian people for the manner in which the elections\nwere concluded. We wish Liberia success in the difficult\ntask of reconstruction and post-conflict peace-building.\nKenya believes that a continued United Nations\npresence and focused support of the international\ncommunity are critical in the rehabilitation and\nreconstruction of Liberia, including the repatriation and\nreintegration of refugees. We welcome the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s intention to establish a peace-building support\noffice in Monrovia upon the termination of the mandate\nof the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia\n(UNOMIL). We are convinced that this will assist the\nnew Government in its efforts to rebuild Liberia\u2019s\neconomy and contribute towards the promotion of peace\nand stability in the region.\n15\n\n\nKenya welcomes the recent movements towards the\nresumption of negotiations by the parties to the conflict in\nthe Middle East. We wish to urge them to honour in good\nfaith the Oslo agreements they have entered into and to\nrefrain from activities that have the potential of\nundermining the peace process. There is a need for the\nGovernment of Israel and the Palestinian Authority to\nresume dialogue in order to resolve all outstanding issues.\nKenya will continue to support the parties in their search\nfor a just, durable and comprehensive peace.\nWe also welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative in\nCyprus and the efforts of the international community to\nbring the parties to the negotiating table. In this respect, we\napplaud the face-to-face intercommunal talks held in\nSwitzerland on 11 August last. The world would like to see\nboth the Greek and Turkish Cypriots resolve their problem\nof more than two decades. There is therefore a need to\nintensify efforts to find a durable solution to that problem.\nWe call upon the international community to also support\nthe talks by exerting pressure on both sides and to refrain\nfrom activities that might be seen as impeding the peace\nprocess.\nThe humanitarian emergencies accompanying these\nconflicts require an urgent response from the international\ncommunity. Thousands of people are affected in one way\nor another. Refugees and displaced persons are experiencing\nvarying degrees of suffering on a daily basis. While\nreiterating our support for the work of the Office of the\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees and of the international\ncommunity, we feel that it is vital to enhance closer\ncoordination and cooperation between all actors to facilitate\nthe complementarity of efforts.\nWe are committed to the promotion of universal\nhumanitarian principles and international humanitarian law.\nKenya, indeed, has been host to thousands of refugees from\nour region. We have stretched our meagre resources to\naccommodate the refugees but regret that some of them\nhave abused our hospitality and caused problems of\ninsecurity in our own country. We urge the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees to work closely with the\nGovernment of Kenya in monitoring and verifying the\ngenuineness of the refugees in order to address this\nproblem.\nKenya and other African countries have contributed\ntroops to various United Nations peacekeeping missions\nworldwide. We view the reluctance by the international\ncommunity to support operations in Africa as a departure\nfrom the Charter responsibilities of the United Nations. We\nrecognize that concerted efforts by the countries affected\nand others in the region are necessary in the settlement of\nconflicts. The involvement of regional organizations in the\nprevention, management and resolution of conflicts should\ntherefore not entail any derogation of the responsibilities\nof the United Nations. We wish to reaffirm that the role\nof peacekeeping and peace enforcement throughout the\nworld must remain the responsibility of the United\nNations and in particular of the Security Council, in\naccordance with the Charter. In this respect, Africa\nexpects to see swift handling of the conflict in the Congo\n(Brazzaville), in much the same way as was the case in\nthe Balkans.\nMy country welcomes the results of the Oslo\nDiplomatic Conference on an International Total Ban on\nAnti-Personnel Landmines. This constitutes a significant\ncontribution to the realization of ending the use of\nweapons that have wreaked havoc in many parts of the\nworld. Kenya commends the international community for\nits efforts to bring to an end the use of these deadly\nweapons.\nA prominent feature in recent years has been the\nincreasing globalization of the world economy. Although\nthe global economy continues to show modest growth,\nwith the highest performance being experienced in East\nAsia, Africa\u2019s economy still lags behind. The continent\nremains highly vulnerable to adverse international\neconomic policies and natural calamities due to its limited\ncapacity to respond. The economy is characterized by\npoverty and underdevelopment. The per capita incomes\nare the lowest in the world, and most of the countries are\nunable to feed their growing population. At the same\ntime, the marginalization of the continent continues, with\nunsustainable external debt being a major factor.\nWe welcome the measures taken by the international\ncommunity at the bilateral and multilateral levels to\nmitigate the debt burden. It is evident, however, that\nAfrica\u2019s indebtedness continues to be a major constraint\nin the economic development of the continent despite\nefforts by many countries to implement economic\nreforms. These efforts have not met with adequate\nbilateral and multilateral financial support, resulting in\nlimited prospects for economic growth. We underscore\nthat the reduction or cancellation of both the bilateral and\nmultilateral debt of the heavily indebted countries needs\nserious consideration. Kenya urges the international\ncommunity to seriously address the external debt crisis.\n16\n\n\nIn addition, we regret that the agreed official\ndevelopment assistance target of 0.7 per cent has not been\nmet by most donor countries but has, as a matter of fact,\ndeclined to approximately 0.25 per cent. Hence, the\nimplementation of the United Nations Agenda for\nDevelopment should address all these issues and place\nAfrica in its proper perspective. We appeal to the\nindustrialized countries to reverse the declining trend in\nofficial development assistance and to honour their\ncommitments by attaining the agreed target. Kenya believes\nthat to achieve good results, development must be people-\noriented and involve all actors, with emphasis on human\nresource development, application of science and\ntechnology, and the creation of employment and income-\ngenerating opportunities.\nAfrica has abundant human and natural resources,\nwhich, if properly harnessed, could generate wealth for the\npeople of the continent. Kenya is committed to the\npromotion of South-South cooperation and urges that\nnecessary measures be taken to ensure effective\ncollaboration. In this regard, Kenya and other countries of\nthe region are promoting regional cooperation in order to\nintegrate our economies in the long run. We wish to appeal\nto our partners to complement these efforts by intensifying\ntechnical and financial support. We underscore that without\nsocial and economic progress it is difficult to achieve\npeace.\nThe liberalization of trade regimes and the promotion\nof an open and secure multilateral trading system are vital\nrequirements for the acceleration of economic development.\nAs a member of the World Trade Organization, Kenya is\ncommitted to the liberalization of both trade and investment\nregimes. In this regard, unilateral protectionist actions,\nwhich are inconsistent with multilateral trade agreements,\nshould not be allowed to interfere with these arrangements.\nKenya is committed to the implementation of the\noutcomes of the various United Nations conferences, such\nas the Rio United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, the Cairo International Conference on\nPopulation and Development, the Copenhagen World\nSummit for Social Development, the Beijing Fourth World\nConference on Women, the Istanbul United Nations\nConference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) and the\nRome World Food Summit, among others. We are\ndisappointed that the outcome of these conferences has to\na large extent remained unimplemented. In the course of\nimplementing Agenda 21, my country has initiated\ninnovative steps to protect and preserve the ecosystem.\nThese include public awareness programmes, environmental\neducation and the Great Rift Valley Conservancy\nProgramme, which ensures integrated utilization of land.\nWe urge the international community to honour their\ncommitments by making available new and additional\nresources for the attainment of the intended objectives.\nAs the United Nations continues to introduce\nmeasures to ensure reduction of waste, it is imperative\nthat the Organization ensure maximal and rational use of\nthe existing facilities within the United Nations system.\nAs host to the only United Nations headquarters in the\ndeveloping world, we are concerned that the facilities at\nthe Nairobi offices are underutilized. In this regard,\nKenya wishes to see maximal utilization of the facilities\navailable in Nairobi, the headquarters of the United\nNations Environment Programme (UNEP) and of the\nUnited Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat).\nWe therefore wish to urge that General Assembly\nresolutions requiring meetings to be held at their\nrespective headquarters should, to the extent possible, be\nadhered to.\nWe are further concerned that both UNEP and\nHabitat suffer from inadequate funding despite their\nenormous potential. We note that these two United\nNations bodies need to be strengthened by streamlining\ntheir administrative and financial management. Above all,\nthey require adequate and predictable financial resources\nfrom all sources in order to fulfil their mandates. In this\ncontext, we would like to request the Secretary-General\nto expedite the implementation of measures expected to\nrevitalize the two institutions. In addition, we wish to\nappeal to the donor community to honour their financial\ncommitments and release any blocked funds to enhance\nthe effective operation of UNEP and Habitat. Kenya will\ncontinue to ensure that the United Nations offices in\nNairobi operate in a smooth environment.\nThe challenges facing the Organization in the next\nmillennium are many and complex. It is imperative that\nthe Organization be restructured to enable it respond\nadequately to new priorities and challenges. In this\nrespect, we wish to commend the Secretary-General for\nunveiling reform measures and proposals that will form\nthe basis of our discussion. We urge the Secretary-\nGeneral to speedily implement measures within his\nmandate to reduce waste and ensure effective utilization\nof existing facilities and better coordination and\ncooperation within the United Nations.\nKenya is committed to the reform of the United\nNations and will continue to participate actively in the\n17\n\n\ndebate. We expect that the reforms will be carried out with\ntransparency, and in full compliance with the democratic\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter. In our view, the\nOrganization requires not radical transformation but rather\nthe strengthening and modification of its structures and\norgans to enhance its effectiveness.\nIn reforming the United Nations, it is of paramount\nimportance for Member States to recognize that unpaid\ncontributions constitute a major obstacle to the effectiveness\nof the Organization. We are concerned that the United\nNations is facing a financial crisis which is due basically to\nMember States not honouring their Charter obligations. For\nthe United Nations to fulfil its mandate effectively, there is\nneed for stable, predictable and adequate financing. We\ntherefore urge Member States to take concrete action to\nclear their arrears without conditionalities. Furthermore,\nadjustment of the scale of assessments ought to be the\nresult of a collective decision to redistribute the financial\nburden while bearing in mind the principle of capacity to\npay.\nKenya considers that the Security Council should be\nreformed to make it possible to achieve transparency,\naccountability, democratization and balanced regional\nrepresentation. We reaffirm the position of the Organization\nof African Unity calling for the enlargement of the Council\nin both categories of membership to a total of 26 seats. We\nreiterate that Africa should be allocated at least two\npermanent and five non-permanent seats in the reformed\nCouncil.\nWe also support reforms in the economic and social\nfields which should enhance complementarity and better\ncoordination of the activities of the Council. The Economic\nand Social Council should assume effective coordination of\ninternational policies and the activities of the specialized\nagencies. Further, it should ensure mobilization of resources\nfor the operational activities which are critical for the\nachievement of socio-economic development. We are\nconvinced that strengthening and revitalizing the functions\nof the Economic and Social Council will accelerate\ndevelopment, particularly in the areas of poverty alleviation,\nenvironment degradation, health and humanitarian\nassistance, among other areas.\nI should like to conclude my statement by reaffirming\nKenya\u2019s readiness to support measures that will strengthen\nthe United Nations and turn it into a more focused and\nintegrated Organization able to steer humanity into the next\nmillennium. Let us all strive to make the Organization more\neffective in serving mankind in the years to come. We are\ndetermined to make our contribution.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, Sir, to express\nto you and to your delegation our sincere congratulations on\nyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-second session. As you are an experienced United\nNations diplomat, we entertain great expectations of your\ntenure of office as President of the Assembly.\nWe wish also to pay tribute to the outgoing\nPresident, His Excellency Ambassador Razali Ismail of\nMalaysia, whose stewardship of the fifty-first session will\nforever be remembered for its creativity and dynamism.\nWe wish him well and thank him and his country,\nMalaysia, for a job well done.\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, deserves in\nample measure our gratitude for the professionalism he\nhas demonstrated thus far in his leadership of the United\nNations. His reports on the work of the Organization and\non the wide-ranging reform of the United Nations system\nrenew the confidence and trust we reposed in him when\nwe elected him only nine months ago.\nWe live in a rapidly changing world. The past few\nyears have witnessed an unprecedented expansion of\nworld trade and commerce, and the trend continues\nunabated. National boundaries are being transcended with\nease in the interaction of national economies through a\nprocess which has been christened globalization. In the\ninternational political arena, there is increasing unanimity\namongst the community of nations and other global actors\nthat narrow national interests should be superseded by\nuniversal interests.\nThese complex changes in the world outlook call for\nan enhanced role for the United Nations in international\naffairs lest change become brutal, especially for the\ndeveloping countries. The United Nations has gained new\ninternational stature in recent years, thanks to the\nextirpation of the politics of paralysis of the cold-war era.\n\u201cBlue Helmets\u201d are today being deployed in situations\nformerly considered to be outside the range of the\nresponsibility of the United Nations for the maintenance\nof international peace and security.\nThe United Nations has also built international\nconsensus through a series of conferences and meetings\non areas and issues as diverse as women and\ndevelopment, youth, the environment, human rights,\nageing, population, social development and human\nsettlements, education and health, the outcome of which\nwill guide the thinking and actions of the international\ncommunity into the next millennium. Furthermore, the\nUnited Nations has proved its capability to deal\neffectively with the serious threats posed by nuclear,\nchemical and biological weapons, a capability which is\noften frustrated by a lack of political will and\ncommitment on the part of Member States.\n8\n\n\nIn short, in the present-day reality, no one country, big\nor small, rich or poor, weak or powerful, can exist in\nisolation or act unilaterally without suffering the\nconsequences of its actions. Terrorism, drug trafficking,\ncross-border crime, the depletion of the ozone layer, acid\nrain, receding rain forests, advancing deserts, diminishing\nfresh-water reserves, poverty, disease and many more\nrecognize no national boundaries; only collective action by\nthe States Members of the Organization can arrest and\nreverse their advance.\nThe United Nations is the mother of genuine\nmultilateralism, and it should occupy centre stage in our\nthinking about international relations. The heavy\nresponsibilities reposed in the world body by present-day\ninternational realities demand that the United Nations\nsystem should undergo substantial reform if it is to respond\nmore efficiently and effectively to the needs and concerns\nof its Member States and their peoples, now and in the\nfuture. The United Nations system needs to be streamlined\nto remove administrative bottlenecks, weed out corruption\nand other malpractices and eliminate duplication in the\nactivities of its organs, agencies, programmes, funds and\noffices.\nIt is in that spirit that Botswana welcomes the recent\nreform initiatives of the Secretary-General as the basis for\nfurther discussion and debate on the reform process. My\ndelegation will have occasion to pronounce itself on the\nvarious elements of the reform package in due course. At\nthis juncture, I can only observe that Botswana is disposed\nto a holistic consideration of the package by the General\nAssembly. The reform proposals constitute a single unit,\nand its constituent parts should be discussed with that\nunderstanding in mind.\nThis means, therefore, that those elements of the\npackage \u2014 the greatest number, we would hope \u2014 which\nare acceptable to the majority of delegations, or on which\ngeneral consensus is attained, should be implemented\nforthwith. True, many of the proposals are indeed\nrevolutionary, as the Secretary-General himself concedes,\nand, if approved, they would in a positive sense change\npermanently the way the Organization operates. The reform\npackage is the broadest and most extensive in the history of\nthe United Nations and, in my view, is an appropriate\nresponse to the magnitude of the clamour for reform which\nhas echoed through the halls of this Organization and which\nfor some time now has even threatened its very existence.\nIt would have been the height of absurdity for my\ndelegation to have expected the whole reform package to be\nagreeable or acceptable to every delegation in this Hall,\nbut I find the arguments and complaints from some\nquarters that the package does not go far enough\npreposterous to say the least. Reform, as the Secretary-\nGeneral rightly reminds us, is not an event but a process.\nReform should not and must not be apocalyptic. It cannot\nand must not become synonymous with the downsizing of\nthe Organization to the extent that it would deprive it of\nthe requisite human and material resources to render\nservices to Member States, especially the developing\ncountries.\nSuch reform would be inimical to the efficacy of the\nUnited Nations. Reform should lead to a more efficient,\nmore effective and more relevant United Nations, that is\na United Nations with a capacity to foresee and respond\nadequately and expeditiously to imminent disaster\nsituations around the world and to other needs and\nconcerns of humankind today.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s reform proposals have\nsignalled the direction to take in the reform process; it is\nthe collaborative response of the Member States which is\nawaited. I believe we are all very serious about reform of\nthe United Nations; now is the time to approve and\nimplement those reform proposals on which there is\ngeneral consensus. Our commitment, seriousness and\nsincerity about United Nations reform would increasingly\nbe called into doubt if by the beginning of the fifty-third\nsession of the Assembly we had not implemented any of\nthe reform proposals contained in the Secretary-General\u2019s\nreform package.\nNo one country, region or group of countries can\narrogate to itself the right to dictate the reform agenda.\nWhat should be established is a balanced, equitable and\nnon-discriminatory reform agenda in which the common\nwishes and interests of every Member State can find\nexpression. This is the guiding principle my delegation\nwill follow in its contribution to the ongoing reform\nprocess.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s reform package is not the\nonly momentous issue in the United Nations reform\nprocess. Close to four years have elapsed, and the debate\non Security Council reform continues without an end in\nsight. It is obvious that, unless we can suddenly acquire\nSolomonic wisdom, we are unlikely to come to a\nsuccessful conclusion of this debate in another four years\n9\n\n\nor even much longer. Yet there has emerged a body of\nthought which favours an increase in the membership of the\nSecurity Council, in both the permanent and non-permanent\nmember categories, to reflect the configuration of today\u2019s\ninternational political realities.\nBotswana was a member of the Security Council until\nthe end of last year, and we are convinced more than ever\nbefore that the composition of the membership of the\nSecurity Council, as well as its working methods and\nprocedures, needs reform. It is time for the debate on\nSecurity Council reform to be brought to a successful\nconclusion, so that all geographical regions can be equitably\nrepresented in the Council. We should not allow the debate\nto become sterile or degenerate into a dialogue between the\ndeaf and the dumb.\nThe financial health of the Organization is another\nissue which remains a source of deep concern and anguish\nto my delegation. The United Nations cannot be expected\nto deliver the goods without the necessary financial\nlifeblood. In other words, the United Nations cannot operate\non the basis of a shoestring budget and be expected to carry\nout the heavy responsibilities imposed on it every day by\nMember States. It is therefore imperative that each and\nevery Member State should meet its financial obligations to\nthis Organization on time, in full and without any\nconditionalities, and clear all its arrears as a matter of\nurgency.\nThe international community has made considerable\nprogress in the struggle for democracy around the world\nsince the end of the cold war. Today, peoples and nations\nacross the spectrum of the African continent live in relative\npeace and tranquillity and are engaged in the reconstruction\nof their national economies, thanks to the emergence of a\ndemocratic culture. In spite of these positive developments,\nthe reality is that Africa is still bedeviled by deadly\nconflicts.\nHowever, we are happy to acknowledge that fighting\nhas ceased in Liberia. The Liberian people have at long last\nfreely chosen their leaders, and their verdict was respected.\nThe long-suffering and economically plundered\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo today enjoys relative\npeace and security after a short but devastating crisis that\nended with the overthrow of a 32-year dictatorship. The\npeople of the Democratic Republic of Congo need the\nunderstanding and sympathy of the international community\nas they grapple with the reconstruction of their country.\nThe final settlement of the conflict in Angola\ncontinues to elude the international community, but, thank\nGod, there has been no resumption of hostilities so far.\nProgress is painfully slow, due to the failure by UNITA\nto honour its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol, and\nespecially its refusal to disarm and demobilize its forces.\nThe United Nations should monitor the situation in\nAngola very closely to ensure that the present slow\nprogress does not assume a state of permanence or lead\nto a reversal of the gains made so far under the Lusaka\nprocess.\nThe international community should continue to pay\ncloser attention to the situation in Somalia and help the\nSomali parties hold a peace conference through which\nthey can settle, once and for all, their long-running\nfratricidal conflict.\nThere is a renewed sense of expectation that the\nefforts deployed to resolve the conflict in Western Sahara\nwill bear fruit. It is our hope and wish that the Secretary-\nGeneral, through his Personal Envoy, Mr. James Baker,\nwill achieve a breakthrough which will lead to the final\nsettlement of the Western Sahara conflict in the very near\nfuture.\nThe situation in Sierra Leone is troubling. The\noverthrow of a democratically elected Government in\nSierra Leone five months ago was a most unfortunate\nreversal of the political gains that had been achieved in\nthat country. The international community has taken the\ncorrect line in making it clear that it will no longer\ntolerate any military dictatorships. The rejection and\nisolation of the military junta in Sierra Leone should\nserve as a warning to military leaders with similar designs\nthat military rule is unacceptable, whatever the\njustification. The ballot, and not the bullet, should be the\nonly way through which political leadership can change\nhands.\nWhile the situation in the Balkans remains generally\ntense, there is a light at the end of the tunnel signalling\nthe arrival of a new era of national reconciliation in the\nconstituent States of the former Yugoslavia. The time has\ncome for the various ethnic groups in the former\nYugoslavia to realize that none of their countries can exist\nas an ethnically pure State without causing political\ntensions and reawakening centuries-old hatreds. Their\nfuture and destinies are, fortunately or unfortunately,\ninextricably intertwined by reason of geography and\nhistory. They should accept their fate for what it is.\nConflict and war have failed to resolve the ethnic\n10\n\n\ncomposition of these States in the past, and are unlikely to\nresolve them in the future.\nWe salute the Secretary-General for his recent\ninitiative which brought together the leaders of the two\nsides in the Cyprus conflict in New York for talks. We\nencourage him to continue his good offices until the parties\nreach a final solution to this decades old conflict.\nBotswana supports the Middle East peace process.\nExperience has shown that peace in that complex cauldron\nof conflict cannot be achieved through war and bloodshed.\nOnly painstaking and rigorous negotiations conducted in an\natmosphere of give and take can lead to the desired result:\nthe peace that everyone is yearning for in the Middle East.\nWe hope that the State of Israel will realize the\ninsensitivity of the construction of new settlements on\nPalestinian lands. This has contributed in no small measure\nto the current crisis in the Middle East peace process. No\neffort should be spared to put the Middle East peace\nprocess back on track so that the hopes and aspirations of\nthe ordinary peoples of that region to live together in peace\nas good neighbours may be realized.\nWe welcome the ongoing talks between the two\nKoreas, in which China and the United States are also\nparticipants. It is our ardent hope that the talks will lead to\na decrease in political tensions in the Korean peninsula, and\nthat the two Koreas will henceforth establish some common\nground which will assist in the eventual reunification of\ntheir divided country.\nI wish to welcome the recent conclusion of the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on\nTheir Destruction. I wish the Convention enjoyed the\nsupport of all nations. Anti-personnel mines are diabolical\nand cowardly instruments of warfare which indiscriminately\nkill and maim their unsuspecting victims. They should have\nbeen banned a long time ago, before they claimed more\nlives and maimed many people. It is our fervent desire that\nthe Convention will soon enjoy the support of all Member\nStates. It is hoped that the experience gained in the\ncampaign for the elaboration and conclusion of this\nConvention will be extended to all weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nSeveral developing countries are still wrestling with\ndaunting economic and social problems. The number of\ncountries whose people still live in abject poverty and lack\nbasic nourishment is on the rise, especially in Africa.\nRegrettably, multilateral assistance is declining rapidly in\nrelation to the rising poverty in the developing countries.\nOnly a handful of developed countries meet the agreed\ngoal of 0.7 per cent of gross national product to official\ndevelopment assistance. At the same time, private capital\nflows have been directed to only a few countries. The\nUnited Nations funds and programmes are also unable to\nimplement their respective mandates due to lack of\nresources. It is important that this trend be not only\narrested but reversed through strengthened international\ncooperation for development.\nFor meaningful development to take root in the\ndeveloping countries, an enabling international\nenvironment should be established which can address\nsuch issues as macroeconomic stability, more open trade\nregimes in developed countries, stable financial systems,\nreasonable debt initiatives, such as those proposed under\nthe World Bank\u2019s Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt\nInitiative, and greater financial flows from developed\ncountries to the developing countries. The international\ncommunity must also make concerted efforts to support\nthe development programmes of the developing countries\nin capacity-building, infrastructure and manpower\ndevelopment.\nObviously, there will be an absolute need for a\nturnaround in the political and economic orientation of the\ndeveloped countries in favour of global prosperity if these\nobjectives are to be realized. It is such enlightened\nthinking, which promises economic and political rewards\nto the greatest number of the Member States of the\nUnited Nations, which is absent in the development\nbureaucracies of many developed countries.\nAs always, our faith in the United Nations as a\nrepository of the hopes and aspirations of humankind is\ngenuine, deep-rooted and unassailable. We are a young\nand developing country in a troubled world \u2014 a world\ncaught between the extremes of rampant globalization and\nresurgent isolationism. Our survival rests with this global\nOrganization and its Charter, to which we pledge our\nunstinting commitment and loyalty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nGovernment and people of the Republic of Trinidad and\nTobago, I have the distinct pleasure and honour to extend\nsincere congratulations to you, Sir, and to the Government\nof Ukraine on your election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at this fifty-second session. I am\nconfident that, under your able leadership, the urgent and\nimportant issues which face the General Assembly at this\ncritical time in the history of the United Nations will be\nadvanced.\nI would also like to express my profound\nappreciation to your predecessor, Ambassador Razali\nIsmail of Malaysia, for his excellent stewardship over the\nlast session. His inimitable and dynamic style has left a\ndistinctive mark on the modus operandi of the General\nAssembly. Ambassador Ismail deserves our\ncommendation for his efforts to advance the work of the\nGeneral Assembly on issues such as the reform of the\nSecurity Council, the Agenda for Development and the\nnineteenth special session of the General Assembly to\nreview and appraise the implementation of Agenda 21.\nTrinidad and Tobago remains committed to the\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\nToday, as we approach the twenty-first century and a new\nrange of issues demands our attention as nation States,\nour commitment to the United Nations is no less focused,\nno less poignant. Trinidad and Tobago continues to\nbelieve in the efficacy of the United Nations, a body now\nat a critical point in its evolution. We applaud Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan, who has presented perhaps the most\nextensive reform proposals in the history of the\nOrganization. A restructured Organization will be better\npoised to respond more readily to the challenges of the\nnext century. There is no doubt about the need of the\ninternational community for the United Nations. No other\nbody remotely approximates its universality of\nmembership and it remains the most appropriate forum\nfor addressing the interrelated issues of peace, security\nand sustainable development.\nWhile the international community must address\nthese perennial issues, we need at the same time to\nconfront the daunting tasks of providing humanitarian\n5\n\n\nassistance and reconstructive aid and ensuring the\npromotion of good governance, democracy and human\nrights. In this post-cold-war period, the United Nations\nmust strive to build an international community based on\npeace, justice, equity, democracy and the rule of\ninternational law.\nTrinidad and Tobago is concerned about the rise in\npolitical conflicts and tensions and the unresolved long-\nstanding disputes which continue to threaten international\npeace and security. Increased efforts must be made by the\ninternational community to address these conflicts through\npeaceful means. Trinidad and Tobago wishes to restate its\ncommitment to the non-use of force in the conduct of\ninternational relations and the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes. We will continue to support United Nations-led\npeacekeeping missions and do our part to further\ndemocracy, as exemplified by our participation in the\nelection processes in such countries as Haiti, El Salvador,\nNicaragua, Namibia and South Africa.\nThis General Assembly will address yet again the\ncontinuing quest for a just and lasting peace in the Middle\nEast. At this delicate period in the peace process, Trinidad\nand Tobago believes that durable peace will be achieved\nonly if all parties to the dispute adhere to the relevant\nUnited Nations resolutions and implement the agreements\nand guarantees to which they have committed themselves\nin bilateral and multilateral negotiations.\nWe in the Caribbean region appreciate the support\ngiven by the international community to the Government\nand people of Haiti. This support has contributed to the\nprogress made so far in the building of democracy and the\nstrengthening of its institutions. We are convinced that the\nrecent decision to extend the mandate of the United Nations\nTransition Mission in Haiti was necessary to consolidate\ngains already made. We must continue to provide material\nand other support to strengthen Haiti\u2019s democracy and its\neconomic development. These are necessary pillars for the\nestablishment of durable peace and stability in that country.\nTrinidad and Tobago, as a member of the Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM), pledges to continue to do its part\nin consolidating this process. It is in this context that we\nwelcomed Haiti as the fifteenth member State of\nCARICOM at the meeting last July of the Heads of\nGovernment of CARICOM, which was held in Montego\nBay in Jamaica. Trinidad and Tobago continues to\nparticipate in the efforts of the international community in\nthis transition period, as evidenced by the fact that a\nTrinidad and Tobago national, Ambassador Colin\nGranderson, is the Executive Director of the Organization\nof American States/United Nations International Civilian\nMission in Haiti. It will also be recalled that Trinidad and\nTobago, as part of a hemispheric effort, participated in the\nmilitary mission that restored the democratically elected\nPresident to Haiti and our efforts have continued at both\nthe civilian and military levels after that objective was\nachieved.\nIn the post-cold-war era, the world has witnessed an\nescalation in the abuse of human rights, including some\ncases of genocide and other heinous crimes against\nhumanity. Trinidad and Tobago has always been\nconcerned about such atrocities. Trinidad and Tobago is\nproud of the role it played in reintroducing on the\ninternational political and legal agenda the question of the\nestablishment of a permanent international criminal court.\nThe Government of my country is heartened by the\nincreasing support for the establishment of the\ninternational criminal court and we welcome the\nsubstantial progress made thus far by the Preparatory\nCommittee for its establishment. Trinidad and Tobago\nurges Member States to continue their constructive and\nactive participation during the forthcoming sessions of the\nPreparatory Committee. We further urge wider\ninvolvement in the process so as to ensure the successful\nnegotiation of a widely acceptable statute, which will be\nfinalized at a conference of plenipotentiaries to be held in\nRome in the summer of 1998.\nIt is because of this concern for the promotion and\nprotection of human rights and our absolute condemnation\nof acts of genocide and crimes against humanity that\nTrinidad and Tobago participated at the highest level\nthrough our President, Mr. Arthur N. R. Robinson, at a\nconference in Italy on reining in impunity for\ninternational crimes and serious violations of fundamental\nhuman rights. That conference addressed issues pertaining\nto the ongoing work of the Preparatory Committee and\nunanimous support was expressed for a permanent\ninternational criminal court to ensure that perpetrators of\nsuch crimes are brought to justice.\nLinked to the considerations of peace and security\nare the myriad socio-economic problems which continue\nto undermine the stability of our nations. In this regard,\nthe international community has sought to respond by\nconvening a series of world conferences to analyse the\nglobal situation and provide blueprints for action at the\nnational, regional and international levels.\n6\n\n\nA continuing concern for the Government of Trinidad\nand Tobago remains the failure on the part of the\ninternational community to provide adequate resources for\nthe accelerated implementation of the commitments made\nat these conferences. Any reform of the United Nations\nsystem aimed at delivering mandated programmes in a\nmore efficient manner must therefore take this factor into\naccount.\nThe World Summit for Social Development, which\nwas held in Copenhagen in 1995, highlighted the urgent\nneed to eradicate poverty and to develop policies to\npromote social and economic equity. In October 1996, as a\nfollow-up to the World Summit for Social Development, a\nCaribbean Ministerial Meeting on Poverty Eradication was\nheld in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. The assembled\nMinisters developed a Plan of Action on poverty\neradication, which is guiding Governments of the region in\nthe elaboration of their own national plans. In this regard,\nthe Government of Trinidad and Tobago has adopted and\nis vigilantly pursuing as one of its primary objectives a\npolicy of sustained economic growth with equity, with\nspecial emphasis on poverty eradication.\nMy Government recognizes the central role of\neducation and its impact on the eradication of poverty and\nwe have begun to reform the curriculum to give all children\nequal access to quality education as we strive continuously\nin Trinidad and Tobago towards achieving a \u201ctotal quality\nnation\u201d. Education, in itself, is central to the Government\u2019s\nobjective of producing a total quality nation, in which all\nour citizenry strives for excellence, is committed to the\nhighest standards, is technologically equipped to deal with\nthe realities of a knowledge-based work environment and is\nafforded opportunities for life-long learning.\nIn addition, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago\nhas established mechanisms for addressing the scourge of\npoverty and societal inequities through the following\ninitiatives.\nFirst, we established a change-management unit for\npoverty eradication and equity-building, which reports to a\nMinisterial Council on Social Development. This Council\nwas launched in October 1996, with the assistance of the\nPoverty Strategies Initiative of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP). The Government\napplauds UNDP\u2019s support.\nSecondly, we set up a Committee on Social\nDisplacement. The Committee\u2019s terms of reference include\nthe development of holistic plans to provide relief to all\nhomeless and destitute persons.\nThirdly, expenditure on several other social safety-\nnet schemes has been significantly increased in order to\ndeal with problems and issues affecting women, the\nelderly, children, adolescents, the disabled and the\ndispossessed.\nThese measures have been recognized and indeed\nreflected by UNDP in its 1997 Human Development\nReport, which lists Trinidad and Tobago at the top of the\nhuman poverty index rankings. According to the Report,\nTrinidad and Tobago is among those countries which\nhave reduced human poverty to a human poverty index\nvalue of less than 10 per cent.\nWe must all continue to support efforts for the\neradication of poverty in accordance with agreed\nprogrammes and plans of action. The assault on poverty,\nespecially rural poverty, must take into account the\nspecial needs of women and their full integration in the\ndevelopment process.\nTrinidad and Tobago therefore welcomes the\nprogress achieved by the United Nations in following up\nthe Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing\nin September 1995, which had as one of its primary\nobjectives the need to accord high priority to gender\nissues. It welcomes as well the appointment of a high-\nlevel official as a special adviser to the Secretary-General\non gender issues and the advancement of women.\nSocial and economic problems transcend national\nboundaries and therefore require international solutions\nbased on strengthened global partnerships to support\naction. When the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago,\nThe Honourable Basdeo Panday, addressed the fifty-first\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly, he\nidentified a number of social problems which pose a\nparticular threat to the stability and integrity of small\nStates. Among the problems he mentioned were drug\nabuse and drug trafficking and the associated problems of\nmoney laundering and trafficking in small arms, as well\nas terrorism and social disintegration.\nTrinidad and Tobago therefore welcomes the\nconvening of the special session of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly on illicit drugs, to be held in New\nYork in June 1998. This session should provide an\nappropriate opportunity for Governments to review\nprogress made in implementing the Global Programme of\n7\n\n\nAction on drugs adopted in February 1990 and serve to\nintensify drug-control strategies and cooperation worldwide.\nThe drug scourge and its attendant consequences\nrequire action at different levels. To that end, Caribbean\nGovernments have decided to establish a criminal justice\nprotection programme that would facilitate cooperation in\nthe confidential protection of witnesses, jurors, judicial and\nlaw enforcement personnel and their families. If this\nprogramme is to be successfully implemented, additional\ntraining and technical assistance from the international\ncommunity and agencies such as the United Nations\nInternational Drug Control Programme will be required.\nThe United Nations has a critical role to play, but it is\nthe responsibility \u2014 indeed, the duty \u2014 of every State to\nact aggressively in this regard. Conscious of its\nresponsibility, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago has\nembarked upon initiatives to curb the illicit drug trade and\neradicate the associated downstream activity of money\nlaundering.\nThese initiatives are in keeping with international\nconventions and declarations, such as the United Nations\nConvention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and\nPsychotropic Substances, the Commonwealth Scheme\nrelating to Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and the\nInter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in\nCriminal Matters. Trinidad and Tobago has also entered\ninto bilateral agreements with other countries to foster\ncooperation with regard to arresting the growth of\ntransnational crimes associated with trafficking.\nOur Government has declared its commitment to\neliminating the threats to the stability, security and safety\nof our society that emanate from the scourge of the illicit\ndrug trade. Some of the measures taken include the\nfollowing.\nThe first measure is the signing of an agreement on\nmaritime counter-drug operations with the United States of\nAmerica. This bilateral mechanism has already proved to be\nvery effective in dealing with the pernicious drug trade.\nThe second measure is the extension of the\nGovernment\u2019s powers of extradition and the negotiation of\nagreements with countries with which it does not now have\nextradition agreements. We are renegotiating existing\nagreements to make extradition procedures more effective.\nTrinidad and Tobago is also fulfilling its obligations under\nexisting extradition treaties.\nThe third measure is the serious implementation of\nmoney- laundering drug laws. The illicit gains of the drug\ntrade and the resource base of drug criminals are being\nattacked. The property and profits of drug lords are being\nconfiscated as a result of measures which have been\nintroduced in my country.\nAlso, a task force to counter narcotics and money\nlaundering has been established and the Government is\npursuing law reform in the area of bank secrecy.\nAnother measure is that Trinidad and Tobago \u2014\nwith the cooperation of other CARICOM Governments,\nCanada, Britain and the United States of America \u2014 has\ncreated a witness protection programme. In addition, we\nare establishing the criminal justice protection programme\nto which I alluded earlier.\nFinally, we continue to seek bilateral and multilateral\nassistance in various forms, such as equipment, personnel,\naircraft and maritime support in our relentless fight\nagainst illicit drugs.\nEarlier I referred to the efforts to reform this\nOrganization. One of the key issues that will engage the\nattention of delegations at the fifty-second session is the\nquestion of the reform of the intergovernmental\nmachinery. We are particularly interested in efforts at\nreform and reconstruction, especially as they relate to the\ndevelopment activities of the United Nations. We view\nwith satisfaction the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal,\nintroduced last March, that the new structure of the\nSecretariat should serve to bolster support for Africa\u2019s\ndevelopment, South-South cooperation and the sustainable\ndevelopment of small island States.\nTrinidad and Tobago welcomes the recent decision\nof the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly\nto hold a comprehensive review of the United Nations\nGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States. That Conference, which\nwas held in Barbados in 1994, was of historic\nsignificance, marking as it did the recognition on the part\nof the international community of the special situation and\nneeds of small islands.\nThe Barbados Declaration and Programme of Action\nhave as their overall objective the management of\nenvironmental problems, the management of our vital\nnatural resources and the improvement of human-resource\ncapability and institutional requirements for sustainable\ndevelopment of small island States in the overall context\n8\n\n\nof Agenda 21. We look forward to the full support of the\nUnited Nations and the international community when the\ncomprehensive review and appraisal of the implementation\nof the Barbados Programme of Action takes place in 1999.\nA new phase of international cooperation for the\nCaribbean region was heralded in May 1997 at the first\nmeeting of the secretariats of CARICOM and the United\nNations, from which emanated a work programme for the\nimplementation of special projects. We commend this\ninitiative and are confident that this new relationship will be\nof benefit to the people of the Caribbean region.\nThe volcanic eruptions in Montserrat bring to the fore\nthe vulnerability of small islands to natural disasters. This\nphenomenon and other environmental problems have\nreceived increased recognition since the 1992 Rio\nConference on Environment and Development. Trinidad and\nTobago shares the anguish felt by the citizens of the\nCaribbean island of Montserrat, which is fast becoming\nuninhabitable. CARICOM member States have responded\nwithin their limited capabilities to the disaster, and we will\ncontinue to provide logistic and other support.\nTo this end, Trinidad and Tobago, in response to the\nplight of the Government and people of Montserrat, has\npledged financial and technical assistance, medical and\nother relief and engineering personnel, and has been\ninvolved in the establishment of a CARICOM village in the\nnorthern part of the island of Montserrat \u2014 a decision that\nwas taken at the recent conference of CARICOM Heads of\nGovernment. Within our available resources, Trinidad and\nTobago will continue to be of assistance.\nThe special concerns of small island developing States\nwere also incorporated in the recently adopted Agenda for\nDevelopment. The Agenda recognizes the fact that\neconomic development, social development and\nenvironmental protection are interdependent and mutually\nreinforcing components of sustainable development, and are\nthe basis for the achievement of a higher quality of life for\nall people. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago\nattaches great significance to this issue. We are therefore\npursuing economic, social and infrastructural development\nin a sustainable way which avoids environmental\ndegradation, conserves our natural resource endowment and\nhelps to build and maintain a long-term national capacity to\nsupport rising standards of living for the population, as well\nas opportunities for self-actualization.\nRecent steps to promote sustainable development in\nTrinidad and Tobago in the area of environmental\nmanagement include: the establishment of an\nenvironmental management authority and drafting of a\nnational environmental policy; the development of\nenvironmental standards; the preparation of a water\nresources management strategy; the development of a\nnational parks and watershed management project; and the\ncommissioning of a study to assist in establishing a policy\nframework and facilities for the management of oil and\nhazardous wastes.\nTrinidad and Tobago has also ratified several\ninternational conventions relating to the environment: the\nMontreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone\nLayer; the 1994 United Nations Framework Convention\non Climate Change; the 1994 Basel Convention on the\nControl of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous\nWastes and Their Disposal; and the 1996 Convention on\nBiological Diversity.\nIn the area of macroeconomic policy, we have\nproceeded to liberalize the trade and exchange regimes to\nfoster enhanced competitiveness; streamline the incentive\nframework; privatize State-owned enterprises to promote\nincreasing levels of private investment; promote\nentrepreneurial activity through, among other measures, a\nventure capital regime; and to modernize and strengthen\nintellectual property legislation to encourage investment\nand the transfer of technology.\nIn the social sector, the Government has focused on\nrationalization and restructuring of the social service\ndelivery system; expanding access to education for the\nschool-age population; rationalization and strengthening\nof the health services through the health sector reform\nprogramme; regularization of squatter communities;\nrestructuring of the unemployment relief programme to\nallow for skill acquisition through on-the-job training; the\nestablishment of a community development fund to\nprovide financing for the delivery of basic social services\nand infrastructure to the poor and vulnerable population\ngroups and communities; and the provision of institutional\nsupport for the strengthening of non-governmental\norganizations and community-based organizations to assist\nin this regard.\nTrinidad and Tobago is a cosmopolitan society in\nwhich the human rights of each individual are\nconstitutionally guaranteed. We endeavour to achieve the\ncherished ideal of a truly democratic nation, in which all\npersons live together in harmony, with equal opportunities\nfor all, in order that each individual may contribute to the\nprocess of national development. In this context, one of\n9\n\n\nthe primary goals of the Government of Trinidad and\nTobago has been to seek to wider participation in the\ndecision-making process through a strengthened local\ngovernment machinery in a manner that will promote the\nempowerment of local communities in the pursuit of\ndevelopment efforts and the promotion of good governance.\nIn a similar vein, the United Nations, with the\ndiversity of its membership, must harness individual and\ncollective strengths to advance the interests of all Members\nof the Organization as we move into a new millennium. In\nthis regard, Trinidad and Tobago welcomes the ongoing\ndiscussions aimed at reforming the membership and\nworking procedures of the Security Council. It is our hope\nthat this process will result in a Council whose composition\nmore accurately reflects the wider membership of the\nGeneral Assembly and whose working procedures are more\nopen and inclusive than has previously been the norm.\nWe all need to work steadfastly to improve the image\nof the United Nations from one of goal-setting to one which\nfacilitates prompt action by Members in a manner that is\nconsistent and wide-ranging and takes into account the\nspecial needs of the most vulnerable among us.\nIt is incumbent on all Member States to imbue our\nOrganization with a renewed sense of self-confidence, faith\nand optimism and to work in a global partnership to\nachieve the goals and ideals of the United Nations. We owe\nthis legacy to present and future generations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSouth Africa welcomes your\nelection, Sir, as the President of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-second session. We congratulate you having\nexperienced at first hand your skills and role as Vice-\nChairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid. We\nalso express our appreciation to Ambassador Razali Ismail\nfor his tireless work as President of the General Assembly\nat its fifty-first session.\nMay I also congratulate His Excellency Mr. Kofi\nAnnan on his election as the seventh Secretary-General of\nthe United Nations. The zeal that the Secretary-General\nhas displayed in addressing, through his reform proposals,\nthe difficulties confronting this Organization is\nimpressive. The Secretary-General\u2019s reform programme\nis one that in many respects complements the\nintergovernmental process regarding the revitalization of\nthe Organization.\nThe General Assembly is well aware of the need to\nreform the United Nations. The process of reform should\nproduce a revitalized Organization capable of addressing\nhumanity\u2019s vital issues of peace and security. Central to\nthe process of modernization of the United Nations is the\nrestructuring of the Security Council to redress existing\nimbalances and transform it into a transparent organ\naccountable to the broader membership of the\nOrganization.\nSouth Africa fully supports the Non-Aligned\nMovement\u2019s position that there should be no partial or\nselective expansion in the membership of the Security\nCouncil to the detriment of developing countries.\nThe reaffirmation at the Organization of African\nUnity\u2019s Harare Summit of Africa\u2019s claim to two\npermanent and five non-permanent seats, with the same\npowers and prerogatives enjoyed by the current permanent\nmembers in an expanded Security Council, is consistent\nwith the Charter principle of equitable geographical\nrepresentation. If the Security Council is to fulfil the role\nof custodian of international peace and security envisaged\nfor it in the Charter, it must be perceived to be fully\nlegitimate by States and peoples.\nSouth Africa is therefore of the view that a limited\nexpansion of only five or six new Security Council seats\nwill not fulfil the crucial requirement of transforming the\nSecurity Council into a representative organ.\nCentral to the Security Council reform process is the\nquestion of the veto, which has been a focal point in our\ndeliberations for the last three and a half years. Indeed,\nthe democratization of the Council hinges on the veto\nbeing either eliminated or extended to the new permanent\nmembers. Accordingly, the issue of the status of the veto\nmust of necessity form an integral part of a\ncomprehensive reform package. Permanent membership\nwithout the veto represents merely a symbolic gesture to\nnew permanent members which would serve to perpetuate\n13\n\n\nan unjust and discriminatory practice and accord them an\ninferior status.\nI wish to recall that last year in the General Assembly,\nI registered South Africa\u2019s disappointment with the slow\npace of the debate relating to the reform of the Security\nCouncil. The time has come for us all to display the\nnecessary political will and determination in order to reach\nagreement on a comprehensive set of measures which will\nlead to the creation of a Security Council which is\ntransparent, democratic, accountable and thus credible and\nlegitimate.\nThe fifty-first session of the General Assembly also\nwitnessed the conclusion of the work of the Open-ended\nHigh-level Working Group on the Strengthening of the\nUnited Nations System. Its notable recommendations\nregarding the strengthening of the role and functions of the\nGeneral Assembly attest to the importance which we as\nMember States attach to this body as the supreme political\norgan of the Organization.\nIt is, however, disappointing that on the issue relating\nto the election of a Secretary-General, the Working Group\nwas unable to reach consensus on the recommendation to\nthe permanent members of the Security Council to refrain\nfrom using the veto to block the outcome of the election.\nAs a result of Africa\u2019s painful past experiences under\ncolonial domination, as well as the abhorrent system of\napartheid, my Government is committed to the final\neradication of colonialism and fully supports the effective\nimplementation of the Plan of Action for the International\nDecade for the Eradication of Colonialism. We believe,\ntherefore, that the Committee of 24 should continue its\nwork in order to determine the interests of the peoples of\nNon-Self-Governing Territories regarding their future\npolitical status. We call on the administering Powers to lend\ntheir full cooperation to the Committee.\nSouth Africa is concerned that intra-State conflicts in\nAfrica continue to pose a threat to the continent\u2019s stability.\nThese conflicts lead to loss of life and economic hardships\nand are a major stumbling block on the road towards peace\nand development. It is a matter of concern that conflicts in\nAfrica persist despite the commendable efforts of the\nOrganization of African Unity and of African leaders in\nconflict resolution.\nWe therefore urge parties to the conflict in the\nRepublic of the Congo to observe the ceasefire agreement\nand to make all efforts to ensure that the interim measures\nfor the holding of national elections in 1998 are instituted.\nSimilarly, we condemn the coup in Sierra Leone and\nimplore Member States of the United Nations to support\nAfrica\u2019s efforts to restore constitutional order by\nrefraining from recognizing or giving support in any form\nto the military Government.\nSouth Africa is committed to the promotion of peace\nin Angola, which we believe will contribute to the\nconsolidation and extension of stability to the whole of\nour region of southern Africa. We are therefore concerned\nabout the failure of UNITA to fulfil its obligations under\nthe Lusaka Protocol. In this regard, my Government\nwelcomes the decision of the Security Council to impose\nthe punitive measures envisaged in its resolution 1127\n(1997), as a means of ensuring UNITA\u2019s compliance.\nSouth Africa has followed the unfolding\ndevelopments in the Middle East with cautious optimism.\nSouth Africa, and indeed the international community,\nwelcomed the signing of the Oslo accord by the Palestine\nLiberation Organization and the Israeli Government and\napplauded it as representing a positive step towards the\nfull realization of the long-awaited comprehensive and\njust settlement in the region. But the decision of the\nGovernment of Israel to construct new Jewish settlements\nin Jebel Abu Ghneim has given rise to tensions and has\ngenerated a crisis situation which has reignited conflict in\nthe region. We all know that this decision is a flagrant\nviolation of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and\nof the relevant resolutions of this body. It is no doubt an\nattempt to change the legal status of Jerusalem and to pre-\nempt the final status negotiations.\nThe inalienable right of the Palestinian people to\nself-determination is a prerequisite for achieving a durable\nand comprehensive peace. For peace and stability to\nprevail, the region requires the unconditional withdrawal\nof Israel from all Palestinian and Arab territories occupied\nsince 1967.\nSouth Africa welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s latest\ninitiatives currently under way to seek a lasting solution\nto the question of Cyprus. We urge all parties to make\nconcerted efforts in working with the Secretary-General\nand his good offices towards an overall comprehensive\nsettlement to this question, which has been on the agenda\nof the United Nations for more than 30 years.\nSouth Africa attaches great importance to preventive\ndiplomacy as a means of forestalling the possibility of\nconflict. We commend the report of the Special\n14\n\n\nCommittee on Peacekeeping Operations because it provides\nus with measures aimed at strengthening the role of the\nUnited Nations in peacekeeping. We also welcome the\nCommittee\u2019s 1997 report on peacekeeping operations and\nurge the Committee to address the question of the rapidly\ndeployable mission headquarters and the further\ndevelopment of United Nations standby arrangements.\nSouth Africa believes that progress on disarmament\nissues will create a world free of war. The end of the cold\nwar heralded a period of progress in disarmament and non-\nproliferation, as was evidenced by the entry into force of\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention and the conclusion of\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. However, the\nre-emergence of maximalist positions in the disarmament\ndebate retards global disarmament, as demonstrated by the\ndisappointing progress made at the Conference on\nDisarmament this year. Despite the consensual adoption of\na mandate for the negotiation of a fissile-material cut-off\ntreaty, one of the essential elements for complete nuclear\ndisarmament, little progress has been made. Nevertheless,\nSouth Africa is encouraged by the large number of States\nwhich have committed themselves to the complete\neradication of weapons of mass destruction by joining\nvarious non-proliferation and disarmament treaties during\nthe past year. Universal adherence to important\ndisarmament treaties will pave the way towards a world\nfree of weapons of mass destruction.\nHumanity is faced with the daily threat of harm from\nthe use of conventional weapons. High priority should be\nplaced on strategies and policies intended to prevent the\nproliferation of conventional weapons and to reduce their\nflow to conflict areas. The conclusions reached by the\nUnited Nations Panel of Governmental Experts on Small\nArms lay the foundation for future action by the\ninternational community.\nOn 18 September 1997, the Oslo Diplomatic\nConference adopted the Convention on the Prohibition of\nthe Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\nPersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction. The Convention\nis a clear and total ban on anti-personnel mines and\nestablishes a compelling new international norm against this\nscourge which has for so long afflicted humanity, especially\ninnocent civilians, mostly women and children. South\nAfrica looks forward to the early entry into force of the\nConvention and appeals to all States to heed the call of the\ninternational community against these inhumane weapons.\nSouth Africa has often expressed grave concern at the\ninvolvement of its nationals in mercenary activities, because\nthese activities inhibit the achievement of peaceful\nsolutions to internal conflicts and destabilize regions.\nConsequently, we have drafted legislation to regulate the\nrendering of military assistance by private individuals and\ncompanies to foreign Governments and agencies.\nThe South African Government puts a high premium\non the promotion and protection of human rights as a\ncornerstone of its foreign policy. As we approach the\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights and the thirtieth of the International Year\nfor Human Rights, we reaffirm our commitment to the\npreeminent values of basic human dignity, values for\nwhich we have fought and for which we must continue to\nfight. Our peoples deserve no less. In this context, my\ndelegation supports the recommendation to convene a\nworld conference on racism and racial discrimination,\nxenophobia and related intolerance.\nMy Government remains committed to addressing\ngender inequities. The worst manifestations of these\nunequal gender relations are the acts of violence\ncommitted against women and girls. My Government has\npledged itself to preventing and combating this violence\nby, among other initiatives, aligning its legislation,\npolicies and strategies with international instruments such\nas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination against Women.\nSouth Africa believes in the strengthening of the role\nof the United Nations in the promotion of international\ncooperation for economic and social development. To this\nend, we welcome those measures in the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s proposed reform package which seek to\nstrengthen the capacity of the United Nations and to\nrevitalize its role in the context of development.\nThe adoption of the Agenda for Development by the\nGeneral Assembly was a milestone in our collective\nsearch for a meaningful global partnership for\ndevelopment. That the membership could reach agreement\non so complex a matter is testimony to the seriousness\nwith which States view the issue, and to the dynamics of\nconsensus-building in fostering a global partnership.\nMember States should act to implement the Agenda for\nDevelopment in a coordinated manner, by creating\ndynamic structures susceptible of successful delivery.\nSouth Africa remains committed to an action-\norientated Agenda for Development which gives priority\nto international cooperation for development. Partnerships\n15\n\n\nfor development, as envisaged also in the Midrand\nMinisterial Declaration and Partnership for Growth and\nDevelopment, should be established to ensure effective\ndelivery of assistance to the developing world.\nThe problems of abject poverty and social deprivation\ncontinue to afflict and haunt many countries, particularly in\nthe developing world. In order to address this scourge,\nwhich affects least-developed countries in particular,\neffective and consistent measures need to be undertaken\nwithin the context of the United Nations Decade for the\nEradication of Poverty.\nThe issue of external indebtedness continues to\nfrustrate the ability of the least-developed countries to\npromote economic and social development. It is therefore\nincumbent upon the international community to address and\nfind a solution to this problem as a matter of urgency.\nOne year after the conclusion of the mid-term review\nof the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\nAfrica in the 1990s, we need to take stock and review\nprogress to see if the requisite resource mobilization levels\nare anywhere near being met and whether the central\ndevelopment goals are in place. As with the mid-term\nreview of the New Agenda, this would enable the\ninternational community to take urgent and practical action\non behalf of the African continent to eradicate poverty and\nunderdevelopment.\nWe in southern Africa, as a region whose potential for\ndevelopment was hamstrung by the repressive policies of\napartheid, cannot but seek the promotion of our people\nthrough cooperation. It follows therefore that we should be\ncommitted to the transformation of our Southern African\nDevelopment Community into an institution which provides\na framework for the promotion of the imperatives of\nreconstruction and development. This would enhance the\ndegree to which, individually and collectively, the region\noffers a basis to ensure a better life for all our peoples.\nThe global partnership for sustainable development\nwill be enhanced through the transfer of essential and\nenvironmentally sound technologies to developing States on\npreferential and concessional terms. The financial resources\nand mechanisms necessary for the implementation of\nAgenda 21 are still inadequate. Developed countries should\nhonour their commitment to raise official development\nassistance flows to the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent\nof gross domestic product. Those few countries which have\nachieved this objective are commended.\nWe encourage the promotion and sustainable\nmanagement of the global environment to ensure a higher\nquality of life for all. The objective of sustainable\ndevelopment should be the integration of environmental,\neconomic and social policies in order to meet basic\nhuman needs and to manage the environment on a\nsustainable basis.\nThe disappointing lack of consensus at the special\nsession of the General Assembly on the environment held\nin June 1997 leaves considerable follow-up action to be\nundertaken in order to accelerate the implementation of\nAgenda 21. In this respect, the role and importance of the\nUnited Nations Environment Programme as one of the\nleading United Nations bodies in the field of the\nenvironment should be strengthened.\nWe commend the decision to convene a special\nsession on drugs to deal effectively with the illicit\nproduction, sale, demand, trafficking and distribution of\nnarcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. The special\nsession will offer Member States an opportunity to join\ntheir efforts to combat drug abuse and illicit trafficking.\nSouth Africa strongly favours the early establishment\nof a permanent, independent and effective international\ncriminal court. An opportunity now exists to establish the\ncourt before the turn of the century. We must therefore\nredouble our efforts during the forthcoming sessions of\nthe Preparatory Committee to ensure that the diplomatic\nconference in Rome can complete its work successfully.\nIt is imperative that all Member States continue fully\nto support the international criminal tribunals for Rwanda\nand the former Yugoslavia. To this end, my Government,\nin collaboration with the Parliamentarians for Global\nAction, recently hosted an international workshop on\nsecuring State cooperation and compliance with the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. Its purpose\nwas to review cooperation with the Rwanda Tribunal and\nencourage the enactment of domestic legislation by\nMember States, thus ensuring that those accused of acts\nof genocide are swiftly brought to trial.\nMy Government welcomes efforts to elaborate a\ndraft convention to define terrorism. It is our belief that\nacts of terrorism must be clearly distinguished from\nnational liberation struggles in pursuit of the right to self-\ndetermination by peoples subjected to foreign or colonial\ndomination.\n16\n\n\nI should like to take this opportunity to announce to\nthe Assembly that on 20 August 1997, the South African\nCabinet approved ratification of the United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. South Africa, a country\nwith considerable maritime interests, will, for its part,\ncontinue to play a meaningful and constructive role in the\ngovernance of the world\u2019s oceans.\nThe continuing financial crisis of the Organization is\nof great concern to my delegation. We fully support the\nSecretary-General\u2019s commitment to ending the long and\npersistent near-bankruptcy of the Organization. It behoves\nMember States to discharge their Charter obligation by\npaying their contributions in full, on time and without\nconditions.\nThe lofty ideals that brought us together should\ncontinue to serve as an inspiration for us to strengthen the\nauthority and capacity of the United Nations as we move\ninto the next millennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFive years ago, when I first\naddressed this Assembly, the cold war had only just\nended and the transition to a new era was beginning.\nNow, together, we are making that historic transition.\nBehind us, we leave a century full of humanity's capacity\nfor the worst and its genius for the best. Before us, at the\ndawn of a new millennium, we can envision a new era\nthat escapes the twentieth century's darkest moments,\nfulfils its most brilliant possibilities and crosses frontiers\nyet unimagined.\nWe are off to a promising start. For the first time in\nhistory, more than half the people represented in this\nAssembly freely choose their own Governments. Free\nmarkets are growing, spreading individual opportunity and\nnational well-being. Early in the twenty-first century,\nmore than 20 of this Assembly's members - home to\nhalf the earth's population - will lift themselves from\nthe ranks of low-income nations.\nPowerful forces are bringing us closer together,\nprofoundly changing the way we work, live and relate to\neach other. Every day, millions of our citizens on every\ncontinent use laptops and satellites to send information,\nproducts and money across the planet in seconds. Bit by\nbit, the information age is chipping away at barriers -\neconomic, political and social - that once kept people\nlocked in and ideas locked out. Science is unravelling\nmysteries in the tiniest of human genes and in the vast\ncosmos. Never in the course of human history have we\nhad a greater opportunity to make our people healthier\nand wiser, to protect our planet from decay and abuse and\nto reap the benefits of free markets without abandoning\nthe social contract and its concern for the common good.\nYet today's possibilities are not tomorrow's\nguarantees. We have work to do.\n7\n\n\nThe forces of global integration are a great tide,\ninexorably wearing away the established order of things.\nBut we must decide what will be left in its wake. People\nfear change when they feel its burdens but not its benefits.\nThey are susceptible to misguided protectionism and to the\npoisoned appeals of extreme nationalism, and ethnic, racial\nand religious hatreds. New global environmental challenges\nrequire us to find ways to work together without damaging\nlegitimate aspirations for progress. We are all vulnerable to\nthe reckless acts of rogue States and to an unholy axis of\nterrorists, drug traffickers and international criminals.\nThese twenty-first-century predators feed on the free\nflow of information, ideas and people we cherish. They\nabuse the vast power of technology to build black markets\nfor weapons, to compromise law enforcement with huge\nbribes of illicit cash and to launder money with the\nkeystroke of a computer. These forces are our enemies. We\nmust face them together because no one can defeat them\nalone.\nTo seize the opportunities and move against the threats\nof this new global era, we need a new strategy of security.\nOver the past five years, nations have begun to put that\nstrategy in place through a new network of institutions and\narrangements, with distinct missions, but a common\npurpose: to secure and strengthen the gains of democracy\nand free markets while turning back their enemies.\nWe see this strategy taking shape on every continent:\nin expanded military alliances, such as the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO), its Partnership for Peace and\nits partnerships with a democratic Russia and a democratic\nUkraine; in free trade arrangements, such as the World\nTrade Organization and the global Information Technology\nAgreement, and in the movement towards free-trade areas\nby nations in the Americas, the Asia-Pacific region and\nelsewhere around the world; in strong arms-control regimes,\nsuch as the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; in\nmultinational coalitions with zero tolerance for terrorism,\ncorruption, crime and drug trafficking; and in binding\ninternational commitments to protect the environment and\nsafeguard human rights.\nThrough this web of institutions and arrangements,\nnations are setting the international ground rules for the\ntwenty-first century, laying a foundation for security and\nprosperity for those who live within them, while isolating\nthose who challenge them from the outside. This system\nwill develop and endure only if those who follow the rules\nof peace and freedom fully reap their rewards. Only then\nwill our people believe that they have a stake in\nsupporting and shaping the emerging international system.\nThe United Nations must play a leading role in this\neffort, filling in the fault lines of the new global era. The\ncore missions it has pursued during its first half century\nwill be just as relevant during the next half century: the\npursuit of peace and security, promoting human rights and\nmoving people from poverty to dignity and prosperity\nthrough sustainable development.\nConceived in the cauldron of war, the United\nNations first task must remain the pursuit of peace and\nsecurity. For 50 years the United Nations has helped\nprevent world war and nuclear holocaust. Unfortunately,\nconflicts between nations, and within nations, have\nendured. From 1945 until today, they have cost 20 million\nlives. Just since the end of the cold war, each year there\nhave been more than 30 armed conflicts in which more\nthan 1,000 people have lost their lives - including, of\ncourse, a quarter of a million killed in the former\nYugoslavia and more than half a million in Rwanda.\nMillions of personal tragedies the world over are a\nwarning that we dare not be complacent or indifferent;\ntrouble in a far corner can become a plague on everyone's\nhouse. People the world over cheer the hopeful\ndevelopments in Northern Ireland, grieve over the loss of\ninnocent lives and the stalling of the peace process in the\nMiddle East and long for a resolution of the differences\non the Korean peninsula, between Greece and Turkey or\nbetween the great nations of India and Pakistan as they\ncelebrate the fiftieth anniversary of their birth.\nThe United Nations continues to keep many nations\naway from bloodshed: in El Salvador and Mozambique;\nin Haiti and Namibia; in Cyprus; and in Bosnia, where so\nmuch remains to be done but can still be done because\nthe bloodshed has ended.\nThe United Nations record of service has left a\nlegacy of sacrifice. Just last week we lost some of our\nfinest sons and daughters in the crash of a United Nations\nhelicopter in Bosnia. Five were American, five German,\none Polish and one British - all citizens of the world we\nare trying to make, each a selfless servant of peace. The\nworld is poorer for their passing.\nAt this very moment, the United Nations is keeping\nthe peace in 16 countries, often in partnership with\nregional organizations such as NATO, the Organization of\nAmerican States, the Association of South-East Asian\n8\n\n\nNations and the Economic Community of West African\nStates, avoiding wider conflicts and even greater suffering.\nOur shared commitment to more realistic peacekeeping\ntraining for United Nations troops, a stronger role for\ncivilian police and better integration between military and\ncivilian agencies - all these will help the United Nations\nfulfil these missions in the years ahead.\nAt the same time, we must improve the United\nNations capabilities after a conflict ends to help peace\nbecome self-sustaining. The United Nations cannot build\nnations, but it can help nations build themselves by\nfostering legitimate institutions of government, monitoring\nelections and laying a strong foundation for economic\nreconstruction.\nThis week the Security Council will hold an\nunprecedented ministerial meeting on African security,\nwhich our Secretary of State is proud to chair, and which\nPresident Mugabe, Chairman of the Organization of African\nUnity, will address. It will highlight the role the United\nNations can and should play in preventing conflict on a\ncontinent where amazing progress towards democracy and\ndevelopment is occurring alongside still too much discord,\ndisease and distress.\nIn the twenty-first century our security will be\nchallenged increasingly by interconnected groups that traffic\nin terror, organized crime and drug smuggling. Already,\nthese international crime and drug syndicates drain up to\n$750 billion a year from legitimate economies. That sum\nthat exceeds the combined gross national product of more\nthan half the nations in this Hall. These groups threaten to\nundermine confidence in the fragile new democracies and\nmarket economies that so many of you are working so hard\nto see endure.\nTwo years ago I called upon all the members of this\nAssembly to join in the fight against these forces. I applaud\nthe recent United Nations resolution calling on its Members\nto join the major international anti-terrorism conventions,\nmaking clear the emerging international consensus that\nterrorism is always a crime and never a justifiable political\nact. As more countries sign on, terrorists will have fewer\nplaces to run or hide. I also applaud the steps that Members\nare taking to implement the Declaration on Crime and\nPublic Security that the United States proposed two years\nago, calling for increased cooperation to strengthen every\ncitizen's right to basic safety, through cooperation on\nextradition and asset forfeiture, shutting down grey markets\nfor guns and false documents, attacking corruption and\nbringing higher standards to law enforcement in new\ndemocracies.\nThe spread of these global criminal syndicates also\nhas made all the more urgent our common quest to\neliminate weapons of mass destruction. We cannot allow\nthem to fall into or remain in the wrong hands. Here too,\nthe United Nations must lead, and it has led - from the\nUnited Nations Special Commission in Iraq to the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, now the most\nexpansive global inspection system ever devised to police\narms-control agreements.\nWhen we met here last year, I was honoured to be\nthe first of 146 leaders to sign the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), our commitment to end\nall nuclear tests for all time, the longest-sought, hardest-\nfought prize in the history of arms control. It will help\nprevent the nuclear Powers from developing more\nadvanced and more dangerous weapons. It will limit the\npossibilities for other States to acquire such devices. I am\npleased to announce that today I am sending this crucial\nTreaty to the United States Senate for ratification. Our\ncommon goal should be for the CTBT to enter into force\nas soon as possible. I ask for of you to support that goal.\nThe United Nations second core mission must be to\ndefend and extend universal human rights and to help\ndemocracy's remarkable gains endure. Fifty years ago the\nUnited Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nstated the international community's conviction that\npeople everywhere have the right to be treated with\ndignity, to give voice to their opinions and to choose their\nleaders; that these rights are universal - not American\nrights, not Western rights, not rights for the developed\nworld only, but rights inherent in the humanity of people\neverywhere.\nOver the past decades these rights have become a\nreality for more people than ever, from Asia to Africa,\nfrom Europe to the Americas. In a world that links rich\nand poor, North and South, city and countryside in an\nelectronic network of shared images in real time, the\nmore these universal rights take hold, the more people\nwho do not enjoy them will demand them. Armed with\nphotocopiers and fax machines, e-mail and the Internet;\nsupported by an increasingly important community of\nnon-governmental organizations, they will make their\ndemands known, spreading the spirit of freedom -\nwhich, as the history of the last 10 years has shown us,\nultimately will prevail.\n9\n\n\nThe United Nations must be prepared to respond -\nnot only by setting standards but by implementing them. To\ndeter abuses, we should strengthen the United Nations field\noperations and early-warning systems. To strengthen\ndemocratic institutions - the best guarantors of human\nrights - we must pursue programmes to help new legal,\nparliamentary and electoral institutions get off the ground.\nTo punish those responsible for crimes against humanity,\nand to promote justice so that peace endures, we must\nmaintain our strong support for the United Nations war-\ncrime tribunals and truth commissions. And before the\ncentury ends, we should establish a permanent international\ncourt to prosecute the most serious violations of\nhumanitarian law.\nThe United States welcomes the Secretary General's\nefforts to strengthen the role of human rights within the\nUnited Nations system and his splendid choice of Mary\nRobinson as the new High Commissioner for Human\nRights. We will work hard to make sure that she has the\nsupport she needs to carry out her mandate.\nFinally, the United Nations has a special responsibility\nto make sure that as the global economy creates greater\nwealth, it does not produce growing disparities between the\nhaves and have-nots or threaten the global environment, our\ncommon home. Progress is not yet everyone's partner.\nMore than half the world's people are two days' walk from\na telephone, literally disconnected from the global economy.\nTens of millions lack the education, the training and the\nskills they need to make the most of their God-given\nabilities.\nThe men and women of the United Nations have\nexpertise across the entire range of humanitarian and\ndevelopment activities. Every day they are making a\ndifference. We see it in nourished bodies of once-starving\nchildren, in the full lives of those immunized against\ndisease, in the bright eyes of children exposed to education\nthrough the rich storehouse of human knowledge, in\nrefugees cared for and returned to their homes and in the\nhealth of rivers and lakes restored.\nThe United Nations must focus even more on shifting\nresources from handouts to \\\"hand ups\\\", on giving people\nthe tools they need to make the most of their own destinies.\nSpreading ideas and education and technology - the true\nwealth of nations - is the best way to give the people the\nchance to succeed.\nThe United Nations must continue to lead in ensuring\nthat today's progress does not come at tomorrow's expense.\nWhen the nations of the world gather again next\nDecember in Kyoto for the Conference of the Parties to\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange, all of us - developed and developing nations -\nmust seize the opportunity to turn back the clock on\ngreenhouse-gas emissions so that we can leave a healthy\nplanet to our children.\nIn these efforts, the United Nations no longer can,\nand no longer need, go it alone. Innovative partnerships\nwith the private sector, non-governmental organizations\nand the international financial institutions can leverage its\neffectiveness many times over. Last week a truly\nvisionary American, Ted Turner, made a remarkable\ndonation to strengthen the United Nations development\nand humanitarian programmes. His gesture highlights the\npotential for partnership between the United Nations and\nthe private sector, in contributions of time, resources and\nexpertise. I hope more will follow his lead.\nIn this area and others, the Secretary-General is\naggressively pursuing the most far-reaching reform of the\nUnited Nations in its history - not to make the United\nNations smaller as an end in itself, but to make it better.\nThe United States strongly supports his leadership. We\nshould pass the Secretary-General's reform agenda at this\nsession.\nOn every previous occasion I have addressed this\nAssembly, the issue of our country's dues has brought the\ncommitment of the United States to the United Nations\ninto question. The United States was a founder of the\nUnited Nations. We are proud to be its host. We believe\nin its ideals. We continue to be, as we have been, its\nlargest contributor. We are committed to seeing the\nUnited Nations succeed in the twenty-first century.\nThis year, for the first time since I have been\nPresident, we have an opportunity to put the question of\ndebts and dues behind us once and for all and to put the\nUnited Nations on a sounder financial footing for the\nfuture. I have made it a priority to work with our\nCongress on comprehensive legislation that would allow\nus to pay off the bulk of our arrears and assure full\nfinancing of America's assessment in the years ahead.\nOur Congress's actions to solve this problem reflect a\nstrong bipartisan commitment to the United Nations and\nto America's role within it. At the same time, we look to\nMember States to adopt a more equitable scale of\nassessments. Let me say that we also strongly support\nexpanding the Security Council to give more countries a\nvoice in the most important work of the United Nations.\n10\n\n\nIn more equitably sharing responsibility for its successes,\nwe can make the United Nations stronger and more\ndemocratic than it is today. I ask the General Assembly to\nact on these proposals this year so that we can move\nforward together.\nAt the dawn of a new century so full of hope but not\nfree of peril, more than ever we need a United Nations\nwhere people of reason can work through shared problems\nand take action to combat them, where nations of goodwill\ncan join in the struggle for freedom and prosperity and\nwhere we can shape a future of peace, progress and the\npreservation of our planet. We have the knowledge; we\nhave the intelligence; we have the energy; we have the\nresources for the work before us. We are building the\nnecessary networks of cooperation. The great question\nremaining is whether we have the vision and the heart\nnecessary to imagine a future that is different from the\npast - necessary to free ourselves from destructive patterns\nof relations with each other and within our own nations and\nto live a future that is different.\nA new century in a new millennium is upon us. We\nare literally present at the future, and it is the great gift we\nare obligated to leave to our children.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me great pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nsecond session. I am confident that your political\nexperience will help you conduct the work of the session\nwisely and successfully.\nI should also like to commend your predecessor, His\nExcellency Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for the\nexcellent way in which he presided over the General\nAssembly at its fifty-first session.\nI also wish to extend our congratulations to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his election to his\ncurrent position, and to express our appreciation for his\nprogramme for the reform of the Organization. He can be\nassured of our full support for any measures he takes to\nthat end.\nAs we approach a new millennium, the world is\nwitnessing a series of internal and external conflicts that\nrepresent a great regression when compared to the\noptimistic expectations that followed the end of the cold\nwar and the collapse of ideological conflicts. A new\nworld characterized by balance and equitable relations\namong States was expected to emerge, with a view to the\ncreation of innovative cooperation among our States and\npeoples in different areas of concern. However, I regret\nto say that the world is still facing severe problems, such\nas political conflict, poverty, famine and intensive\nmigratory movements. These are the result of poor\neconomic conditions, refugee flows caused by wars, the\ndeterioration of the environment, trafficking in illicit\ndrugs and the proliferation of organized crime.\nIn the context of these changes, and more than half\na century after the United Nations was established, there\nis an urgent need for the Organization to undergo drastic\nreforms, both structural and functional, so as to establish\nrules and principles for a new international order free of\ndouble standards. Such a new order would allow us to\nrise to the new challenges and achieve the goals set forth\nin the Charter more than 50 years ago for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security and the\nintensification of international cooperation for the benefit\nof the peoples of the world.\nTo this end, the process of reform must begin by\nactivating the role of the General Assembly and enabling\nit to fulfil its duty in an effective manner that would give\nits democratic resolutions vitality and credibility before\ninternational public opinion. The Security Council must\nalso be reformed, so that it can carry out the role it has\nbeen entrusted with, because it has a special status among\n\n\nthe United Nations bodies, as defined in the Charter. In our\nview, this cannot be achieved except through a general\nagreement that would regulate the use of the veto power,\nlimiting such use to cases covered by Chapter VII of the\nUnited Nations Charter, namely, threats to international\npeace.\nIn order for the Security Council to reflect the new\npolitical and economic realities of a changing world, it must\nincrease the number of its non-permanent members to\nprovide for just and balanced representation and to enable\nthe Council to deal with the new international realities and\nshoulder its responsibilities by becoming more democratic\nthrough the adoption of a rotation system, not limiting\nmembership to certain States, and by giving all States the\nopportunity to participate in its work and assume their share\nof international responsibility.\nAlthough we understand the opinions advocating an\nincrease in the number of permanent members, we believe\nthat the coexistence of permanent members that have the\npower of veto with permanent members that do not, plus\nnon-permanent members, runs counter to the concepts of\nequality among States, geographic and cultural\nrepresentation and international participation. It also runs\ncounter to the principle of democratic decision-making. In\norder to achieve the required balance, fairness, justice,\nequality and reason call for an increase in Security Council\nmembership for Asia, Africa and Latin America. Together,\nthose three continents have the majority of world population\nand States. Nevertheless, their representation on the\nSecurity Council is less than 50 per cent. In order for the\nSecretary-General to be able to carry out the reforms that\nfall within his competence, the financial crisis of the United\nNations must be addressed by making Member States\nhonour their legal commitments and pay their dues without\ndelay. In this regard, we would like to express our deep\ngratitude to Mr. Ted Turner for his generous donation to\nsome United Nations humanitarian programmes. We hope\nthis will be an encouraging initiative for others to follow.\nThe task of maintaining international peace and\nsecurity has particular importance. Therefore, measures\nrecommended by the General Assembly or taken by the\nSecurity Council should not be limited to post-conflict or\nwar situations. More attention should be given to\nappropriate and timely preventive measures, because we\nbelieve that early measures adopted by the international\ncommunity are the ideal way to avert the outbreak of\nconflicts and wars and to avoid taking the necessary\npolitical and military measures in the aftermath of the\nconflict \u2014 let alone imposing half solutions that are often\nunfair.\nThe question of disarmament plays an essential role\nin building the foundation of international peace and\nsecurity. To achieve this goal, we believe that renewing\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) indefinitely is a decision that requires more support\nand endorsement, so that the Treaty can acquire a\nuniversal character, with the adherence of all States. In\nthis context, the State of Qatar affirms that Israel should\nadhere to that Treaty and should place its nuclear\nfacilities under the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s\nsafeguards regime. This will be a basic step towards\nestablishing a zone free from nuclear and other weapons\nof mass destruction in the Middle East. It would also\ncontribute to achieving equitable and balanced peace and\nstability in that important area of the world so that there\nwould be no multiple criteria for defining the conduct of\nStates.\nIn the same context, we cannot fail to mention the\nspecial importance of the Convention to ban anti-\npersonnel mines, which was finalized in Oslo recently. It\nwill be ready for signature in Ottawa next December. We\nhope it will be signed by all States.\nThe world has witnessed fundamental economic\nchanges, such as the end of State control of economic life\nin many States, the withering away of numerous restraints\non international trade, the easy transfer of capital and\nhuge investments across the world. Meanwhile, many\neconomies in developing countries are still deteriorating.\nThis requires that urgent and effective solutions be\nprovided by the international community to enable those\nStates to progress and develop their societies through\nbuilding strong and effective economies. Such an\nendeavour requires us to take a new look at expenditures\non armaments, in order to save such huge sums and\nallocate them to supporting education and health\nprogrammes. This would also enable us to address the\nproblems of poverty and the environment and to develop\nthe economies of developing nations. This is an absolute\nnecessity for any new international economic order based\non integration and balance, and is capable of devising\ndesired solutions for the aforementioned problems. The\nproblems of poverty, backwardness and lack of access to\neducation and medical care are among the problems that\naffect developing countries. The societies of such States\nalso suffer from a population explosion that is\ndisproportionate to their resources. At the same time,\nfortunes are being wasted on armaments, arms races or\n2\n\n\nluxuries. This causes huge discrepancies in consumption\nrates between the peoples of rich countries and those of\npoor countries.\nSuch problems compel us to be fully aware of the fact\nthat solving them requires reconsidering the question of\nmilitary expenditures. It is no secret to anybody in authority\nthat while the programmes implemented by the United\nNations Children\u2019s Fund, the United Nations Development\nProgramme and the World Food Programme cost less than\n$4.6 billion a year, Governments all over the world are\nspending about $800 billion every year on armaments,\nwhile 1.3 billion people are still living in a state of abject\npoverty.\nNow I would like to address the situation in the\nMiddle East and the crisis of the peace process.\nThe Israeli Government is still stalling in the\nimplementation of agreements and putting impediments and\nobstacles in the way of achieving a just and comprehensive\npeace. Israel is undermining the peace process by building\nsettlements, reneging on agreements and commitments\nreached with the Palestinian Authority, imposing a blockade\non the Palestinian people, depriving them of their rights and\nflouting international legality. This generates violence and\ncounter-violence. The Israeli policy runs counter to General\nAssembly resolutions and Security Council resolutions,\nespecially resolutions 242 (1967), 271 (1969), 298 (1971),\n478 (1980) and 672 (1990). They all provide that all\nlegislative and administrative measures taken by Israel\naimed at altering the legal status and demographic\ncomposition of the occupied Arab territories, including the\ncity of Jerusalem, are null and void, and have no legal\nrelevance. They also run counter to the Fourth Geneva\nConvention of 1949 concerning the protection of civilians\nand their properties in time of war. Therefore, the\ninternational community is called upon to exert pressure on\nthe Israeli Government to make it desist immediately from\nimplementing the policies that jeopardize the peace process\nas a whole.\nThe Arab leaders affirmed last year at the Cairo\nsummit that peace in the Middle East is a strategic option.\nThey underlined the importance of having all the parties\ncommitted to the Madrid formula that calls for a peace\nbased on the principle of land for peace. This means that\nIsrael should withdraw completely from all the occupied\nPalestinian and Arab territories, including East Jerusalem,\nto enable the Palestinian people to establish their\nindependent State, with Arab Jerusalem as its capital. It\nshould also withdraw completely from the Syrian Golan and\nfrom southern Lebanon to the internationally recognized\nborders, in keeping with Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978).\nThere has been a noticeable improvement over the\nlast five years on the road to achieving a just and\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. It started with\nthe Madrid Conference and moved on to Oslo and the\nsubsequent peace accords. Several economic conferences\nwere held to promote the Middle East peace process and\nto contribute to moving it forward by underscoring the\ncommon interests of the peoples of the region.\nTo that effect, arrangements are being made to hold\na fourth economic summit conference for the Middle East\nand North Africa next November in Doha, the capital of\nmy country. In this connection, I would emphasize that\nthe State of Qatar has no private interest in acting as host\nfor this conference. Our interest in holding it is based on\nthe following reasons.\nFirst, we believe that peace is a strategic choice that\nthe Arab countries have adopted since the Madrid\nConference.\nSecondly, such a conference would manifest our\ndesire for the peace process to continue. Failure of the\npeace process would have serious implications and would\nthreaten peace both at the regional and at the international\nlevel.\nThirdly, our region has witnessed many wars in past\nyears, the last of which was the 1991 Gulf War, which\nhave impeded economic and political progress in our\nregion and imposed on us huge expenditures on\narmaments at the expense of the social development and\nwell-being of our peoples.\nFourthly, at the 1995 Amman Economic Summit the\nState of Qatar committed itself to acting as host to the\nfourth summit conference, and honouring that\ncommitment is a question of our credibility as a State that\nrespects its commitments.\nSome are of the opinion that the conference should\nbe cancelled due to current Israeli policy that does not\nrespect undertakings and agreements, flouts international\nlegality and tries to marginalize the role of the United\nNations. Although we in Qatar understand the reasons\nbehind such an opinion, which calls for the cancellation\nof the conference in response to the practices of the\nIsraeli Government, which has not respected its\n3\n\n\ninternational commitments, we do respect our international\ncommitments, and we believe that no State should have\nveto power with regard to the peace process. We have\ntherefore decided to act as host to the conference on its\nappointed date. If it does not prove to be successful and\nfails to achieve the desired results, the Government of Israel\nwill bear sole responsibility.\nThe State of Qatar welcomes the position of the\nUnited States of America, as expressed by its Secretary of\nState during our meeting in Saudi Arabia and here in New\nYork. We also welcome the resolve it has shown in dealing\nwith the disruption of the peace process in the Middle East,\nas well as the fact that it has underlined the principle of\nland for peace, the relevant resolutions of the Security\nCouncil and the inadmissibility of taking unilateral\nmeasures that run counter to the peace process.\nMy country also appreciates the position of the States\nof the European Union, as well as the Russian Federation\nfor their support of the peace process in the Middle East.\nThe State of Qatar views with satisfaction and\nappreciation the positions taken by States that support the\nMiddle East peace process and reject the Israeli settlement\npolicies that are obstructing that process. At the same time,\nmy country stresses the importance of the role of the\nUnited Nations in the Middle East peace process and\nopposes any attempts to exclude it.\nThe State of Qatar joins the other fraternal members\nof the Gulf Cooperation Council in their endeavour to\npromote security and stability in the Gulf region, which is\nof strategic and vital importance to the entire world. The\nState of Qatar is making a constructive effort in that\ncontext with the aim of establishing good and constructive\nrelations with all countries of the region on the basis of\ngood-neighbourliness, mutual respect, non-intervention in\nthe internal affairs of others, respect for international\nlegality and the settlement of disputes through peaceful\nmeans, dialogue and mediation or by arbitration under\ninternational law. The State of Qatar supports the settlement\nof the dispute between the United Arab Emirates and the\nIslamic Republic of Iran over the three islands of Abu\nMusa and Greater and Lesser Tunb by those means.\nMy Government and people have expressed their\nfraternal feelings and strong empathy towards the brotherly\npeople of Iraq, who are living in extremely difficult\ncircumstances resulting from the sanctions imposed on\nthem. We have therefore welcomed the oil-for-food\nagreement between the United Nations and Iraq to alleviate\nthe suffering of the fraternal people of Iraq and to provide\nthem with such basic necessities as food and medicine.\nMy Government has also emphasized the importance of\nrespecting Iraq\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity and\nregional security. We condemn any foreign interference\nin its internal affairs. In the same context, my\nGovernment affirms the importance of implementation by\nthe Government of Iraq of the relevant resolutions of the\nSecurity Council, in particular those concerning the\nrelease of Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees and other\nnationals in the same conditions. Such steps would help\nthe international community to lift the embargo imposed\non Iraq and would also enable Iraq to carry out a\nconstructive role in achieving security, stability and\nrehabilitation in the region.\nMy Government also expresses its concern for the\nsuffering to which the brotherly people of Libya are being\nsubjected due to the sanctions imposed against that\ncountry because of the Lockerbie issue. In that\nconnection, the State of Qatar calls for the creation of a\nuniform and agreed regime for imposing sanctions and of\nmechanisms to lift them subsequently in a manner that\ndoes not distinguish among States and peoples and that\nstrikes a balance between international interests, on the\none hand, and the suffering to which peoples are\nsubjected, on the other.\nLast week the Security Council devoted a meeting to\naddressing the problems of disputes and wars in some\nAfrican countries. It considered ways of containing and\nsolving such problems. The State of Qatar, which has\nfraternal relations with the African countries, is pained to\nwitness the current state of affairs in States such as the\nSudan, Somalia, the Comoros, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and\nthe Congo. We believe that the African States are capable\nof overcoming their plight if they receive the necessary\ninternational support, particularly for the purpose of\nimproving their economies and the transfer of technology\nin an international partnership in which all would\nparticipate.\nMy country was one of the first to welcome the\nDayton Peace Agreement because we believe in the\nimportance of peace and cooperation in the Balkans. We\nhave therefore supported the reconstruction of the\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have also made\ncontacts with our neighbour countries to urge them to\ncooperate with each other to help rehabilitate the region,\ndevelop its resources, link it to the international economy\nand improve the situation of its peoples.\n4\n\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to point out that in order\nto solve the problems the world is facing it is imperative\nfor us to work together for the benefit of mankind.\nAddress by The Honourable Edison James, Prime\nMinister and Minister for External Affairs, Legal\nAffairs, Labour and Immigration of the Commonwealth\nof Dominica\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of my\nGovernment and on my own behalf, allow me to\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your unanimous\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nsecond session. Your election to this office bears testimony\nto your commitment to the cause of international peace and\nsecurity. I am sure that with your guidance and wide\nexperience in international affairs, our work will record a\nsuccessful outcome. You can rest assured of my\ndelegation\u2019s full support during your term of office.\nI would also like to put on record our appreciation of\nthe manner in which your predecessor, Ambassador Razali\nIsmail of Malaysia, presided over the deliberations of the\nfifty-first session of the General Assembly. His\nperformance and innovative ideas will indeed help us tackle\nthe challenges before our Organization in the years to\ncome.\nLet me pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\nleadership and the commitment to the ideals of international\npeace and security demonstrated in his first year of office.\nI wish him well and pledge our full support and cooperation\nas he discharges his responsibilities in our Organization in\ntimes of change.\nWithin two days, Mozambique will celebrate five\nyears of peace and stability. Looking back, albeit to see the\nchallenges we have encountered, our nation has, without a\ndoubt, made significant progress in its quest for the\nconsolidation of peace and tranquillity, democracy and\ndevelopment, and we are determined further to pursue these\ngoals.\nIn the political sphere, we have succeeded in\ncreating an enabling environment in which political\ndiscussions are being carried out positively both in\nParliament and by civil society at large. As we deepen\nthis positive experience within the framework of a\npluralistic society, there is broad consensus among all\nMozambicans that dialogue must continue to be the way\nto overcome differences and to address the development\nneeds of our country. To this end, my Government will\nspare no effort in order to ensure that Parliament\ncontinues to function normally, for we believe that this\ncourse of action remains a key factor for the consolidation\nof peace, democracy and national reconciliation. The next\nstep will be to hold the country\u2019s first municipal elections,\nwhich will complement the process initiated in 1994 with\nthe holding of multi-party general elections.\nThe implementation of the structural adjustment\nprogramme initiated in 1987 has indeed created an\nattractive environment for private investment, both\ndomestic and foreign, which is gradually and steadily\nleading the country to economic and social progress. It is\nwithin this multidisciplinary and global action that\neconomic reforms are taking place, with results that are\nalready positive and tangible. Preliminary indications of\nthe performance of the economy during the first half of\n1997 estimate that growth in gross domestic product will\nreach about 7 per cent by the end of this year, a figure\nwhich is higher than that originally forecast.\nIn speaking on this very important subject I would\nlike to underscore the high importance we attach to the\nneed for flexibility with respect to the implementation of\ninitiatives for debt relief and sustainability. My\nGovernment is encouraged by recent indications from\ninternational financial institutions concerning the\nimpending decision on the eligibility of Mozambique to\nthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. I\nwould hope that once such a decision is made the time-\nframe between the decision point and the completion\npoint might be as short as possible so as to have the\ndesired impact on the economy. Without far-reaching debt\nrelief measures, it will be virtually impossible for the\ncountry to sustain the current growth and stabilization of\nthe economy. We hope that as soon as possible all least\ndeveloped countries may accede to the Initiative.\nIn this regard, my Government welcomes the recent\nadmission of Russia to both the Group of 8 and the Paris\nClub. It is our hope that those steps will enable that\ncountry to play a more active and constructive role in\nmatters related to debt forgiveness and relief, particularly\n10\n\n\nin relation to countries like Mozambique. For our part, we\nwill continue to undertake and deepen further our political\nand economic reforms, as we have over the past 10 years,\nwith particular emphasis on the provision of basic health\ncare and education.\nThe rehabilitation of the economic and social fabrics,\nespecially in the rural areas, is seriously hampered by the\nscourge of landmines. These horrible weapons have killed\nand continue to kill and wound hundreds of innocent\ncitizens. With that in mind, at the fourth International\nConference of Non-Governmental Organizations on\nLandmines, which met at Maputo in February of this year,\nmy Government approved a resolution that prohibits, with\nimmediate effect, the production, commercialization,\nutilization and non-authorized transportation of anti-\npersonnel landmines in the territory of Mozambique.\nMy Government has been participating fully in the\nnegotiations within the framework of the Ottawa process.\nIn this respect, we welcome the results achieved at the\nrecently concluded Oslo Diplomatic Conference. We urge\nall countries to heed the call of the peoples of the world\nand to join the majority of nations in signing the\ninternational treaty on the total ban of anti-personnel\nlandmines in December this year. We wish to launch a\nvigorous appeal to the international community to ensure\nthat all the provisions of that treaty with respect to, inter\nalia, the destruction of stockpiled anti-personnel mines and\nthose laid within minefields and in areas outside minefields,\nand with respect to international cooperation and assistance,\nare fully implemented.\nIn this respect, I wish to highlight the importance my\nGovernment attaches to the question of assistance to victims\nof landmines before, during and following mine clearance,\nin order to ensure the early and safe return and resettlement\nof displaced persons with a view to ensuring a speedy\nresumption of economic activity, in particular in rural areas.\nI would like to express our deep gratitude to those\ncountries and organizations that are providing generous\nassistance in demining activities, and invite others to join\nus in implementing our national demining programme.\nIn August this year, the Government and civil society\njointly launched a national campaign for the\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which will take place on 10\nDecember 1998. The Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, with which my country fully associates itself,\nrepresents the commitment by all peoples of the world to\ntheir faith in human dignity. The nationwide celebrations,\nencompassing a variety of activities, will afford a unique\nopportunity to all Mozambicans \u2014 and, indeed, to other\npeoples elsewhere \u2014 to review and educate themselves\non such an important issue for mankind. It will be an\nopportunity to underscore the importance of the non-\nselectivity, indivisibility and universality of human rights.\nWithin that framework, my Government follows with\nkeen attention the progress being made in the Preparatory\nCommittee on the Establishment of an International\nCriminal Court. The establishment of such a court, with\nthe purpose of bringing to justice individuals accused of\ncommitting the most heinous crimes, is an important\ncontribution to the promotion of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms. The court must be entrusted with\nclear powers in order fully to discharge its mandate. In\nparticular, its competence and jurisdiction should be\nclearly defined in conformity with its objectives and\ntaking into account the principle of complementarity.\nIn the African continent, we are participating in\ndiscussions for the establishment of an African court of\nhuman and peoples\u2019 rights. It is our hope that the high-\nlevel meeting scheduled for next year at Addis Ababa will\nsucceed in finding the needed consensus on all\noutstanding issues pertaining to the court.\nIn the past 12 months, the issue of United Nations\nreforms has gained new impetus with new developments\nwhich have taken place quite recently. It is a fact that\nthere is a broad consensus with regard to the need for\nsuch reforms. Nevertheless, in carrying them out it will be\nimportant to find ways and means that will ensure that the\nlegitimate rights and aspirations of all Member States, and\nin particular the developing countries, are safeguarded.\nThis is particularly relevant with respect to the proposals\nfor the enlargement of the Security Council.\nSimilarly, my Government has taken due note of and\nwelcomes the reform package presented by the Secretary-\nGeneral in his report entitled \u201cRenewing the United\nNations: A Programme for Reform\u201d. The report, the most\ncomprehensive and far-reaching ever produced in the\nannals of the Organization, addresses vital elements that\nrequire in-depth discussion by Member States.\nAs a country striving to strengthen peace and\nsecurity both within its borders and in the regional\ncontext, as well as in the world as a whole, Mozambique\nregards preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and post-\nconflict peace-building as important elements that must be\n11\n\n\nstrengthened in the new international context. In this\nconnection, we are participating with other countries of the\nregion in joint efforts aimed at reinforcing our preparedness\nfor emergencies. We therefore encourage and support the\nSecretary-General in his endeavours to enable the United\nNations to deploy peacekeeping operations rapidly.\nIn the field of human rights, I welcome the proposed\nconsolidation of the Office of the High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights and the Centre for Human Rights into a\nsingle new Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights. I commend the Secretary-\nGeneral for this course of action, which is in line with the\nsentiments expressed by Member States not only in the\nGeneral Assembly but also within the framework of the\nCommission on Human Rights. The merging of the two\nbodies will in fact eliminate the duplication of tasks and\nexpenditures and streamline the work of the new,\nconsolidated body.\nOn behalf of my Government, I wish to take this\nopportunity to congratulate Mrs. Mary Robinson on her\nassumption of the post of High Commissioner for Human\nRights. We pledge to her our full support, both within the\ncontext of the Commission on Human Rights, of which\nMozambique is a member, and also within the context of\npromoting human rights and fundamental freedoms\nworldwide.\nWith respect to financing our Organization, I fully\nagree with the Secretary-General that the current financial\ncrisis facing us\n\u201cis directly linked to the failure of ... Member States\nto discharge their ... obligations regarding prompt and\nfull payment of assessed ... contributions\u201d. [A/51/950,\npara. 82]\nWe would really hope that the very same countries that so\nfar have failed to fulfil their treaty obligations, will this\ntime not only pay their dues but also assist the Secretary-\nGeneral by contributing to the proposed Revolving Credit\nFund.\nI equally commend the proposed establishment of a\ndevelopment account resulting from reductions in non-\nprogramme costs over the next few years. We regard the\nestablishment of such an account as an important\ncontribution in addressing the economic and social needs of\ndeveloping countries on a more consistent and predictable\nbasis.\nWe also endorse the proposed establishment of the\npost of Deputy Secretary-General within the framework\nof strengthening the leadership capacity of the Secretariat.\nThe creation of a Strategic Planing Unit, in our\nview, will further enhance the ability of the Secretary-\nGeneral to act in accordance with the provisions of the\nArticle 99 of the Charter. In the light of the new realities,\nit is our firm belief that the information gathered by this\nUnit will be brought to the attention not only of that body\nbut also of the General Assembly, in accordance with the\nprovisions of Articles 10 and 11 of the Charter.\nAs for the proposed establishment of the \u201cUN\nHouse\u201d under a single United Nations flag, it is important\nto ensure that the identity and the vast individual and\nunique experience \u2014 as well as the expertise \u2014\naccumulated by the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP), the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund\n(UNICEF) and the United Nations Population Fund\n(UNFPA) are preserved. More significantly, the need for\ndecentralization and flexibility in decision-making at the\ncountry level should be safeguarded and further enhanced\nso as to ensure that everyone benefits from the proposed\nconsolidation. It is my Government\u2019s hope that the new\narrangement will result in a united, cooperative and\ncoherent framework at the country level. The experience\nof coordination of all of the United Nations programmes\nand funds in Mozambique is positive and encouraging.\nWe have taken due note of the proposal for the\nestablishment of a ministerial-level commission to\nexamine possible changes in the Charter with a view to\npreparing our Organization for the challenges of the next\ncentury. Given the complexity of the issues to be looked\nat, the commission should be established on the basis of\ngeographic representation, after adequate consultations,\nand should be provided with clear and precise terms of\nreference in order to guarantee that its views are universal\nand as consensual as possible.\nIt is our hope that the proposed reforms \u2014 those\nbeing implemented within the purview of the Secretary-\nGeneral, as well as the ones under discussion in the\nWorking Group \u2014 will result in greater focus of the\nUnited Nations in the economic and social spheres. Now\nthat we have gathered consensus on an Agenda for\nDevelopment, we need to ensure that appropriate steps are\ntaken by a reformed, more efficient United Nations to\nrealize our goals.\n12\n\n\nThe trends towards the establishment of regional and\ncontinental blocs require deep cooperation and integrated\neconomies. Only combined unity of purpose and action can\nlend greater leverage and capacity to negotiate and make\neconomies competitive for investment. This must be\ncomplemented by political stability and an enabling\nenvironment for domestic and foreign investment. We in\nsouthern Africa are joining our efforts towards this goal\nwithin the framework of the Southern African Development\nCommunity (SADC).\nThese efforts will be further enhanced to a great extent\nby the recently established Indian Ocean Rim-Association\nfor Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC). The new\norganization assembles a variety of countries from Asia and\nAfrica, plus Australia. Its fundamental principles include\nthe facilitation and promotion of economic cooperation,\nbringing together representatives of government, business\nand academia.\nMy Government follows with renewed interest the\nefforts towards the mitigation of conflicts throughout the\nworld. We are conscious of the fact that economic and\nsocial development are possible only when we live in peace\nand political stability. Therefore, prevention, management\nand conflict resolution constitute a fundamental issue in our\nforeign policy.\nIn this regard, I wish to associate myself with previous\nspeakers in congratulating most sincerely the establishment\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo following decades\nof uncertainty. We hope that the new authorities will play\na positive role in our collective efforts for regional peace\nand stability, particularly in the Great Lakes region. The\nchallenges facing the new Government are indeed immense\nand deserve assistance and support from the international\ncommunity.\nLikewise, we commend the successful outcome of the\nelectoral process in Liberia, which symbolizes the\ncompletion of the peace process in that country. We look\nforward to the reinvigoration of a united, peaceful and\nprosperous country which is ready to contribute to the\neffort towards the economic stabilization of the entire\nregion. It is our hope that the international community will\nspare no efforts in assisting Liberia to overcome the tragedy\nthat has fallen on it for so many years.\nThe Economic Community of West African States\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) deserves our special\ncommendation for the role it has played in the resolution\nof the Liberian crisis and for its current efforts in the\nrestoration of peace and respect for the rule of law in\nSierra Leone.\nWe equally note with satisfaction the recent progress\nmade for the settlement of the issue of Western Sahara,\nand we encourage the parties concerned to continue down\nthis positive path.\nThe peace process in Angola continues to face\nserious challenges as a result of the failure of UNITA to\ncomply fully with the agreed commitments under the\nLusaka Protocol. With the recent adoption of Security\nCouncil resolution 1130 (1997), it is now for this body to\nensure that the provisions of all other relevant resolutions\nare fully complied with in order to bring the peace\nprocess back on track and to avoid the continued delays\nwe have been witnessing over the three years of the\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol.\nOn the other hand, my Government remains\nconcerned about the situation in the Congo. We support\nthe initiative of the heads of State and Government of the\nregion under the leadership of His Excellency President\nBongo, and we call upon the parties to exercise maximum\nrestraint in order not to jeopardize any further those\nefforts. All parties concerned must set aside their\ndifferences and work together for the attainment of a\nnegotiated settlement to prevent further suffering of\ninnocent civilians and destruction of property.\nRecent events in the Comoros islands underline the\nneed for full respect of the independence and territorial\nintegrity of all States, under any circumstances. We\nencourage permanent dialogue among all concerned\nparties so as to find a negotiated settlement of the dispute\nwithin the framework of the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) peace initiatives.\nOn behalf of my Government, I would like to\nexpress our solidarity to the people of East Timor. We do\nhope that the ongoing negotiations between Portugal and\nIndonesia under the auspices of the Secretary-General of\nthe United Nations, and other initiatives, will finally lead\nto a successful outcome of this issue in accordance with\nthe principles and purposes of the Charter.\nOn the Middle East, my Government notes with\nconcern the deterioration of the security situation in that\n13\n\n\narea, which poses great danger to the efforts to achieve a\ncomprehensive, just and lasting solution in the region.\nPeace cannot be achieved at the expense of other peoples\u2019\ninterests. The policy of establishing new settlements in the\noccupied Arab and Palestinian territories should be\ndiscontinued. As we have said before, the existence of both\nIsrael and Palestine is an undeniable reality which nobody\nshould ignore if we are to reach a final settlement of this\nlong-standing conflict. Dialogue and compliance with\nsecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions are the\ninstruments through which a solution should be found in the\nMiddle East.\nWe are also following with interest the developments\nconcerning the conflict situations in the Persian Gulf region.\nIn the highest interests of its peoples, we urge all the\nparties concerned to act together with a view to finding an\ninternationally acceptable solution to all outstanding issues,\nin accordance with the purposes and principles of the\nCharter.\nAt the dawn of the new millennium, we bear the\nresponsibility of preparing the United Nations to save not\nonly succeeding generations from the scourge of war but\nalso to provide an Organization that will effectively and\nefficiently promote cooperation and development. We in\nMozambique are prepared to work towards this goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt\nthe outset I would like to express my congratulations to\nthe President on the confidence the General Assembly\nshowed in him by electing him to preside over fifty-\nsecond session. We have no doubt that his experience and\ncapability in multilateral diplomacy will assist him in\nconducting the deliberations of this session towards\nsuccess. We assure him of the cooperation and support of\nthe delegation of the Sudan.\nI would also like to express my gratitude and\nappreciation to the President's predecessor, His Excellency\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, for his distinguished efforts\nand bold initiatives within the context of strengthening the\nrole of the United Nations and the improvement of its\nmethods of work.\nLikewise, we would like to extend our\ncongratulations to the United Nations Secretary-General,\nKofi Annan. In a very short time since the assumption of\nhis post, he has demonstrated enthusiasm, ability and\npatience in leading this Organization. This has been\nembodied in his initiative to reform it, improve its\nmethods of work and enhance its stature.\nWe commend the genuine endeavours of the\nSecretary-General to reform the United Nations system.\nIn this connection, the Sudan will stand by his side until\n21\n\n\nthe United Nations realizes the purposes for which it was\nestablished, chief among which is the strengthening of\npeace and international cooperation for the achievement of\ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty, particularly in\nAfrica and in developing countries.\nWe would also like to affirm the keenness of the\nSudan that the programme of reform should result in\nstrengthening the ability of the United Nations to respond\nto humanitarian, social and developmental issues undertaken\nby the Organization. Furthermore, the reform should lead\nto the consolidation of the participation of developing\ncountries in the Organization and their equitable\nrepresentation in the Secretariat.\nThe Sudan calls for giving the reform endeavours\nenough time. The results and recommendations of the\nOpen-ended High Level Working Group on the\nStrengthening of the United Nations System, adopted by the\nGeneral Assembly, should be given special attention. My\ncountry reaffirms its intention to participate effectively in\nthe meetings to be agreed upon within the proper\nframework, with the aim of reaching a consensus on all\naspects of the reform.\nThe Sudan attaches special attention and interest to the\nissue of reform of the Security Council through the\nenlargement of its permanent and non-permanent\nmembership, and the improvement of its methods of work.\nOur interest derives from our deep-rooted conviction about\nthe importance of enhancing transparency and democracy\nin the work of the Council, so as to respond to the\nchanging realities and the current challenges facing\ninternational peace and security, in accordance with the\nprinciples and provisions of the Charter which define the\nduties of the Council in the peaceful resolution of\nconflict \u2014 far from using it as an instrument of peoples'\npunishment.\nThe Sudan, while welcoming the efforts made for the\nreform of the Security Council, reaffirms the necessity of\nobserving equitable geographical representation and\npreserving the principle of state sovereignty. In this\nconnection, we would like to reiterate our commitment to\nthe New Delhi Declaration of the Non-Aligned Movement,\nas well as our commitment to the African position taken at\nthe Harare summit.\nWe wish to stress the importance of linking the right\nof veto to the aspects relating to enlargement of the Council\nand improvement of its methods of work, in a way that\nwould secure a comprehensive consideration through\ndeliberate negotiations relative to all aspects, within a\ndemocratic and open-ended membership.\nIt is important to deal with the points that the\nForeign Minister of Singapore made in his statement this\nmorning. At this time last year I informed the Assembly\nof our efforts to establish peace in the Sudan, which\nresulted at that time in the signing of the \u201cPeace Charter\u201d.\nToday, it is with honour and pride that I convey to this\ndistinguished gathering that we have succeeded in\nevolving that \u201cPeace Charter\u201d into a comprehensive\n\u201cPeace Agreement\u201d signed in April this year by the\nGovernment and the fighting factions and political entities\nin southern Sudan. The Agreement has been endorsed by\nthe Sudanese Parliament, and thus it has, par excellence,\nbecome one of the most important political events in the\nhistory of the Sudan.\nThe Khartoum Peace Agreement provides for a\nlasting settlement to the Sudanese problem. The\nnegotiating parties have reached a formula which\nidentifies a framework for peaceful coexistence in the\ncountry. In the Agreement, the principle of citizenship\nconstitutes the basis for rights, duties and equality of\nparticipation of all Sudanese in the responsibilities of\npublic life, without discrimination as to race or religion.\nIt further consolidates the principle of democratic\nevolution in the Sudan. It clearly defines the question of\npower sharing between the state governments and the\nfederal authority within the federal system in the country.\nIn addition, it provides for the bases and criteria for\nwealth-sharing in the country.\nWith regard to public liberties and human rights, the\nagreement guarantees the same liberties and rights\nembodied in divine revelation and in the texts of relevant\ninternational instruments and agreements. In that way it\nwill have a considerable influence in consolidating and\nguaranteeing human rights. Furthermore, the agreement\nallows for the people of southern Sudan to exercise their\nright to self-determination through a free referendum to\nbe held at the end of a four-year transitional period.\nAn additional, complementary arrangement was\nagreed upon to prevent hostilities and ensure a ceasefire\nbetween the signatory parties with the aim of enhancing\nthe requisites for peace and stability. Furthermore, in\naccordance with the collective will of the people of the\nSudan, a presidential decree granted an unconditional\ngeneral amnesty in respect of all crimes committed and\nall civil and criminal claims asserted during the 14 years\npreceding the signing of the agreement.\n22\n\n\nIn our quest to enhance the scope of a comprehensive\nand lasting peace, an agreement was reached last week with\nthe only remaining faction that was still carrying arms,\nthereby allowing for the resumption of peace talks on 28\nOctober 1997 in the Kenyan capital under the auspices of\nthe Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).\nI am honoured to be able to renew the determination and to\nexpress the eagerness of the Government of the Sudan for\nmaking the forthcoming talks a success.\nThe courageous steps taken by the Government of the\nSudan towards achieving a just and lasting peace have been\nwidely commended and appreciated by many States in the\nworld. One of its early positive results was the beginning\nof the voluntary repatriation of displaced persons and\nrefugees from neighbouring countries.\nWe call upon the United Nations, the international\nfinancial institutions and our development partners to\ncontribute to the resettlement of the returnees by shifting\nfrom humanitarian assistance to programmes of\nrehabilitation and the provision of developmental assistance\nneeded to consolidate the foundations of peace, which has\nbeen sought for many decades. This call derives its\nlegitimacy from the spirit and content of the Security\nCouncil ministerial-level meeting held on 25 September to\ndiscuss the current situation in Africa. The meeting\nconsolidated the link between peace and development, the\nlatter being one of the basic human rights.\nIn the same context, in striving to develop a system of\ngood and responsible governance, the Sudan has witnessed\nimportant constitutional developments, which have been\nmanifested in the establishment of a national committee for\npreparing the draft of a permanent constitution to be\nsubmitted to the legislative body and then presented to the\npeople in a referendum.\nIn the economic field, in support of a market economy\nand policies of liberalization, we have taken serious steps\ntowards the rationalization of public expenditure, the\nprivatization of the public sector, the abolition of\nrestrictions on internal and external trade and the promotion\nof investment. These policies have led to the reactivation of\nthe economy and reduced the inflation rate from 114 per\ncent at the beginning of this year to 28.5 per cent in August\nof this year. Furthermore, we have achieved a positive\ngrowth rate of 5.5 per cent and stability in the rate of\nexchange of the national currency. This progress was\ncommended by the International Monetary Fund mission in\nits report to the Executive Council of the Fund last August.\nHowever, the major obstacle to the accomplishment of the\neconomic reform programme continues to be an\ninsufficiency of external resources needed to boost\nproduction. We therefore appeal to the donor countries\nand the international financial institutions to provide the\nnecessary resources for the completion of the process of\neconomic reform. We also reaffirm that the Sudan\nwelcomes and encourages private and joint investments in\nall fields.\nAs for the problem of debt, it is imperative to\naddress it within a comprehensive international framework\nand not on a bilateral basis, so as to make possible the\nbuilding of a world economic system based on justice and\nequality among all States without distinction.\nIn recognition of the importance of regional\neconomic cooperation, African States have taken steps\ntowards the revitalization of the African Economic\nCommunity, in addition to the subregional economic\norganizations, all of which need the support and\nassistance of the international community.\nWe should not fail to stress the aspirations of Africa\nwith regard to the implementation of the United Nations\nConvention to Combat Desertification and the importance\nof following up on the outcome of the World Food\nSummit in the context of achieving food security for the\nnations of the continent and of the necessity to provide\nthe required resources to the countries concerned. In this\ncontext, the Sudan reaffirms its readiness to effectively\ncontribute to the programmes and action plans for the\nprovision of food, with the serious participation of the\ninternational community.\nEconomic development on the one hand and security\nand stability on the other are two sides of the same coin.\nIn speaking about poverty eradication in the African\ncontinent, we must stress the need for the realization of\npeace as a means to guarantee the security of the African\npeoples on the one hand and to accelerate the continent's\ndevelopment on the other hand. In this respect we\ncommend the positive developments in Liberia and we\nhope that this model will encourage our brothers in\nSomalia and Congo (Brazzaville) to stop the bloodshed.\nWe also hope that in Sierra Leone the endeavours being\nled by the countries of West Africa will succeed in\nsolving the problems facing that country. Africa's need for\nsecurity, stability and development requires it to become\na zone free of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass\ndestruction. Africa needs assistance in clearing anti-\npersonnel landmines, left behind by civil wars in a\nnumber of its countries, including my own.\n23\n\n\nThe Sudan supports the efforts of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and of its Secretary-General, Mr.\nSalim Ahmed Salim, to restore peace and stability in many\nAfrican States. With regard to the formation of African\npeacekeeping forces, we stress the need to harmonize any\nmeasures taken in this matter with the resolutions and\npositions of the OAU. Africa should have the right, through\nits regional organizations, to take the initiative and to lead\nin this matter.\nWhile addressing the subject of economic hardship in\nAfrica, it is incumbent upon us to mention the exasperating\neffects of the imposition of sanctions, in particular those\nimposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. We call for the\nsettlement of this issue on the basis of the proposal\npresented by the OAU and the League of Arab States,\nsupported by the Non-Aligned Movement.\nWe support the proposal of the Non-Aligned\nMovement to lay down specific measures and rules for\nsanctions and to strictly observe the provisions of the\nCharter. We share the concerns expressed by the Secretary-\nGeneral in his report on the work of the Organization for\nthis year about the negative effects of sanctions on peoples.\nWe look forward to the proposals he has promised to\npresent in this regard.\nIn Asia, we welcome the return of Hong Kong to the\nparent country, the People's Republic of China. We are\nfollowing with interest the efforts of the Secretary-General's\nSpecial Envoy to Afghanistan. We hope that the parties in\nconflict will cooperate with the United Nations so as to\nreach a formula for understanding and agreement. We also\ncall upon the international community to support the\ncontinuous efforts to establish peace in the Korean\npeninsula.\nWith regard to developments in the Middle East, the\nSudan believes that a comprehensive, just and lasting peace\ncannot be achieved without a total commitment to the\nprinciples of justice and the complete preservation of the\nrights of the Palestinian people and the Arab States in the\nregion, or without a commitment to the agreements and\naccords reached by the parties concerned. Israel should\nabandon its settlement policies and withdraw from the all\nthe occupied Arab territories on the basis of the relevant\nSecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions, which\ncontinue to be the point of reference for a peaceful\nsettlement and for the achievement of a comprehensive\npeace in the Middle East.\nWe agree with what the Secretary-General stated in\nhis report to the tenth emergency special session of the\nGeneral Assembly about the seriousness of the situation\nin the region. The Secretary-General warned of the\nconsequences of the settlement policies in the occupied\nArab territories and the attempts to effect demographic\nand legal changes in Al-Quds aimed at its Judaization and\nthe alteration of its legal, geographical, historical,\nreligious and civilizational status. The Sudan calls upon\nthe international community to shoulder its responsibilities\nin the face of the deterioration of the situation and the\nescalation of confrontation to save the region from the\nspectre of war that appears over the horizon as a result of\nthe unacceptable Israeli practices. Furthermore, the Sudan\nis strongly opposed to Israeli attempts to impose\ncollective sanctions on the Palestinian people whatever\nthe justification or the pretext.\nIn the domain of international relations, the Sudan\nfollows policies and holds firm positions based on its\ncommitment to international and regional charters, the\nrespect of good- neighbourliness and regional cooperation\nand the suppression of terrorism and threats to regional\nand international security.\nThe Sudan continues to call for the abandonment of\nconflict and for regarding the interest of peoples as a\npriority that supersedes transient disagreements.\nThe application of the slogans of pluralism and\ndemocracy that characterize the present epoch in the\nprogress of humanity essentially requires respect for the\ndiverse cultural contexts of the peoples of the world.\nThose cultures should be allowed the opportunity of free\nand equitable self-expression in order to enrich human\nexperience and elevate the values of tolerance and\nacceptance of the other. That would lead to the restriction\nof recourse to violent and extreme expressions of injustice\nresulting from isolation and cultural arrogance.\nAll religions uphold the principles of tolerance, the\nacceptance of pluralism and coexistence with others. The\nHoly Koran says:\n\u201cSay Ye: We believe in Allah and the revelation\nGiven to us, and to Abraham, Ismail, Isaac, Jacob,\nand the Tribes, and that given to Moses and Jesus,\nand that given to all Prophets from their Lord: We\nmake no difference Between one and another of\nthem: And we submit to Allah.'\u201d (The Holy Koran,\nII:136).\n24\n\n\nIn this context, we support the statement of the\nGerman Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the need to\nencourage dialogue between civilizations to replace\nconflicts and rivalry, in order to build a world of tolerance\nand cooperation and so that slogans of pluralism and\ndemocracy may not themselves become a pretext for\ncultural hegemony.\nThe adoption by the United Nations of the idea of\nsetting up a body to promote dialogue between religions\nand civilizations would pave the way for the realization of\nthat noble objective and would reinstate respect for lofty\nmoral values. It would act as a strong deterrent to such\nsocial ills as drug abuse, the escalation of violence and\nterrorism and family disintegration, thus clearing the way\nfor a better future for humanity as it enters a new\nmillennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a great honour for me, as the representative\nof the people of Guatemala and as President pro tempore\nof the Central American Integration System, to\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your well-deserved\nelection to preside over the General Assembly at its fifty-\nsecond session.\nWe wish to thank the President and the Secretariat\nfor their understanding in allowing us to alter protocol\nand to address the Assembly in the form of a joint\npresentation. We Central Americans deemed it necessary\nand timely to do so because we wish in this way to\nhighlight the importance, the scope, the depth and the\nextent of the changes that are taking place in Central\n18\n\n\nAmerica after years of confrontation and suffering for our\npeoples and our region.\nWe bring good news. Central America is undergoing\nremarkable changes, and the Central American leaders wish\nto share together here in this world forum the progress\nachieved in our region. We bring news of peace, democracy\nand development, news of understanding and cooperation,\nnews of accord and unity. Our region is leaving behind\nyears of internal war and authoritarianism to move into a\nconstructive stage of political, economic, social, cultural\nand ecological strength, one that will enable us to enter the\nnew millennium with new hopes and achievements by our\npeoples. And this new stage is being constructed with the\nrespectful participation and responsible support of the\ninternational community.\nWe must recall that barely 12 years ago we Central\nAmericans were on the verge of a regional war and that our\ncountries were experiencing the with full intensity of being\none of the last settings of the so-called cold war. But then\nnegotiation prevailed over conflict and we found Central\nAmerican roads to peace, which led, 10 years ago to the\nEsquipulas II Accords, embodying the procedure for a firm\nand lasting peace in Central America.\nThe processes of dialogue and reconciliation moved\nforward along difficult and complex roads. The heat of\nbattle was replaced by the warmth of debate. Weapons were\nlaid down, and we began the difficult but unpostponable\nmarch towards reconciliation, towards a return to the rule\nof law, towards democratic strengthening and towards\npeaceful and constructive coexistence.\nAs may be recalled, at last year\u2019s session I came\nbefore the Assembly anticipating peace in my country. In\nless than 10 months during 1996 we were able to complete\nnegotiations on seven specific peace accords in Guatemala\nwith the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca\n(URNG) and thus, on 29 December of last year, we arrived\nat the signature of the final Agreement on a Firm and\nLasting Peace. Thus we did put an end to the 36 years of\ninternal armed conflict that had torn at the very vitals of\nmy country.\nAs many here know, the process of complying with\nthe accords has advanced with firm steps. Thanks to the\nwill of the parties and the timely and determined\ncollaboration of the international community, in barely three\nmonths the demobilization of the former guerrilla\ncombatants was completed, with the assistance of a military\nVerification Mission of United Nations Blue Berets,\napproved by the Security Council.\nWithout going into undue detail, I can reaffirm what\nwe reported a few days ago in my country: the process of\ncompliance with the peace accords is going forward\ndecisively with regard to all fronts and commitments. The\njoint commissions envisaged in the accords have already\nbeen established, thus creating the broadest and most\ndiversified structures of citizen participation in our\nhistory. The commitments on investment and public\nexpenditure on health, education, justice and security for\nthe people are already reflected in detail in the budget for\nnext year, not only increasing the ratio of social\ninvestment to levels unprecedented in our history but also\nchanging their orientation in order increasingly to favour\nrural areas. The National Congress is ready to discuss the\nagreed constitutional amendments. Similarly, the agreed\ninstitutional reforms have begun to be implemented in all\nareas. The process of the return of refugees from the\nneighbouring brotherly country of Mexico will be\ncompleted before the end of this year, and the guerrilla\norganizations that formed part of the URNG, having been\ndemobilized, are returning to legality and are becoming a\npolitical organization that will participate in future\nelections.\nAll of these important changes in my country are\nbeing verified and supported by the United Nations, for\nwhich we are deeply thankful. All these changes can be\nadded to others that have already taken place in our\nisthmus and that are enabling us to rediscover our\nregional agendas of democratization and development.\nIndeed, while peace negotiations were progressing and\nmaturing in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala, we\nonce again undertook to revitalize our regional integration\nprocess. Following the finalization of the series of peace\nnegotiations, that process of integration and regional\ndevelopment has taken on a renewed vigour and\ndynamism and has recently received a further important\nimpetus. It gives us real pride and hope to be able to\nshare with the Assembly a brief summary of our advances\nin that process and of the important decisions that we\nhave recently taken.\nFully aware that the region is going through a rare\nhistorical moment, one characterized by the existence of\npopularly elected Governments in all of the countries of\nCentral America and a situation of peace, we deem it\nessential to design and implement regional and unified\nresponses to the demands of our peoples and the\nchallenges of globalization.\n19\n\n\nDuring the past three years we have made\nextraordinary progress in our integration efforts, which\nextend from a new conceptual horizon, one that has become\nbetter balanced and more inclusive with the creation of the\nAlliance for Sustainable Development and the establishment\nof innovative regional projects to increase regional\ncompetitiveness by means of joint efforts on the part of\nGovernments, academic centres and sectors of production.\nWe replaced the former common market in 1991 with\na new legal framework that created the Central American\nIntegration System (SICA). However, as we were also\nconvinced of the need to go beyond mere governmental\ncooperation in our regional integration efforts, a few weeks\nago, in Panama, we took an important step towards\nstrengthening, deepening and developing our regional\ncooperation. We agreed on the broadest possible review and\nmodernization of our regional institutional framework, as\nwe were convinced that the benefits of development to\nwhich our people are entitled cannot be tapped by each\ncountry separately \u2014 they are attainable only to a regional\ncommunity, because of the dynamics of today\u2019s\nincreasingly interdependent environment.\nFor the first time, at our most recent meeting in\nManagua, all the Governments of the area agreed that we\nneed to look beyond economic integration and clearly show\nthe will and resolve needed to direct our efforts towards a\npossible regional political union, a community of\nindependent nations that pool their capabilities without\nlosing their individuality. And that is how we agreed to\nbegin the gradual and continuing process of setting up the\nCentral American Union, as a higher expression of\ncommunitarian partnership stipulated in the 1991 Protocol\nof Tegucigalpa.\nThus, we have taken the first step in a broad and\ncomplex process that can bring us closer to the vision of a\nCentral American Union, with the ultimate goal of\nproducing the concrete results sought by our populations:\novercoming poverty, creating opportunities, increasing the\nnumber of jobs, activating our production capacity,\nincreasing our competitiveness, equitable and unified\nparticipation in the benefits of development, genuine\ndemocratization, equitable access to an efficient system of\njustice and the legitimate enjoyment of peaceful\ncoexistence.\nWe have redoubled our efforts to ensure that Central\nAmerica is more united and better prepared to face the\nenormous challenges of its development and to respond\ncreatively and dynamically to the international demands of\nour contemporary and ever changing world. We, the\nCentral American leaders, have come together to this\nforum as genuinely united nations to demonstrate our\ncommon aim of regional unity and the efforts we are\nmaking to that end. We reiterate our deep appreciation for\nthe support and cooperation of the international\ncommunity to date, and I offer my best wishes for the\nprosperity of all as the new millennium dawns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, let me say how very pleased I am to\ncongratulate you sincerely, Sir, on behalf of the\ndelegation of the Kingdom of Morocco, on your\nelection to preside over the fifty-second session of the\nGeneral Assembly \u2014 an election that is a token of\nconsideration for your political experience and great\ncompetence.\nIt is also a pleasure for me to salute you, Sir, as\nthe representative of the friendly country of Ukraine,\nwhich has solid ties of friendship and full cooperation\nwith the Kingdom of Morocco. I am convinced that\nyour vast experience and excellent command of\n11\n\n\ninternational affairs will guarantee the success of our\ndebates and will lead our session to results that open up\nnew prospects of peace, cooperation and prosperity.\nI should like to take this opportunity to express to\nthe outgoing President, Mr. Razali Ismail, the\nrepresentative of the friendly country of Malaysia, our\nrespect and gratitude for his efforts and for having\nsuccessfully guided the work of our previous session.\nI should also like to extend to the new Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, my most\nsincere congratulations on the confidence placed in him\nby virtue of his election as Secretary-General, which\ncrowns many years of competent management and\ntireless effort within the context of the United Nations.\nHis election also reaffirms the deep consideration in\nwhich the friendly country of Ghana is held.\nSince our last session, the world has been\nexperiencing a period of various political and economic\ninteraction which, unfortunately, has not lived up to\nmankind's aspirations for bringing the international\ncommunity closer to tranquillity, security and peace.\nInternational relations indeed continue to be fraught with\nvarious tensions and disturbances. Thus, on the\ninternational scene, new conflicts have emerged which\nthreaten the security, stability and sovereignty of peoples.\nGiven these challenges, we believe that those\nproblems which emerge in the international arena today\ncan be resolved only through international efforts under\nthe auspices of the United Nations. In this context, we\napplaud the efforts made by the Secretary-General to\nreform and restructure the United Nations and improve its\nworking methods in accordance with the requirements of\nthis age. In the same way, we reaffirm our support for all\nof these efforts aimed at strengthening our Organization\nand enhancing its effectiveness to allow it to carry out its\nmission in full, in accordance with the provisions of the\nCharter.\nWe firmly believe that the aims of any reform\ndesigned to restructure the Organization and rationalize\nits expenditures can be attained only if due account is\ntaken of the interests of the developing countries and,\nabove all, if reform provides for a solution to their\neconomic and social problems as well as the provision of\nmaterial and technical means required for these ends.\nWith regard to enlargement of the Security\nCouncil, we would like to stress the need for consensus\nand the achievement of balanced and equitable\nrepresentation of all continents, in particular since the\nconditions in which United Nations bodies, including\nthe Security Council, were established have now\ndisappeared. The world is now witnessing profound and\nswift changes which force us to reconsider the\ncomposition and role of the Security Council to make it\na genuinely effective instrument which is not subject to\nobjectives and interests which contravene the Charter.\nThe international community welcomed with\noptimism the peace process which began in the Middle\nEast on the basis of agreements reached between the\nparties concerned. However, the interruption of this\npeace process, as a result of the violation by the\nGovernment of Israel of all previous commitments and\nthe contravention of all obligations and rules of\ninternational conduct now threaten to wipe out all\nprevious efforts to strengthen the foundations for peace\nin the region.\nThe violation by the Government of Israel of its\ncommitments was illustrated by its decision to resume\nits settlement policy and to alter the cultural\ncharacteristics and demographic composition of East\nJerusalem. This decision is in violation of previous\nagreements with the Palestinian side. This unilateral and\nillegitimate decision is also a blatant violation of the\nFourth Geneva Convention, which forbids occupation\nauthorities from effecting any changes in the territories\nunder their control.\nIsrael, which is still persisting in its refusal to\nimplement Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338\n(1973) and 425 (1978), has once again brought about\nan escalation of tension in southern Lebanon, and is\ncontinuing to ignore the Syrian proposals to resume\nnegotiations from the point at which they were broken\noff.\nOur vision emanates from our conviction that\npeace in the region cannot endure or achieve its goals\nexcept through equitable treatment which guarantees the\nmutual interests of all parties and in the context of a\nregion free from weapons of mass destruction.\nConvinced as we are of the need to pursue peace\nefforts, and conduct this process in accordance with the\nlegal framework laid down for it, we would like to\nstress the need to honour all the obligations stipulated\n12\n\n\nin the agreements signed, and the adherence to credibility\nin dealings based on such agreements, which will lead to\npeace and security for all the peoples of the region, and\nallow the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-\ndetermination and establish their independent State with\nAl-Quds as its capital.\nIn this framework, the international community\nshould take the necessary measures to make Israel respect\nand implement Security Council resolutions.\nThe stability of the Middle East requires the\nestablishment and consolidation of security in the Gulf\nregion. We deplore the sufferings of the Iraqi people,\nwho are living in extremely harsh conditions as a result\nof the economic embargo which has been imposed on\nthem for many years now, and we reaffirm that the\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 986 (1995)\non \u201coil for food\u201d is a first step towards lifting the\nembargo imposed on the Iraqi people. We look forward\nto the day in the near future which will mark the end of\nthat suffering and the return of Iraq to the exercise of its\nrights as a member of the Arab family of nations and an\nactive and constructive member of the international\ncommunity.\nMorocco, as a part of the Arab Maghreb region,\ntakes a special interest in the existing dispute between the\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya and certain western countries\nbecause of its negative impact on the regional situation\nand on the brotherly Libyan people.\nThus, we call for a favourable response to the\ninitiatives undertaken by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and\nthe flexibility it has demonstrated, and the efforts exerted\nby the Arab Maghreb Union, the League of Arab States,\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-\nAligned Movement with a view to lifting the sanctions\nimposed on Libya.\nMorocco, which has closely followed the\ndevelopment of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nand has contributed, along with other members of the\ninternational community, to the initiatives proposed by\nthe chair of the Organization of the Islamic Conference,\nand through participation of Moroccan military units in\nthe Implementation Force and Stabilization Force,\nexpresses its satisfaction at the progress made in the\nimplementation of the military and civilian aspects of the\nDayton Accord, and stresses the need to pursue efforts to\nensure its full implementation with a view to establishing\nthe legitimate rights of the people of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and to contribute to the reconstruction of\nthe country through provision of the requisite means as\nagreed by the conferences of donor countries.\nAs an African nation, and given its age-old and\nvaried relations with other African countries, and\nfurthermore conscious of its obligations to Africa,\nMorocco expresses deep concern about the deterioration\nof the political, economic and social conditions in many\nparts of that continent.\nMorocco follows with deep concern the\npersistence of instability in some parts of Africa, and\nreaffirms its determination to support and enhance the\nefforts of the international community to find\nappropriate and lasting solutions to crises.\nOn the other hand, the woeful economic situation\nin Africa is a source of concern for the international\ncommunity. This situation is particularly reflected in the\nweak participation of the continent in world trade and\nin an increase in its debt burden. It is also reflected in a\nchronically inadequate infrastructure, a serious\ndeterioration in social and health conditions, and,\ndespite the stringent structural reforms introduced by\nAfrican countries, by the paucity of foreign investment.\nIn this context, we welcome the initiative taken by\nPortugal to convene a European-African summit\nmeeting to consider these conditions in the continent\nand to seek appropriate solutions. We consider that this\ninitiative reflects the awareness of the European Union\nin respect of its responsibilities with regard to Africa.\nMorocco therefore proposes the convening of a\nministerial meeting to prepare for that summit.\nSimilarly, the Security Council's initiative calling for\nthe convening of a special meeting at the foreign\nministerial level to consider the situation in Africa\nattests to the degree of concern of the international\ncommunity with regard to the gravity of that situation.\nIn its relations with all other African countries,\nMorocco has always adopted policies aimed at effective\ncooperation, taking into consideration the priorities and\nthe basic needs of our partners.\nAs a consequence of the profound changes that\naffected the world economy after the Second World\nWar, it has become current knowledge that the world is\ntoday characterized primarily by the globalization of the\neconomy. However, the new challenge which faces the\ninternational community today lies in coping with\n13\n\n\neconomic and social development issues in all their\ndimensions, and doing so in harmony with our efforts to\nachieve peace and security.\nThe liberalization of world markets and the\nglobalization and comprehensiveness of the world\neconomy have led to a noticeable increase in the volume\nof trade and financial flows. However, this has not eased\nthe marginalization of developing countries or reduced\ntheir debt burden.\nMorocco, which has been following with interest the\nactivities of the World Trade Organization (WTO),\nconsiders that liberalization of trade must be basically\naimed at correcting existing discrepancies and at\nnarrowing the gap between developed and developing\ncountries.\nWe hope that the second WTO conference, due to\ntake place in Geneva, will provide a new opportunity for\nthe international community which leads to consolidating\nthe bases and rules governing multilateral relations, and\nto taking decisions likely to reconcile the imperative for\ntrade liberalization and the requirements of development,\nwhile responding to the aspirations of developing\ncountries by allowing them, if necessary, to adopt\nprotectionist trade measures.\nWith regard to the question of the Sahara, Morocco,\nwhich cooperated with Mr. James Baker as soon as he\nwas appointed Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General\nfor Western Sahara, hopes that the results achieved will\nallow for the implementation of the United Nations\nsettlement plan. In this regard, Morocco, which took the\ninitiative of proposing a referendum in 1981, stresses\nonce more its readiness and desire to cooperate with the\nUnited Nations for the achievement of this objective.\nThe most important achievement of the international\ncommunity in this century, to which we soon bid\nfarewell, was the end of colonialism in almost all regions\nof the world. In the past few months, the world has\nwitnessed the return of Hong Kong to its parent country,\nthe People's Republic of China, and Macao will also be\nso returned in 1999. In the light of the example of Hong\nKong and the plans for the future of Macao, logic now\ndictates the elimination of all remaining pockets of\ncolonialism throughout the world.\nHere I am referring in particular to the Moroccan\ncities of Sebta and Melilla and the islands adjacent to\nthem, which remain under Spanish domination. Morocco\nhas always believed in the virtues of dialogue as a\ncivilized way of reaching a final settlement to the\nproblem of Sebta and Melilla so as to enable Morocco\nto regain its sovereignty over those territories while\nguaranteeing Spain's interests. It was in this context that\nHis Majesty King Hassan II took the initiative in\ncalling for the setting up of a Moroccan-Spanish unit to\nconsider a final solution to this question. This initiative\nimplies a greater rapprochement between the two\ncountries, whose impact would spread to wider and\nmore comprehensive fields.\nHumankind is still committed to the noble\npurposes laid down in the Charter of our Organization.\nIt is therefore incumbent upon us to pursue efforts\naiming at the furtherance of those purposes so that,\ntogether, in a spirit of confidence and renewed hope,\nwe may bring about a better future for all of\nhumankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I first take this\nopportunity to congratulate my very good friend, the\nForeign Minister of Ukraine, on his election as President\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-second session and to\nconvey to him the best wishes of Canada for a successful\nand productive association in this session. I know from\nour long personal contacts that the course of this\nimportant debate is in the best possible hands.\nLet me also take the opportunity to thank and\ncongratulate Ambassador Razali for his tireless and\neffective leadership of the General Assembly at the fifty-\nfirst session.\nI come to the Assembly today with a sense of\nurgency and an abiding faith and belief that we are now\nemerging, not only from the shadows of the cold war, but\nalso from the uncertainties of its aftermath.\n\nAround the world, we see countless examples of the\nbasic principles and overall vision of the United Nations\nCharter being put into practice. The people of the world\nare laying the foundations of a new international system\nfor the new millennium.\n\nOf course, I recognize that no part of the world is\nwithout its burdens of conflict, grief and personal\nsuffering. Nor are there any great signs of relief from the\ngrowing burden of global economic inequities. What has\nchanged, however, is the new international willingness to\nface the issues, to mobilize political will and to launch\nreforms. There is a sense, not of helplessness, but of\nhope. The old realities of power have not disappeared,\nbut alongside them have appeared new forces, new\ncoalitions and new ways of doing business \u2014 and these\nforces are impatient. As we have seen, in fact, in recent\ndays, one person's vision and generosity can make a\ndifference and stand as an inspiration to us all.\nThis new spirit needs to be manifest and inspire\nthe work of the United Nations. The Secretary-General\nhas proposed a serious and far-sighted set of reforms.\nCanada strongly supports these proposals and accepts\nthem as a package. They promise not simply greater\nefficiency, but, we hope, greater effectiveness. Based\non our experiences in Canada, I can say with some\nauthority that budget-cutting by itself is not the answer.\nThere must be serious structural change to modernize\nexisting institutions, both national and international, that\nwere formed over 50 years ago.\nTo undertake these reforms, solutions must be\nbased on agreement and cooperation. Solutions cannot\nbe imposed by one country or one group, but rather\nmust be inspired by a sense of openness and\ninnovation. In other words, we must establish a new\ncompact amongst United Nations Members to set this\nOrganization on a sound financial footing. As\nMr. Udovenko has said, we are at a watershed, a\ndefining moment for the Organization that can either\nprovide new momentum or stall our advance. The\ndirection we take is ours collectively to decide and the\noutcome in all our hands. We must not waste this\nopportunity.\n(spoke in French)\nAnother defining moment, I believe, took place\njust over a week ago in Oslo. Ninety nations, spurred\non by the efforts of the non-governmental\norganizations, agreed on the text of a treaty banning\nanti-personnel landmines. The treaty will be signed this\ncoming December, just 14 months after it was first\nconceived.\n(spoke in English)\nWhile visiting the treaty discussions in Oslo, I was\nforcibly struck by how what has become known as the\nOttawa process demonstrates the changed character of\nworld affairs. Above all, it shows how the breakdown\nof the old bipolar world affords new opportunities for\ncivil society, private individuals, to influence\nmultilateral diplomacy. The focus of the Ottawa process\n19\n\n\nis a weapon that slaughters countless civilians, a weapon\nthat has lost much of its military utility, whatever some\nmay say. This illustrates the growing feeling, coming\nfrom the grass roots of the world community, that the\nengines of war designed for the twentieth century have\nno place in the twenty-first.\nI should say that this is not the only example of the\nnew grass-roots activism which points to the emergence\nof a global commons as a powerful positive force of\nglobalization. For example, Canadian women, appalled at\nthe treatment of their sisters in Afghanistan, have started\na letter-writing campaign. I will be delivering some 5,000\nletters today to the Secretary-General, which call on him\nto take the lead in exposing the gross human rights\nviolations of women in Afghanistan as unacceptable in\nthe eyes of the world's citizens.\nThe effectiveness of these new forces can be clearly\nmeasured. Nations from every region of the world have\npledged to sign on to a complete ban on the stockpiling,\nproduction, export and use of anti-personnel landmines.\nWe hope to see more join our ranks between now and\nDecember. For those who are still on the sidelines, we\nask them to think hard and deep on this issue. Their\nengagement is crucial. By joining us, already a majority\nof United Nations Member States, they can help rid the\nworld of this most inhumane weapon.\n(spoke in French)\nCanada recently announced its intention to destroy\nits remaining stocks of anti-personnel mines before\nsignature of the treaty. We will also shortly ratify the\namended Protocol II of the Convention on Certain\nConventional Weapons.\n(spoke in English)\nThis treaty constitutes a promise to future\ngenerations. But it does not resolve the equally grave\nproblems posed by mines already in the ground, nor does\nit address the plight of those who have experienced\ndirectly their dreadful impact.\nFollowing the signing of the treaty, the international\ncommunity will have an obligation to develop policies for\nan enhanced and coordinated approach to humanitarian\ndemining, and to victim assistance and rehabilitation.\nThis is, as much as anything else, a development\nissue. Heavily mined areas of the world cannot pursue\neconomic development until they have been demined;\nand demining is a hopeless task if there is no treaty to\nprevent the laying of new mines.\nAt Ottawa in December, we will invite nations to\nengage in a second phase of the campaign: a broad\nmobilization of groups and countries to tackle the\naftermath of the landmines crisis. It is a monumental\ntask, to be met only through the combined action of all\nStates. We invite all present to join us. The generosity\nof private citizens such as Ted Turner, or of the Auto\nWorkers' Union of Canada, and the commitment of\nthose like Princess Diana must be matched, indeed\nsurpassed, by the Governments of this world.\nIt is important to ask what is behind this\nwillingness to tackle these old problems in a new way?\nWhat has brought us to the intersection of high hopes\nand new strategies, and the real ability to effect change\nin the world, as exemplified by the landmines\ncampaign? To my mind, these developments and, above\nall the recognition of the need to adopt new approaches,\nare in part a response to the changing face of war.\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, we\nhave seen one type of conflict become prevalent. These\nare wars fought within, not between, States; wars that\ntend to be long and bitter; and wars, above all, in which\ncivilians suffer the most and children and women are\noften deliberately targeted. These are wars in which, in\nthe words of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry \u201cthe firing line passes\nthrough the hearts of people\u201d.\nAs this type of war increasingly accounts for the\ngreat majority of all conflicts, the distinctions that once\ninformed the work of international diplomacy \u2014\nbetween military security concerns and humanitarian or\ncivil concerns \u2014 break down. This blurring of the\nlines, along with heightened media presence, has\nstrongly affected international opinion. Fewer and fewer\npeople are willing to view war as an acceptable\ninstrument of state policy.\nIn the light of these changes, the concept of\nhuman security, which I highlighted when I addressed\nthe Assembly last year, takes on growing relevance. It\nis based on the premise that it is not enough to spare\npeople from the \u201cscourge of war\u201d narrowly defined.\nEnsuring true, sustainable human security means\ntackling other severe threats: the unmet needs of more\nthan a billion people living in poverty; attacks on\nhuman rights of individuals and groups within society;\n20\n\n\ntransnational threats, such as crime and terrorism; and\nthreats to health and livelihood through depletion or\npollution of our resources.\nThe problems of these new global issues will not\nwait for long-term solutions. It is urgent that we take\naction to prevent or reduce the incidence of conflict, to\nrestore societies in the aftermath of conflict and to\nincrease human security around the world.\nThe priorities for action can, in my view, be\ngrouped under three main headings: addressing issues\nwhich cut across traditional boundaries between areas of\nconcern, such as we have in the landmines campaign;\nidentifying and addressing the root causes of conflict; and\nimproving our ability to respond to crises when we\ncannot prevent them.\nLet me talk about that first priority. Landmines are\nnot the only complex, cross-cutting problem to be\naddressed if we are to reduce the impact of conflict. All\ntoo often it is small arms, rather than the major weapons\nsystems targeted by our disarmament efforts, that cause\nthe greatest bloodshed. In the hands of terrorists,\ncriminals, the irregular militia and armed bands typical of\ninternal conflict, these are the true weapons of mass\nterror. As with landmines, their victims are all too often\ncivilians.\nWe welcome the recent report of the United Nations\nPanel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms and\ndiscussions within the United Nations Disarmament\nCommission on disarming combatants as a step towards\nmore lasting peace. These should serve as the launching\npad from which to develop practical measures, in\nconsultation with regional bodies.\n(spoke in French)\nTo tackle this problem, the first steps must be to\ncombat illicit trafficking in firearms and to bring greater\ntransparency to the legal exportation of small arms. The\nOrganization of American States (OAS) is currently\nworking towards an Inter-American convention on illicit\ntrafficking in firearms. Canada hopes that the OAS\nnegotiations will result in an effective convention and\nwill also inspire other regional bodies to take action.\n(spoke in English)\nRidding the world of anti-personnel landmines and\nbanning or limiting other forms of weapons directly\nreduce the human suffering caused by conflict. The\nother side of the same coin is building and enhancing\nhuman security. By building peace, reducing\nunsustainable military expenditures, promoting equitable\nand sustainable development and encouraging stable,\ndemocratic societies which respect human rights, we\nnot only limit human suffering, but we also address the\nroot causes of conflict itself.\nTo do this requires solutions that are built from\nthe inside, not imposed from the outside. Sustainable\npeace can be built only through the active cooperation\nand participation of Governments, peoples, and groups\ncaught in the conflict itself.\nAt the same time, a parallel effort is required to\nreform the United Nations development funds and\nprogrammes. Canada strongly supports the Secretary-\nGeneral's reform proposals in this area. We place\npriority on improving coordination within the United\nNations system at the country level, including among\nthe specialized agencies and the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions, in order to maximize development impact.\nCanada, through diplomacy and development\nassistance, has supported peace-building activities in\ncertain regions for many years. To give further impetus\nto this approach, last October I announced the Canadian\npeace-building initiative. Its aim is to coordinate\nCanadian programmes and policies in support of\nconflict prevention and resolution, peace-building and\npost-conflict reconstruction. A peace-building\nmechanism or fund has provided a rapid response\nmechanism in areas of conflict.\nOver the last six months, we have used this peace-\nbuilding fund for the following purposes: to provide\ncritical start-up funding for the historical clarification\nCommission in Guatemala; to assist the preparatory\ncommission for the establishment of an international\ncriminal court by underwriting the participation of\ndelegates from developing countries; and to provide\nfinancial assistance for the work of the joint United\nNations/Organization of African Unity (OAU) Special\nRepresentative for the Great Lakes region of Africa,\nMr. Mohamed Sahnoun.\nIn addition, Canada is prepared to contribute up to\n$500,000 from this fund for the establishment in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina of a non-governmental organization\nfoundation to develop civil society on the basis of\n21\n\n\nmulti-ethnic cooperation. I urge other members to join us\nin supporting this foundation.\nFinally, I am pleased to announce a Canadian\ncontribution of $500,000 from the peace-building fund to\nthe new United Nations Trust Fund for Preventive\nAction, created by the Secretary-General in response to a\nproposal from the Norwegian Government.\nA second promising area of work on the root causes\nof conflict lies in exploring the links between security\nand development, and particularly in reducing levels of\nmilitary expenditures relative to economic and social\nspending. Last year Canada sponsored, together with the\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development\n(OECD) a symposium on military expenditures in\ndeveloping countries which brought together a wide range\nof experts who identified areas for further action: small-\narms proliferation, about which I have just spoken,\nregional security, good governance and the rule of law.\nThe United Nations has established important tools\nto build the confidence necessary for reductions in\nmilitary spending, in the form of the United Nations\nRegister of Conventional Arms and the United Nations\nstandardized reports on national military expenditures.\nMuch more work is needed, particularly at the regional\nlevel, to identify ways to reduce military spending and to\nredirect scarce national resources to the economic and\nsocial development goals.\nA third area of attention is work on conflict that\ncomes from threats to environmental sustainability.\nEnvironmental problems have the capacity to imperil\nliving standards and to endanger the well-being of future\ngenerations. For these reasons, Canada strongly supports\nnew agreements on hazardous chemicals, including\npersistent organic pollutants, and will work to ensure the\nsuccess of the new intergovernmental forum on forests.\nCombating desertification also remains a priority for us,\nand we have offered to host the Desertification\nConvention secretariat.\nThe fourth and final promising area in addressing\nthe root causes of conflict is human rights and good\ngovernance. Next year we celebrate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. This is an opportunity for all of us to reaffirm\nstrongly the fundamental importance of this document\nand our commitment to the common standards it sets out.\nIn recognition of the importance of this\nanniversary, Canada will be sponsoring a broad\nprogramme of activities, including a major world\nconference on human rights and the Internet, to draw\ntogether work being done in many international forums,\nwith a focus on strategies for using the new\ninternational telecommunications technology to increase\nrespect for human rights. We are working on the\ndevelopment and publication of an annual report on the\nstate of human rights worldwide, based on the findings\nof the United Nations independent human rights\nmechanisms. And we will hold a conference reviewing\nthe impact of the 1993 Vienna Declaration, to be held\nby Canadian non-governmental organizations.\nAbuse of human rights is sometimes excused as\nnecessary in the interests of stability and national\nsecurity, but the facts show otherwise. Countries with\ndemocratic governments which respect the fundamental\nrights of their citizens are less likely to wage war on\none another. They are also more likely over time to\nachieve high levels of economic development.\n\nRecognizing this, Canada has recently undertaken\na series of new bilateral human rights initiatives. Our\naim is to work with our counterparts in other countries\nto establish discussions between governments to foster\nexchanges between institutions devoted to the protection\nof human rights and civil-society initiatives and projects\nfor the development of free media.\n\nWe also fully support the Secretary-General\u2019s\nproposals for reform measures to enhance United\nNations work in human rights. And we welcome the\nappointment of Mary Robinson as High Commissioner\nfor Human Rights, and offer her our support.\nAs we move towards the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, the challenges\nfacing the international community, if anything, have\nincreased. The trend towards targeting civilians in\nwarfare has resulted in severe infringements of the\nbasic rights of women and children. Too often we have\nseen children recruited as soldiers or women subjected\nto sexual assault as a deliberate weapon of terror.\nCanada continues to make the rights of the child\nand of women, both in conflict and in peace, a top\n22\n\n\nhuman rights priority, which we pursue actively in the\nUnited Nations and elsewhere. We welcome the\nappointment of Mr. Olara Otunnu as Special\nRepresentative to study the impact of armed conflict on\nchildren. We will shortly host a preparatory meeting for\nthe main donor countries invited to the Oslo child labour\nconference. And domestically we have launched a Child\nLabour Challenge Fund to support the efforts of our\nprivate sector to address the problem of exploitative child\nlabour.\nNowhere is the link between human rights and\nhuman security clearer than in the issue of children\u2019s\nrights. By protecting the basic rights of the world\u2019s\nchildren, we are nurturing a future generation of citizens\nwith both the means and the desire to live in peace.\nThe final overall priority for action is crisis\nresponse. And despite our best efforts, there will be times\nwhen conflict looms, or when it cannot be prevented.\nThese situations call for rapid, decisive action, whether to\nforestall conflict or contain it when it breaks out. These\nactions include not only peacekeeping and other military\nmeasures, but also humanitarian and judicial responses.\nTo date, the international community appears to\nhave identified the lessons that the missions to Somalia,\nBosnia, Rwanda and Zaire have taught us, but not to\nhave learned from them. In crisis situations, speed is the\nkey to effective response. This is why Canada has been\nso active in efforts to develop a United Nations rapid-\nresponse and deployment capability, in particular a\nrapidly deployable mission headquarters here in New\nYork. This would not only permit the timely insertion of\nmilitary forces, but also integrate civilian and\nhumanitarian organizations into mission planning and\ndeployment.\nCanada hopes to see measurable progress on the\nrapidly deployable headquarters and on the Danish-led\nStandby Forces High-Readiness Brigade initiative. These\nimprovements to the United Nations rapid-response\ncapability are complementary, feasible and should be\nimplemented without delay. Let us learn our lesson, and\nnot ignore it once again.\nIn addition to rapid military and humanitarian\nreaction, a key element of the United Nations response to\nconflict is the application of justice and the international\nrule of law. Canada strongly supports the timely\nestablishment of an independent, effective international\ncriminal court. In order to be effective, the court must\nhave inherent jurisdiction over the core crimes of\ngenocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. In\norder to be independent, the court must not be\nprecluded from dealing with matters on the Security\nCouncil agenda.\nIn conclusion, let me say that, as we all recognize,\nthe United Nations was originally established as an\ninstrument of international peace. Since that time, war\nhas put on a new face. More and more, it has targeted\nprimarily civilian populations. If the United Nations is\nto be effective \u2014 and I believe that the need for\neffective multilateralism has never been greater \u2014 the\nUnited Nations must adapt to this changing face of war.\nAt the same time, the United Nations must also\nrecognize that it, too, has changed at its very\nfoundation. Both its membership and its mandate have\nexpanded, and the growing importance of United\nNations development and humanitarian activities have\nmade their mark. Clearly, it is time for concerted\nreflection on the purpose and functioning of this body\nthat we have built together \u2014 including on the difficult\nissues of financing and reform of the Security Council.\nThe reform and expansion of the Security Council\nis a major undertaking of direct concern to all Member\nStates. The long-term implications must be fully\ndebated and carefully weighed, and the process must be\nfair and open. It must attract a broad consensus and\ncannot be rushed to accommodate other goals \u2014\nincluding a short-term solution to the United Nations\nfinancial crisis. Canada wants to see a Security Council\nthat is effective, transparent, broadly representative and,\nabove all, less elitist and more democratic. The primary\ncriteria for membership should be commitment to the\nideals and undertakings of the United Nations and a\nwillingness to remain always accountable to the full\nmembership of this Assembly.\nBroader United Nations reform must necessarily\nfail so long as Member States continue to demand more\nof a system to which they contribute less. Effective\nleadership and moral authority are rooted in respect for\nundertakings and obligations freely entered into by\nMember States. It is the responsibility of each and\nevery Member to pay its dues. These obligations apply\nin full, on time and without conditions.\nLooking ahead, there may be a time when we will\nchoose to reconsider aspects of the current financial\nunderpinnings of the United Nations. Indeed, we may\n23\n\n\ncollectively decide that in order to broaden\nresponsibilities and share power in ways that better\nreflect current international realities, some adjustments to\nthe scale of assessments are warranted. Such decisions,\nhowever, can be neither prejudged nor presumed, and\nwould no doubt be influenced by the commitment of\nthose advocating such changes to the broader purposes of\nthis Organization.\nThe international context in which the United\nNations functions has changed profoundly. Around the\nworld, people are reshaping the way they live \u2014 be it by\nseeking more food, better air or greater democracy.\nCrucial to this massive transformation is the search for\nsecurity, through both the reduction of conflict and the\nbuilding of a better life in times of peace. The United\nNations has long symbolized these dual hopes, for escape\nfrom \u201cthe scourge of war\u201d and for \u201cbetter standards of\nlife in larger freedom\u201d.\nI close my remarks today on a note of hope, quoting\nPresident V\u00e1clav Havel of the Czech Republic, who said,\n\u201cHope is definitely not the same thing as optimism.\nIt is not a conviction that something will turn out\nwell, but the certainty that something makes sense,\nregardless of how it turns out.\u201d\nOur hope lies in the certainty that the United Nations, as\nthe standard-bearer of international values, of a sense of\nmultilateralism and of a sense of cooperation and\npartnership, makes sense for all of us. This must spur us\non in this Assembly for the challenges that lie ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to take this\nopportunity, on behalf of the Government of the Republic\nof the Marshall Islands, to congratulate Mr. Hennadiy\nUdovenko on his election and to commend the President of\nthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly for a job\nwell done.\nMy delegation has stressed the importance of\nsustainable development ever since we first became a\nMember of the United Nations. Our convictions and our\nsupport were most recently reiterated by His Excellency\nThe Honourable Imata Kabua, President of the Republic\nof the Marshall Islands, at the special session of the\nGeneral Assembly to review Agenda 21. It is, and will\nremain, the cornerstone of the Government\u2019s policy, but\nI must recall the sentiments that we have often voiced:\nsustainable development is not the easiest path to travel\nfor a small country like the Marshall Islands. There are\nnumerous obstacles which we must face and which are\nimpeding our progress. Please let me try to put this into\nbetter perspective.\nPopulation growth in the Marshall Islands and in\nmany parts of the Pacific is of great concern to our\nGovernments. It has been as high as 4.2 per cent but now\nappears to be slowing down to 3.5 per cent. This is\nnevertheless far too high a figure for our small country to\nsustain. With rather limited resource bases to begin with,\nit is difficult to imagine what job opportunities will have\nto be created for new generations. We are already facing\nproblems with layoffs in the public sector. Granted, it was\nmuch too large. It was at one point almost 60 per cent of\nthe work force but is now down to 43 per cent. This is\nstill a very high number, and we are looking into all sorts\nof methods of increasing private sector investment to\nincrease private sector employment.\nBut population growth also has a negative impact on\nour local environment. There is a growing trend of\nmigration to the two main urban centres of the Marshall\nIslands \u2014 Majuro, the capital, and Ebeye, close to the\nUnited States base at Kwajalein. These areas are\nbecoming increasingly crowded, and there is an urgent\nneed to find local solutions. There is a great need to\nimprove urban conditions, but at the same time we also\nwish to reduce the rate at which the urban centre\npopulation grows.\nIn a democracy like ours, it is difficult to try to\nimpose any restrictions; instead, we have tried to look\ninto incentives. One idea that has been tried is job\ncreation in the outer islands. We have long been aware of\nthe potential that the outer islands could have if there\nwere only more investment in sustainable development\nprojects.\nPopulation growth is causing difficulties for the\ncountry in many diverse fields, but Government and local\nauthority action is making some progress. Our youth and\nchurch groups in particular are taking up this issue as a\nmain concern for the future. But this is only one of many\nproblem which we have to face.\n22\n\n\nWe have by no means given up on the struggle to\nachieve sustainable development and the improvement of\nliving standards in the Marshall Islands. On the\nGovernment side we are first of all looking at how existing\nstructures can be reformed and how better to utilize our\nresources. We are interested in any innovations that could\nhelp us. But it is increasingly clear that if we are to break\nout of destructive cycles and move away from\nunsustainable patterns, then we must all work together.\nThere will continue to be a need for external assistance to\nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands, but this can and must\nbe channelled in a more appropriate manner.\nLast year we reported that the damage caused by\nnuclear-weapons testing in the Marshall Islands was far\nmore extensive and devastating than previously understood.\nWe now know that many more islands and groups of\npeople were affected. The testing programme in the\nMarshall Islands helped the international community\nunderstand the effects of nuclear weapons on people and\nthe environment. This knowledge was a contributing factor\nto the prevention of nuclear war during the cold-war era. In\nthe Marshall Islands, we believe that we played a\nsignificant role in bringing about the end of the cold war.\nWe share the commitment of the United Nations to world\npeace, security and disarmament.\nThere is little question that the nuclear-testing\nprogramme in the Marshall Islands was the defining\nexperience of the Marshallese people in this century. The\n67 nuclear-weapon tests conducted in our country and the\ntests conducted on our neighbouring Pacific islands\ncontaminated every inch of our environment and exposed\neach one of our citizens to radiation. As a result, my\nGovernment is desperately seeking resources to address the\ndirect medical and environmental consequences of radiation\nexposure, since we do not have sufficient funds. We are\nalso struggling to deal with the indirect problems of the\ndisplacement of, and the lack of adequate medical care for,\nthe affected population. It places an additional burden on\nour already constrained medical care resources.\nWe cannot solve these problems on our own, and we\nfeel obliged to appeal to the international community. We\ncertainly appreciate all efforts to address our problems\nmade by our former administering authority, and we are\nencouraged by recent indications that the United States is\nwilling to address outstanding concerns. Yet present efforts\nto address lingering consequences are inadequate.\nMarshallese people have the basic human right, like all\npeople throughout the world, to a healthy and clean\nenvironment. We are justified, therefore, in asking\nassistance in restoring our lands and returning our\ndisplaced populations to a safe environment.\nIn this regard the United Nations has an important\nrole to play. We are encouraged that the International\nAtomic Energy Agency is in the process of conducting a\nsurvey in the northern areas of the Marshall Islands. But\nanother body, the United Nations Scientific Committee on\nthe Effects of Atomic Radiation, could in our view have\na much greater role. We have noted the terms of\nreference of that Scientific Committee, and we see no\nreason why it cannot undertake studies that could in the\nfuture assist those populations that are suffering from the\neffects of atomic radiation. In our view it must go beyond\na simple academic understanding and have a role that\nwould allow more interaction with affected countries. I\nwas also a little puzzled by the brevity of the Scientific\nCommittee\u2019s last report \u2014 only one page. We would like\nto request that the Committee expand its scope of work,\nto see how it could look into areas, like the Marshall\nIslands, affected by nuclear tests. We would be willing to\nassist the Scientific Committee in obtaining, for its\nconsideration, documents and declassified information\npertaining to nuclear testing and its effects on people. My\ndelegation intends to review this issue in the Fourth\nCommittee.\nMy country, all low-lying atolls, with no mountains,\nis also facing a most serious threat of sea level rise.\nWhile we are here discussing this issue, the effects of\nerosion, storms and tide surges are already being felt in\nthe Marshall Islands. We are of the firm opinion that the\nscientists working with the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC) have by now made such a\nconvincing argument about this troubling issue. This\nconsensus has been reflected in the acceptance by all\nGovernments concerned of the Second Assessment Report\nof the IPCC. As a result of this acceptance of the\nscientific proof, we would have expected, at the very\nleast, that the developed countries would agree to\nundertake so-called no-regrets measures. Such measures\nseek to improve efficiency and reduce waste, and to\ndevelop alternative sources of energy. My Government\nfully supports such initiatives, as they seem to us to be a\nperfectly sensible way to begin addressing climate change.\nBut we are finding that there is resistance even to such a\nmodest idea aimed at trying to halt this irresponsible\nwaste of natural resources and fossil fuels. I have been\nhearing reports that in the negotiating process there are\nstill those countries that seek to undermine the process\nitself for their own short-term gains. I can only say that\nmy Government is saddened by these countries\u2019 attitude.\n23\n\n\nFor this reason, a Pacific regional expert group has warned\nthat we may have to look at our migration options, rather\nthan adaptation options. Are we willing to see the\ndisappearance of whole countries for the sake of short-term\neconomic gain?\nA recent newspaper ad campaign here in the United\nStates has further attempted to add confusion and doubt in\nregard to the scientific evidence, and is also spreading\nalarmist doomsday scenarios for the economies of the\ndeveloped countries. This is simply a misrepresentation of\nwhat is being discussed and of what has been proposed, as\nwell as what is likely to be the result if we do not act now.\nI was further amazed at seeing television ads stating similar\nmisleading information. The question that appears to be\nraised is that the developed countries will pay a heavy\nfinancial price for ineffective measures. The suggestion here\nis that climate change is a preposterous plot by developing\ncountries to dominate the industrialized economies. But\nclimate change would be costly to us all. The destruction of\nsmall island developing States and other low-lying areas\nwill only be the first marker as the flood gates open for\nfull-blown climate change. There should be no\nmisconception that there is any other option except action\nto significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I wish to\nstate our position, supported by scientists, economists and\nconcerned people, that inaction will result in a disaster for\nmankind. What we need as the first step are significant,\nlegally binding cuts in the greenhouse gas emissions of the\nindustrialized world.\nPlease allow me to state our gratitude to and full\nsupport for the Secretary-General in his efforts and\nproposals to reform the United Nations. His report has been\nstudied by our officials, and we have concluded that we\nmust give the Secretary-General our full backing on his\nvision for a reformed United Nations. I have some\nexperience with the difficulties of bringing reform to an\nunwilling system, and we understand fully what he is going\nthrough. But reform is crucial if we are to have a forward-\nlooking and effective United Nations, a United Nations that\ncan assist us developing countries in our search for\nsustainable development. All the national efforts of\ncountries like the Marshall Islands require an international\nsupport structure that is conducive to sustainable\ndevelopment goals. The United Nations has a crucial and\nvital role, and we must maintain its leadership and\ncoordination function.\nReform of the United Nations requires that the\nMember States recommit themselves to their treaty\nobligations to negotiate in good faith and find the mutually\nbeneficial steps that we need to take. I wish to reiterate\nthe support which my Government has given to the\nproposals that have come out of the Committee on\nContributions as a good starting point for financial\nreform. Let us take these modest first steps, and then in\nthe next phase we can finish the reform.\nReform will also have to involve the expansion of\nthe Security Council. We have stated our support for\nvarious proposals in past general debates, and we have\nbeen involved in the working groups. Last week the\nPrime Minister of Fiji reiterated their proposal to give\nmore prominence to the Pacific as a subregion of the\nAsian Group. This is an idea that we wholeheartedly\nembrace. It has captured a very important facet of the\nreasons why we need to have expansion \u2014 that is, to\nfacilitate the participation of all countries in the Security\nCouncil. Our countries would feel much more\ncomfortable with the decisions of the Security Council if\nwe had a better opportunity to be a member. There is also\na need to review the use and extent of the veto power,\nand whether there should in fact be any new permanent\nmembers of the Security Council. It may well be that a\nmore equitable rotation structure would suffice.\nThese are some of the most pressing issues before\nthis session of the General Assembly. The connection\nbetween what occurs in the international community and\nthe impact the results have on individual countries should\nbe made clearer. The sustainable development process\nthat we wish to work towards requires a great effort on\nthe part of the Marshall Islands Government and\ncitizenry.\nSimilarly, the international community as a whole\nmust be involved in charting a more democratic and\ncooperative future in this singular world organization. We\nfeel that we deserve the support of the international\ncommunity for our own efforts, and we pledge to work\nconstructively with the United Nations system and donor\ncommunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, may I\ncongratulate Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on his election as\nPresident of the fifty-second session of the General\nAssembly and wish him much success in this important and\nresponsible function. I should also like to use this\nopportunity to thank his predecessor, Ambassador Razali\nIsmail, who, with his typical energetic approach,\ncontributed greatly to the success of the fifty-first session.\nThe recently concluded fifty-first session of the\nGeneral Assembly can certainly be described without\nexaggeration as one of the key periods in the history of the\nUnited Nations. The important reform proposals submitted\nduring its course will, if carried out, result in the most\nfundamental change in the structure and activities of the\nUnited Nations since its foundation. We strongly believe\nthat the Organization will emerge from the reform process\nreinforced and that this process will increase the importance\nof the United Nations as a global forum that focuses on the\nserious problems facing our world today, open to all who\nwish and are willing to take part.\nWe greatly appreciate the vigour and vision with\nwhich the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has\ncommitted himself to the reform efforts. We support the\nmeasures he has already taken to make the work of the\nUnited Nations Secretariat more effective as well as the\npackage of recommendations he submitted to the General\nAssembly last July. Whether or not these concrete and\neffective reform steps are really put into effect now\ndepends on the political will of the Member States. The\nCzech Republic will make every effort to be most\ncooperative in this respect.\nWe are glad that the reform efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral have met with a favourable response on the part\nof the Member States. His proposals have been supported\nalso by the 16 Heads of State and Government associated\nin the Carlsson Group, of which Czech President V\u00e1clav\nHavel is also a member. As this Group stated in its\ndeclaration of 10 August 1997 on the Secretary-General\u2019s\nreform proposals, the United Nations has a chance to take\na step forward, and this chance should not be missed.\nAs for restructuring the Security Council, the Czech\nRepublic prefers the expansion of both Council-member\ncategories while preserving the Council\u2019s effectiveness\nand flexibility. We continue to support an increase in the\nnumber of permanent members to include Germany,\nJapan and three other countries representing Africa, Asia\nand Latin America. My country also advocates expansion\nof the category of non-permanent seats, including one seat\nfor the Group of Eastern European States.\nThe reform of the Security Council should also\nresult in improving and simplifying the Council\u2019s working\nmethods. My country has actively participated in\ndiscussions of this question and has submitted a proposal\nfor a broader interpretation of Article 31 of the United\nNations Charter. We are pleased that our proposal has\nbeen backed by a number of Member States and believe\nit will become part of the working methods of the\nreformed Security Council.\nIt is quite unthinkable to restructure the United\nNations without changing its present system of financing.\nIn order to make cost-sharing more equitable it is\nnecessary to change the existing scale of assessments. The\nnew system of contributions to the regular budget and to\npeacekeeping operations should reflect the real economic\ncapacity of individual Member States. All Member States,\nwithout exception, should also duly comply with their\nfinancial obligations.\nFor my country, this year is a year of important\nevents. The invitation extended at the Madrid Summit to\nthree Central European countries, including the Czech\nRepublic, to open talks on accession to the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO), is a key and historic\n17\n\n\ndecision which we regard not as a first and last step, but,\nrather, as the beginning of the process of NATO\nenlargement. The Czech Republic is convinced that the\nalliance will in the future invite some other democratic\ncountries. The signing of the Founding Act on Mutual\nRelations, Cooperation and Security between the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization and the Russian Federation\nconstitutes an important step towards the strengthening of\nEuropean security.\nThe Czech Republic has noted with satisfaction that\nthe effort of the European Union to further enhance the\nintegration process achieved concrete results at the\nIntergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam. We\nwelcomed the European Commission\u2019s positive assessment\nof the Czech Republic as a candidate for European Union\nmembership. We believe that negotiations with the Czech\nRepublic and other candidates for membership can start in\nthe early months of 1998.\nOne of the basic prerequisites for a country\u2019s stability\nis harmonious relations with its neighbours. This is why we\nattach great importance to the Czech-German declaration on\nmutual relations and their future development, signed in\nPrague in January of this year. By signing this document\nthe two sides confirmed their political will to further\nintensify all-round bilateral cooperation as an expression of\ntheir determination to work jointly on shaping a peaceful\nfuture in Europe. In fact, this joint determination and\npolitical will is already being transformed into concrete\nsteps in different areas.\nWe are very sensitive to the political problems of our\npresent world, and, within our capacities, participate in their\nsolution. One of the most complicated issues is undoubtedly\nthe conflict in the former Yugoslavia, and particularly in\nBosnia and Herzegovina. We support the peace process\nbased on the Dayton Peace Accords and on the London\nProgramme of Action, and consider them the best possible\nsolution to the protracted conflict. It is beyond dispute that\none key prerequisite for the success of the peace process is\nthe just punishment of all war crimes committed during the\nconflict.\nWe also focus our attention on the situation in the\nMiddle East, the region currently being visited by President\nHavel. The peace process is now in a difficult phase, but its\nrole is irreplaceable. We hope, however, that bilateral talks\nbetween the State of Israel and its neighbours will lead to\ngreater stability in the region and eventually result in just\nand lasting peace for all.\nThe Czech Republic follows with much concern the\nsecurity and humanitarian situation in certain African\ncountries, in particular in the Great Lakes region, but also\nin Somalia and Sierra Leone. We fully support the efforts\nof the United Nations and the Organization of African\nUnity aimed at putting an end to unrest, wars and\nsuffering in Africa. Positive changes taking place in\nLiberia, for example, fill us with optimism. We believe\nthat the work done by our own military observers in the\noperations of the United Nations Observer Mission in\nLiberia has also contributed to this progress.\nMy country wishes to continue to participate in\nbuilding a global security architecture. Within the United\nNations we want to work actively, mainly in the fields of\npeacekeeping operations, arms control and disarmament.\nOur military observers, doctors and other medical\npersonnel participate in a number of United Nations\npeacekeeping operations. A Czech Army battalion has\nbeen operating in Bosnia and Herzegovina under NATO\ncommand within the multinational Stabilization Force, on\nthe basis of the Security Council mandate. It has been\nperforming its tasks well, and we are pleased that its\nactivities are being viewed positively.\nThe inclusion of the Czech Republic at the\nbeginning of this year in the Special Committee on\nPeacekeeping Operations is both a sign of appreciation of\nour activities in this field and a manifestation of our\ncommitment to participate further in peacekeeping\noperations and to improve the level of our participation.\nThe Czech Republic has been actively participating\nin the field of arms control and disarmament. As a non-\nnuclear-weapon State, we are naturally interested in\nattaining universality of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its strict\nobservance, which, we expect, will lead to the further\nreduction of nuclear proliferation and will advance the\nlong-term objective of nuclear disarmament. We attach\ngreat importance to the sessions of the preparatory\ncommittees, and expect that their positive suggestions\ncould set the tone of the Review Conference to be held in\nthe year 2000 towards reinforcing the Non-Proliferation\nTreaty.\nThe Czech Republic has from the very beginning\nvoiced support for the idea of strengthening the\ninternational safeguards system of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency within the so-called 93 +2\nProgramme. It was within these efforts that the Czech\nRepublic only a few days ago officially informed the\n18\n\n\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s secretariat of its\ninterest in concluding a supplementary protocol to the\nsafeguards agreement between the Czech Republic and the\nAgency, as required by the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\nThe majority of Member States of the United Nations\nlast year signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty, and I am pleased to state that my country was one\nof the first to ratify it.\nWe welcome the establishment of the Organization for\nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. We expect it to\neffectively control and carry out the verification process, in\nwhich we are prepared to participate fully.\nWe are convinced that the Biological Weapons\nConvention needs more effective control mechanisms. To\nthis end, Czech experts are actively participating in talks on\nfinalizing the verification protocol, which will considerably\nstrengthen this Convention.\nIn the field of conventional weapons, the Czech\nRepublic supports all measures contributing to greater\ntransparency, and has been systematically fulfilling all its\nobligations concerning notification to the respective\nregisters. At this year\u2019s Brussels Conference on anti-\npersonnel land mines, the Czech Republic joined the so-\ncalled Ottawa process, and it is prepared to sign in Ottawa\nearly in December a convention on the complete ban of\nsuch weapons.\nIt has been an honour for my country to chair two\nimportant United Nations bodies this year. The Economic\nand Social Council plays a very important role in promoting\ninternational cooperation in the economic and social fields.\nIts reform is therefore very important. The Czech Republic\nhas always stressed the need for better coordination,\neffectiveness and simplification of the Council\u2019s structure\nand activities. We also believe that when chairing the\nCouncil we have helped shape its new image. We noted\npromising signs of this new image already during its\nsubstantive session in July. One example was the high-level\nsegment with participation of ministers and senior\ngovernment officials, which proved the growing interest of\nthe Member States in discussions on specific subjects. An\ninformal political dialogue with representatives of United\nNations funds and agencies also proved the Council\u2019s\nability to serve as a platform for useful and fruitful\nexchanges of views. The reform and strengthening of the\nEconomic and Social Council should continue. In this\nrespect, we welcome all steps taken to implement resolution\n50/227, and above all to further simplify the structure of\nthe Council\u2019s subsidiary bodies.\nIn its priorities, the Czech Republic pays great\nattention to the protection of human rights as one of the\nnecessary conditions for free development of human\nsociety and democracy. We had the honour to chair the\nCommission on Human Rights in the first year of our\nmembership in this important body. On the basis of this\nexperience, the Czech Republic has been urging the\nelimination of factors negatively influencing the work of\nthe Commission, and has been seeking new approaches\nand methods of dealing with individual cases of flagrant\nviolation of human rights.\nNext year the international community will\ncommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We hope that\nthis event will be an occasion not merely for ceremonial\nassemblies and declarations, but for presenting concrete\nresults of work in the field of human rights.\nMy country supports all efforts aimed at early\nestablishment of an International Criminal Court, which\nwould create a new system for punishing the most serious\ncrimes of human rights violations and violations of\ninternational humanitarian law. The need for such an\ninstitution is acute, and the Czech Republic fully supports\nthe convocation of a diplomatic conference in 1998 to\nadopt and open to signature the convention on the\nestablishment of the court.\nOne of the burning scourges of our world today is\nthe growth of international organized crime and the\nrelated problem of drug abuse. This global problem can\nbe solved effectively only through close international\ncooperation. We believe that the special session of the\nGeneral Assembly in 1998 will stimulate the\nstrengthening of this cooperation.\nAnother threat hanging over the world is\ninternational terrorism. This is a threat which can be\nneutralized only by the tough and uncompromising\nattitude of the international community and by effective\ninternational cooperation. Every country sincerely\ninterested in security throughout the world must strictly\nobserve and comply with commitments arising from\nrelevant international instruments. The Czech Republic\nsupports every effort aimed at the elaboration of an\ninternational convention for the suppression of terrorist\nbombings. In this respect, my country has also actively\nparticipated in the work of the Ad Hoc Committee set up\n19\n\n\nto deal with this problem and believes that the current\nsession of experts will make further progress in the\nfinalization of the draft convention so that it may be\nadopted and opened to signature as soon as possible.\nOne of the most dynamically developing spheres of\ninternational and global cooperation is that of environment\nand sustainable development. The United Nations has been\ntraditionally working hard in this field. The key,\nirreplaceable role in this field is played by the United\nNations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United\nNations Commission on Sustainable Development. It seems\nthat UNEP is already on the way out of crisis, although not\nall the problems are solved by any means. The recent\nestablishment of the high-level committee is undoubtedly a\nstep towards improvement of the governing structure of\nUNEP and towards stabilization of its programme and\nbudget. In a short time we expect the strengthened UNEP\nto start a new endeavour to fulfil its mandate.\nThe process of follow-up activities of the United\nNations Conference on Environment and Development was\ngiven a new and strong impulse at the nineteenth special\nsession of the General Assembly. The results of this special\nsession were not unambiguously positive. On the one hand,\nwe welcome the wide support for the promotion of\nsustainable development and for efforts of Governments\nand international organizations, further strengthened by\ncomplementary activities of non-governmental\norganizations, national Governments, entrepreneurial circles\nand other interest groups. On the other hand, however, the\nsession proved that not all of them are prepared to take\nresolute steps towards achieving sustainable development.\nThe tasks facing the United Nations in the next period\nare numerous and difficult. However, they have been\nclearly outlined and can be fulfilled. It also depends on us,\nMember States, whether and how we will cope with them.\nIt is the results of our joint efforts that will decide not only\nthe fate of the world Organization but also of the world\nitself on the threshold of the next millennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It is yet\nanother opportunity to participate in the discussions on the\ngreat questions before us and to seek better solutions in our\nquest to preserve international peace and security and\npromote economic and social progress.\nThe consideration of various subjects will certainly\nentail difficult debates, but Mr. Udovenko\u2019s long experience\nand solid understanding of international problems are sure\nguarantees for the successful outcome of our meetings. In\ncongratulating him on his election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-second session, I wish him\nevery success in his guidance of our work.\nI take this opportunity to express our gratitude to\nAmbassador Razali Ismail for the achievements of the\nfifty-first session.\nTo our new Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, I\nconvey our satisfaction at the dynamism with which he\nhas infused the Organization since he assumed office.\nThree weeks ago, the wreck of a passenger boat,\nwhich killed more than 100 of my compatriots, threw the\ncountry into grief and the entire world into dismay.\nMessages of sympathy arrived from every corner, as did\nassistance that helped us to cope with this tragedy. On\nbehalf of the Haitian people and Government, I wish to\nexpress our deep gratitude to the international community,\nwhich, yet again, has demonstrated great solidarity with\nmy country.\nFor some time, the gist of statements made in this\nOrganization about Haiti was a plea for the restoration of\na state of law and an end to the violence and brutal\nauthoritarianism. Today, I am pleased to convey the\nmessage that the Haitian people has been greatly relieved\nby the reestablishment of democratic institutions, assisted\nby the international community, and the United Nations\nin particular.\nI wish to highlight some of the progress that has\nbeen made in the political sphere and the efforts exerted\nto consolidate the gains of the new democratic deal,\nwhose rules of play are being increasingly respected. The\ntransition of power has been recognized and accepted as\na cardinal principle of political life. The state, quasi-state\nand civil institutions are being further strengthened.\nSocio-professional associations and pressure groups are\nplaying an ever more active role.\nIn the field of human rights, no effort has been\nspared to end the repressive practices that characterized\nthe former dictatorial regimes. Arbitrary arrests, summary\nexecutions and abuse have practically disappeared. The\nstructures of oppression have been dismantled and\nreplaced by institutions sensitive to the need to respect\ncitizens\u2019 rights. This is the case with the National Police\nforce that has replaced the Haitian Armed Forces, which\nwere the main perpetrators of human rights violations in\nthe country. Created barely two years ago, this Police\nforce continues to acquire the experience necessary to\ncarry out its responsibilities for keeping the peace and\npublic safety. It is already gearing up to ensure security\nand stability throughout the country when the mandate of\n17\n\n\nthe United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti ends in late\nNovember.\nThe judiciary, for its part, has enjoyed special\nattention, given the desire for justice expressed by the\npopulace. Parliament is currently considering a bill that will\nallow the necessary deep-rooted reforms to be undertaken\nto improve the administration of justice.\nWhile the political situation in the country has\nstabilized, economic and social performance has lagged\nbehind. The gaps created by the crisis of 1991-1994 have\nyet to be breached. Democratic institutions are up and\nworking, it is true, but they remain fragile because certain\nneeds of the public have yet to be fulfilled.\nNonetheless, efforts are being undertaken to revitalize\nthe economy. For example, it has been decided to\nmodernize public companies. Hence, the creation of the\nCouncil to Modernize Public Companies. Cooperation with\nParliament has already led to the creation of legal\ninstruments aimed at maximizing the potential of these\ncompanies to the great profit of users and the consumers of\nthe goods and services they produce. Similarly, the fiscal\nand financial system is being reformed and trade\nliberalized. A bill on customs tariffs is currently under\nconsideration by Parliament.\nIn order to invigorate national production, an agrarian\nreform programme has been launched that aims at\nbestowing ownership on the peasants of their means of\nproduction. It works on three levels: access to land, access\nto credit and availability of technical training. The\nGovernment believes that agrarian reform will facilitate the\nsocial integration of citizens who have long been\nmarginalized.\nThis programme falls within an anti-poverty campaign\nled by the Government in order to assist the poorest sectors\nof society. As can well be imagined, the democratic process\nin Haiti is being pursued, but it remains fragile because of\nthe precarious situation and the great poverty of the people.\nIt is quite obvious that, if it is to be viable, it must be\nmaintained, nurtured and supported by sustainable\ndevelopment.\nThe Heads of State and Government who met here\nduring the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations two years ago committed themselves to\nenabling the Organization to carry out its mandate properly.\nConsequently, the Secretary-General is now proposing a\nprogramme of reforms to strengthen the role of the\nOrganization and to give it a new impetus. We thank the\nSecretary-General for this initiative, to which we give our\nfull support. This bold and innovative proposal will\nenable the Organization to become more effective and\ncarry out its mission fully.\nSome of the measures presented have drawn our\nparticular attention. For example, there is the idea of\nregrouping the activities of the United Nations around\nfive major themes: peace and security, economic and\nsocial development, development cooperation,\nhumanitarian affairs and human rights. However, we must\nensure that development issues, which are crucial for the\nmajority of Members, are given the same attention as\nother themes \u2014 if not more. Any reform must give\ndevelopment the priority, resources and political\ncommitment it deserves.\nThe question of Security Council reform, which is\nstill being studied, is another matter on which we must\nmake progress, given the Council\u2019s role in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Haiti\ncontinues to call for more transparency and participation\nin the Council\u2019s work, so that the views of States which\nare not members of the Council are considered in the\ndecision-making process. Any expansion of the Security\nCouncil should be carried out in a way that guarantees a\nfair and equal geographical representation. Everything\nshould be done so that the universality of the inhabitants\nof our planet is recognized in the United Nations system.\nHowever timely they may be, reforms alone will not\nmake the Organization more efficient if it does not have\nadequate financial resources to carry out its activities. We\nare convinced that the financial crisis of the United\nNations may reduce its capacity to cope with the serious\nproblems it faces.\nWe need a strong and efficient United Nations,\ncapable of finding solutions to current problems and\nfacing the challenges of the next century. It is through the\norchestrated, collective action of the United Nations that\nwe will be able to overcome our numerous current\nproblems, which threaten international peace and security\nand compromise the well-being of our populations.\nThere we refer first to the many armed conflicts\nwhich are raging in all regions of the world, some of\nwhich seem to resist any attempt at a negotiated\nsettlement. Haiti encourages the use of regional and\nmultilateral mechanisms to solve these conflicts.\n18\n\n\nLikewise, the existence of vast arsenals of weapons of\nmass destruction is a grave threat to our collective security.\nThe progress achieved in the area of disarmament \u2014\nespecially the opening for signature last year of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the entry into\nforce of the Chemical Weapons Convention \u2014 is\nencouraging. However, we urge the countries concerned to\nmake further efforts to achieve complete and true\ndisarmament.\nThe Republic of Haiti welcomes the recent adoption\nof the text of a treaty banning anti-personnel landmines.\nThis is an important step in the battle to eliminate these\ndeadly devices, which have caused so much suffering and\nwhich continue to take a toll among civilian populations,\nespecially among women and children.\nThe illicit use of drugs and drug trafficking are also\nproblems which the international community must face with\ndetermination. They are, in fact, a threat to the internal\nsecurity of small States because of the violence and\ncriminality with which they are often associated.\nFurthermore, drug use affects the most vulnerable stratum\nof society: young people. International cooperation is\nabsolutely necessary to overcome this scourge.\nSince 1960 several summits and conferences devoted\nto poverty and development have been organized.\nRecommendations have been formulated and measures have\nbeen contemplated. Nevertheless, poverty continues to gain\nground. According to the 1997 Human Development Report,\nmore than 1.5 billion of the planet\u2019s inhabitants live in a\nstate of extreme poverty, particularly in African countries\nand less developed countries, which see themselves\nincreasingly marginalized.\nThe eradication of poverty, especially in the least\ndeveloped countries, should go beyond simple speeches or\nresolutions. It requires a strong political will, adequate\nresources, well defined strategies and the implementation of\nappropriate programmes. It also requires the sincere support\nof the international community, especially the support of\ninternational institutions and the leaders of the industrialized\ncountries, namely, those who possess technology and\nwealth. The battle against poverty must also be a struggle\nfor human dignity, sustainable development and peace.\nWith a view to strengthening international peace and\nsecurity, the Republic of Haiti has pursued a policy of good\nneighbourliness which has enabled it to come closer to\ncountries in the region. It has established with the\nDominican Republic a mechanism for consultations through\na joint Haitian-Dominican Commission. This is an\nexcellent tool for cooperation and working together to\nfind a solution to the various problems of the island. We\nwould like to see this important forum continue, as it\nrepresents a necessary stage towards greater mutual\nunderstanding between the Haitian and Dominican\npeoples.\nLikewise, Haiti recently rejoined the Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM). By getting the train of\nintegration under way, my country intends to contribute\nin a significant manner to the realization of the objectives\nof the Community, because Haiti is aware that a strong,\nopen-ended, united CARICOM will largely determine the\nsocio-economic performance of the Caribbean region. In\nthis context, we urge the international community to\ncontinue to support the reconstruction of Montserrat.\nFifty-two years ago at San Francisco we undertook\nto work for the progress and happiness of our peoples in\na world where peace and security would reign. We should\ntherefore work to realize their dreams and meet their\nexpectations and aspirations.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I would like to say how pleased\nwe are to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the\npresidency of the fifty-second session of the United\nNations General Assembly. We are convinced that your\ngreat experience and wisdom will promote the success of\nthis session. I can assure you of the cooperation of the\ndelegation of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania in\nreaching the results to which we all aspire.\nI take this opportunity also to express our gratitude\nto and esteem for your predecessor, Mr. Razali Ismail, for\nthe great efforts made and the positive results obtained\nduring his term of office as President of the past session.\n5\n\n\nI should also like to express our appreciation to\nMr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nfor the tireless efforts he has made since his assumption to\nhis high office to promote the universality of the United\nNations and to strengthen its credibility and capacity to\ndischarge its responsibilities despite a difficult international\nsituation.\nIn this context, we welcome the initiative taken by the\nSecretary-General in submitting an outline for reform,\nwhich includes a number of provisions that could improve\nthe functioning of the Organization. An in-depth study of\nthis outline will undoubtedly facilitate its adoption by all\nmembers of the international community.\nWhile the end of the cold war has created a favourable\nclimate for the emergence of a new era of international\ndialogue and cooperation, the improvement of the economic\nconditions of developing countries remains an urgent need.\nIndeed, with the growing trend towards globalization\nand liberalization in international trade, the developing\ncountries are facing a number of obstacles, including slower\ngrowth, falling export revenues, and a reduction in the\nvolume of investments and in official development\nassistance. All of this may prevent these countries from\nbecoming part of the global economy and further\nmarginalize them if the international community does not\nmobilize swiftly to provide them with the aid they need to\nmeet these challenges.\nThe increase in the volume of debt is another obstacle\nto the economic and social development efforts undertaken\nby these countries for the benefit of their peoples. In this\nrespect the 1996 report of the World Bank notes that the\nburden of debt in many of the least developed countries has\nreached such a level that it is virtually impossible for them\nto continue with their economic reforms, which are of\ncrucial importance; and that this situation is exacerbated by\nthe fact that in 1996 official development assistance, which\ncan reduce the effect of indebtedness, fell to its lowest level\nin real terms in 23 years.\nInternational strategies do not seem to have succeeded\nadequately in easing the burden of debt in the developing\ncountries, which is why more effective solutions, such as\nincreasing official development assistance, must be found\nso that these countries\u2019 development priorities can be\nfinanced.\nDespite the fragility of the international economic\nsituation, progress has been made in various areas due to\nefforts by the United Nations to promote international\ncooperation and to define policies and strategies capable\nof meeting the economic, social and environmental\nchallenges that confront the world today. For instance,\nseveral important international meetings and conferences\nhave been organized during the past five years under the\nauspices of the United Nations, resulting in some\ndecisions and undertakings relating to the main issues of\ndevelopment that seek to promote international\ncooperation and coordination for development.\nI am referring in particular to the World Summit for\nChildren, held in New York; the Earth Summit, held in\nRio de Janeiro; the World Conference on Human Rights,\nheld in Vienna; the International Conference on\nPopulation and Development, held in Cairo; the World\nSummit for Social Development, held in Copenhagen; the\nFourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing; the\nWorld Food Summit, held in Rome; the second United\nNations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II),\nheld in Istanbul; and the nineteenth special session of the\nGeneral Assembly, devoted to the overall review and\nappraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21, which took\nplace in New York last June.\nThese initiatives attest to the determination of the\nUnited Nations to take into account the concerns and\ninterests of the international community with regard to a\nwhole range of development issues. The United Nations\nshould continue on this path and seek to ensure\nimplementation of the decisions adopted.\nUnder the enlightened guidance of its President, His\nExcellency Mr. Maaouya Ould Sid\u2019Ahmed Taya, the\nIslamic Republic of Mauritania has completed the process\nof establishing constitutional institutions within the\nframework of a democratic process that began 11 years\nago. This ensures that these institutions will be able to\nfunction normally within a multi-party system and a State\nbased on the rule of law. My country is proud to state\nthat we do not hold any political prisoners.\nFundamental freedoms, such as freedom of\nexpression and a multi-party system, as well as trade\nunion freedoms, are guaranteed and enjoyed by 20\npolitical parties and a large number of organizations and\ntrades unions that can pursue their activities in complete\nfreedom. Likewise, there are dozens of newspapers and\nmagazines that reflect various political and intellectual\nsensibilities.\n6\n\n\nFurthermore, in keeping with the provisions of our\nConstitution, the two Houses of Parliament have been\nreplenished, and for the second time presidential elections,\nset for 12 December this year, are being prepared in a\nclimate of freedom, peace and stability.\nA global strategy that seeks to raise the level of our\npeople\u2019s economic and social development and to\nconsolidate democracy has been implemented. This goes\nhand in hand with the democratic process and is in keeping\nwith the following comments of the President of the\nRepublic, His Excellency Mr. Maaouya Ould Sid\u2019Ahmed\nTaya:\n\u201cWe are seeking to build a modern society\ncapable of accompanying the world on its march\nforward and of assimilating scientific and\ntechnological information; a society aware of the\nchallenges of our time and working to meet those\nchallenges\u201d.\nIn this context, the promotion of women\u2019s rights and\nthe campaign against illiteracy figure prominently in our\ndevelopment programmes. A sustained effort is also being\nmade to provide as many of our citizens as possible with\naccess to education, jobs and health services, thereby\nguaranteeing them a better standard of living. The results\nobtained in this regard are satisfactory. Indeed, the\nenrolment rate in our schools has reached 86 per cent and\nhealth care coverage for our people has been significantly\nextended towards meeting the goal defined by the World\nHealth Organization, which is health for all by the year\n2000. Drinking water supply systems have been built in\nseveral regions, and the main cities of the country now\nhave electricity.\nWithin the framework of a huge programme to\nprovide access to remote towns in the interior of the\ncountry, several new roads have been built, and a modern\ntelecommunications system now covers the entire country.\nThese important achievements attest to our firm desire\nto combat underdevelopment in all its forms, relying first\non our own resources and then on the support of our\ndevelopment partners.\nI should like here to express my gratitude to all\nbrotherly and friendly countries and international\norganizations and agencies, as well as to non-governmental\norganizations, for their support of my country\u2019s efforts in\nthis area.\nOne of the positive features of international relations\ntoday, which has led to the strengthening of democracy\nand respect for human rights in several regions of the\nworld, is the international community\u2019s effort to\nconsolidate fundamental principles such as transparency,\nthe representative character of power, the primacy of law,\nand the independence of the judiciary.\nWhile we can be satisfied with the significant\nprogress made in this area, we should not lose sight of\nthe fact that democracy cannot be limited to the narrow\nconfines of each individual country; it must extend to\nrelations between nations. In this respect we attach\nparticular importance to the efforts made by the Open-\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\nSecurity Council. We also hope that these efforts will\nlead to greater transparency in the decision-making\nprocesses of the Security Council as well as to improved\nworking methods.\nIn a different area, we need to adopt a new form of\npreventive diplomacy that is capable of preventing\nconflicts and the human tragedies that result from them,\nsuch as those we have witnessed recently and those we\nsee today and yet are unable to resolve.\nThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania expresses its\nprofound concern at the difficulties encountered in the\npeace process and at the negative developments in the\nregion of the Middle East, which result from non-\ncompliance with agreements concluded and commitments\nundertaken in accordance with the established timetable.\nMy country believes that there can be no just and\nlasting peace in the Middle East unless Israel withdraws\nfrom all the occupied Palestinian territories, including\nAl-Quds, the Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon, and\nunless the Palestinian people regain their right to create\nan independent State on their territory.\nMy country also calls for the taking of the steps\nnecessary for the resumption of the peace negotiations\namong all the parties concerned. We are convinced that\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and\n425 (1978) and the principle of \u201cland for peace\u201d remain\nthe basis of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace.\nFurthermore, we call upon the two sponsors of the\npeace process to redouble their efforts to ensure that the\nchance for peace is not lost and the hopes for a new era\nof cooperation and concord, in which the potential of the\n7\n\n\nregion is dedicated to economic development and social\npromotion, are not dashed.\nIn this context, my country calls for the lifting of the\nembargo placed on the Palestinian people, and we ask the\ninternational community to mobilize the necessary resources\nto finance the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for\nPalestine Refugees in the Near East so that it can do its job\nproperly.\nIn the Gulf region, the aftermath of the war continues\nto impede the normalization of the situation. The Islamic\nRepublic of Mauritania, while reaffirming its dedication to\ninternational law and its commitment to respecting the\nprinciples thereof, again states its rejection of any violation\nof Kuwait\u2019s independence, its territorial integrity and the\nsecurity of its citizens, and calls for a rapid solution to the\nquestion of Kuwaiti prisoners.\nWe also reaffirm our steadfast position that no\nmeasures should be taken that threaten Iraq\u2019s unity and\nterritorial integrity, and we call for the lifting of the\nembargo imposed against the Iraqi people, so that an end\ncan be put to their suffering. We hope that the\nimplementation of the resolution regarding \u201coil for food\u201d\ncan help to achieve this.\nStill on the same region, we reiterate our support for\nthe United Arab Emirates in its desire to regain its\nsovereignty over the islands of Greater Tumb, Lesser Tumb\nand Abu Mussa.\nIn the Arab Maghreb, my country is acting in\ncooperation with its brothers for the attainment of the\naspirations of the States of the Union of the Arab Maghreb.\nOn the subject of Western Sahara, my country\nwelcomed with great satisfaction the agreement which was\nconcluded on 16 September last in Houston in the United\nStates under the auspices of Mr. James Baker III, the\nPersonal Envoy of the Secretary-General, and which deals\nwith the main issues that have hampered the\nimplementation of the settlement plan for Western Sahara\nworked out by the United Nations in coordination with the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU). The Islamic\nRepublic of Mauritania reaffirms its willingness to do\neverything it can to promote implementation of the plan for\nthe settlement of this dispute.\nFurthermore, we call for the lifting of the embargo\nimposed against the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and we hope\nthat the efforts of the League of Arab States and of the\nOAU to find a peaceful solution based on the principles\nof international law, a solution that will put an end to this\nsituation so detrimental to the Libyan people and all other\nMaghreb peoples, will be given favourable consideration.\nOn the question of Africa we hope that the meeting\nof the Security Council at the ministerial level held two\nweeks ago to consider the situation in Africa will\ncontribute to the achievement of appropriate solutions to\nthe problems of the continent.\nMy country also wishes to reaffirm its commitment\nto the principles of dialogue and negotiation as the only\nway to overcome crises and conflicts and to defuse\npockets of tension which exist in several parts of the\ncontinent. Accordingly, my country renews its support for\nefforts to revitalize the central organ of the OAU that\ndeals with prevention, management and settlement of\nconflicts in Africa.\nAs for the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros,\nmy country hopes that the efforts undertaken by the\nLeague of Arab States and the OAU will contribute to the\nsettlement of the crisis in that country.\nWe hope also that in Somalia the parties concerned\nwill have recourse to constructive dialogue to reach a\nsolution that will guarantee harmony and stability.\nIn regard to the Republic of Congo, my country\nhopes that a peaceful solution that will restore security\nand stability will be found.\nWe hope that there will again be a normal situation\nin Sierra Leone, in keeping with international law.\nThe United Nations is today required more than ever\nbefore to react more vigorously to the problems facing the\ninternational community. The end of the cold war, and the\ninternational community\u2019s awareness of the importance of\ncoordination and dialogue, are positive factors for giving\nour Organization the necessary momentum to enable it to\nmeet the challenges and to establish the bases for a new\ninternational order founded on the principles of justice\nand solidarity and guaranteeing the maintenance of peace\nand security throughout the world.\nThere is no doubt also that being aware of the\nmagnitude of the challenges and the need to pool our\nefforts to meet them is the best way to restore our hope\nof moving closer to the fulfilment of the ideal that was\n8\n\n\nconsecrated at the ceremonies commemorating the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Organization:\n\u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations united for a\nbetter world\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nshould like at the outset to make two imperative\nacknowledgments. The first is to congratulate Ambassador\nHennadiy Udovenko on his election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly \u2014 and to congratulate the Assembly on\nthe election of an insightful and experienced politician to\npreside over this session \u2014 which may, for many reasons,\nprove to be an exceptional one.\nThe second is addressed to the Secretary-General at\nthis first regular session convened under his mandate. Mr.\nKofi Annan is a veteran of the United Nations system,\nwhich explains how, in the short time since he took up the\npost of Secretary-General, he has been able to submit an\nimportant programme for the comprehensive reform of the\nOrganization.\nI wish also to state my Government\u2019s full support of\nthe statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nLuxembourg on behalf of the European Union. Spain shares\nthe commitment of the European Union to the reform of the\nOrganization; it is specifically upon this matter that my\nstatement will be focused.\nWhen we speak of the reform of the Organization, we\nfrequently link it with the financial crisis which the United\nNations is undergoing. Yet I consider it important to\ndifferentiate the two questions and to emphasize that the\nreform process must not be seen solely as a remedy or\nfactor for saving the United Nations from the financial\ncrisis. On the one hand, the current crisis is fundamentally\na crisis of payments. I shall return to this matter later on.\nOn the other hand, the Organization\u2019s supposed \u201cfailures\u201d\nreflect the limits of cooperation in the international\ncommunity as it exists at present.\nThe crisis is, in any case, one of growth. The United\nNations has to adapt and do away with the bureaucratic\nobstacles accumulated by the Organization during the\ndecades of the cold war and to develop new means with\nwhich to tackle the complex situations it now faces.\nThe great virtue of the reform programme introduced\nby the Secretary-General on 16 July is that, building on the\nbetter part of the thinking of recent years, it presents a\ncomprehensive plan to adapt all sectors of the Organization.\nRecent experience has shown the difficulty of implementing\npartial reforms. The links among the main functions\nentrusted to the United Nations is becoming increasingly\nclear: international peace and security can hardly be\nmaintained without genuine cooperation to promote the\ndevelopment of the world\u2019s States and regions, and\nwithout respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nI should like straight away to declare Spain\u2019s\nagreement with this approach and to make clear the\nbacking which my country is willing to give to the\nSecretary-General\u2019s programme. I will now present the\nviews of the Spanish Government on the main aspects of\nthe overall reform process.\nI shall begin with the reform of the Security\nCouncil. This is undoubtedly one of the most significant\nquestions facing us, and its success will determine if the\nOrganization will be able to enhance its legitimacy and its\neffectiveness in maintaining international peace and\nsecurity in the future. The reform of the Security Council\nis a most sensitive task, involving an amendment to the\nCharter; it must therefore be undertaken carefully, without\nhaste and on the basis of the broadest possible agreement.\nIt must promote greater cohesion among the\nOrganization\u2019s Members and not create greater tension\nand suspicion among them. We should not forget: poorly-\ndone reform could bring grave repercussions for the\nOrganization, which could lead to an irreparable crisis of\nconfidence.\nAn increase in the number of members of the\nSecurity Council, and particularly of permanent members,\nis a much more contentious issue than the improvement\nof the Council\u2019s working procedures. The category of\npermanent members of the Security Council was created\nin historical circumstances which no longer apply.\nFurthermore, the enlargement of that category could\ncreate more problems than benefits. Therefore, we\nconsider it wisest in the present situation to limit\nenlargement to the category of non-permanent members.\nCurrent proposals for enlarging the permanent\nmembership of the Security Council introduce formulas\nwhich tend to meet the legitimate interests of a few\nStates, but fail to resolve serious problems raised for the\nvast majority of Members of the Organization, and so\nthey cannot be positive for the United Nations as a whole.\nAs far as the veto is concerned, aware of the\ndifficulty in present circumstances of achieving its\nelimination, we propose that it be limited to situations\ninvolving Chapter VII of the Charter. In any case,\nproposals for the creation of new permanent seats, with\npostponement of discussion as to whether those seats\nwould or would not have the veto, are not very realistic.\n22\n\n\nThe leading role acquired by the United Nations at the\nend of the cold war in making, maintaining and\nconsolidating peace is without historical precedent.\nSpain unreservedly supports United Nations efforts in\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. In the\nlast year, in addition to the Spanish contingents deployed in\nthe International Police Task Force (IPTF) and the\nStabilization Force (SFOR), forces from my country have\nparticipated in the United Nations Mission for the\nVerification of Human Rights and of Compliance with the\nCommitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human\nRights in Guatemala (MINUGUA) demobilization process\nand in the multinational protection force for Albania, which,\nas the Prime Minister stressed just a few minutes ago, has\nhelped to avoid a serious internal conflict. Spain was also\nready to participate in the multinational force for Zaire. My\nGovernment is also studying ways of enhancing the\nOrganization\u2019s operational readiness, particularly by\nincreasing its rapid deployment capabilities.\nWhile dealing with this matter, I must refer briefly to\ncertain situations of special interest to my Government. The\ndeterioration of the situation in the Serb Republic is a cause\nof special concern. We must continue to give firm backing\nto those in the Republic who are willing to cooperate with\nSFOR, the High Representative and the special envoys.\nSub-Saharan Africa also deserves special attention. Of\nparticular concern is the serious situation which persists in\nthe Great Lakes region and in the Republic of Congo. Spain\nsupports the efforts under way to restore peace, as well as\nthe holding of an international conference under the\nauspices of the United Nations and the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU). Likewise, with reference to the\nsituation in Angola, Spain joins the appeal to UNITA to\ncomply with its international commitments and to finally\nallow peace to come to this country.\nMy Government welcomes the recent agreements\nreached in Houston to unblock implementation of the\nUnited Nations settlement plan for Western Sahara, and\naccordingly wishes to congratulate Morocco and the\nPolisario Front. I equally wish to congratulate the Personal\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. James Baker, on the\nefficient mediation work he has performed. My Government\nconsiders that the holding of a referendum, freely and with\ninternational guarantees, in which the Sahraqui people will\nexercise their right to self-determination, continues to be the\nonly acceptable solution to this conflict. Spain, which has\nalways supported the settlement plan, considers therefore\nthat the extension of the mandate of the United Nations\nMission for the Referendum in Western Sahara\n(MINURSO) is indispensable. My Government trusts that\nthe parties will continue to demonstrate flexibility and a\nconstructive spirit until the referendum is held.\nSpain is also following developments in the Middle\nEast with the greatest concern. The peace process is,\nwithout a doubt, going through one of its most difficult\nphases. However, this dialogue is the only possible\nalternative. The European Union, in particular through its\nSpecial Envoy, the Spanish diplomat Miguel Angel\nMoratinos, is making major efforts. I should like here to\nreiterate the Spanish Government\u2019s commitment to this\nprocess and to restate our willingness to continue to work\nactively for peace and understanding among the peoples\nof the region.\nWith the signing of the Agreement on a Firm and\nLasting Peace in Guatemala, a process in which Spain\nplayed an active role in the verification of compliance\nwith the accords, the way has been paved to stability, the\nstrengthening of democratic institutions and sustainable\ndevelopment in Guatemala. Spain will continue to support\nthis process, through practical measures such as\nmultilateral and bilateral cooperation.\nAs I have already indicated, peacekeeping has\nbecome a multifaceted activity. In addition to military\nactivities, it has become essential to take into account the\nhumanitarian consequences of conflicts. In fact, the\nhumanitarian role of the United Nations is increasingly\nlinked to peacekeeping. Spain accordingly supports the\nSecretary-General\u2019s initiatives to enhance the coordination\nand rapid deployment capability of the United Nations\nhumanitarian response through the establishment of the\nEmergency Relief Coordination Office.\nTogether with my Government\u2019s official\nhumanitarian aid, I must refer here to the commitment of\nSpanish civil society to such humanitarian operations, and\npay tribute to all the international relief workers and\nmissionaries who, generously and at risk to their very\nlives, are deployed in war-devastated areas. Five Spanish\nrelief workers and four missionaries have been killed in\nrecent months while performing their humanitarian tasks.\nSpain considers that additional measures must be adopted\nto protect those participating in these humanitarian\nmissions, and we intend to introduce a proposal to that\nend during this session.\nRecent experience of the conflicts in the former\nYugoslavia and in Rwanda has highlighted the need to\n23\n\n\ncreate a judicial body to prevent impunity and to facilitate\nreconciliation of war-torn societies and consolidate the\npeace process. The creation of an international criminal\ncourt is thus a matter to which the Spanish Government\nattaches great importance.\nConcern for the protection and promotion of human\nrights, which is becoming one of the Organization\u2019s\nprincipal functions, underlies all these developments. As of\n10 December and throughout 1998 we will be celebrating\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights. This will be an appropriate time to assess\nthe situation and to devise strategies which will allow us to\ncontinue to move forward in the advancement of human\nrights.\nAs pointed out by the Secretary-General in his report,\nthe United Nations human rights programme must be\nintegrated into the whole range of the Organization\u2019s\nactivities. Spain supports the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal\nto consolidate the Centre for Human Rights and the Office\nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and stresses\nthe need to increase the human and financial resources\ndevoted to the human rights programme.\nSpain will maintain an active policy in defence of\nhuman rights and will help to ensure general respect for\nhuman rights and for democratic principles.\nAnother of the Organization\u2019s major functions is\ncooperation for development. Spain welcomes the proposals\nput forward in this area by the Secretary-General. In\nparticular, I should like to stress my support for the\nSecretary-General\u2019s various initiatives aimed at ensuring the\nrelease of more funds for operational programmes.\nThe inclusion in development cooperation activities of\nother than purely economic factors \u2014 such as social and\nenvironmental ones \u2014 is the expression of a concept to\nwhich the United Nations has given primary attention\nthrough a number of international conferences held under\nits auspices. I am referring to the subject of sustainable\ndevelopment.\nI would like to underline in this respect the importance\nthat the Spanish Government attaches to environmental\nmatters and our special interest in the problem of\ndesertification, which affects Spain so directly. I wish to\nnote in this context that my country is presenting the\ncandidature of Murcia as headquarters of the permanent\nsecretariat of the Convention to Combat Desertification. I\nam convinced that Murcia would be an excellent\nheadquarters, and I therefore ask Members for their\nsupport.\nThe attainment of effective international cooperation\nin the fight against terrorism is a priority objective for my\nGovernment. The phenomenon of terrorism cannot be\ncontrolled without complete and active cooperation at all\nlevels. The conceptual advances made in the area of\nextradition that have taken place within the European\nUnion must be furthered in the United Nations. The\nSpanish Government participates actively in the\nnegotiations on the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings, aimed at creating an\neffective tool in the fight against terrorism that is\nacceptable to the largest possible number of countries.\nSpain also supports the Declaration on Measures to\nEliminate International Terrorism and the Supplement to\nthat Declaration adopted by the Assembly at its last\nsession.\nIn this connection, I cannot fail to mention the tragic\nsituation in Algeria, a country which is a neighbour and\na friend of Spain and which has the solidarity and support\nof my Government in its battle against the plague of\nterrorism. The Algerian Government can count on\nSpanish backing to continue resolutely the process of\npolitical reform, in order to achieve the widest possible\nbase of support among the population, ensure peaceful\nand lasting coexistence and to eradicate terrorism.\nThe fight against drug trafficking is also a question\nof the greatest importance to Spain, and it is one that\nundoubtedly has connections with terrorism and\ntransnational crime. My Government therefore supports\nthe creation in Vienna of an international crime\nprevention centre designed to reinforce the Organization\u2019s\ncapacity to combat these scourges.\nSpain is pleased with the decisive role played by the\nUnited Nations in disarmament and arms control. Spain\nwelcomes the outcome of the Oslo Conference and will\nbe signing the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel\nMines and on Their Destruction, while promoting\ndiscussion of this question in Geneva at the Conference\non Disarmament.\nThe preparation of a protocol to strengthen the\nBiological Weapons Convention \u2014 particularly in the\nfield of verification; the negotiation of a convention to\nban fissionable material for the manufacture of nuclear\nweapons; and the improvement of control and\n24\n\n\ntransparency in conventional weapons: these are also\nmatters of importance.\nThe process of decolonization has without any doubt\nbeen one of the Organization\u2019s greatest successes. It may\ntherefore seem anachronistic to refer to this matter in a\nstatement that deals with the reform of the United Nations\nand that focuses on the present and the most immediate\nfuture, rather than on the past. The reality, however, is that\nunresolved colonial situations unfortunately continue to\nexist, and our Organization still has to deal with them.\nWith regard to these situations, Spain is affected\ndirectly and painfully by the question of Gibraltar. The\nexistence of this colony on our territory \u2014 the colony of a\nState that, like Spain, belongs, to the Atlantic Alliance and\nto the European Union \u2014 is an anomaly and an\nanachronism that we are trying to resolve within the context\nof the doctrine established by the United Nations. In\nresolution 2353 (XXII), and in accordance with resolution\n1514 (XV), the General Assembly acknowledged that the\ncolonial status of Gibraltar violates Spanish territorial\nintegrity and that the principle of self-determination\ntherefore does not apply. The territory of Gibraltar was an\nintegral part of Spain, and the Spaniards who lived there\nwere expelled when a military base was established.\nPursuant to the repeated invitations made by the\nUnited Nations to Spain and to the United Kingdom to\nsettle this matter by negotiation, my Government is engaged\nin the search for a solution through the bilateral channel\nestablished in the Brussels Declaration of November 1984.\nThe Spanish authorities have given repeated assurances that\nthe legitimate interests of the inhabitants of Gibraltar will\nbe respected. I very recently and publicly formulated a most\ngenerous offer whereby, following the reincorporation of\nGibraltar into Spain, the current inhabitants of the colony\nwould be allowed to retain the broad outlines of their\npresent economic and legal situation. We believe that this\noffer should help us advance in the bilateral negotiations\nwith the United Kingdom.\nWe all agree on to the irreplaceable nature of our\nOrganization and on the need to reform it. However, our\nOrganization cannot prosper, nor can the reforms be put in\nplace, if we Member States do not comply in full with our\nfinancial commitments. As the Secretary-General himself\nhas pointed out, the Organization\u2019s present financial crisis\nis a payments crisis. The punctual and full payment of\ncontributions is an international legal obligation that should\nbe recognized by all States that respect the international\nrule of law. It is unacceptable that any Member State\nshould place conditions on these payments or on the\npayment of arrears. Such a practice would lead eventually\nto the bankruptcy of the Organization we defend.\nAs early as 1996, the European Union introduced a\nproposal designed to encourage States to meet their\nfinancial obligations to the Organization and to establish\na fairer scale of assessments. Spain hopes that this\nproposal will be carefully considered at this session.\nThe United Nations is the main international forum\nentrusted with maintaining international peace and\nsecurity, with promoting development, human rights and\nfundamental freedoms and with ensuring cooperation\nbetween States. The indispensable nature of its role has\nbecome clear in recent years.\nFinally, I would like to restate the Spanish\nGovernment\u2019s firm commitment to the purposes contained\nin the Charter of the United Nations and to reassert our\nunshakeable determination to continue to participate in the\nreform process in the firm belief that, together, we will be\nable to adapt the United Nations to the requirements of\nthe new millennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me pleasure to extend to Mr. Udovenko our\nheartfelt congratulations on his election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-second session. We are\nconfident that his experience and wisdom will contribute to\nthe successful and efficient conduct of the deliberations of\nthe Assembly and help us achieve our desired objective.\nI am also pleased to address our thanks and\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Razali Ismail,\nPermanent Representative of sisterly Malaysia, for the\nmanner in which he conducted the work of the previous\nsession.\nI take this opportunity to express my country\u2019s\nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\nvaluable efforts in serving the interests of the international\ncommunity, strengthening international peace and security\nand striving to attain the noble principles and objectives of\nthe United Nations.\nI would like to avail myself of this opportunity to pay\ntribute to his predecessor, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nformer Secretary-General of the United Nations, for the\npositive and important role he played in carrying out the\ntasks and responsibilities of the United Nations Secretariat.\nIf we were to define the general trend characterizing\nthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly, we\nwould say it is the great attention paid to the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s report on the financial and structural reforms of\nthe United Nations and its related agencies. This points to\nthe fact that the Secretary-General\u2019s reform proposals are\nof great significance and not just an ordinary matter.\nIndeed, they aim at preparing the Organization to usher in\nthe twenty-first century with more vigour and\ncompetence, thus enabling it to achieve the noble\nobjectives of the Charter.\nThe Republic of Yemen, in principle, supports these\nproposals. However, we have to underline certain basic\nconsiderations that should not be forgotten or overlooked\nunder the rubric of financial and administrative reforms\nof the Organization. It is first and foremost necessary to\nemphasize that the purpose of these reforms should be to\nreinforce the United Nations ability to shoulder its\nresponsibilities within the framework of the noble\nobjectives for which it was established under the Charter,\nwhich we all have accepted and pledged to abide by.\nAs a least developed country itself, the Republic of\nYemen expresses its concern regarding some indications\nin the report that the United Nations role in the field of\ndevelopment may be reduced and its responsibilities\nlimited in the field of social justice and the task of\nnarrowing the huge gap that separates the developing and\ndeveloped industrialized countries \u2014 all on the pretext\nthat some of these responsibilities have been shifted\nelsewhere.\nAny move in this direction is bound to encourage\ncertain dangerous phenomena that we have been\nwitnessing of late, including legal and illegal emigration\nfrom developing to developed countries, that could sow\nthe seeds of social, ethnic and cultural conflict. Any\ndiminishing of the United Nations role in development\nwill lead to an increase in the population of developing\ncountries, which, in the absence of such basic needs as\nfood, clothing and shelter, could lead to a further\ndeterioration of the environment.\nFor these reasons, we would like to confirm in the\nname of the Republic of Yemen that the development\ntasks undertaken by the United Nations and its related\nagencies constitute an integral part of the main objective\nbehind its establishment: to achieve international peace\nand security on this planet.\n21\n\n\nWith regard to the question of reforming and\nexpanding the Security Council, which has been under\nmuch discussion for some time and is referred to in the\nSecretary-General\u2019s report, we strongly support the\nexpansion of the representative basis of the Council, either\nby accepting Japan and Germany as new permanent\nmembers or by increasing the number of permanent\nmembers through an increase in the representation of\ngeographic groups and by allowing each group to rotate its\npermanent seat among the countries of that group.\nWe support what has been said about the need to\nreduce the use of the power of veto by permanent members.\nIndeed, its use should be limited to matters that directly\naffect the highest national interests. In this way, we can\navoid the arbitrary use of the veto power in matters that are\nirrelevant to such interests, but affect narrow regional\ncalculations or temporary political gains unrelated to issues\nof international peace and security.\nIt is known to all that our Organization was created in\n1945 to implement the principles of its Charter, which\nstipulates that its main task is to maintain international\npeace and security, settle international conflicts, protect\nhuman rights and the dignity of man and respect the\ncommitments emanating from international conventions and\npacts.\nDuring the 50-plus years of its life, this Organization\nhas witnessed ethnic and national wars and conflicts as well\nas rivalries and polarizations that have led to controversies\nbecause of what was then known as the cold war between\nthe super-Powers. No one can deny the fact, however, that\nthe wars that raged from Latin America in the west to the\nAfrican continent and even to East Asia have indeed\nsubsided, thanks to the undeniably worthy efforts of the\ninternational Organization itself and of efforts made from\noutside the Organization, but mostly under its umbrella.\nYet, one important question that threatened peace and\nsecurity in our region even before the creation of this\ninternational Organization still constitutes a looming danger\nto international peace and security. It is the question of\nPalestine and the Arab-Israeli conflict, with all its\ncomplexities. The international Organization has failed to\nsolve this question and has been forced to be a mere\nonlooker before the various attempts that have been made\nbut have yet to reach a comprehensive, durable and just\npeace.\nThe displacement of millions, the occupation of their\nterritories, the establishment of settlements, the confiscation\nof their properties, the arrest of tens of thousands of\nPalestinians and the violation of their most basic human\nrights, all of which result from the Arab-Israeli conflict,\nconstitute a flagrant breach of all the noble principles\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter and a challenge\nto the resolutions of international legitimacy emanating\nfrom the Security Council and this Assembly.\nWe believe that it is the right of all people in\ngeneral, and of every citizen in the Middle East in\nparticular, to speculate about the secret behind the\ninability of the international community to tame a State\nwhose population is less than half the population of this\ncity in which we are meeting to adopt legitimate\ninternational resolutions.\nEven more peculiar is that, when a candle of hope\nflickered and lit the dark fierce night of the struggle that\nstarted early this decade \u2014 that is, when the world felt\nsome optimism following the announcement of the Oslo\nagreement, the signature of the Jordanian-Israeli peace\nagreement and the progress achieved in the talks on the\nSyrian track to a stage described by President Hafez Al-\nAssad of Syria as at times encompassing fewer points of\ndivergence than of convergence \u2014 after that slim beam\nof hope, the new Israeli Government came all of a sudden\nto extinguish it and decided to send the whole region\nback to square one: conflict and destruction.\nOn the other side of the spectrum of what is being\ncalled today the \u201cnew world order\u201d, we are all asked, and\nwithout exception, to implement the harshest sanctions\nagainst the Iraqi people, even seven years after the\nwithdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Can anyone tell\nus which lands the Iraqis are still occupying now and why\nthe Iraqi people should be displaced and deprived of their\nmost basic legitimate rights? Is it not high time for the\nhumanitarian conscience of some of us, particularly the\npermanent member States, to be awakened and for an end\nto be put to the sufferings of the Iraqi people?\nIn accordance with its positive stand in support of\nthe peace process in the Middle East, which is in line\nwith the position of the Arab Summit Conference held in\nCairo in June 1996, the Republic of Yemen reiterates its\ncommitment to seeing the process for a just and\ncomprehensive peace completed as stipulated by the\nMadrid Conference, in the resolutions of international\nlegitimacy \u2014 particularly Security Council resolutions\n242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978) \u2014 and in\nsubsequent relevant agreements and protocols, and in\nkeeping with the principle of land for peace.\n22\n\n\nThis principle would ensure the complete Israeli\nwithdrawal from all the occupied Palestinian territories; the\nestablishment by the Palestinian people of its own\nindependent State, with East Jerusalem as its capital; the\nreturn of the Palestinian refugees; the release of prisoners;\nthe dismantling of the settlements built by the Israeli\noccupation authorities in the occupied territories in defiance\nof the resolutions of international legitimacy; and full\nwithdrawal from occupied Golan and occupied southern\nLebanon.\nFurthermore, we affirm that Israel should respect the\nsovereignty of brotherly Lebanon, should release the\nLebanese prisoners and detainees in the Israeli camps, and\nshould compensate Lebanon for all the damages caused by\nthe Israeli aggressions against its peoples and lands.\nSince it gained its unity and strove to consolidate the\ndemocratic direction it has adopted, the Republic of Yemen\nheld the second parliamentary elections on 27 April this\nyear. The elections took place in a free and fair atmosphere,\nas confirmed by national and international observers. These\nelections will have positive effects at all levels \u2014 national,\nregional, Arab and international \u2014 for they represent a new\nand advanced turning point in strengthening the democratic\ndirection that is based on a multi-party political system,\nfreedom of the press, respect for human rights, and the\ninstitutional consolidation of the modern Yemeni State.\nOur people is still waging its most important and most\ndifficult struggles to implement the programmes set up by\nthe newly elected Government and approved by the elected\nhouse of representatives. These programmes focus on\npursuing reform efforts \u2014 economically, financially and\nadministratively \u2014 and on continuing cooperation with the\nInternational Monetary Fund and the International Bank for\nReconstruction and Development.\nIn this regard, our objectives are to correct the\neconomic, financial and structural imbalances; to achieve\nsteadiness and stability in the economy as a whole; to\nactivate the role of the private sector in the competitive\nfree-market economy; to achieve sustainable development;\nto foster stable environments so as to attract foreign\ninvestments; to upgrade the basic necessary services of\nsociety; and to build the new State and improve the\nstandards of living of all citizens.\nFollowing these elections and the formation of a new\nGovernment, Yemen has persisted in its efforts in the\nimplementation of the advanced stages of its economic and\nadministrative reform programmes. These programmes have\nbeen welcomed by the international financial institutions\nand by the Brussels conference of donor countries, which\npledged $1.8 billion in support of the Yemeni\nGovernment\u2019s efforts over the next three years. Our\nthanks go to all donor Governments and organizations\nthat have manifested their support for and solidarity with\nthe Yemeni people.\nThe British Prime Minister Henry Palmerston is\nreported to have said that the foreign policy of a country\nis the reflection and expression of its internal policy. And\nsince economic and social development constitutes the\nbackbone of the internal policy of the Republic of Yemen,\nthe success or failure of the Yemeni foreign policy could\ntherefore be measured by its ability or inability to bring\nin foreign support in order to realize the main objective\nof its internal policy.\nThis leads me to say that a country such as Yemen,\nwhich mainly depends on foreign aid to carry out its\ninternal policy \u2014 that is, its economic, social and cultural\ndevelopment \u2014 has to take into account, in seeking the\nfinancial and technical assistance needed to achieve the\nobjectives of the internal policy, certain basic\nconsiderations that might seem to others supplementary\nand not mandatory.\nAllow me to say in this respect that within the\nparameters of a foreign policy there exists a red line that\nshould not be violated when realizing an internal\nobjective. Most important among these considerations is\nthe need to safeguard sovereignty and not to become\nmortgaged to others when seeking national interests.\nForeign support should not be sought at the expense of\nthe regional and international commitments of the\ncountry. Correspondingly, there are also certain basic\nconsiderations that are unanimously recognized by the\ninternational community which cannot be ignored or\noverlooked, as this would adversely affect the interests of\nthat country and damage its relations with the\ninternational community. Included in those considerations\nis the need to abide by international pacts and\nconventions and to respect human rights.\nEqually, the fight against terrorism and violence in\nall their forms and manifestations, regardless of their\norigins or perpetrators and regardless of where they are\ncommitted, has become a basic consideration that cannot\nbe overlooked by any country seeking foreign assistance\nor even mere acceptance by the international community.\n23\n\n\nIn a similar manner, the relation between a\nGovernment and its citizens has a direct and strong bearing\non its relations with the donor countries that are to provide\nassistance and support. We need not be too idealistic,\nhowever, for the requirements of national interest of some\ndonor countries have been placed above those idealistic\nprinciples. As a result many countries that have had\nextremely bad relations with their peoples have still\nmanaged to get a considerable amount of financial aid,\nalthough this occurred more during the cold war than now.\nThe Republic of Yemen is therefore fully committed\nto the consolidation of security and stability at both regional\nand international levels. This can best be reflected in its\nposition regarding its conflict with Eritrea and its\nendeavours to solve border problems with its neighbours in\na peaceful manner.\nThe Republic of Yemen supports the process of a\ncomprehensive and just peace in the Middle East and the\nprinciple of land for peace. But, like other Arab countries,\nit categorically rejects the principle of peace for peace.\nThe Republic of Yemen has condemned all forms of\nterror, be it terror committed by an individual, by a group\nor by a State.\nThese are the foundations and the principles of the\nforeign policy of the Republic of Yemen.\nAt the internal level, the relation between the\nGovernment and its citizens is based, as I said before, on\nconstitutional legitimacy; on equality among all citizens,\nwhether male or female; on equality in rights and\nobligations of men and women alike; on the freedom of\nindividuals and groups; on the freedom of association to\nparties, trade unions and civilian community organizations;\non freedom of the press; and on the protection of human\nrights.\nOn the basis of its deep understanding of the noble\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, the\nRepublic of Yemen is pursuing a foreign policy that is\nbased on mutual respect, positive cooperation, common\ninterests, rejection of violence in international relations,\npeaceful coexistence, maintenance of security and stability,\ngood neighbourliness, and consolidation of the role of\nYemen in attending to the needs of our nation and in\nstanding for the causes of righteousness, justice and peace\nin the world under the wise leadership of His Excellency\nPresident Ali Abdullah Saleh.\nIn this regard we are satisfied with the results of our\nefforts to improve our relations and to cooperate with our\nbrothers and friends. Here we take pride in having been\nable to solve the border problem between our country and\nthe sisterly Sultanate of Oman, and to reach a final\nsolution acceptable to both parties. This can be an\nexample to be followed by brothers and neighbours in\nsolving border problems.\nThis is what we are trying to do now with our\nbrothers and neighbours in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nWe hope that we will be able to achieve what we all are\nlooking for: to serve the interests and aspirations of our\ntwo brotherly and neighbourly peoples and to consolidate\nstability and peace in the region.\nWith the aim of reaching a peaceful solution that\nsafeguards legal, historical and geographic rights, the\nRepublic of Yemen has endeavoured to avoid escalation\nand to dissipate tension. It has demonstrated a sincere\ndesire and exerted great efforts both in dealing with the\nEritrean occupation of the Yemeni Greater Hanish island\nin the Red Sea in mid-1995 and all along in the\nnegotiations between the two countries. We did not rush\nto use force, but rather have sought to pursue all peaceful\nways and means. We have opted for dialogue through\nofficial mediation and international arbitration in order to\nsave our neighbouring peoples the scourge of war.\nWhile the Republic of Yemen expresses its solidarity\nwith the brotherly Somali people, the Yemeni leadership\nrepresented by His Excellency President Ali Abdullah\nSaleh has added its efforts to those of the League of Arab\nStates, the Organization of African Unity and the Inter-\nGovernmental Authority on Drought and Development\n(IGADD) to achieve peace in Somalia. Just last August,\nPresident Saleh received the United Nations envoy to\nSomalia when he visited to our capital. At that time the\nRepublic of Yemen expressed its special interest in the\nSomali question and discussed its efforts to find a suitable\nsolution to the conflict in Somalia, not only in view of the\nhistorical and social links between Yemen and Somalia,\nbut also in view of the negative effects this crisis could\nhave on our countries and the fact that thousands of\nSomali refugees have come to Yemen.\nThe Republic of Yemen has affirmed its readiness to\ncooperate with the United Nations with a view to\nnormalizing the situation in Somalia and enabling that\ncountry to become an active member of the international\ncommunity. Our joint efforts have resulted in noticeable\nprogress in this respect. Our political leadership has\n24\n\n\nreceived a number of Somali leaders and has sought to\nsolve outstanding differences in Somalia. This is because of\nour belief in the need to safeguard the unity and territorial\nintegrity of Somalia and to achieve justice and equality\namong its citizens.\nFrom this rostrum we hereby call upon our Somali\nbrothers to take the initiative themselves and to demonstrate\na greater political will and sincere desire to find a peaceful\nsolution to the conflict and to attain stability so that\nSomalis can restore their national institutions and\nreconstruct their country. In this way it will be possible for\nSomali refugees to return to their regions and be resettled\nin their country.\nWe also call upon the international community to\nincrease its effort and to provide the necessary assistance\nand support to rebuild the State institutions within a\nframework of national consensus that is acceptable to all\nSomalis.\nWhen we met last year Yemen welcomed the\nmemorandum of understanding that was signed between\nIraq and the United Nations in May 1996 to implement\nSecurity Council resolution 986 (1995) on the oil-for-food\nformula, it being the first step to alleviate the sufferings of\nthe Iraqi people. Yemen was optimistic that this agreement,\nwhich was reached after arduous negotiations, would be\nimplemented without delay. But we find now that the\nimplementation of that agreement often faces great\ndifficulties, which has compounded the agony of the Iraqi\npeople.\nThe Republic of Yemen, while reaffirming the need\nfor Iraq to implement all the resolutions of international\nlegitimacy and to continue its cooperation with the United\nNations, finds it necessary and urgent to alleviate the\nsuffering of the Iraqi people caused by the embargo\nimposed on that country.\nThis leads me to talk about the air embargo and other\nmeasures imposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and\nabout the damages and sufferings inflicted upon the\nbrotherly Libyan people in consequence of this unfair\nembargo. We would like to affirm our call for an end to\nthis embargo in the context of the resolutions of the League\nof the Arab States, the Organization of African Unity and\nthe Non-Aligned Movement.\nConcerning Sudan, my country would like to express\nits happiness about and support for the new developments\nand changes regarding the Khartoum peace agreement,\nwhich should receive the support and backing of the\nUnited Nations and the international community.\nWe in the Republic of Yemen look with much\nadmiration and respect on the way in which democratic\nelections were held recently in the Islamic Republic of\nIran. We congratulate its new President on his election,\nand we applaud its Government for the approach it has\nadopted towards the region. However, we call upon our\nbrothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran and in the United\nArab Emirates to continue their direct dialogue in order\nto reach a final and peaceful solution to the question of\nthe three islands, in accordance with the United Nations\nCharter, the principles of international law and the\nprinciple of good-neighbourliness.\nThe maintenance of international peace and security,\nthe achievement of sustainable development and respect\nfor human rights depend, first and foremost, on the\npolitical will of the Member States of this Organization.\nYet the selectivity used by the powerful Members of the\nOrganization in dealing with others will strip the new\nworld order, whose characteristics are not yet\nascertainable, of its humanity and the justice to which we\nall aspire. Therefore this rostrum and this Organization\nrepresent the real safety valve for the security and safety\nof all mankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, your\nelection to preside over the fifty-second session of the\nGeneral Assembly is a fitting and well-deserved result of\nyour distinguished service for your country in the\ninternational community.\nI also wish to convey our appreciation to\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia for so ably\ndirecting the work of the fifty-first session, and to\ncongratulate him for a job well done.\nI join those who have spoken before me in\nwelcoming the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan to this,\nhis first General Assembly session since his assumption\nof office. Already he has impressed us with his sincerity\nof purpose and his willingness to take bold initiatives. He\ncan always rely on Jamaica\u2019s full cooperation and support\n4\n\n\nas he seeks to steer the United Nations towards the new\nmillennium.\nExactly 35 years ago, Jamaica became a Member of\nthe United Nations by one of its first acts as a sovereign\nnation. We did so in recognition of the central role in the\nmanagement of global affairs which only the United\nNations can fill and from our desire to participate as an\nequal partner in that process. Ever since then, Jamaica has\nactively sought to contribute in a constructive spirit to the\nbuilding and strengthening of the international system. One\nconcrete result of these efforts is the location in Jamaica of\nan offshoot of the system, the International Seabed\nAuthority, established under the United Nations Convention\non the Law of the Sea, which is generally acknowledged to\nhave been a signal achievement in extending the reach of\ninternational cooperation. We feel confident that the\nAuthority will be able to discharge its mandate efficiently\nas a completely autonomous institution.\nWe are constantly reminded that we are approaching\na new century and a new millennium. This new era\nprovides exciting possibilities and, at the same time, poses\nformidable challenges. It requires of us a creative effort to\nfind new directions and a continuing search for fresh\nsolutions. The fluidity and changing currents in world\naffairs demand constant adaptation and adjustments to meet\ncontemporary realities.\nSome old disputes remain unresolved, and an array of\nnew problems continues to enter the international agenda.\nThe situation in the Middle East should not be allowed to\nremain forever a source of anxiety and frustration. The rise\nof ethnic violence and intercommunal conflict must be\nhalted now.\nWhatever cloud of uncertainty may hang over the\nfuture, we must not fail to lay the foundations of a more\nstable and equitable world order which fosters greater hope\nand wider opportunities for mankind.\nAs we seek to strengthen the fabric of international\nsecurity, there needs to be a concentrated focus on the root\ncauses of instability, conflict and confrontation everywhere.\nThe danger signals are unmistakably clear. The coexistence\nof a world of wealth and prosperity and a world of poverty\nand misery is too profound a contradiction to be ignored. It\nlies at the heart of an emerging crisis. More than one\nbillion human beings are still condemned to abject poverty.\nThe despair and frustration which form their daily\nexperience breed tension and trigger instability which are\nbound to erupt from time to time.\nIn a world where we note with increasing concern\nthe absence of appropriate measures by multilateral\nfinancial institutions to relieve the burden of debt, we are\nbound to question whether the economic measures applied\nin the last few years represent the only way for\ndeveloping countries to orient their economies. We cannot\naccept that the impoverishment of millions is a necessary\ncost of future world growth.\nGlobalization and liberalization, which have led to\nthe breaking down of so many barriers between nations,\nare not removing the barriers between rich and poor. The\nprocess seems instead to be widening the differences and\ndeepening the divide. The benefits of increased production\nand the expansion of global trade have been unevenly\nspread. Many developing countries are being increasingly\nmarginalized in the process. Expected transfers of\nresources from increased trade and investment flows have\nnot materialized, while the burden of debt remains a\nmajor constraint on development. Simply put, the rich are\ngetting richer and the poor are getting poorer.\nUnless we redress the imbalance \u2014 and quickly \u2014\nthe disparities will increase exponentially. To avert\nimminent disaster, there has to be a reversal of the pattern\nof transfer of technology and more liberal access to the\nmarkets of developed countries.\nIn all this, the United Nations has a decisive and\nstrategic role to play. It should direct and channel\ninternational cooperation to correct distortions and\ninequities in the system, and contribute to the creation of\nan international economic environment facilitating\neconomic growth and the benefits of development for all.\nThe new trading system is skewed in favour of the\neconomically powerful. It is becoming more and more\napparent that free trade, as practised by its loudest\nadvocates, is not necessarily fair trade. For developing\ncountries, access to larger markets remains difficult,\nowing to a variety of protective barriers. And where\nspecial and historical market arrangements for small\nproducers still exist, these are now under threat from\nalliances of powerful governmental and private interests.\nWe developing countries cannot afford to shut\nourselves off from what is taking place around us. The\npace of change is at times bewildering, but we cannot\nsay, \u201cStop the world, I want to get off\u201d. We must make\nuse of the positive elements of modernity, organization of\nwork and efficiency, to build the kind of society we wish\nto leave to our children. The empowerment of all of the\n5\n\n\npeoples of our countries is of paramount importance to the\nadvancement of our societies.\nSuch empowerment requires that priority attention be\ngiven to human-resource development and human-capital\nformation, and to the optimal utilization of all the available\nhuman and natural resources of our time. Increasingly,\nwhere this has not already started, our programmes of\neducation and training will have to be redesigned and\nrefocused to enable our peoples to function effectively in\nthe emerging knowledge-based world economy.\nApplications of science and technology and advances in\ntelecommunications must become all-pervasive factors to be\neffectively and appropriately utilized for the benefit of our\npeoples.\nNothing would better fulfil the lofty ideals of our\nfounding fathers than an immediate global assault on\npoverty, ignorance and disease. To win the battle, I call\nupon this Assembly to emphasize the creation, application\nand dissemination of knowledge in every corner of the\nEarth.\nLiberalization and globalization, as they are being\npractised, have not shown the capacity or willingness to\ntake into account the genuine interests or practical\npossibilities of small States. This is the painful lesson that\nwe as Caribbean producers of bananas have learned. The\nrecent panel ruling by the World Trade Organization\n(WTO) in Geneva on the European banana regime threatens\nto ruin the economies of the smaller States of the\nCaribbean, thereby endangering the economic stability of\nthe entire region. It demonstrates not only the vulnerability\nof small economies, but also the extent to which we are at\nthe mercy of those whose calculations seem oblivious to the\ninterests of our survival.\nSmall economies operate under severe resource\nconstraints and need to conserve the natural environment,\nwhich is a precious resource. That is why countries\nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) attach\nspecial importance to international recognition of the\npeculiar circumstances and needs of small island developing\nStates, as highlighted in the Barbados Programme of\nAction, which was adopted by the United Nations Global\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States.\nIt is with great disappointment that we note how little\nprogress has been made to implement the Programme of\nAction. There is a special need for financing arrangements\nto develop production capabilities, infrastructure and\nenvironmental protection programmes.\nSmall island States suffer other disadvantages. The\nCaribbean is renowned for its natural beauty, but it is also\nvulnerable to a range of frequent natural disasters. To the\nphysical limitations in resources and economic scale have\nbeen added the hazards of nature.\nEven as I speak, the people of the small island of\nMontserrat are struggling to maintain their existence in\ntheir own land, two thirds of which has been destroyed by\na volcano that resumed activity just over two years ago.\nAs a member of the Caribbean Community, Montserrat's\nplight is of grave concern to all CARICOM States. I\nspeak on behalf of the Community in acknowledging the\ncategorical commitment given by the administering\nPower, the United Kingdom, for both emergency\nassistance to Montserratians and for the sustainable\ndevelopment of that territory.\nThe costs of reconstruction are immense. Members\nof the Caribbean Community have offered constructive\nsupport to the recovery efforts. We believe that the\ninternational community should also respond in a\nhumanitarian gesture of solidarity. I therefore take this\nopportunity to appeal to the General Assembly to\ndemonstrate appropriate support for Montserrat through\nthe adoption of tangible measures to assist in the\nrebuilding and sustainable development of that island. It\nis our hope and expectation that the membership of the\nUnited Nations will be able to devise a specific scheme\nof assistance for a small and courageous people.\nWe all look to the United Nations to help in\nemergencies, but above all, to be effective in keeping the\npeace. It should be ready to respond promptly to crises as\nthey occur and to defuse tensions and conflict situations\nthrough preventive diplomacy. We believe the present\ntime affords a significant opportunity for creating the\nframework to fulfil this role and for us to shape a rapid-\nresponse capability.\nIn recent years, a number of unilateral as well as\nmultilateral measures have resulted in a more positive\nclimate for international peace and security. The\nconclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty at the fiftieth session of the General Assembly and\nthe entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention\nhave enhanced the prospects for real progress towards the\ngoal of general and complete disarmament. We\nnevertheless acknowledge that more needs to be done in\n6\n\n\nthe areas of arms regulation and disarmament, in respect\nespecially of conventional weapons and the proliferation of\nsmall arms.\nWe welcome the steps being taken to prohibit the use\nof anti-personnel landmines, which should be regarded as\na category of inhumane weapons that can no longer be\nallowed to cause the maiming and loss of life of civilians.\nWe urge Member States to give full support to the Ottawa\nprocess for the conclusion of an international treaty to ban\nthis category of weapons so that there can be universal\nobedience.\nThe threat to international peace and security can no\nlonger be viewed in purely military and political terms.\nIllicit trafficking in drugs poses a serious threat, as all\ntoo often we witness the pervasive and pernicious effects of\nthe production and consumption of illicit drugs. The\nmassive demand and the lure of profits from the trade have\nspawned a transnational network of criminals with\nconsiderable resources and influence. The activities of these\ngroups are particularly threatening to small States such as\nthose in the Caribbean, where the State apparatus is often\nstretched to deal with their coercive capability. Within the\nCaribbean Community we have taken these threats seriously\nand have committed significant resources to confronting\nthem. Our geographical proximity to the major destination\nfor the consumption of drugs makes the Caribbean\nparticularly vulnerable as a transshipment point. We\ntherefore view bilateral and regional cooperation as critical\nto combating drug smuggling.\nAn associated problem that is particularly dangerous\nfor us is the smuggling of arms and weapons of destruction,\nwhich is a significant factor in spreading a cycle of crime\nand violence. CARICOM has pushed for a regional\ninitiative to attack this problem. We look forward to\nhemisphere support, particularly in restricting illegal exports\nfrom the main areas of manufacturing and sale of small\narms.\nIt is evident from all the forces at work that the\nimperatives of interdependence, the impact of globalization\nand the interlinkage in global problems require a renewal\nand strengthening of multilateralism. With the end of the\ncold war, we now have within our grasp the opportunity to\nestablish a lasting framework for international cooperation\nand to build genuine partnerships that will guarantee a\nfuture that is secure for all. The challenges of the emerging\nworld order are best addressed by multilateral approaches.\nIsolationism and unilateralism cannot be viable options, but\nmultilateralism can thrive only if there are effective\nmultilateral institutions.\nThe United Nations remains indispensable as the\nonly universal mechanism capable of addressing issues of\nglobal impact and concern. But we must realize that the\ninternational society which the United Nations now serves\nis vastly different from the one in existence when the\nOrganization was originally created. The reshaping of the\nUnited Nations therefore has to take into account new and\ncomplex international realities. Without compromising the\nfundamental objectives of the Charter, we need new rules\nand procedures to guide us.\nOf special importance is the reform of the Security\nCouncil, in terms of both composition and mode of\noperation. The Council is a vital organ in the working of\nthe United Nations. It is essential for its effectiveness that\nit command the confidence of the international\ncommunity.\nJamaica supports an expansion of membership of the\nCouncil which will make it more representative of the\ninternational community. We advocate the adoption of\nprocedures that will make it more democratic and\ntransparent in decision-making. We recognize that there\nare important and delicate issues at stake and that we\nshould proceed with care, but we have a concern that the\nprocess should not be mired in endless debate. We\nbelieve there is a sufficient consensus on proposals to\nform the basis for decisions soon.\nWe also acknowledge that more efficient\nmanagement and more scope for effective initiative by the\nSecretary-General and his staff are essential to a\nstrengthened United Nations structure. We support the\nSecretary-General in this endeavour.\nJamaica also endorses the need for measures to\nimprove efficiency, and we have no quarrel with reform\nto streamline and rationalize the system. In welcoming\nthese steps, we must however emphasize that reform is\nnot synonymous with cost cutting. Reform is not about\ndoing less; it is about doing better.\nWe would therefore wish to see a process that\nstrengthens the capacity of the United Nations to deliver\nthe services required by Member States as well as cement\nthe linkages among the organs of the system while\npreserving comparative advantages, complementarities and\nsynergies. The exercise must improve the capacity of the\nUnited Nations to take preventive action and respond\n7\n\n\nswiftly to crises. Above all, for small developing nations\nsuch as my own it is important that the Organization\ncontinue to play a leadership role in defining global\ndevelopment priorities.\nNot all Member States will readily embrace the reform\nproposals that have been introduced, yet no one can deny\nthe need for meaningful action to strengthen and improve\nthe United Nations system. We must therefore seek to find\ncommon cause and summon the collective will to\nimplement the measures that are necessary for its\nrevitalization. It is our collective responsibility. Effective\nreform of our global institution requires broad agreement on\nthe main features of the new global environment. We must\nclearly define the role the United Nations is expected to\nplay in the next millennium. Our common vision must be\none in which the United Nations can act as the catalyst for\nchange and an instrument of progress on behalf of all\npeoples of the world.\nLet us resolve to equip the United Nations with the\nnecessary tools, including the requisite financial resources\nin accordance with Charter obligations, to enable it\neffectively to undertake its leadership role in safeguarding\ninternational peace and security in ensuring the economic\nand social well-being of mankind. It is our responsibility,\nand our peoples are looking for an institution energized to\nact effectively and swiftly to address the challenges that\nconfront us as we approach the twenty-first century. Let us\nexploit the opportunity we now have to fashion a United\nNations which reflects the hope and aspirations of all\nmankind for sustainable development, for lasting security\nand for enduring peace.\nThe new millennium beckons with its endless\npossibilities and challenges. Let not narrow self-interest\nprevent us from taking bold and decisive steps to meet\nthese challenges. Jamaica and the Caribbean Community\nstand ready to play their part in a cooperative effort to\nattain global equity and prosperity. All of us owe it to\nourselves and to succeeding generations.\nI urge the international community wholeheartedly to\nembrace this venture in a genuine spirit of solidarity and\nharmony. History will not forgive us should we fail to do\nso.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt\ngives me great pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-second session. I am confident that your extensive\nexperience and extreme competence will positively\ncontribute to the successful conduct of the proceedings of\nthis session. I would like to assure you that the Iraqi\ndelegation will do its best to cooperate with you and with\nyour colleagues in discharging your responsibilities to bring\nthe proceedings of this session to a successful conclusion.\nI would like also to pay tribute to your predecessor,\nMr. Razali Ismail, for the incessant and sincere efforts\nwhich he made to crown the proceedings of the last session\nwith success. He has earned our appreciation.\nThe success of the United Nations in the exercise of\nits desired role depends primarily on the proper application\nof the principles and provisions of the Charter, because it\nis the only instrument that can achieve the goals for which\nthis Organization was established: the endeavour to achieve\nan international community based on respect for the\nsovereignty, freedom and independence of peoples and their\nempowerment to achieve their goals of economic and social\ndevelopment.\nThe reform of the United Nations structures and\nmechanisms in a proper way that ensures justice to all\nMember States and geographical groups will enable it to\ndischarge its responsibilities in a manner consistent with the\npurposes, principles and provisions enshrined in the\nCharter.\nWe believe that the reform process of the Organization\nshould not be restricted to the management aspect,\nimportant as it is. More important, there should be a\ncommon political will to redress the real and effective\nbalance in the work of the Organization and to prevent its\nmachinery from being used for private political objectives\nand purposes of certain super-Powers. Above all, one\nshould pay attention to the dangers inherent in one\ninternational pole breaking loose and trying to dominate\nthe world. In this context, Iraq welcomes the communiqu\u00e9\nissued after the meeting of President Yeltsin of Russia\nand President Jiang Zemin of China in Moscow on 22\nApril 1997, which clearly called for the rejection of\nhegemony by any State over the world\u2019s destinies, of the\nexercise of power politics or of the monopoly of\ninternational issues. The Russian-Chinese communiqu\u00e9\nalso called for the establishment of a multi-polar\ninternational system. We in Iraq are proud to note that\nour leader, President Saddam Hussain, called 20 years ago\nfor a multi-polar world.\nThe United Nations should not be controlled by the\nrich, who are a small minority in the world. Among the\nbasic purposes of the United Nations, according to the\nCharter, is the promotion of the economic and social\nadvancement of all peoples. Based on that, we consider it\nnecessary to avoid marginalizing developing countries and\ndenying them the opportunities and potentialities for\neconomic and scientific development.\nWhile we are talking about the reform of the\nOrganization and its mechanisms and the review of its\nrole, we should not overlook the basic realities of the\nevolution of the international community from a small\ngroup of States that are homogeneous in their concepts\nand interests to a community of a global nature,\nnecessarily heterogeneous and varying in all its\nperceptions and interests. This objective reality makes it\nimperative for all of us to employ our common energies\nto review the charters and mechanisms that we have\ninherited to make them consistent with the objective\nreality of the international community in order to achieve\nthe common and public good, not simply the interests of\nthe minority. One example that comes to mind in this\nregard is the area of human rights.\nFinally, we must recognize the need for deliberation,\nconsultation and extensive negotiation on what reform\nsteps should be approved. A prerequisite for the success\nof any step in this common effort is the presence of a real\nconsensus among States, not the voices speaking under\npressure and threats to their respective interests.\n6\n\n\nFor more than seven years, Iraq has been suffering\nunder an unjust blockade the like of which has never been\nwitnessed in human history. We have more than once stated\nclearly and unequivocally before the General Assembly the\nsteps that Iraq had undertaken to implement the resolutions\nof the Security Council on the so-called Gulf crisis,\nparticularly resolution 687 (1991), so that the blockade\nimposed upon it could be lifted.\nIraq has carried out what was required of it under\nthese resolutions. In the context of working with the Special\nCommission and the International Atomic Energy Agency\n(IAEA) for the implementation of section C of resolution\n687 (1991), on proscribed weapons, Iraq has carried out all\nthe substantive obligations set out therein. Iraq has never\ntarried in doing everything possible to emphasize its\nkeenness to deal even with the very minute details so that\nthe Security Council could move to carry out its\ncorresponding obligations towards Iraq by lifting the\nblockade.\nOur work in this regard is of special importance. We\nshould pause to shed light upon it. The full implementation\nto date of the substantive obligations imposed on Iraq with\nregard to banned weapons is an established fact. Despite all\nthe rumours, the truth is that Iraq no longer has any banned\nweapons, equipment, machinery or materials. The system of\ncontinuous observation established in Iraq by the Special\nCommission and the International Atomic Energy Agency\nis working effectively and has been since August 1994,\ncovering all the territory of Iraq.\nWhen the new Chairman of the Special Commission,\nAmbassador Richard Butler, assumed his office, we\nwelcomed his statements in which he affirmed that he\nwould follow an objective, scientific and technical approach\nin dealing with what the Commission views as remaining\nissues, in accordance with the requirements clearly\nestablished by resolution 687 (1991). We affirmed our full\nreadiness to cooperate with Ambassador Butler. We agreed\nwith him, during his first visit to Baghdad last July, on an\nintensive common work programme, which we have\nactively carried out. In fact, substantial advances have been\nmade in this common activity, and we look forward to the\nsemi-annual report by the Special Commission, which we\nhope will be submitted to the Security Council in a few\ndays. We hope it will equitably reflect the progress\nachieved and will open the door for the Security Council to\nstart implementing paragraph 22 of resolution 687 (1991),\nwhich means the beginning of the lifting of the blockade on\nIraq.\nThe comprehensive blockade imposed on Iraq is the\nmost extensive and cruel boycott system ever imposed by\nthe Security Council throughout its history. It covers and\naffects, in theory and in practice, every aspect of life.\nFrom our practical experience, we are convinced that the\ninsistence on the perpetuation of the blockade against Iraq\nis not related to the fulfilment by Iraq of its obligations.\nIt is rather a systematic plan to inflict severe damage on\nIraq by putting an end to its development potential and by\ndestroying its basic economic infrastructure to fulfil the\nselfish interests of an unjust super-Power.\nThe whole world has felt the magnitude of the wilful\ndamage and destruction inflicted on Iraq by the\ncontinuation of the blockade, which is contrary to the\npurposes for which the United Nations was established,\nwhich purposes have been emphasized in its numerous\nconferences. International organizations, humanitarian\nmissions and United Nations agencies have warned of the\ndangers besetting the people of Iraq as a result of the\ncontinued blockade, particularly the dangerous effects on\nwomen and children.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), for\ninstance, has confirmed in its latest study in March 1997\nthat 27.5 per cent of Iraqi children under five years of age\nsuffer from chronic malnutrition and that the most\nthreatened segment is children under two years old, due\nto malnutrition and the incidence of contagious diseases.\nFurthermore, the environment in Iraq has suffered\nextensive damage because of indiscriminate bombing by\nthe United States and some of its allies, which was aimed\nat power stations, sewage systems and factories, which we\nhave not been able to rebuild fully because of the\nblockade.\nScientific studies and research carried out by foreign\nresearchers and scientists have unequivocally confirmed\nthat the United States used banned weapons and\nammunition enriched with depleted uranium in its military\noperations against Iraq. This exposed vast tracts of Iraqi\nterritory to contamination by deadly toxic materials.\nNumerous cases of hitherto unfamiliar illnesses have been\nrecorded, such as congenital deformities of foetuses, bone\ndeformities and many cases of leukaemia among children.\nWe heard many allegations from the representatives\nof the United States and Britain before Iraq agreed to deal\nwith the oil-for-food formula. The representatives of both\ncountries shed crocodile tears and alleged that they were\nconcerned about the suffering of the Iraqi people. They\n7\n\n\nsaid that they had come up with Security Council resolution\n986 (1995) to alleviate this suffering. that resolution was\nnot balanced. We and the United Nations Secretary-General,\nin May 1996, were able to reach a memorandum of\nunderstanding to implement the resolution in a balanced\nmanner. When implementation started \u2014 that is to say,\nwhen the implementation of the memorandum started \u2014 in\nDecember 1996, the American and the British conduct was\nseen for what it really is.\nThe oil-for-food-and-medicine formula is a temporary\nand modest formula that meets only a small fraction of\nIraq\u2019s needs. Nevertheless, this formula has encountered\nand continues to encounter many major obstacles and\ndifficulties, which the United States and Britain in\nparticular try to impose with a view to impeding the proper\nand effective implementation of the memorandum of\nunderstanding.\nThe conduct of the representatives of these two\ncountries in the Committee established pursuant to Security\nCouncil resolution 661 (1990) has led to an accumulation\nof contracts which were rejected or suspended on flimsy\npretexts. This has caused a huge break in the smooth flow\nof the approval of such contracts and has thereby delayed\nthe delivery and distribution of materials to the Iraqi\npeople. To date, despite the fact that the implementation of\nthe first period ended over three months ago, Iraq has\nreceived only 25 per cent of the medicine required and has\nnot received any materials at all up to now relating to\nagriculture, education, water or sewage, or any spare parts\nfor electricity-generating power stations.\nNow more than ever is the time for the United Nations\nto discharge its responsibility with regard to its obligations\nunder the Charter, not only to the people of Iraq, but to the\ninternational community. The United Nations has a duty to\ncarry out a professional and objective review of the\nprovisions of the blockade imposed on Iraq in order to\nimplement paragraph 22 of Security Council resolution 687\n(1991) as a first step towards lifting the blockade\ncompletely.\nAll the discussions that have taken place in the United\nNations, in specialized working groups and committees, and\nin particular in the Special Committee on the Charter of the\nUnited Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the\nOrganization, have stressed that sanctions should be an\nexceptional measure used by the United Nations in special\ncircumstances and in accordance with the Charter. They\nhave also stressed that such sanctions should not be based\nmerely on political expediency, but rather should be firmly\nbased on international law; that they should be\nimplemented according to the principles of justice and\ninternational law; that they should not serve individual or\nfactional interests; that in their implementation,\nconsideration should be given to the human suffering that\nthey cause; and that a time limit should be set for their\nlifting. Such a serious measure should not be imposed\nwithout setting a precise time for its lifting.\nUnited Nations responsibility does not end there. The\nUnited Nations must put an end to all hostile practices\nagainst Iraq by the United States, which persists in its\ncontinuous attempts to interfere in Iraq\u2019s internal affairs\nwith a view to causing instability and insecurity and in\ncarrying out operations to change its nationalist regime;\nsuch practices are considered criminal acts even under its\nown domestic law. Statements made by senior American\nofficials confirm the hostile American policy towards\nIraq.\nMembers of the United Nations are not unaware of\nthe article published in the Washington Post on 26 June\n1997 or of the information contained in the ABC\ntelevision programme aired on 26 June 1997. This\ninformation confirmed that the United States was involved\nin conspiracies against the nationalist regime in Iraq. This\ninvolvement is an official policy, approved by the\nAmerican President, and more that $100 million has been\nappropriated for it. The Central Intelligence Agency has\nbeen charged with its implementation. Following that\npublicity, the policy was acknowledged by an official\nspokesman of the American State Department in a press\nbriefing on 27 June.\nThe United Nations resolutions on Iraq affirm that\nall States have an obligation to respect Iraq\u2019s sovereignty,\nterritorial integrity and political independence. The United\nStates is carrying out a policy of its own making, which\nruns counter to the provisions of the Charter and of the\nresolutions referred to. I hope that Members of the United\nNations are not ignorant of the fact that among the means\nof achieving the declared objectives of this hostile policy\ntowards Iraq is the imposition of no-fly zones in northern\nand southern Iraq. This is an illegal act that is contrary to\nSecurity Council resolutions. It is a unilateral military act\nby the Governments of the United States and Britain \u2014\na clear application of brute power politics against our\ncountry. We demand that the United Nations deplore and\ncondemn unilateral policies based on the logic of brute\nforce, opportunism, double standards and hegemony.\n8\n\n\nWe are demanding no more than the legal and proper\napplication of Security Council resolutions in accordance\nwith the purposes and principles of the Charter. We believe\nthat there is a collective duty to take joint action to evaluate\nin an equitable manner Iraq\u2019s fulfilment of its obligations.\nThis responsibility rests first and foremost with the\nmembers of the Security Council because collectively they\nbear responsibility for any imbalance caused by the\nunilateral positions taken by the United States and Britain.\nWe are eager to establish excellent relations with\nneighbouring countries. We have affirmed on more than\none occasion the importance of dialogue in order to arrive\nat the best solutions to problems affecting relations between\nthe countries of the region. Unfortunately, we have not\nreceived the required response from certain parties, largely\nbecause of interference by external Powers that have\nnothing to do with the reality of the interests of the States\nof the region.\nWe note that, unfortunately, our neighbour, Turkey, is\nindulging in dangerous policies that run counter to the deep\nhistorical, religious and human relations between Iraq and\nTurkey. Turkey has repeatedly continued to violate our\nsovereignty, interfere in our internal affairs and invade our\nterritory, on the basis of flimsy pretexts. We have discussed\nthe situation with our neighbour, Turkey, on several\noccasions in the past. The most recent discussion was with\nthe Under-Secretary of the Turkish Ministry for Foreign\nAffairs, which took place on 15 September 1997 in\nBaghdad. During those discussions we explained that the\nsolution to the Kurdish problem inside Turkey could not be\nachieved by committing armed aggression against Iraq, or\nby interfering in its internal affairs, in collaboration with\nforeign Powers \u2014 the United States and Britain \u2014 but\nrather by fully observing the principle of mutual respect for\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two countries\nand by cooperation between their Governments to ensure\nsecurity and stability on both sides of the international\nborder.\nWe have warned Turkey of the serious and negative\nconsequences of its policies for relations between the two\ncountries and for Turkey\u2019s own interests. Many countries in\nand outside the region, and international organizations,\nforemost among them the League of Arab States, have\ncondemned the new Turkish aggression against Iraq, which\nbegan on 22 September 1997. We strongly condemn this\nnew military aggression, which is a flagrant violation of\nIraq\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We demand that\nTurkey immediately withdraw its invading forces from our\ncountry and refrain from repeating such aggressive military\npractices, which contradict good-neighbourly relations, the\nCharter and international law. We hold Turkey fully\nresponsible internationally for its acts of aggression inside\nIraq. We reserve our full right to respond to these acts\nand to assert our other legitimate rights under\ninternational law that arise as a result of Turkey\u2019s\nresponsibility for those acts.\nWe are also keen on establishing good-neighbourly\nrelations with Iran, based on mutual respect for\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in\ninternal affairs. On 8 August 1997 President Saddam\nHussain issued a call to the new Iranian Government to\nshow its good intentions towards Iraq by carrying out its\nestablished obligations, foremost of which is the release\nof Iraqi prisoners of war and the return of the aircraft\nentrusted to it. He also affirmed that Iraq would\nreciprocate each step taken by Iran in this regard by\ntaking two balanced steps: one corresponding to the\nIranian step and another in line with our deep sense of\nhumanitarian, regional and international responsibility to\nencourage the taking of successive, continual steps to\nensure that regional security, mutual respect and balanced\ninterests rest firmly on their proper foundation in such a\nway that benefits the peoples of the region.\nIt is unfortunate that our neighbour, Iran, does not\nmatch our inclination and prefers to continue to exploit\nthe conditions of the unjust blockade imposed against Iraq\nand to exploit the imposition of no-fly zones by the\nUnited States and Britain in northern and southern Iraq to\nenable it to violate Iraqi sovereignty, penetrate its airspace\nand commit one military aggression after another. The\nmost recent of such acts was the bombing by eight\nIranian military aircraft of positions inside Iraqi territory,\nin the governorates of Diala and El-Kut on 29 September\n1997.\nIran and another State are taking advantage of the\nillegal air embargo, imposed on northern and southern\nIraq by the United States and its collaborators, to violate\nIraq\u2019s sovereignty, penetrate its airspace and commit\ncontinuous military aggression on its territory. The\ncontinuation of this illegal air embargo constitutes an\nongoing threat to Iraq\u2019s sovereignty and security, not only\nfrom America and Britain, but also from Iran and other States.\nThis situation, in which acts of aggression are\nrepeatedly committed, means that the explicit United\nNations pledges in relevant Security Council resolutions\nto safeguard Iraq\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity\nhave become a mere dead letter. It is time that these\n9\n\n\npledges be honoured. If it does otherwise, the United\nNations will have violated its own pledges.\nIraq is an ancient country with a history going back\nmore than 7,000 years. The Iraqi people, who contributed\nimmensely to human civilization, will remain in charge of\ntheir own affairs, independent in their choices and able to\novercome these crises. As we stand at the threshold of the\ntwenty-first century, we look forward to seeing the United\nNations enabled to discharge its basic responsibilities to\ncarry out the purposes embodied in the Charter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I am\nsure that, with your vast experience and diplomatic skill,\nthis Assembly will be guided towards achieving the goals\nto which all peace-loving nations aspire. I also take this\noccasion to thank your predecessor, Ambassador Razali\nIsmail, for the efficient and energetic manner in which he\npresided over the Assembly at its fifty-first session.\nAs we approach the dawn of a new millennium, the\ninternational community continues to prepare itself for the\nnew challenges that the twenty-first century will\ninevitably bring. Malta welcomes the commitment of our\nevolving United Nations, ably led by Secretary-General\nKofi Annan, to become more responsive to and effective\nin meeting these new challenges. Similarly, we share his\nperception that the United Nations is at a moment of great\nopportunity.\nThere should be little doubt that, with the demise of\nbloc politics, the way has been opened for a world more\nat ease with itself. Tension on a global scale has\ndiminished. At the same time, global instability has been\nreplaced by regional tensions that have often led to ethnic\nand other localized conflicts. In our interdependent world,\nthe United Nations has a significant role to play in the\npromotion of understanding and cooperation, which are\nessential elements for the survival of humankind.\nFor its part, Malta is ready to work closely with all\nMember States to strengthen our capacity for collective\naction in the best interests of the States and peoples of\nour countries, particularly in upholding the principles of\nthe Charter of the United Nations. Our commitment to\nfundamental rights and the process of democracy is\nunwavering.\nMalta looks forward to the establishment of an\ninternational criminal court in Rome in 1998. Earlier this\nmonth, Malta was honoured to host an international\nconference on this initiative, which we strongly support.\nOur commitment to the setting up of such a court stems\nfrom the fact that this court would be a landmark\ndevelopment in the creation of a balanced and effective\nsystem aimed at ensuring that international crimes,\n5\n\n\nespecially mass violations of basic fundamental human\nrights, do not remain unpunished.\nWe strongly believe that no country can enjoy peace\nand prosperity in the true sense of the word unless\nfundamental human rights are respected and unless the\nState adopts a democratic system of government. Likewise,\nMalta is committed to an international policy that promotes\ndisarmament and supports all measures that militate against\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including\nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Malta fully\nsupports current efforts being undertaken to ban the\nproduction and use of anti-personnel landmines.\nEleven months to the day after a democratic change of\nGovernment in Malta, I must take this occasion to affirm\nour commitment to peace, to cooperation among all nations\nand to the pursuit of economic prosperity in a context of\nsocial justice. Placed as it is at the southern rim of Europe\nand at the geographic and strategic centre of the\nMediterranean, Malta stands by its commitment to the\nideals of European integration as well as to those of\nMediterranean unity. We believe that both these sets of\nideals are of vital importance, while being complementary\nand in the best interests of all Mediterranean and all\nEuropean peoples.\nIn following up on these ideals, we have proposed to\nthe Maltese nation a vision of a role for Malta that tangibly\naffirms the island's neutrality, in order to remove once and\nfor all any perception that Malta could be of any threat to\nany of its neighbours, north or south, west or east. Within\nthis context, our vision projects for Malta a role that,\nsubject to our clear limitations of size and resources,\nactively seeks to help build political, economic, social and\ncultural bridges between all our neighbours and other\npeoples of the Euro-Mediterranean space.\nIndeed, Malta's foreign policy has three important\nconstituents. It is a foreign policy based on cooperation\nwith neighbouring countries, free of alignments yet open\nand friendly to all; supported by an economic strategy\nbased on high-quality production and the provision of high-\nquality services; and endeavouring to pursue excellence and\nreliability in all that it seeks and undertakes.\nMalta's foreign policy priority is to maintain the best\nand most transparent relationship possible with all of our\nneighbours in the Euro-Mediterranean region and beyond.\nOur active neutrality foreign policy agenda aims to deepen\nour ties with the European Union in a meaningful manner\nwhile implementing an active Mediterranean policy to\nencourage regional cooperation and unity.\nIndeed, the Government of Malta aims to forge the\nclosest possible relations with the European Union by\nnegotiating ties in the form of a free trade area coupled\nwith a long-term political and security cooperation\nagreement, and cooperation in technical, economic,\nfinancial and social affairs.\nWe are equally committed to build upon our\nMediterranean identity and heritage by seeking to further\nspur intra-regional networks of cooperation. Malta\nstrongly believes that such cooperation, based on dialogue\nand mutual understanding, will contribute to a peaceful\nEuro-Mediterranean region where Malta is ready to act as\na catalyst to bring together the diverse civilizations of the\nMediterranean littoral.\nIt is in this spirit that Malta speaks of and promotes\nits active neutrality. We seek and promote peace and\nstability in a troubled and complex region. Malta presents\nno threat of any nature to anyone. At the same time,\nMalta extends to all of its neighbours the engagement and\ncommitment of an honest broker, an intermediary or\nsimply a venue for dialogue and discussion, in the search\nfor a solution to the many problems which beset them.\nThe Government of Malta is determined to be proactive\nin the quest for peace, and, in this context, we are\ndetermined to enhance the trust needed to act in the best\ninterests of all of our societies.\nMalta's neutrality is indeed validated by our\ngeostrategic position in the centre of the Mediterranean,\nwhere political uncertainties, socio-economic disparities\nand diverse cultural traditions all are contributing to an\narea that remains plagued by tension and instability. Far\nfrom being ideologically motivated, Malta's neutrality is\ntherefore a direct response to the very specific and unique\ngeopolitical factors that currently exist in the surrounding\nregion.\nThe Government of Malta believes that its strategy\nof active, site-specific neutrality enables it effectively to\npromote stability and understanding across the Euro-\nMediterranean region. Moreover, this status of neutrality\nwill continue to serve Malta's self-interests precisely\nbecause it will also serve the best interests of the\nEuropean Union member States and of our Mediterranean\nneighbours.\n6\n\n\nFor Malta, the Mediterranean has been and continues\nto be an integral element in our national development\nprogramme. Malta's active participation in international and\nregional forums is perhaps best described as an extension\nof its cooperative security philosophy.\nThe Mediterranean is a microcosm of today's\nmultipolar world. The region epitomizes many of the\nproblems associated with the North-South debate. These\ninclude maritime safety, maritime pollution, illegal\nmigration, terrorism and weapons proliferation. Malta is\nparticularly concerned at the ever-widening demographic\ngap and the ever-widening economic disparities in the\nMediterranean region between the affluent North and the\nunderdeveloped South. Poverty, combined with a lack of\njob opportunities and deteriorating living conditions, is\nfueling extremist tensions throughout the Mediterranean.\nMalta lies at the crossroads of the Mediterranean and\ntherefore believes it can act as a focal point in the effort\nneeded to attract the necessary attention and resources to\ntackle security challenges in the region. The Mediterranean\nis still dominated by areas of tension and conflict, which\nrequire our constant vigilance. Israeli-Palestinian relations,\nthe Cyprus question, the situation in the former Yugoslavia,\nthe sanctions against Libya, the situation in Algeria and\nother issues continue to create political tension, which is\nunfortunately escalating and therefore creating a sense of\nurgency in the finding of immediate and enduring solutions.\nMy Government thus believes that the perceived\nthreats to stability and therefore to security in the\nMediterranean are more of a political, environmental,\neconomic, social and humanitarian nature than of a military\none.\nAn important dimension of my Government's foreign\npolicy is directed towards the fight against drug-related\nmatters: illicit trafficking, money laundering and organized\ncrime. As a transit country, Malta could easily be open to\ninvolvement in the web woven by drug traffickers.\nNevertheless, Malta is more determined than ever to face\nup to this challenge, which is threatening the very fabric of\nour societies. Malta calls upon the international community\nfor support in our efforts to eradicate this social plague.\nThe Government of Malta believes that the creation of\na nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Mediterranean,\nestablished on the basis of arrangements unanimously\nagreed to by all the States of the region, would inevitably\ncontribute to peace and stability in the Mediterranean. This\nfact was acknowledged by the 1995 Review and Extension\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), when the\ncreation of such zones was encouraged.\nThe ultimate objective of Malta's Mediterranean\npolicy is the transformation of the region into a politically\nstable and an economically prosperous, demilitarized and\nnuclear-free zone. In this respect, Malta intends to make\nmaximum use of its contacts and available diplomatic\nrepresentation at the United Nations and in other\ninternational forums to promote its political objective of\nthe Mediterranean Sea as an area of peace and stability.\nThrough regular diplomatic interaction with other Member\nStates at the United Nations, as well as through a more\nactive interchange and collaboration with the Office of the\nSecretary-General, Malta intends to keep questions\nrelating to the Mediterranean high on the international\nagenda.\nEarlier this year Malta was host to the second Euro-\nMediterranean Conference, at which 27 States from\nEurope and the Mediterranean held their second\nministerial meeting in as many years to forge a Euro-\nMediterranean partnership, an event which in itself has\nfar-reaching significance. The Malta Conference reiterated\nthat the serious and deep-seated problems of our region\nneed to be tackled through a process of dialogue and\ncommon action, extending over a period of time and\ncovering a whole range of interrelated issues. It is Malta's\nconviction that this process has generated a political\ncommitment that will effectively contribute to the removal\nof the misperceptions and prejudice that still exist in the\nregion.\nIn its document on foreign policy published before\nMalta's last general elections, held in October 1996, the\nMalta Labour Party stated that for the United Nations to\nimprove its credibility and authority, it must improve its\nstructure, its administration and its competence. Above\nall, it is hoped that this world Organization will develop\na more efficient mechanism by which it could implement\nand execute its decisions more rapidly and effectively.\nThat is why Malta today supports the initiative of\nthe Secretary-General in presenting his report to the\nGeneral Assembly and congratulates him for what we\nconsider to be proposals of an unprecedented and\ncomprehensive nature.\nThis annual gathering provides the perfect setting for\nthe international community to come together and take\nstock of the previous 12 months and to identify, as\n7\n\n\nprecisely as possible, the challenges that lie ahead. We\nbelieve that three types of trans-national security challenges\nrequire our immediate attention. These are the war on\ndrugs, environmental degradation and the eradication of\npoverty. Unlike the immediately visible effects of war,\nthese three challenges cannot always be defined with\nsufficient clarity, although they have a potential for\ndestruction that is equivalent to that of war. Malta sees each\nof these areas as a far-reaching hazard which threatens the\nvery fabric of our economic, human and environmental\nhabitat, leading to instability and presenting real threats to\nour security.\nThe first challenge concerns the scourge of illicit drug\ntrafficking. Countless human lives are being ruined and\nwasted to satisfy the greed of a few. This is an\nunacceptable situation. Malta believes that the United\nNations system is well placed to coordinate this fight\nthrough appropriate and effective measures. We therefore\nwelcome the recommendation of the Secretary-General that\nthe functions of the Commission on Crime Prevention and\nCriminal Justice and the Commission on Narcotic Drugs be\nconsolidated into a single commission under arrangements\nthat will fully preserve the treaty-based functions entrusted\nto the latter.\nThe second challenge we are facing on the threshold\nof the twenty-first century is the reconciliation of\nenvironmental concerns with development needs. The\ncommon concerns and mutual interests of the international\ncommunity in promoting sustainable development, and at\nthe same time protecting our environment, cut across\nnational boundaries.\nThe problem of the environment is no less relevant to\nMediterranean countries. Sound management of Malta's\ncoastal and marine environments is of crucial importance\nfor an island State like Malta. The pressures exerted on the\nMediterranean environment as a consequence of its being\nan important maritime highway and a tourist destination are\nof particular concern. We believe that solutions to common\nenvironmental problems are best found through an\nintegrated regional approach.\nMy Government is firmly committed to a proactive\nrole in supporting regional initiatives in the Mediterranean\nfor the conservation and sustainable management of its\nnatural marine habitat. Malta has contributed actively to this\nprocess in the past, within the context of the Mediterranean\nAction Plan of the United Nations Environment Programme\n(UNEP) and the Barcelona Convention, the most recent\ninitiative being the setting up of the Mediterranean\nCommission for Sustainable Development. Malta intends\nto strengthen its participation in that Commission as well\nas to contribute to the fullest extent to the Mediterranean\nenvironmental programmes within the context of the\nEuro-Mediterranean process.\nMalta fully supports the efforts of the Organization\nin the promotion of environmental protection and the\nsustainable use of the world's natural resources to ensure\na more equitable distribution of wealth, and of an\ninternational trade regime free of restrictive or\ndiscriminatory practices. Together we must adopt an\neffective course of action for the coming years that will\ncreate the right balance between the need for human-\ncentred and socially just development and the need to\nensure the sustainability of our natural environment.\nIn the five years since the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development, not much,\nunfortunately, has been achieved. Last June's special\nsession made an in-depth appraisal of the progress\nachieved, defined future priorities and helped to raise the\nissue of sustainable development higher on the political\nagenda. We acknowledge that all of us \u2014 developed and\ndeveloping, rich and poor \u2014 share a common interest in\nthe pursuit and attainment of development, which must be\nsustained, equitable and integrated. In the words of the\nSecretary-General, development is\n\u201ca pillar of peace, a foundation of stability, and a\npowerful force for preventive diplomacy and\npreventive action\u201d. [Press release ECOSOC/5708]\nHowever, our third challenge is what I consider to\nbe the most complex. For years, the international\ncommunity has been trying to come to grips with the\nperennial problem faced by millions and millions of the\nworld's population: poverty. The ever-increasing\ndisparities between the haves and the have-nots have\nreached alarming proportions. The cold war and East-\nWest division have been superseded by a post-cold-war\nNorth-South divide. Though many had predicted this\ndevelopment and called for a concerted effort to deal with\nthe issue, little has been done to try to reverse this trend.\nPoverty still reigns supreme. Aggravated poverty, hunger\nand malnutrition are a paradox of our times. A fifth of the\nworld's population, or 1.3 billion human beings, live on\nincomes of below a dollar a day, and over 50 per cent of\nthe world's population have less than 5 per cent of total\nglobal income.\n8\n\n\nThe United Nations system is uniquely placed to deal\nwith such intolerable and acute problems. This Organization\nmust dedicate more attention and more time to coordinating\neffective action to alleviate the suffering and the degrading\nenvironment in which billions of citizens still live. It is time\nto act firmly and unequivocally to halt the aggravation of\nthis situation, which is fast becoming a latent source of\npolitical instability in the world.\nMalta believes that as we enter the new millennium\nour Organization must become more relevant; it must\nbecome more democratic. Today's setup reflects the past. In\na world where everyone is speaking about democracy, the\nright and the use of the veto become anachronistic. Malta\nis of the view that the use of the veto should be curtailed\nwith a view to its eventual elimination. Malta is not in\nfavour of extending the right of veto.\nOn the issue of the expansion of the Security Council,\nMalta believes that the Charter of the United Nations\nconsiders all States to be equal, and therefore it follows that\nthough we should have a more representative Security\nCouncil that reflects today's membership of the United\nNations, this can easily be achieved by increasing the\nnumber of non-permanent seats to the Council.\nMy Government has carefully examined the Secretary-\nGeneral's report on renewing the United Nations, document\nA/51/950. We agree on the need for more efficiency and\ngreater cost-effectiveness. At the same time, we feel that,\nas the Organization is a unique body, its tasks and\nsuccesses cannot be measured solely in monetary terms.\nHere, I would like to highlight two important areas of\nthe Secretary-General's report. In paragraph 108 it is stated\nthat when imposing sanctions the Security Council should\ngive more consideration\n\u201cto making these sanctions more effective in achieving\nthe goal of modifying the behaviour of those targeted,\nwhile limiting the collateral damages. There is also a\nneed to address the broader humanitarian and\neconomic effects of sanctions, as well as objective\ncriteria in their application and for their termination\u201d.\n[A/51/950]\nMalta finds itself in total agreement with this\nstatement. While supporting the use of fair sanctions,\nimposed appropriately and for the minimum period of time\npossible by the United Nations in its task of guaranteeing\ninternational peace, we feel that the decision to impose\nsanctions, especially those which will ultimately affect the\nwhole population of a given country, must be justified\nand that they should be imposed only as a last resort.\nIn another area referred to by the Secretary-General\nin his report, Malta would like to see the Secretariat's\nDepartment of Political Affairs dedicate more time and\nattention to the situation in the Mediterranean region. In\nthis context, consideration should be given to the\nestablishment of a Mediterranean desk within that\nDepartment. The creation of such a desk would facilitate\ncontacts and the Department would thus assume a more\ndirect role in the implementation of the relevant\nprovisions of resolutions adopted by the General\nAssembly on the strengthening of security and\ncooperation in the Mediterranean.\nMalta's contributions in the search for peace, security\nand cooperation for the benefit of mankind are well\nrecorded in the annals of the history of this Organization.\nMalta's initiatives on the law of the sea and climate\nchange and the recent initiative on the new role to be\ngiven to the Trusteeship Council are witness to the esteem\nand dedication which Malta attaches to its role in this\nOrganization.\nMalta is a small island State. Notwithstanding this,\nwe look upon the United Nations as the forum where\ncountries such as ours can express their views and where\nthe principle of the equality of States is enshrined and\nprotected. For us, this Organization has much significance\nand for this reason Malta intends to support the Secretary-\nGeneral in his quest for urgent reform.\nThe more efficient and relevant the United Nations\nbecomes, the better our interests are served. My\nGovernment will continue to give its wholehearted\nsupport to the United Nations, its agencies and its\nprogrammes. Many of the problems and challenges which\nwill face us in the third millennium can be overcome only\nthrough the concerted efforts of all Member States and\nthrough a better, more efficient and more effective United\nNations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe General Assembly has unanimously chosen you,\nMr. President, to guide the work of the fifty-second session.\nThis decision is a tribute to your outstanding personal\nqualities as a diplomat and a statesman, and at the same\ntime a tribute to your vast experience in international\nrelations. It also shows how much the international\ncommunity appreciates the role played by your country,\nUkraine, in the management of the major issues that\ncharacterize the evolution of world affairs. My country is\npleased to express to you its warmest congratulations and\nbest wishes for success in the execution of this noble\nmission.\nI would like to pay tribute to your predecessor,\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for the competence\nand open-mindedness with which he guided the work of the\nfifty-first session of our General Assembly. We extend to\nhim our deep gratitude.\nI would like to extend to the new Secretary-General\nof our Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan, my warmest\ncongratulations. The election of Mr. Kofi Annan last 17\nDecember was a tribute to the exceptional qualities of a\nman who has devoted his entire life to United Nations\ncauses. I wish him every success in the important mission\nentrusted to him. I am convinced that he will do honour\nto our continent, Africa, and successfully lead our\nOrganization into the next millennium.\nThe world\u2019s family of nations is once again meeting,\nas it does every year, to examine the current situation\nand, at the same time, to chart the course of progress for\nthe 12 months to come.\nWhile making its contribution to this exercise in\ncollective reflection, my country, Senegal, would like to\nassociate itself with all of those who find hope for a\nbetter future for humankind in our Organization, because\nit is based on peace and solidarity.\nIn fact, the United Nations remains an irreplaceable\ninstrument for the promotion of peace, security and\nprogress in the world, thanks to its universal character, to\nthe international culture and ethics that it expresses and\ninspires and to its positive accomplishments.\nTwo years ago, on the occasion of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, the international\ncommunity stressed here, unanimously, the irreplaceable\nnature of the framework for reflection, discussion,\nsynthesis and coordination of international life that the\n\n\nUnited Nations provides. In fact, the United Nations has\nbeen and remains a multidimensional symbol. The United\nNations is, first, an indispensable tool for safeguarding\nglobal peace and security. Further, the United Nations is\nabove all a source of new hope for many men and women\nwho suffer from exile, hunger, poverty or illness. And\nlastly, the United Nations is a tool for the promotion of\ndemocracy, human rights and development \u2014 in other\nwords, of justice among individuals, peoples, cultures and\ncivilizations.\nIn this light, we have made it one of our highest\npriorities to improve the capacities and the ability of the\nOrganization to better tackle the challenges of today\u2019s\nworld. We have done so while affirming that\n\u201cIn order to be able to respond effectively to the\nchallenges of the future and the expectations of the\nUnited Nations held by peoples around the world, it is\nessential that the United Nations itself be reformed\nand modernized.\u201d (Declaration on the Occasion of the\nFiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations, resolution\n50/6, para. 14)\nWe are pleased to note today that this conviction has\nbegun to be reflected in deeds. In fact, led by the\ndynamism of our Secretary-General, the United Nations has\nnow embarked on a vast reform effort, unprecedented in the\nhistory of this institution.\nMore specifically, on 16 July last Mr. Kofi Annan\nsubmitted to the General Assembly proposals for reforms\nthat will make the United Nations the cornerstone of an\ninternational system better adapted to the realities of the\ntwenty-first century.\nI would like to express all my gratitude to the\nSecretary-General and his collaborators for the\ncommendable efforts and energy that they have applied to\nthe development of proposals as bold as they are relevant.\nSenegal is now examining all these proposals in close\ncoordination with its fellow members of the United Nations,\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Non-\nAligned Movement. Senegal will do this while bearing in\nmind the political will expressed by all to undertake, within\nan appropriate time period, the necessary reforms,\nespecially in the fields of development, maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, disarmament and\npromotion of human rights, so that the Organization can\nbetter respond to the demands of our day and to the\naspirations of the peoples for which it was created.\nThe Head of State of Senegal, His Excellency\nMr. Abdou Diouf, has already provided the necessary\nguidelines and resources for this examination.\nIn this framework, the reform of the Security\nCouncil requires the special attention of all Member\nStates and, at the same time, a common will to be faithful\nto the ideal of peace that was inscribed in the Charter in\nSan Francisco in 1945.\nThe Working Group charged with examining this\nquestion has made considerable progress, even though\nconsensus has yet to be found on such fundamental issues\nas expansion, composition and use of the veto in the\nSecurity Council.\nNonetheless, we can and must underscore, welcome\nand support the many constructive and often\ncomplementary proposals that have been submitted and\nthat have visibly enriched the debates over the course of\nthe past year.\nWe now must stay on track and redouble our efforts\nin order to take advantage of the momentum thus\nestablished and to succeed ultimately in our objective of\nrestructuring the Security Council while modernizing it,\nmaking it more democratic and giving it greater\ncredibility and greater transparency \u2014 and thus greater\nlegitimacy.\nAfrica has a natural role to play in this reform, a\nrole that must be recognized given Africa\u2019s historical\nevolution and its destiny as a continent of the future in\nthe community of nations.\nThe reform of the United Nations system towards\ngreater coherence and greater dynamism is important, but\nequally urgent is the need for the maintenance and\npromotion of peace in the world.\nIt is true that significant progress has been made in\nthis area in recent years. Thus, the United Nations has\nsucceeded in substantially strengthening its capacity to\nplan, establish and conduct peacekeeping missions\nthroughout the world. My country, Senegal, is pleased to\nhave been able to contribute to this progress, through,\ninter alia, the posting of officers from its army to the\nSecretariat in New York so that the various aspects of\npeacekeeping operations could be better rationalized.\n2\n\n\nBut the desired improvement should not be limited to\nprocedural matters, even though we must recognize that\nthese matters are clearly important.\nAbove all, we must also re-examine the orientation of\nUnited Nations missions in all cases in which peace in the\nworld is threatened or breached.\nThe international community must, in particular, be\nmore realistic in the missions it confers upon the United\nNations Blue Helmets.\nIn this context, drawing lessons from operations such\nas that conducted in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we must\nrecognize something quite clear: by the rules of engagement\nestablished for them, the United Nations forces are not yet\nlegally equipped to restore peace in theatres of operation\nwhere peace has been broken.\nTherefore, it seems to us more appropriate to entrust\nsuch missions to the Members of the United Nations that\nagree to conduct them in the framework of coalitions\nplaced under the moral authority, but not the command, of\nour Organization. We would thus avoid giving mandates to\nUnited Nations soldiers without in turn giving them the\nlegal, human and material means that are essential to the\naccomplishment of their missions.\nThis choice is all the more desirable since multifaceted\nconflicts continue to afflict many regions of the world,\nstarting, unfortunately, with Africa, our own continent.\nThere significant progress has been made this year on\nthe road to restoring peace in a certain number of countries,\nin particular in Liberia, which \u2014 thanks to the\ndetermination of the countries of the Economic Community\nof West African States (ECOWAS) and the support of the\ninternational community \u2014 has just emerged from seven\nyears of fratricidal conflict. But we must recognize that in\nthe case of other crises, the path towards peace remains\nuncertain.\nThis applies in particular to Sierra Leone, where the\nsituation remains very disturbing in spite of the initiatives\nof the United Nations, of the OAU and most especially of\nECOWAS to restore legitimacy in that country.\nIn the Congo (Brazzaville), another of our brother\ncountries, the world witnessed a sudden deterioration of the\npolitical situation in the military confrontation that began on\n5 June 1997. Here again it must be recalled that the\ncombined efforts of the United Nations and the OAU and\nthe lucid and commendable actions of President El Hadj\nOmar Bongo, President of the Gabonese Republic and\nalso of the international mediation committee, have,\nunfortunately, not managed to find a political way out of\nthis grave internal crisis, the prolongation of which is a\nserious threat to peace in the subregion and the continent.\nElsewhere on the continent, in Angola and in\nSomalia, internal conflicts continue to elude resolution.\nFaced with all the dangers posed by all these\nconflicts, Africans have established the OAU Mechanism\nfor Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution in\nAfrica.\nNonetheless, it is clear that that pan-African\norganization does not alone possess the means to\nundertake the many and complex actions required by\npeacekeeping operations in Africa.\nMassive support from the international community\nis therefore particularly needed in this area.\nThis is why I would like once again to commend the\nconvening last 25 September, on the initiative of the\nPresident of the Security Council, of a special Council\nmeeting at the ministerial level devoted to the\npreservation of peace, security and stability in Africa. We\nwould also like to thank our colleague, Mrs. Madeleine\nAlbright, Secretary of State of the United States.\nThat meeting gave eloquent witness to the special\nimportance that the international community attaches to\nAfrican problems.\nHowever, I must emphasize that declarations of\nintent alone are not enough. We need concrete action.\nHence, Senegal attaches great importance to the report\nthat the Secretary-General is soon to submit to us and\nwhich is to contain specifically concrete recommendations\non the causes of conflict in Africa, on the means of\npreventing them and, where need be, the means of\nresolving them in full agreement with our partners in the\ninternational community.\nIn this context, we welcome the increasing assistance\nwe are beginning to receive from certain major countries\nof the northern hemisphere in the framework of the\nstrengthening of Africa\u2019s capacity to maintain peace and\nreact rapidly to crises. In this respect, we cannot but\nmention France, the United States of America and\nCanada, as well as other countries of the North. Along\n3\n\n\nthose same lines, the inauguration in Copenhagen on 2\nSeptember by the Secretary-General of a planning centre\nfor the new United Nations Stand-By Forces High-\nReadiness Brigade was an event of great importance for\nconflict prevention throughout the world.\nAlso in the framework of these concerns for Africa, I\nshould like to mention the ongoing conflict between the\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya on the one hand and the United\nStates of America and the United Kingdom on the other\nwith respect to the Lockerbie tragedy. We feel that the time\nis ripe for the parties concerned finally to successfully\nresolve this matter through dialogue and negotiation\nbecause \u2014 and this must be stressed once again \u2014 the\npeople of Libya are suffering greatly from the embargo to\nwhich that country is being subjected.\nWe welcome the significant progress made in the\nframework of efforts to achieve a definitive peace in the\nWestern Sahara under the auspices of the United Nations\nand under the guidance of Mr. James Baker, the Personal\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General.\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to be of\nconcern to peace-loving people. Recent developments in the\noccupied Palestinian territories, the expansion of existing\nIsraeli settlements or the construction of new ones, delays\nin negotiations \u2014 these all have had, to our great regret, a\nnegative impact on the peace process. We would mention\nalso the clear-cut acts of violence perpetrated against\ndefenceless civilians, such as the recent attacks in\nJerusalem. All of these acts must be condemned\nunreservedly because they do enormous damage to the\npeace efforts.\nIt is for all these reasons that we wish here to make a\npressing appeal to the co-sponsors of the peace process and\nto the entire international community so that the most\nappropriate initiatives can be taken in order to salvage the\npeace process. For today, more than any other region of the\nworld, the Middle East truly needs peace and security for\nits own development. This peace can be achieved only\nwithin a framework of mutual trust and the will to live\ntogether with respect for the rights and the dignity of all the\npeoples of the region.\nGlobal security also requires arms reduction and the\nelimination of certain categories of weapons. That is why,\nfor more than 50 years now, the United Nations has\nattempted to create a world free of all weapons of mass\ndestruction. In the pursuit of this objective, significant\nprogress has already been made. One year ago, we\nwelcomed in this very Hall and with deep satisfaction the\nconclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty.\nFrom that point on, the international community was\ninvolved in negotiations for a treaty for the elimination of\nanti-personnel landmines. Senegal, which is a member of\nthe Conference on Disarmament, continues to attach\nspecial importance to this question, whose settlement\nwould represent a major step forward towards a world\nthat would offer greater security for all. In this context,\nwe hope to see the Ottawa process, in which we are\nparticipants, succeed, by the end of this year, in the\nsigning of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel\nMines and on Their Destruction.\nEradicating poverty throughout the world has been\nand remains one of the fundamental objectives of the\nUnited Nations. By proclaiming in the Charter their\ndetermination to establish better standards of living in\nconditions of broader freedom, the founding fathers\nwanted to make of the United Nations an instrument that\nwould fight for the social progress of all humankind.\nBut at the present time, planet Earth is threatened by\nglobal challenges that know no boundaries and that spare\nno peoples. The world\u2019s problems \u2014 poverty, exclusion,\nterrorism, organized crime and drug-trafficking \u2014 have\nbecome globalized far earlier than the economy has. That\nis why, regardless of the way in which we approach the\nfuture, the problems that exist at century\u2019s end cannot be\nresolved except through concerted and integrated action\nthat can manage harmoniously all of the upheaval that is\naccompanying this changing period of history.\nIt is in this context that Senegal welcomes the\nsuccessful conclusion of negotiations on the elaboration\nof an Agenda for Development. The consensus achieved\nin that Agenda, which draws its substance from earlier\ncommitments in the various plans of action of recent\ninternational conferences, gives evidence of our shared\nfaith in the virtues of a new global partnership for\ndevelopment based on the imperative of interdependence\nand on mutual benefit. Thus the conceptual framework\nhas been set and accepted by all, and it remains for us to\nmove towards action through a mobilization of resources\ncommensurate with the generous intentions formulated in\nthe Agenda for Development.\nAlong these lines, the settlement of the debt crisis,\njust remuneration for commodities, the lifting of trade\n4\n\n\nbarriers and an increase in official development assistance\nare indispensable prerequisites if we are to build a world\nthat is more welcoming to everyone, so that our global\nvillage can be strengthened, in a spirit of solidarity, in a\nlasting way.\nIn this context, the fight against poverty is of clear\npriority, because it is unacceptable, in this era of space\ntechnology and the Internet, that millions of men and\nwomen the world over, and especially in the southern\nhemisphere, still do not have the minimal conditions for a\ndecent life. They lack water, electricity, medicine, food \u2014\nin a word, they lack security and well-being. The\naspirations of peoples to a better life is an eternal quest that\nwe cannot neglect, as it is true that human beings must\nremain at the very beginning and end of development.\nIn this quest for lasting solutions to the challenges of\nunderdevelopment, my country took the initiative, at the\nthirty-third Summit of the OAU, held in Harare in June, to\nsuggest two resolutions through which the Heads of State\nand Government of Africa unanimously renewed their\nsupport for the United Nations system in general and for\nthe action taken by Africa in particular to raise the standard\nof living of African peoples. But this need for solidarity\nshould not cause us to forget that any effort towards\nsustainable development is, above all, the national\nresponsibility of States. It requires the definition and\neffective application of sound macroeconomic policies\nbased on transparency, the rule of law, the practice of\ndemocracy, respect for human rights, social justice and the\nparticipation of all in the national development effort: in\nother words, it is based on what we today call good\ngovernance.\nAs my country sees it, this choice, which must be\nsupplemented by solidarity at the global level, is the most\ncertain course towards the shared ideal assigned to us by\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\nBy enshrining in our Charter their attachment to\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, the\nfounding fathers of the United Nations inspired millions of\nmen and women to take what His Holiness Pope John Paul\nII called two years ago \u201cthe risk of freedom\u201d. Their\ncommendable struggle means that today, respect for these\nrights and these freedoms is universally considered to be an\nessential component of any undertaking whose goal is the\nprogress and well-being of the individual.\nMy country, Senegal, which attaches profound\nimportance to the dignity and value of the human being,\nwould like here to reiterate its commitment to continue to\nwork alongside those many who are struggling to obtain\nor regain their right to freedom, justice and peace. This\nsolidarity applies to our brothers and sisters in Palestine,\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Libya, Afghanistan, Somalia, the\nGreat Lakes region and elsewhere, who aspire only to\npeace in order to build their own future.\nI would like, in this framework, to commend the\nappointment of Mrs. Mary Robinson to the post of United\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights. We\nassure her of our support and wish her every success in\nher noble mission.\nThe universal nature of the United Nations is a\nreality that must be consolidated and strengthened. In this\ncontext, we support without reservation the request of the\nRepublic of China to join again the community of nations\nand be admitted to our Organization and its specialized\nagencies. Acceding to this request would be a significant\ncontribution to the consolidation of the ideal of\nuniversality of the United Nations and do justice to the\nesteemed people of the Republic of China. Its economic\nand social development, commitment to democratic values\nand international behaviour have given irrefutable proof\nof its faith in the noble objectives of the United Nations\nCharter and of its capacity to assume the responsibilities\nof all Member States.\nWhen the Berlin wall crumbled in 1989, great hope\nwas aroused in the citizens of the world. Hope was born\nof rapid movement towards a new international order\nwhich would bring with it peace and justice as well as\nsolidarity and progress. In this new international order,\nthe Republic of China has a place, a place recognized by\ninternational law and the demands of a rapidly developing\nworld.\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that the\ninternational community must do everything in its power\nto have hope triumph over the dangers menacing\nhumankind. The human race\u2019s God-given intelligence\nprovides the possibilities and resources to achieve this\nend. We have no choice but to help the United Nations\nadapt to the new world and play its proper role as a\ncentre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the\nattainment of common ends. This is all the more essential\nsince the great challenges to our future can only be met\nin a global framework of solidarity. The only solution \u2014\nwhether in the struggle against terrorism, drug- trafficking\nand organized crime; in the protection of our environment\nand our collective health; or in the promotion of security\n5\n\n\nthrough disarmament or the reduction of poverty \u2014 is a\nconcerted and united global effort.\nTogether, we have already begun this effort, and my\ncountry urges the international community to continue it\nsteadfastly. Senegal makes this appeal convinced that, with\nthe intellectual and material resources available to\nhumankind today, there is no challenge that cannot be met.\nAll we need is the will.\nWe can do it. We must do it. Let us do it together, as\nbrothers and sisters belonging to one family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI recall two years ago, when,\non the occasion of the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary\nof the founding of the United Nations, this podium was the\nfocus of attention. There was much enthusiasm and hope as\nleaders looked back on the past 50 years and looked\nforward to the next 50 and the coming of the new\nmillennium. I had the honour to be among world leaders\nwho shared the privilege of participating in that historic\noccasion. It was then that we as leaders made a number of\npledges and committed ourselves to effecting necessary and\nappropriate changes to reshape and reform the United\nNations. We pledged never to repeat the mistakes of the\npast and to work for a better world through an improved\nand more dynamic United Nations.\nI take this opportunity to congratulate you,\nMr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of the\nfifty-second session and to thank Ambassador Razali Ismail\nfor his work in guiding the fifty-first session. It is with\nprofound pleasure and a sincere sense of hope and\nexpectation that I welcome and congratulate our new\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan. I assure him that he\nhas the full confidence and support of the Commonwealth\nof Dominica in his endeavours.\nNotwithstanding the leadership changes, if we are to\nachieve our ultimate goal of a better world for all, much\nmore must happen. The reform of the United Nations,\nwhich has been the subject of such intense debate for so\nlong now, must become a reality. We have noted and\ntaken seriously your commitment, Mr. President, to\nencourage action-oriented discussions on measures and\nproposals that encompass the reform of the United\nNations system. It is our wish that the discussion, as vital\na part of the process as it is, will be as short-lived as\npossible and that the implementation of reforms which we\nall want to see will very soon be effected.\nThe people of this world are demanding reform. The\nOrganization itself needs the reform. Let us do it now.\nThe numbers, geographic representation and decision-\nmaking process of the principal organs of the United\nNations must urgently reflect the realities of the new\nmillennium.\nMembership in the United Nations is based on the\nsovereign equality of its Members. Whether we are small\nor whether we are big, we are worthy of respect. And we\nall have an obligation to work towards maintaining\ninternational peace and security; achieving international\ncooperation in solving economic, social, cultural or\nhumanitarian problems; and encouraging respect for\nhuman rights and for fundamental freedoms.\nWe do not expect to be in an Organization where the\nrule is the law of the jungle; that is, the survival of the\nfittest. Rules and regulations of any organization which\ncan be interpreted and implemented in a manner which\nthreatens the survival and the very existence of its\nmembers are undesirable.\nMost of us are members of the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO), and I wish to bring it to the\nattention of the General Assembly and of all\nrepresentatives that recent decisions taken in the WTO at\nthe request of some Members of this very United Nations\nare threatening to destroy the livelihood of smaller\nnations. The Commonwealth of Dominica, my country,\nand other countries of the Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM) are threatened by this action. Our main\nmeans of livelihood \u2014 bananas \u2014 has been placed on the\nshakiest of grounds by this decision. Such uncertainty\nbrings about instability and can threaten peace.\nWhile the General Assembly has no enforcement\nauthority, its resolutions and recommendations to Member\nStates carry the political and moral force of majority\napproval. I appeal then to Member States to use whatever\nis in their power to persuade the complainants against the\n5\n\n\nEuropean banana marketing regime to consider the\nconsequences of their action and to think again.\nCliches like \u201cdesperate times call for desperate\nmeasures\u201d and \u201ca hungry man is an angry man\u201d may sound\nbanal, but they cannot be ignored. Peace in our region and\npeace in the world depend much on the humanitarian\ndispensation of justice. The action which has been taken\nagainst us in the WTO is not justice.\nThe raison d\u2019\u00eatre for the establishment of the United\nNations was to maintain peace and security. You,\nMr. President, in your address to this body recognized that\npeace and security are threatened by international terrorism.\nMay I draw to your attention that peace and security can\nalso be threatened by economic terrorism. Our region is\nnow threatened by economic terrorism, and our\nOrganization \u2014 the United Nations \u2014 has a responsibility\nand a duty to ensure that no form of terrorism succeeds in\nundermining our peace and security.\nThis matter is so serious that I urge the Secretary-\nGeneral to pay a visit to the now tranquil and peaceful\nCaribbean region, starting in the Windward Islands, to get\na sense of the situation for himself. For there is a flame\nignited in that area which has the potential to transform\nitself into a conflagration of a magnitude capable of\nengulfing the entire hemisphere.\nIn May of this year in Bridgetown, Barbados,\nCARICOM and the United States entered into a Partnership\nfor Prosperity and Security in the Caribbean. Our ability to\nmeet our obligations for implementation of the Plan of\nAction will be seriously compromised by this decision of\nthe WTO which seeks to deny us the opportunity to earn\nour living.\nOur Caribbean region is often described as paradise,\nbut sometimes there can be trouble in paradise. Our region\nis prone to natural disasters. Hurricanes, earthquakes and\nfloods are not uncommon, and the world knows of the slow\ndestruction of the island of Montserrat by the volcanic\neruptions which have been going on now for over two\nyears. Member States of CARICOM have come to the help\nof this small territory, however there continues to be a great\nneed for humanitarian assistance, and we look to the\nMembers of the United Nations for their meaningful\ncontribution to rebuilding the Emerald Isle.\nMan-made threats also plague our region, one such\nbeing the trans-shipment of hazardous waste through the\nCaribbean Sea. The indiscriminate pollution of the sea, the\ndestruction of marine life by the discharge of waste into\nthe waterway by ocean liners, and the trans-shipment of\nillegal drugs and arms all pose serious threats to the\norderly development of the region. There is a need to\nestablish a regime under the auspices of the United\nNations to stem such practices.\nWe cannot help but lament that after 50 years and\nmore our world has not yet found that peace for which\nthis body was instituted. In the past years we have seen\nthe struggles in the former Yugoslavia and in Central\nAfrica. We have witnessed the scourge of ethnic\ncleansing and killings. And the Middle East remains\nunsettled. Unrest in any part of the world affects us all.\nIt is therefore our responsibility to work towards that total\npeace.\nWe congratulate the 100 nations which have signed\nthe Treaty banning the production and dissemination of\nlandmines. Such weapons of destruction do not deserve to\nexist in a civilized world. We trust that nations which are\nstill hesitating will soon come around and sign \u2014 and\neventually ratify \u2014 the Treaty.\nFor there to be peace we must acknowledge the right\nof peoples and nations to exist, regardless of colour, class,\nrace, creed, political belief or model of government. This\ndecade was declared the International Decade of the\nWorld\u2019s Indigenous People. We are happy to report that\nin the Commonwealth of Dominica the first peoples of\nthe Caribbean, the Caribs, coexist peacefully with the rest\nof the population. It is our intention to work diligently\nwith the Secretary-General so that before this decade is\nover there will be some tangible and positive impact on\nthe lives of our own indigenous people which would give\nmeaning to the noble intentions of this body in making\nthis declaration.\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica as a member of\nCARICOM, the Organization of American States (OAS)\nand the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), is\nheartened by the spread of democracy throughout the\nhemisphere. We intend to play our part to ensure that this\nmovement is not transient, but, rather, reflects a deep-\nrooted conviction of our people that this is indispensable\nfor development and prosperity.\nWe respect the right of all countries to chose their\nown model of government, while at the same time we\nurge all Members of the Organization to practice or\ncontinue to practice the democratic process and to provide\n6\n\n\nfor their people full opportunity to enjoy all the benefits of\na democratic society.\nIt is against this background that the Government and\npeople of the Commonwealth of Dominica call again on\nthis world body not to continually close its ears to the pleas\nof the Republic of China for international recognition. It\nmust be remembered that the Republic of China is a\nfounding Member of this Organization and has been a\nMember for the greater part of its existence. The Republic\nof China on Taiwan is a politically democratic and\neconomically dynamic society with a directly elected\nGovernment and Parliament. Dominica therefore urges\nMember States not to continue to ignore or block the\nefforts being made to admit the Republic of China to\nmembership of this and other international bodies.\nPeace in this world also requires that the hungry be\nfed, the homeless sheltered, the ignorant educated, all\npeople enjoy good health, and our patrimony \u2014 the\nEarth \u2014 kept in a condition that we all can enjoy. We\napplaud and encourage the efforts of international\norganizations \u2014 including United Nations specialized\nagencies, which work to satisfy these needs and aspirations.\nThe effective functioning of this Organization requires\nproper management of its resources, both human and\nfinancial. We encourage the Secretary-General in his efforts\nin this regard, and we call upon all members to do their\nbest to provide the necessary financial support to the limits\nof their ability. I take this opportunity to congratulate\nMr. Ted Turner on his generous donation to the\nOrganization and, like him, call upon others to do likewise.\nI am convinced that the Secretary-General will use this gift\nmost wisely and judiciously, knowing that proper utilization\nof these funds will dispose others to come forward.\nEvery country, even the most developed ones, has its\nneeds. We in Dominica, a developing country, have many.\nGlobalization and trade liberalization, combined with the\nimpact of natural disasters, have increased the urgency for\ndiversifying our economy. In this regard, attention is being\npaid to our human resource capacity, to take advantage of\nthe revolution in technology and communication.\nA major thrust in the process of diversification is\ntourism, but tourism with a difference: ecotourism. Earlier\nI mentioned the need to preserve and conserve the Earth for\nthe enjoyment of all. My country Dominica has much to\noffer to visitors who want to enjoy nature, and we are\nworking hard to make ourselves the ecotourism destination\nof the Caribbean. Some of those listening to me may have\nvisited Dominica and know how difficult it is to enter\nthere. We are taking steps to make it easier to visit my\ncountry by the construction of a 24-hour landing facility\nfor long-range aircraft. We trust that our approach to\nfriendly nations and institutions for assistance in this\nregard will receive favourable consideration.\nThe beginning of the new millennium is close at\nhand. Two years ago we all pledged to redouble our\nefforts to work towards fulfilling the obligations we\nassumed when we became Members of this great\nOrganization. Let none of us waver in our resolve. The\nkey to it all lies in our working together as Members of\nthe United Nations. Let us join hands and wills to build\nthis better world. History will judge us harshly if we do\nnot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThere is an overwhelming air\nof expectancy across the world as we gather at this fifty-\nsecond session of the General Assembly. It is hoped that\nthe events of this session over the next few weeks will\npresent a new vision for our Organization. The success of\nthis session will depend upon Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, the\nForeign Minister of Ukraine and current President of this\nAssembly. His reputation for excellence and hard work\nassures us all that under his presidency, the affairs of this\nsession will be well ordered.\nMay I therefore take this opportunity, on behalf of\nmy Head of State, General Sani Abacha, and the\nGovernment and the people of Nigeria, to extend to him\nour congratulations on his election. Let me also avail\nmyself of this opportunity to extend to his predecessor,\nAmbassador Razali of Malaysia, our praises and high\nesteem for the purposeful and dynamic leadership he gave\nto the General Assembly during the past year.\nMy delegation notes with satisfaction the excellent\nmanner in which our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nhas settled down to his onerous tasks and conducted the\naffairs of our Organization since he took office. He has\ndemonstrated through his reform proposals his capacity to\nlead the United Nations into the twenty-first century. We\nwill continue to extend to him our fullest cooperation and\nsupport.\nAs we gather here to contemplate the present state\nof our world, it is tempting to be optimistic that the\nUnited Nations will provide a solution to the problems of\nnations. The truth however, is that all around the world\nlies evidence of the Organization\u2019s unfinished tasks, and\neven of some of its failures to meet mankind\u2019s hopes and\naspirations. Nonetheless, the fact that Member States\ncontinue to participate in the annual sessions of the\nGeneral Assembly signifies that the search for peace and\nthe pursuit of development are indeed ongoing processes.\nThere still subsists an abiding faith in the United Nations\nand the willingness on the part of all of us to continue to\nstrive for a better and more peaceful world.\nThat is why many nations have come here from time\nto time seeking understanding for their individual travails,\nbelieving passionately that here they would find\naccommodation and support. Many of them have returned\nhome disappointed, confounded by the realities of today\u2019s\nworld, as they come to terms with the awesome power\nwielded by the strong against the weak. We must remain\nmindful that international relations represent a complex\nmix of national circumstances and the demands and\ndictates of a changing external environment. International\nrelations must be based on a perceived goal of the\ncommon good, on mutual respect for sovereignty and on\naccommodation and consideration for national\ncircumstances and sensitivities. The United Nations must\ntherefore continue to serve as the bulwark against the\nimposition of the will of the strong on that of the weak.\n23\n\n\nNo nation ever addresses this body without a point of\nview peculiarly its own. We all come here with our\nhistories, our cultures and our traditions, which give\nmeaning and substance to the values we seek to impart to\nthis Organization. In the case of my country, Nigeria, we\nhave the added burden of manifest destiny. While we did\nnot choose our destiny, we welcome its concomitant\nobligations and opportunities. For it is destiny, not national\nambition, that motivates us in the discharge of our\nresponsibilities.\nIn this regard, we see in the predicament of each\ntroubled African State a mirror image of ourselves and a\ncall to duty to render assistance in the best tradition of\nAfrican brotherhood. Our exertions on behalf of regional\nand subregional peace and security arise from the\ncircumstances of our history as the largest black nation on\nearth and the fortunate circumstances of our bountiful\nendowment. It is our destiny that we are home to one of\nevery four Africans and one of every five blacks on earth.\nHow could we be indifferent to the plight of the black race?\nIt is our unshakeable destiny to champion the promotion\nand defence of the rights of all black people in Africa and\nin the diaspora. So, let no one imagine that we have only\njust embraced our peacekeeping role, because, as is well\nknown, we nurse no expansionist or hegemonistic interests.\nWe simply cannot be indifferent to the plight of our\nbrothers in other African States when their lives are\nimperilled.\nSince our admission to the United Nations on 7\nOctober 1960, we have given a firm indication of our\ncountry\u2019s determination to chart an independent course in\nworld affairs and also to resolutely defend the interests of\nAfrica. When, for example, an atomic device was detonated\nin the Sahara in 1960, Nigeria did not hesitate to express its\ndisapproval by breaking diplomatic relations with the\ncountry concerned. Furthermore, we are proud to have been\npart of the effort that brought about the formation of the\nOrganization of African Unity in 1963. We have since\nspared no effort to ensure the survival of that continental\nOrganization. We were also in the vanguard of the struggle\nfor the total liberation of Africa from colonial domination\nand of the campaign to eradicate apartheid in South Africa.\nWe regarded the apartheid system as an affront to the\ndignity of the black race.\nSimilarly, our contributions to United Nations\npeacekeeping operations span nearly three and a half\ndecades. Starting with the Congo in 1960, we have\ncommitted in excess of a quarter of a million troops to\nUnited Nations peacekeeping efforts. They have been\nvariously deployed to preserve peace and security in our\nown region and elsewhere around the globe including in\nBosnia, Cambodia and Lebanon.\nAt the inception of our Organization over half a\ncentury ago, its founding fathers captured, in the preamble\nto the Charter, a vision and an expectation of saving\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war. It was\nhoped that a global order would emerge in which\nhumanity would live at peace with itself and nations\nwould be able to cooperate in furtherance of peace and\nsecurity. In spite of the end of the cold war, which for\nmany years was perceived as the main obstacle to the\nrealization of United Nations goals, our world is still\nlargely unsafe, insecure and unstable.\nThe threat of nuclear war still truly exists. This\nmakes it imperative that the total elimination of nuclear\nweapons remains a priority item on the United Nations\nagenda. Over and above the threat posed by nuclear\nweapons, there has been a proliferation of inter-State and\nintra-State conflicts with attendant negative consequences\nfor global peace and security. In Central Europe, Asia and\nin our continent, Africa, these conflicts have devastated\nsocieties, resulting in millions of refugees and displaced\npersons. Africa is the area worst affected by these\nconflicts.\nThe United Nations has primary responsibility for\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\nHowever, it also recognizes the crucial role which\nregional and subregional organizations may play in the\nrealization of these objectives. It was in the light of this\nrecognition that the 16 countries of the West African\nsubregion launched, in 1990, the Economic Community\nof West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group\n(ECOMOG) to address the conflict in Liberia, which at\nthe time was rightly perceived as a threat not only to the\ncorporate existence of a Member State but, indeed, to\npeace and security in the entire subregion.\nAs a result of the firm resolve of the leaders of\nECOWAS and the determination of ECOMOG, coupled\nwith the enhanced material and logistic support received\nfrom friendly countries within and outside the subregion,\nthe disarmament of the warring factions was successfully\naccomplished as scheduled, on 31 January 1997. An\nenvironment of peace and security was then established\nthroughout Liberia. It then became possible for free and\nfair legislative and presidential elections to be held as\nscheduled, on 19 July 1997. On 2 August this year, His\nExcellency Mr. Charles Ghankay Taylor was installed as\n24\n\n\nPresident of Liberia. That event brought to an end a sad\nchapter in the history of Liberia. As Nigeria is currently\nchairing ECOWAS, we take this opportunity to convey to\nthe international community our profound appreciation for\nits support and assistance in bringing the Liberian conflict\nto a successful end.\nIt is ironic that as peace came to Liberia events in\nneighbouring Sierra Leone took a turn for the worse,\nfollowing the violent overthrow of the legitimate\nGovernment of President Tejan Kabbah by a section of that\ncountry\u2019s military on 25 May 1997. That action was\ncharacterized by massive looting and wanton destruction of\nlives and property. Vital national assets, including the\nCentral Bank, were looted and burnt down. Virtually all\nembassies and residences were either looted or vandalized\nby the ravaging group of coup plotters now in Freetown.\nAll diplomatic missions have since evacuated Sierra Leone.\nThese developments have been roundly condemned by\nthe OAU, the United Nations and the international\ncommunity. It is encouraging that no foreign Government\nor organization has to date given recognition or support to\nthe regime in Freetown. We urge that this position be\nmaintained.\nMeanwhile, ECOWAS has spared no effort in seeking\na peaceful resolution of the problem created in Sierra\nLeone. At Conakry, in June 1997, ECOWAS objectives\nwere defined to include: first, the early reinstatement of the\nlegitimate Government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah;\nsecondly, the return of peace and security; and, thirdly, the\nresolution of the issues of refugees and displaced persons.\nAccordingly, ECOWAS adopted a combination of three\nstrategies, namely dialogue and negotiations, sanctions and\nembargo, and the possible use of force. A mechanism to\nmonitor and implement the ECOWAS response to the\nsituation in Sierra Leone was established, comprising four\ncountries: Nigeria, Guinea, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana.\nDuring the last ECOWAS summit, held recently at Abuja,\nthe committee was expanded to five with the addition of\nLiberia, and was raised to the status of Heads of State.\nAt that same summit, additional measures were\nimposed on the illegal regime in order to strengthen the\nnegotiation process towards the peaceful resolution of the\ncrisis in Sierra Leone. ECOMOG was mandated to oversee\nthe implementation of these measures. In pursuing this goal\nof the peaceful resolution of the Sierra Leone crisis, we\nseek the support of the international community.\nAfrica has of late witnessed a series of inter-State\nconflicts which have in some cases led either to the\ndisintegration of some countries or to the total collapse of\ncentral government authority. Consequently, many well-\nmeaning members of the international community have\ntried to propose solutions for prevention and resolution of\nconflicts in Africa. Regrettably, these various initiatives\nhave not only been made outside the framework of the\nUnited Nations, but, more seriously, have tended to ignore\nthe existing framework and mechanisms within the\nAfrican continent. Yet it is obvious that the existing\nmechanisms at both the subregional and the continental\nlevels have demonstrated a proven capacity to resolve\nAfrican problems. ECOWAS, the Southern African\nDevelopment Community and the Intergovernmental\nAuthority on Development have all established a\nreputation as viable instruments for conflict resolution. Of\ncourse, most of the regional and subregional bodies\nrequire material and logistical support from the United\nNations as well as from individual members of the\ninternational community.\nNigeria believes that no initiative, however well\nintentioned, can succeed in resolving conflicts if it is not\ndiscussed and adopted within the framework of the OAU\nCentral Organ\u2019s Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\nManagement and Resolution. Accordingly, we recommend\nthat all current initiatives should be first channelled\nthrough the existing organs of the OAU.\nIt is our view that national sovereignty and the\nfundamental rights of the individual are not necessarily\nmutually exclusive, provided a proper balance is struck.\nIndeed, they can be mutually reinforcing. The problem\narises when, either deliberately or inadvertently, the\nprerogative of sovereignty is made subject to the absolute\nrights of the individual. This is a disservice both to the\ncause of freedom and to the true purpose of democracy.\nWhat is required in the interest both of the State and of\nthe enhancement of human rights is a proper recognition\nthat the right of the individual only begins at the point\nwhere the sovereign right of the State terminates. We\nmust resist the attempt in some quarters to use human\nrights as a ploy to engage in activities designed to\nundermine the sovereignty of some Member States in the\nUnited Nations family.\nTwo years ago, the present Administration in my\ncountry announced a programme of return to civil rule.\nSince then, commendable progress has been made in the\nimplementation of that programme. We are encouraged by\nthe successful outcome of the elections held so far and of\n25\n\n\nthe processes which we have undertaken to ensure a\nsuccessful transition. The rest of the programme is firmly\non course. We remain firmly confident that all the\nprocesses entailed in the transition programme will be\ncompleted on schedule, by 1 October 1998.\nWe have always given due recognition and\nappreciation to all friendly countries in the international\nsystem which have shown genuine concern for and\nunderstanding of the complexities of the Nigerian situation.\nAfter all, in 1960 we as a country willingly embraced the\nWestminster model of Government put in place by the\ndeparting colonial Power. That system took little or no\naccount of our traditional institutions, or indeed of our\ncustoms and cultures. Indeed, that system collapsed after\nsix years. In 1979, my country, being more adventurous,\nlooked far across the Atlantic Ocean and adopted the\npresidential system of government. However, the cost of\nrunning the system placed a huge burden on our country\u2019s\neconomy. Not surprisingly, that system too collapsed after\nfive years.\nToday, no one can blame us as a country for searching\nfor a system of government best suited for Nigeria, a\nsystem which takes into account the realities of our nation.\nYou may call it by whatever name, but the peace, stability,\ndevelopment and good governance of our people remains\nuppermost in our minds.\nAt 37, Nigeria is by all standards a relatively young\nnation. Even those countries that have been nations for\ncenturies and have inherited relatively stable societies are\nstill grappling with the complexities of nationhood and\nexperimenting with new formulas to cope with the\nexigencies of state. They were not present when their\nforefathers, who also fought bitter civil wars, struggled to\nhand them their present inheritance. They should therefore\nshow greater understanding for those of us engaged at this\ntime in the arduous task of forging new and stable societies\nfrom the ruins of colonialism.\nIf Nigeria appears concerned and indeed preoccupied\nwith the vital issues of peace and stability at home, in West\nAfrica and in Africa as a whole, it is because we are\nconvinced that the urgent demands of socio-economic\ndevelopment cannot be effectively tackled without peace\nand stability. Nigeria believes that peace and stability in\nAfrica will facilitate the channelling of our limited\nresources into the critical areas of political, social and\neconomic development. Consequently, since the end of our\ncivil war in 1970, we have embarked on a deliberate and\nsubstantial reduction of the Nigerian armed forces from a\nstrength of 500,000 in all ranks to the barely 100,000 that\nit is today. This has resulted in a corresponding reduction\nin military expenditure.\nSecurity considerations have sometimes compelled\ncountries to allocate a disproportionate share of their\nnational budgets to military expenditure. This has had the\neffect of reducing resources available for development.\nThe end of the cold war had raised hopes that substantial\nresources would be available in the form of a peace\ndividend for development. Unfortunately, the proliferation\nof regional conflicts and civil wars has led even the\nUnited Nations into allocating enormous resources for\npeacekeeping and conflict resolution, thus weakening its\ncapacity to fulfil its Charter obligations regarding social\nand economic development.\nSince its establishment 52 years ago, the United\nNations has served as an instrument for implementing a\nglobal agenda of a diverse, complex and pressing nature.\nAs has been evident from the debates that have taken\nplace in the General Assembly, no one today can deny the\nneed for and the urgency of reform.\nIn this regard, the Secretary-General has now made\na number of proposals, in addition to the ongoing efforts\nof the General Assembly on the subject of reform. My\ndelegation will actively participate in the consideration of\nthese proposals. In doing so, it is important to stress that\nthe outcome should encompass and take on board the\nviews and interests of all Member States.\nThe reforms of the United Nations, as proposed for\nthe Secretariat, the General Assembly and the specialized\nagencies, would be incomplete without a corresponding\nreform of the Security Council. A reform of the Council\nwould entail a restructuring and expansion of its\nmembership in both categories to take account of, among\nother things, the increased membership of our\nOrganization and the need to reflect the interests of all the\nconstituent regions.\nHappily, there is now broad agreement on the need\nfor the expansion of the membership of the Security\nCouncil in both categories. With almost a third of the\nmembership of the United Nations, Africa should have\nadequate representation in an expanded Security Council.\nAt the thirty-third summit of the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) held in Harare, Zimbabwe, last June,\nleaders of Africa reaffirmed the need for the region to\nhave two permanent seats with full veto powers. Nigeria\nconsiders this demand legitimate and well deserved.\n26\n\n\nWe stand here today as guardians of the heritage of\nour cherished Organization, even as we gaze at the future\nhorizon and the dawning of the new millennium. The vision\nwe harbour about the future of the United Nations is\ninevitably conditioned by the objective realities of the\npresent and the vigour with which we shall pursue the\nhopes and challenges of the new millennium.\nIt is within our means and our grasp to make the next\n50 years of the United Nations different, more exciting and\ngenerally more beneficial to the world at large. We can\nplead no alibi or extenuating circumstances should we fail\nto do so. For, unlike in San Francisco, when nearly two\nthirds of the present membership of the United Nations did\nnot participate in the creation of the bold new world, this\ntime around, we, all 185 nations at the United Nations, are\nthe world, and we are present at the reordering of the new\ninternational world order, as envisaged by the reform\nproposals of the United Nations and its organs. We should\ntake the opportunity to establish a revamped United\nNations of shared values and interests and to promote a\ngreater equality of States.\nStudents of history will bear testimony to the fact\nthat over the centuries, centres of power and influence\nhave shifted constantly from one part of the world to\nanother. The rise and fall of great empires has been a\nconstant phenomenon in human history. A gale wind of\nchange is now blowing across the globe. My country,\nNigeria, identifies with that change, which inevitably will\nresult in new centres of power and influence. It is not to\nbe imagined that any one continent will forever remain at\nthe periphery of the emerging new world order.\nThe millennium bell tolls for the nations of the\nworld as we await the dawning of the new age. We must\nnot shirk our responsibility for the regeneration of the\nUnited Nations. We are the world. Let us, from this\nhistoric Hall, reaffirm our faith in humankind. Let our\ndream come true for a new and vibrant inner vision that\nwill light our paths into the next century. Now is the\ntime; as the late Mother Teresa so gently reminded us,\n\u201cTomorrow has not yet come, yesterday is\nalready gone, and we have only today \u2014 let us\nbegin\u201d."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI congratulate you, Sir, on\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-second session. We have no doubt that your\ndiplomatic tact will steer the deliberations of this\nimportant session to a fruitful conclusion. My delegation\nwill lend you its full cooperation as you embark on the\ndifficult task ahead of you.\nLet me now pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Razali\nIsmail, your predecessor, who conducted our work during\nthe fifty-first session in a highly remarkable manner.\nOur tribute goes also to the former Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his distinguished\nleadership during his tenure. We are most grateful to him\nfor his tireless efforts in upholding the objectives of the\nOrganization.\nThe present Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nhails from a country that paved the road towards freedom\nand national independence in our part of the world. The\nfirst leader of his country, Mr. Kwame Nkrumah, was a\nmain catalyst in Africa\u2019s fight against colonial\ndomination. We have no doubt that all these attributes,\ntogether with his long-standing experience in the affairs\nof the United Nations, will contribute to the revitalization\nand democratization of the Organization. We congratulate\nhim on his election as Secretary-General, and we assure\nhim of our full support and cooperation.\nAt the fiftieth session of the General Assembly,\nworld leaders recaptured the vision of the founding\nfathers of our Organization. They did so in recognition of\nthe need to map out the institutional framework and\noperational parameters necessary to forge the\neffectiveness and continued relevance of the United\nNations in this ever-changing international arena. It is that\nmomentum that must be the driving force in our quest for\na reformed, revitalized and democratized United Nations.\nReform is a process. As long as the United Nations\nexists and the world continues to change, reform will be\nnecessary. Namibia therefore welcomes the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s report of 16 July 1997 on the reform of the\nUnited Nations. Let me place on record that Namibia\nwelcomes and supports reform which enhances the\ncapacity of the United Nations to effectively address the\ncritical development concerns of developing countries. In\n4\n\n\nthis context, let me emphasize that we attach utmost\nimportance to the operational activities of the United\nNations, for they complement our development efforts. Any\nreform in this area must strengthen their scope of\nexcellence. As the Secretary-General rightly puts it in his\nreport on the work of the Organization, \u201ctimes of\ntransformation can be times of confusion\u201d [A/52/1, para.\n20]. Managerial issues, therefore, must not and cannot be\nconfused with policy matters. We have long recognized that\nit is the General Assembly that is best equipped by the\nCharter to provide the necessary representative leadership.\nAnd this authority of the General Assembly my delegation\nshall seek to uphold.\nReform must not be retrogressive. It must continue to\nenhance and build on those gains we have made over the\nyears. And, therefore, savings to be realized from reform\nmeasures should be channelled \u2014 and rightly so \u2014 to\n\u201cthe Organization\u2019s highest priority, alleviating\npoverty and enhancing the prospects of developing\ncountries\u201d. [A/51/950, letter of transmittal]\nThe recent reform proposals by the Secretary-General are,\nin our view, part of an ongoing process. We must not resist\nchange; nor should we lose sight of the long-term\nimplications of our actions of today. We need to do it now,\nbut we must do it right.\nIn his address to the General Assembly, the current\nChairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\nPresident Robert Mugabe, reiterated the position of the\nOAU on the reform and democratization of the Security\nCouncil. Let me supplement his remarks by emphasizing\nthat Namibia is opposed to categories of permanent\nmembership of the Security Council. As we continue to\nseek ways and means to reform the Security Council, we\nmust not replace a speedy process with haste. Hence, the\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the Security\nCouncil should be the forum to search for and reach a\nconsensus on the matter.\nWhat besets the United Nations today is not merely an\nunmanageable structure. The Organization is subjected to\nfinancial limitations. Reform cannot supplant the Charter\nobligation of Member States to honour their financial\nobligations. Voluntary contributions, therefore, must not be\nseen as a means to pave the way towards resolving the\ncurrent financial crisis. My Government welcomes the idea\nof the establishment of a revolving credit fund, capitalized\nat a level of up to $1 billion through voluntary\ncontributions or through other appropriate means which\nmay be agreed. However, our Organization can execute\nits mandate to the fullest only when all Member States\nequip it to do so. We all must honour our assessed\ncontributions in line with international agreements, not in\nline with unilateral decisions.\nThe creation of a development account is viewed by\nmy Government as a good idea. However, all mandated\nprogrammes and activities should be implemented,\nincluding reimbursement to troop contributors for United\nNations peacekeeping operations. Furthermore, any\nreduction in posts must not compromise the effectiveness\nof the United Nations; more important, it must be carried\nout on the basis of geographical equity.\nSince 1996 we have witnessed positive progress in\nthe field of disarmament. A Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty (CTBT) has been concluded, and the\nChemical Weapons Convention has come into force. In\naddition, an agreement was reached by the parties to the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\nProduction and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological)\nand Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction to intensify\nefforts to negotiate verification provisions. However,\ndespite these developments, nuclear weapons and their\nproliferation continue to be a cause of concern to the\ninternational community. With the conclusion of the\nCTBT, it is still our hope that serious negotiations will\nbegin on the elimination of nuclear weapons.\nIn this connection, we call upon the nuclear-weapon\nStates to undertake, within the shortest possible time\nframe, to carry out effective nuclear disarmament\nmeasures. The total elimination of these weapons is the\nonly genuine guarantee for non-nuclear-weapon States\nagainst the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons.\nNamibia is among many countries still facing the\nbitter experience of the effects of landmines, which have\nclaimed and continue to claim human lives, and which\npose serious obstacles to the reconstruction and\ndevelopment process. Thus, we support the international\ncommunity\u2019s move towards a total ban on the use of anti-\npersonnel landmines and its continuous and tireless efforts\nacross the globe to clear minefields.\nIn this connection, we welcome the treaty recently\nconcluded in Oslo, Norway, to ban anti-personnel\nlandmines. Namibia is ready to sign the treaty in Ottawa.\nLet me express our profound gratitude and great\n5\n\n\nappreciation to those countries which are supporting\nNamibia\u2019s demining activities, thus enhancing our\ndevelopment prospects.\nOur world is merging into one globally encompassing\ndynamo of change, or so it is perceived, characterized by\ninter alia economic integration. Are developing countries to\nbecome victims or beneficiaries of this process? Suffice it\nto emphasize that globalization and liberalization are not\nends in themselves. They are means to greater efficiency,\nhigher growth and increased welfare. It is common\nknowledge that the much talked about benefits of\nglobalization and liberalization of the world economy\ncontinue to elude the majority of developing countries,\nparticularly those in Africa. At the same time, while the\ndebt burden continues to hamper many of the development\nefforts of our economies, official development assistance is\non the decline. Instead, new and innovative ideas for\ngenerating funds for globally agreed commitments and\npriorities are being brought into play, some of which are\nclearly shifting the overall burden of financing development\nto the developing countries which already have limited\nfinancial resources.\nNamibia is strongly of the view that if the twin\nprocess of globalization and liberalization of the world\neconomy is to benefit all countries, developing countries\nmust have free access to world markets without conditions.\nIt should not be a matter of the survival of the fittest. The\nlimitations of many of our countries to compete should be\ncompensated for by maintaining preferential treatment of\ndeveloping countries.\nMuch has been said about global development trends,\nof Africa\u2019s efforts to carve a larger slice of the world\neconomic cake, of our striving for economic empowerment\nand competitiveness, of our movement towards regional\nintegration and harmonization, and of our efforts to put in\nplace an enabling environment for trade, investment and\ncapital flows on a national and regional level.\nAt the same time, at the recent International Monetary\nFund Economic Forum it was said that over the decade\nspanning 1985 to 1995 developing countries increased their\nshare of world trade from 23 per cent to 29 per cent. They\nalso diversified their trade linkages in response to major\nchanges in trade and exchange regimes in the direction of\nmore outward-looking and open policies.\nWhile it is stated that developing countries have more\nthan doubled their real per capita income over the last 30\nyears, in reality only Asia has made relative progress; thus,\nthe gap in living standards between the advanced\neconomies and Africa continues to widen.\nThe distribution of gains from increases in both trade\nand foreign direct investment remains very skewed, with\na few getting the most. Africa still participates in world\ntrade with foreign direct investment flows of less than 4\nper cent.\nTherefore, as we continue to welcome the bright\nprojected global outlook, we should not lose sight of the\nwide divergence across nations and regions. Today, for\nmany African nations, global optimism coexists with local\npessimism. There is a need, then, to open and expand our\neconomies, to increase our competitiveness, to empower\nour people and to improve their well-being. To this end,\nthe international community should support Africa\u2019s need\nto effectively participate in multilateral trade discussions,\nwith a strengthened capacity for negotiations in such\nforums. Full implementation of the United Nations New\nAgenda for the Development of Africa is one effective\nway of addressing Africa\u2019s limited capacity to take\nadvantage of the global outlook.\nWe in the Southern African Development\nCommunity (SADC) have long recognized that the path\nto globalization is regional integration. To equalize power\nrelationships in the global setting, regional integration is\na strategic imperative. To this end, all the members of\nSADC have embarked upon a common strategy to\npromote the region as an attractive trading and investment\npartner, and they are actively working towards: deeper\neconomic cooperation and integration on the basis of\nbalance, equity and mutual respect, providing for cross-\nborder investment, trade and movement of production\nfactors and services; common economic, political and\nsocial value systems, enhancing entrepreneurship,\ncompetitiveness, democracy, good governance, rule of\nlaw, human rights and the eradication of poverty; and\nstrengthened regional solidarity, peace and security.\nWhile admittedly our region has not yet attracted a\nhigh share of foreign direct investment, political and\neconomic risks have greatly reduced over the past years,\nand increasing trade and investment flows are being\nwitnessed.\nNamibia, as a member of SADC, believes in the\nregion\u2019s potential, the opportunities for joint development\nand the power of collective advocacy. This will enhance\nefforts towards the ideals and objectives of the African\nEconomic Community. Together we can strengthen our\n6\n\n\nproductivity and competitiveness in the global economy. By\npooling our resources and skills, we can create a far greater\nmarket for all of us than any of our nations has.\nFor the accelerated development process of developing\ncountries to take place, a strong industrial base is\nindispensable. In this regard, we continue to underscore the\nrole of the United Nations Industrial Development\nOrganization (UNIDO), which is an agency with a clear,\nvital and indispensable mission. UNIDO has successfully\ncarried out its reform, and this should be recognized and\nsupported. At this juncture, let me express Namibia\u2019s great\nappreciation to the Government of the United Kingdom for\nits decision to rejoin UNIDO. We have no doubt that this\nexemplary decision will be rightly emulated by other\nMember States.\nThis year during the month of June major events were\nwitnessed here at the United Nations. The adoption of the\nAgenda for Development and the review and appraisal of\nthe implementation of Agenda 21 are cases in point. We\nview the outcome of these two events as complementary.\nNeither replaces the other. The commitments we made in\nRio remain valid and need full \u2014 not selective \u2014\nimplementation.\nThe United Nations has a major role to play in\npromoting international cooperation. It took the Ad Hoc\nOpen-ended Working Group of the General Assembly on an\nAgenda for Development four years to reach consensus.\nMobilization of resources for its implementation is of the\nutmost importance, for those who are to benefit from it\ncannot wait another four years. Development must be one\nof the centrepieces of United Nations activities. In this\ncontext, we welcome the proposal to appoint a Deputy\nSecretary-General. In our view the Deputy Secretary-\nGeneral should concentrate on United Nations development\nactivities.\nNamibia is one of those countries seriously affected by\ndesertification and drought. In a few days, the first\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention\nto Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing\nSerious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in\nAfrica, will take place in Rome. We underscore the utmost\nimportance of establishing an independent financial\nmechanism to make arrangements conducive to the\nimplementation of this Convention. To this end, we look\nforward with great expectation to the outcome of the first\nConference of the Parties.\nNamibia supports the establishment of an\ninternational criminal court, with its jurisdiction being\nlimited to \u201chard-core crimes\u201d: crimes of genocide, serious\nviolations of the laws and customs applicable in armed\nconflict and crimes against humanity. The principle of\ncomplementarity should be clearly spelled out in the\nstatute. The international criminal court must complement\nand not supplant national criminal jurisdictions. A balance\nbetween the international criminal court and the national\njurisdictions will therefore have to be struck in order to\nmake the international criminal court fully functional.\nWe are two years from the end of this century and\nthe beginning of a new millennium. We have the\nopportunity to reflect on how we have fared in elevating\nthe human race to greater heights. In this context, my\nGovernment would like to congratulate both Mrs. Mary\nRobinson, the new High Commissioner for Human\nRights, and Mr. Olara Otunnu, the Secretary-General\u2019s\nSpecial Representative to study the impact of armed\nconflict on children. Both of them have challenging\nresponsibilities to assist Member States in very important\nbut difficult tasks.\nIn 1998 we will commemorate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. The Government and people of Namibia have\nembraced the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\ninasmuch as our Constitution embodies those principles\nand values that we were denied for so long and that we\nwill cherish and pass on to new generations to come.\nFurthermore, 1998 will mark the fifth anniversary of the\nWorld Conference on Human Rights. This will be a time\nto reflect and to rededicate ourselves to our collective\nresponsibility to save successive generations from the\nscourge of massive and grave human rights violations.\nIt is also our responsibility to redouble our efforts\ntowards the implementation of the Declaration on the\nRight to Development as well as to pay equal attention to\nthe implementation of economic, social and cultural\nrights.\nNo country has been spared the onslaught of drug\ntrafficking and the alarming geographical spread of\norganized crime in its various forms. This undermines our\ndevelopment process and threatens human rights and\nfundamental freedoms, and thus causes regression in the\nquality of our lives. In this context, my Government\nsupports the convening of the special session of the\nGeneral Assembly on the question of drugs next year.\nThis will provide the international community with an\n7\n\n\nample opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to combat\nthis global problem.\nTime and again we have all affirmed the link between\npeace and development. In this context, we are pleased that\nthe United Nations has decided to discuss the concept of\nthe \u201cculture of peace\u201d during this session of the General\nAssembly. We support the current efforts before the United\nNations for a comprehensive strategy to be adopted towards\nthis end.\nMy delegation remains deeply perturbed by the\nsituation in Angola. In this regard, we feel strongly that the\nphasing out of a United Nations presence in Angola must\nhinge on the situation on the ground. The United Nations\nObserver Mission in Angola was established to keep the\npeace in that country. It should not break the fragile peace\nthrough premature withdrawal. In this respect, the\ncommitment of the parties to the full and unconditional\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol is paramount.\nUNITA must therefore rise above the present impasse to\ncontribute to a final and lasting solution to the problem in\nAngola.\nWe commend the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts in the\nRepublic of Congo, and we are keeping our hopes alive for\na speedy resolution to that problem.\nWe welcome the new Government in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, and we call upon the international\ncommunity to render all necessary assistance to the\nGovernment and people of that country as they embark on\nthe road to national reconciliation and reconstruction.\nAfter seven years of tragic civil war in Liberia, my\ndelegation hails the peace which has finally dawned in that\ncountry. It is our hope that it will be a lasting peace. We\nsalute the people of Liberia for their good sense. Peace\ncannot sustain itself. It is therefore incumbent upon the\ninternational community to support the Government and\npeople of Liberia in their national reconciliation and\nreconstruction efforts to keep and consolidate peace and\nstability.\nOur hearts bleed when we consider the situation that\nhas unfolded in Sierra Leone, which has been responsible\nfor the regression of the reconstruction efforts in that\ncountry. The Government of the Republic of Namibia\ncondemned the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Sierra Leone then and does\nso now. Namibia calls for the continued isolation of the\nmilitary regime in that country. We therefore welcome the\nappointment of the Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General.\nWe note with satisfaction the progress made during\nthe recent negotiations between the parties on Western\nSahara. We encourage them to continue to search for a\nfinal solution to that problem. We reiterate our call for\nthe early exercise by the Sahraoui people of their right to\nself-determination on the basis of a free, fair and\ntransparent referendum in Western Sahara, under the joint\nsupervision and control of the United Nations and the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU).\nWe reiterate the concern of the OAU about the\nconflict between Libya and the United States of America\nand the United Kingdom over the Lockerbie tragedy.\nWhile we regret the loss of life as a result of this tragedy,\nother innocent people continue to suffer as a result of the\nsubsequent sanctions imposed on Libya. We call for an\nurgent solution to this problem.\nThe Government of Namibia has reiterated on many\noccasions that the United States of America and the\nRepublic of Cuba should start to walk the distance of 90\nmiles towards reconciliation and peaceful coexistence. We\nhoped to see our aspirations come about. However, these\naspirations are being shattered by the new escalation in\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo against\nCuba through the application of the Helms-Burton Act.\nNotwithstanding this, we shall keep our hopes alive.\nThe construction of new settlements in the occupied\nterritories of Palestine is not conducive to peace in the\nMiddle East. We therefore call on the Government\nauthorities in Israel to desist from such acts. Peace in the\nMiddle East is in the interest of all parties concerned. We\ncall on the parties to resume negotiations.\nLet me conclude by stating the obvious: Peace is\ncheaper than war. Let us all unite our efforts to make the\nworld a haven of peace.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow\nme to express my felicitations to the President on his\nelection and express the confidence that, with his wisdom\nand diplomatic skill, he will ably guide the fifty-second\nGeneral Assembly towards tangible results. Let me also\nexpress my appreciation to his predecessor for his excellent\nwork.\nDue to lateness of the hour, I will present a brief\nversion of my statement. The complete text will be\ndistributed.\nAt the threshold of the third millennium and under the\ncircumstances of unfolding interplay among not one or two\nbut various powers in the shaping of new global decisions,\ninternational relations need a new doctrine, commensurate\nwith the evolving conditions and emerging needs. The main\nobjective of this doctrine is the gradual realization of a\nglobal civil society, a society where liberty and salvation\nharmoniously coincide to meet the spiritual and material\nneeds of humanity in an institutionalized manner, and\nwhere comprehensive, balanced and sustainable\ndevelopment lies at the foundation of universal\ncooperation and participation.\nThe doctrine of global civil society is predicated on\ntwo major principles, the first being the\ninstitutionalization of the rule of law in domestic and\ninternational relations. The international community today,\nlike its constituent Member States, simply cannot provide\na peaceful and prosperous life for people through\ncoercion, autocratic decisions and a cultural domination\nand hegemony. Therefore, the rule of law, as the very\nfoundation of order and the relations among individuals\nand States, should be institutionalized.\nThe second major principle is that of empowerment\nand participation. Similar to the process of participation\nat the national level \u2014 where all individuals, regardless\nof colour, race, opinion, wealth or social status have an\ninalienable right to determine their own destiny \u2014\ncountries and regions with differing cultures and resources\nshould enjoy the right and be empowered to participate at\nall stages of decision-making and policy implementation\nat the global scale.\nToday, North and South constitute two\ncomplementary domains in a single global arena.\nEquilibrium and stability of the future world order\ndepend, in large measure, on the South\u2019s contribution to\nthe shaping of the norms governing future international\nrelations.\nIn our view, we can move towards the gradual\nrealization of a global civil society through\ninstitutionalization of these two fundamental principles\nand by committing ourselves to pluralism, tolerance,\ndialogue among civilizations, promotion of human rights,\ncomprehensive, balanced and sustainable development,\njustice and equality of opportunities as the governing\nnorms in our interactions.\nThe political philosophy of the Islamic Republic of\nIran is in full accord with these fundamental foundations\nof the prospective global civil society. The domestic\nprogramme of the new administration is geared towards\nstrengthening the foundations of civil society.\nThe main features and priorities of the new\nadministration\u2019s foreign policy include the following: the\nexpansion of relations with all countries on the basis of\nmutual respect, common interest and non-interference in\nthe internal affairs of others; emphasis on the\n23\n\n\ninstitutionalization of international law as the foundation of\nglobal order and as the final arbiter among States; the\nestablishment and strengthening of mechanisms of mutual\nconfidence-building and security through regional\ncooperation and the negation of the presence and influence\nof foreign powers; the protection of all human rights and\nthe rejection of attempts at selective and discriminatory\nabuse of human rights as instruments of policy; emphasis\non the fundamental rights of oppressed individuals and\nnations, particularly the Palestinian people; the arresting of\nthe arms race at the regional and global levels, the\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction and the control\nof conventional weapons; the strengthening of the bonds of\namity and solidarity among Islamic and non-aligned\ncountries; an active presence and constructive participation\nin the United Nations and other international organizations,\nwith an effective contribution in international efforts on\nglobal issues such as arms control and disarmament,\ncomprehensive and sustainable development, human rights,\npeacekeeping and combating terrorism and illicit drugs, as\nwell as the reversal of unjust international arrangements;\nand, finally, defending the rights of Iranian citizens all over\nthe world.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has adopted concrete\nmeasures at the regional and international levels in pursuit\nof these principled policies, and it is fully prepared to\ncooperate with all countries towards achieving common\nobjectives in accordance with the principles of the United\nNations Charter.\nThe question of Palestine, which lies at the very heart\nof the Middle East crisis, represents the most vivid and\npersistent case of disregard for international law and the\nsystematic violation of fundamental human rights of\nindividuals and peoples. The Middle East crisis can be\nsolved only through the full realization of the rights of the\nPalestinian people, in particular their right to self-\ndetermination, the return of refugees and the liberation of\nall occupied territories, including Al-Quds al-Sharif,\nsouthern Lebanon and the Syrian Golan. The experience of\nthe past few years has made it abundantly clear that any\nscheme or proposal which fails to take into full account the\nrealities in the region or the infamous Israeli patterns of\nbehaviour is bound to fail.\nIt is indeed unfortunate that some outside powers\ndeliberately misconstrue or misrepresent Iran\u2019s frank, open\nand objective expos\u00e9 of the realities as support for terrorism\nand as opposition to peace and security in the region. I\nreiterate once again that the Islamic Republic of Iran also\nseeks peace and stability in the Middle East \u2014 a just and\nlasting peace that would receive regional consensus and\nthat would cure this chronic crisis once and for all.\nOur region has witnessed for nearly two decades the\ncrisis in Afghanistan. There is, undoubtedly, no military\nsolution to this tragedy; yet some warring factions have\nyet to realize this evident truth. Only through the\nestablishment of a ceasefire, the cessation of foreign\nintervention, negotiations between all Afghan groups and\nthe formation of a broad-based Government representing\nall Afghans can the crisis in Afghanistan find a lasting\nsolution. My Government is determined to continue its\nhumanitarian and peacemaking endeavours in Afghanistan\nin tandem with the United Nations Secretary-General and\nthe Secretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference. I must draw the attention of the international\ncommunity to the dire need for and the urgency of\nhumanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan.\nThe cold war generated a tendency in internal and\nexternal relations which required the existence of a real or\nimagined enemy. Escaping this state of mind and building\na new world based on cooperation and the rule of law\nrequires not only political will, but careful planning in\norder to foster confidence and to mitigate economic,\nsecurity and social concerns at national and regional\nlevels.\nConfidence-building at national, regional and\ninternational levels, as an essential strategy to transform\nhuman relations, will not succeed in the absence of\ntransparency in decision-making and the participation of\nall concerned. The antithesis of universal participation in\ndecision-making and law-based cooperation at the\ninternational level is unilateralism. This phenomenon finds\nits manifestations in various areas, including arms control,\ndevelopment, international trade, the environment and\ncodification of new human rights norms.\nThe first and most effective step towards building\nconfidence is the elimination of weapons of mass\ndestruction, the reduction of conventional weapons,\ntransparency in the field of armaments and the\nestablishment of security and cooperation schemes in\nvarious regions of the globe. This endeavour requires the\nfull and non-discriminatory implementation of existing\nundertakings in the area of disarmament and security and\nthe development of new rules to address universally\naccepted priorities, as well as security requirements of the\ninternational community and its members.\n24\n\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, on the basis of Islamic\nprinciples, considers weapons of mass destruction inhumane\nand illegitimate. Officials of the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) have repeatedly confirmed the fact\nthat Iran\u2019s nuclear activities are performed within the\nframework of the Agency\u2019s regulations and that they follow\npeaceful objectives. Despite these clear facts, some\nGovernments have embarked upon a barrage of false and\nbaseless accusations against Iran during the past few years.\nYet propaganda campaigns of public deception will\ncertainly not change regional realities on the ground. It is\nself-evident that the lack of security in the Middle East is\nrooted in Israel\u2019s militarism and its arsenal of weapons of\nmass destruction, which have thwarted all disarmament\ninitiatives and mechanisms in the region.\nFurthermore, the unabated race for the acquisition of\nconventional weapons exacerbates the atmosphere of\nanxiety and mistrust. The foreign policy of the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran is founded on peace, self-restraint,\nconfidence-building and the reduction and elimination of\ntension, particularly within our region. I wish to inform the\nAssembly frankly and sincerely that of all the countries of\nthe Middle East, Iran allocates the lowest percentage of its\nbudget to its military. In 1995 and 1996, only 3.3 per cent\nof our gross domestic product was spent on defence. We\ncontinue to be ready for any regionally acceptable\nunderstanding on further reductions in defence budgets such\nthat the security concerns of large and small countries alike\nare fully addressed.\nThe highest foreign policy priority of the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran is to make every effort to strengthen trust\nand confidence and to build peace in our immediate\nneighbourhood, which in cases such as Tajikistan has\nachieved encouraging results. In our region, the Economic\nCooperation Organization has also contributed to the\nexpansion and consolidation of relations among its member\nStates through the adoption of common positions and by\nplaying an active role in the field of economic and technical\ncooperation.\nIn the Persian Gulf area, only cooperation and\ncollective participation can bring about security and stability\nfor all countries in the region. Taking full advantage of\nhistorical affinities, cultural ties and religious bonds and\nsparing no effort to utilize in an efficient and coordinated\nmanner the human and natural potential and resources of\nthe region constitute the single best long-term guarantee of\nsecurity and tranquillity. Iran \u2014 as the biggest country in\nthe region, enjoying a historical depth of several millennia\ncombined with the richness of Islamic civilization \u2014 does\nnot need to engage in any arms build-up or competition.\nOur message to our neighbours is one of friendship and\nfraternity, and we shall warmly welcome any initiative to\nstrengthen the foundations of confidence and cooperation\nin the region.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, which in December\nwill be hosting the eighth Islamic summit, is of the view\nthat on the threshold of the twenty-first century, the\nprimary task of the summit will be to foster mutual\nconfidence and establish mechanisms for cooperation and\ncoordination in various fields among Islamic countries.\nThis will undoubtedly contribute to the further\nstrengthening of the foundations of lasting international\nsecurity and stability.\nTerrorism is the wicked result of widespread\nlawlessness and the violent obstruction of public\nparticipation, which in its various forms and\nmanifestations threatens human societies at the national,\nregional and international levels. The political exploitation\nof this international problem, through hurling unfounded\nallegations in order to advance certain ulterior motives or\ncover up deficiencies in domestic or external policy, is no\nless dangerous than terrorism itself. These two elements\ntogether diminish trust, stability and security at the\nregional and the international levels.\nResolution of this destructive problem requires a\ndetermined avoidance of sensationalism and demagoguery\non the one hand, and a concerted international attempt to\nfind practical measures to combat terrorism that are\nreasonable, objective and realistic on the other. More\nimportant, our collective success requires the non-\nselective, universal and law-based application of agreed\nmeasures by relevant international organizations.\nAs a country that has suffered immensely from the\ninhuman phenomenon of terrorism in the post-revolution\nyears, the Islamic Republic of Iran is prepared to take an\nactive part in any international effort to combat this\nproblem in a serious, comprehensive and principled\nmanner.\nThe resolution of complex international problems\nand the realization of post-cold-war opportunities require\nthe participation of all members of the international\ncommunity in the decision-making process, on the basis\nof the rules and principles of international law. The\nUnited Nations is the institutional embodiment of both\nuniversal participation and the rule of law on the global\nscale. It is the only universal organization which, with the\n25\n\n\nhelp of an efficient and capable system, can move towards\nfinding solutions to the problems of human society and\nresponding to post-cold-war challenges. The magnitude of\nthis task clearly points to the need to improve the efficiency\nof the Organization and to enhance its role by embarking\non the transformation and reform of the major bodies,\nprogrammes and modes of operation of the Organization.\nI should like to express appreciation for the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s efforts to reinvigorate the Organization, and to\nassure him of our earnest desire to cooperate with him in\nthe process of restructuring the United Nations into a more\nefficient, capable and reliable institution responsive to the\nneeds and views of all its Members. In our opinion, the\nextensive scope and implications of the measures envisaged\nin the Secretary-General\u2019s report of 16 July make it\nimperative for the General Assembly to establish working\ngroups to examine the report thoroughly and in detail so\nthat the views of all Member States are identified and\ntaken into account.\nThere is no doubt that the current composition of the\nSecurity Council is remote from the state of international\naffairs today and is not acceptable to the overwhelming\nmajority of the international community. In our opinion,\nany increase in the membership of the Security Council\nor reform of its working methods will have to take the\ntrue role and concerns of the developing countries into\naccount. Moreover, reform of the working methods of the\nSecurity Council should not be contingent upon resolution\nof the question of the increase in the membership of the\nCouncil; they are two distinct subjects and thus require\ntwo separate decisions.\nThe General Assembly is undoubtedly the highest\nand most representative organ of the United Nations,\nwhere all Members of the Organization enjoy an equal\nright to participate. This body, which comprises the entire\nmembership, certainly has the right \u2014 and indeed the\nresponsibility \u2014 to address each and every issue of global\nconcern, including in particular those relating to\ninternational peace and security.\nExpansion and broadening of the participatory base\nof the future global order on the basis of norms\nacceptable to all cultures and peoples is most conducive\nto building a better tomorrow, and to ensuring freedom,\nsecurity, stability and sustainable development at the\nnational, regional and international levels. The General\nAssembly, providing all Member States with the\nopportunity for full and equal participation in decision-\nmaking, is the most appropriate venue for dialogue,\nunderstanding and the adoption of coordinated\ninternational measures to build a better and a more\nequitable tomorrow.\nAs the new Government of the Islamic Republic of\nIran assumes its responsibilities, I reiterate the willingness\nand full preparedness of my Government to take a\nconstructive part in this collective endeavour through\npromoting dialogue, understanding, trust and solidarity."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am\nparticularly honoured to have the opportunity to address\nthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly of the\nUnited Nations on behalf of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nI would like, first, to extend my warm\ncongratulations to our respected friend and colleague, His\nExcellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, Minister of Foreign\nAffairs of Ukraine, on his accession to the presidency of\nthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly. Mr.\nUdovenko\u2019s rich experience and extensive knowledge of\nUnited Nations affairs are telling proof that this General\nAssembly session has outstanding leadership.\nThe destiny of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been\nclosely linked to the United Nations since early 1992,\nwhen my country became a Member State. Bosnia and\nHerzegovina\u2019s struggle to survive as a sovereign state\nwithin its internationally recognized borders lasted four\nyears. We believe we won the major battle in preserving\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country, but\nwe know we still have a long way to go.\nThe role of the international community and the\ninvolvement of the United Nations in the Bosnia and\nHerzegovina crisis were overwhelming. Month after\nmonth, the United Nations, led by the Security Council,\nstood firmly behind internationally accepted norms and\nprinciples in order to make possible a negotiated and\npeaceful solution in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nUnfortunately \u2014 for subjective and objective\nreasons, most of which are well known to all of us \u2014 in\nspite of all the resolutions and decisions the tragedy in\nBosnia and Herzegovina continued to take what was\nprobably the heaviest toll of any modern conflict.\nThe events also proved that the United Nations was\nnot ready to deal effectively with what was certainly one\nof the most complex crisis in our times. The conflict in\nBosnia and Herzegovina was, and still is, an important\n22\n\n\ncase study which should be carefully analysed in the\ncontext of the United Nations involvement mandate and its\nrole in crisis situations.\nBut we respect the help and tireless efforts of the\nmembers of the United Nations mission in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina to help the civilian population survive. I would\nlike to use this opportunity to say that we remember and\ngreatly admire the members of the international community\nwho lost their lives in the peace mission in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. We were deeply saddened by the recent tragic\naccident which took the lives of 12 brave peace promoters,\namong them the Deputy to the High Representative,\nAmbassador Gerd Wagner.\nWe cannot forget the tens of thousands people who\nwere killed or wounded, the thousands of missing and\nhundreds of thousands displaced persons and refugees.\nHeavy damage was inflicted on the economic, social,\ncultural and other sectors of life in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. But ultimately it was the social tissue of\nBosnia and Herzegovina that suffered the greatest damage.\nThe striving for national domination, exclusivity and\nxenophobia, and also autism, have destroyed bridges of\ncommunication and have deepened the gap between various\nethnic groups.\nGiven that the tragic consequences of the conflict\nremain, it will require a lot of wisdom, patience and hard\nwork to overcome the many obstacles in our way. But we\nbelieve that it is time to turn resolutely towards the future.\nWe must use this precious time to rebuild confidence and\nestablish relations between different ethnic groups and\namong all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. These\nrelations should be based on internationally accepted\nstandards and norms of behaviour. In that context the\npromotion and protection of human rights is one of the core\nissues. Human rights are universally accepted and inherent\nto all human beings, and they must be respected.\nTwo years after the signatures on the Dayton\nAgreement stopped the negative current of events and\nmarked the beginning of the peace process, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is facing enormous tasks: rebuilding the war-\ntorn country and simultaneously establishing a democratic\nsystem of governance and administration. In spite of a\nvariety of problems and shortcomings, we feel that the\npositive energy necessary for such an endeavour is\naccumulating. Besides the continuous attention and support\nof the international community, we need the parties\nconcerned in Bosnia and Herzegovina to show additional\npolitical goodwill if they want to see the peace process\nprogress and lead, ultimately, to results.\nThe legal framework for this exceptionally complex\ngoal was established in the Dayton Agreement. The\nConstitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina was drafted,\ntaking into account the political reality and using as the\npoint of departure the only possible formula: three\npeoples, two entities, one state. To make this rather\nunique arrangement viable, in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Dayton Agreement, institutions at the\nstate level have been established.\nThe Presidency, Council of Ministers and Parliament\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina are functioning but they have\nnot yet reached the necessary optimal rhythm and\nperformance. This represents a serious obstacle and must\nbe overcome without any delay because of its direct\ninfluence on the functioning of the entire State system,\nand on the external relations of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nas well as on the key development programmes.\nAt the lower level, the system of cantonal power and\nadministration is taking shape. It encompasses a number\nof important duties and activities but also responsibilities,\nsince through it equal representation and participation of\ndifferent ethnic groups in power-sharing should be\nsecured. This represents one of the pillars of the multi-\nethnic, democratic State of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nBut what is most important is full and unconditional\ncompliance with all the provisions of the Dayton\nAgreement. That must be understood by all those who put\ntheir signatures on the peace agreements, and those who\ndo not honour their obligations must face the\nconsequences. I would also like to say that the successful\norganization of the municipal elections in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, held just a week ago, is of great\nsignificance. Imperfect as they may be, these elections\nrepresent a milestone on our complex and often difficult\njourney towards stable peace and in the building of the\nmodern, democratic State of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The\nfact that the elections took place throughout the territory\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, with hardly any problems or\nany major incidents, demonstrates the readiness of all\nparties in Bosnia and Herzegovina to comply with the\nprovisions of the Dayton Agreement.\nThe very fact that the majority of the population in\nthis war-torn and exhausted country responded in an\norderly fashion and presented themselves in large\nnumbers at the voting stations speaks for itself. It is a\n23\n\n\nclear signal that they want to take the destiny of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina in their own hands. It is also a testimony to\ntheir readiness to pursue the noble goal of healing the war\nwounds and starting to rebuild the bridges of cooperation,\ntolerance and mutual respect.\nThe post-war experience in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nunderlines the importance of democratic reforms, the\nintroduction of rule of law and the administration of justice\nin accordance with the highest standards, respect for human\nrights and the strengthening of public institutions. For a\ntruly democratic society, it is of particular importance to\nopen the space for free activities of civil society, citizens\nassociations, various non-governmental organizations and\nreligious communities. During the elections process, the\nsignificance of open, objective and truthful information\ndelivered by free media was confirmed once again.\nIn order to achieve all of this, the presence of the\ninternational community is of critical importance. Help and\nsupport from the various organizations and agencies within\nthe United Nations system is invaluable to Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and we are grateful for it.\nSocio-economic development and the building of a\ndemocratic State are closely interrelated. Only with properly\ntargeted help from the outside will Bosnia and Herzegovina\nbe able to create a sustainable economic system and thus\nachieve a stable environment that is less exposed to crisis\nand conflict situations. Here we are talking about a close\nand mutually conditioned relationship between development,\ndemocracy and peace. The realization of this paradigm\nholds the key to the door for Bosnia and Herzegovina to\ncatch up with the fast developing world.\nTherefore, I am convinced that we all share the\nopinion that this should continue in order to implement a\ncommon long-term vision for a prosperous and stable\nBosnia and Herzegovina. We have to move down this road\nswiftly and urgently. And this applies beyond the borders\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina; we cannot afford to delay\nstability in the region. In that context, I would like to\nunderline one growing phenomenon of our time which is\nparticularly relevant for Bosnia and Herzegovina: the\ninteraction between the foreign and internal factors in the\ncountries in transition. Only the combined efforts of the two\ncan yield the desired results; yet the international factor\nmust never forget that the case of each country is specific.\nInstead of a schematic and stereotypical approach, a new,\ninventive and flexible methodology and pattern of activities\nshould apply. This would certainly contribute to a better\nfocus for programmes and a higher degree of coordination.\nIt would also prevent overlapping and inadequate\nspending of resources.\nThe purpose of my brief overview was to share with\nthis body the recent experience in consolidating peace in\nBosnia and Herzegovina. I am convinced that by the end\nof this debate we will be enriched with valuable ideas and\nproposals on how to continue and improve the peace\nprocess in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the Secretary-\nGeneral stated in his address, the international community\nmust ensure that its collective investments \u2014 military,\npolitical and financial \u2014 have not been made in vain. We\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina share this approach entirely.\nAs a Member State, Bosnia and Herzegovina is\nclosely following the ongoing process of reform of our\nOrganization. The fifty-second session of the General\nAssembly is taking place at a time when the main\nfeatures of the global political scene are rapidly changing.\nThe new political and strategic structures are taking\nshape, with far-reaching consequences. With the cold war\nbehind us, new prospects, with new fears and new\nchallenges, are looming over the world. In such an\nenvironment, we attach the greatest importance to the\nplace and the role of the United Nations.\nWe would like to commend the Secretary-General of\nthe United Nations and his collaborators for the immense\nefforts in preparing a comprehensive report that contains\na programme of action for the reform of the United\nNations system. We cannot but agree that it is high time\nfor the United Nations to respond properly to the\nchanging world and thus confirm the irreplaceable role of\nthis universal Organization.\nWe go along with those who insist on a modern,\nstreamlined efficient Organization, ready to respond to the\ndemands of the new times. The United Nations must\nreach out to the world with new vigour and offer all of its\nassets in order to prevent threats to international peace\nand security and also to address the ever-growing number\nof universal problems. By breaking bureaucratic\nsediments, the United Nations must became a source of\ngreat intellectual power capable of offering a visionary\nperspective on the future.\nWe would like to state that one of the pressing tasks\nis the reform of the Security Council. However, we must\nbe prudent in dealing with this question. A balance\nbetween more democratic representation in, and full\nmobility of action for, this important United Nations body\nhas to be found.\n24\n\n\nBefore concluding, I would like to touch upon the two\nquestions which are of particular relevance for Bosnia and\nHerzegovina.\nThe first question relates to that abhorrent and\nimmoral weapon \u2014 anti-personnel landmines. Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is unfortunately one of the largest fields\ninfested with this dangerous killing device. We strongly\nsupport the conclusions of the Oslo Conference and hope to\nsee the international community united in supporting a\ncomprehensive ban.\nThe second question has to do with our first-hand\nexperience with the most horrible violation of human rights\nthat took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are\ntherefore strongly raising our voice in favour of the\nperpetrators of genocide and war crimes being brought\nbefore justice and prosecuted. We welcome the idea of the\nestablishment of an International Criminal Court, and we\nare convinced that the experience with the International\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda will be taken into account\nduring the preparation process.\nIn conclusion, I would like to underline our feeling\nthat the exchange of views and experiences during the fifty-\nsecond session is of great importance. It will certainly bring\nnew inspiration and, I hope, vision for the overall\ndevelopment of our planet. It will also contribute to our\npreparations for the encounter with the third millennia, its\nchallenges but also its new chances and possibilities. We\nmust be ready for this historic opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me pleasure to convey to the President the\ngreetings of His Excellency Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-\nJaber Al-Sabah, Acting Prime Minister and Minister for\nForeign Affairs of the State of Kuwait, who profoundly\nregrets being unable to participate personally in the debate\nat this session due to some pressing matters. He has\nrequested me to deliver the following statement by Kuwait\non his behalf:\n\u201cOn behalf of the State of Kuwait, it gives me\npleasure to congratulate Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on\nhis election as President of the United Nations General\nAssembly at its fifty-second session. We are confident\nthat he will be able to lead our deliberations\nefficiently towards a successful conclusion. The\nextensive experience he has gained from service at\nthis important international institution together with\nthe high posts he has assumed will no doubt prove\nvaluable. Let me also underline the good relations\nexisting between our two countries, based on mutual\nunderstanding and common interest.\n\u201cI wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute\nto his predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail, the\nformer President of the General Assembly, who\ndemonstrated an impressive sense of purpose,\ndedication and deep perception. Under his\nstewardship, the Assembly reasserted its genuine\nimportance and relevance in international relations.\n\u201cI wish to pay tribute to our new Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, who took\nthe helm of the Organization at the beginning of the\nyear. Apart from being a long-time career insider at\nthe United Nations, Mr. Annan to us now stands as\na good example of the executive manager enjoying\nwisdom and prudence, together with integrity and\ncommitment, that make him a living embodiment of\ndedication to the ideals and mission of the United\nNations.\n\u201cIn the same vein, I wish to set on record our\nrecognition of the significant contribution of\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the former Secretary-\nGeneral, in leading the Organization with efficiency\nand confidence. Kuwait will always recognize his\ncontributions with a deep sense of appreciation.\n\u201cTwo years ago, the United Nations celebrated\nits fiftieth anniversary. The mood then was\noptimistic about the role and capability of the\nOrganization to cope with the lingering issues that\nremained without a solution over the first half\ncentury. This was due to the nature of these\nproblems, which was aggravated by the major-Power\npolarization during the cold war. The sense of\noptimism emanated from our deep conviction that\nthe global understanding that swept the world would\neventually generate the firm will to address the\noutstanding problems that jeopardize international\npeace and security. Also, the widespread public\nawareness of the relevance of the United Nations\nwould also help the Organization in resolving\npending matters. Furthermore, the impressive track\nrecord of the United Nations has earned it collective\ncredibility regarding the vitality and flexibility of the\nmachinery at its disposal.\n\u201cKuwait has examined with great interest the\nmeasures and recommendations contained in the\nreport of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\n18\n\n\nentitled Renewing the United Nations: A Programme\nfor Reform', which was submitted to the General\nAssembly in mid-July last. In this connection, we\nwould like to register Kuwait\u2019s support for this\nprogramme and its appreciation of the efforts made by\nMr. Kofi Annan and his assistants to produce this\nimpressive achievement. The report is analytical in its\napproach and pragmatic in its outlook, focusing on\nperformance efficiency without partiality. It also\nfocused on improving the financial situation of the\nOrganization through the institution of better internal\ncontrol mechanisms and practical suggestions. The\nultimate goal of all these measures is to enhance the\nperformance of the United Nations, which would be\nmore innovative in its operational modalities and more\nfocused on its global concerns.\n\u201cWe have noted, with appreciation, the reports\nsubmitted by a wide array of working groups on\nrestructuring the organs of the United Nations and\nimproving their efficiency in order to adapt the entire\nsystem to the new era following the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations and the post-\nconfrontation environment. The United Nations seems\npoised to embark on addressing in a more\ncomprehensive manner humanitarian, cultural,\ndemographic and environmental issues which were not\nprominent on its list of priorities previously.\n\u201cMoreover, as we recognize the realities of\ncontemporary life, we understand that the world order\ncontinues to be quite fluid, and it is indeed difficult to\npredict its future shape. The current stage is not a\nunipolar power era, as some might imagine. It is a\nmultipolar arena, where military might is no longer the\nfinal arbiter in the definition of polarity. In fact, there\nexists immense technological superiority, which may\nenable some States to make an outstanding\ncontribution to the shaping of global strategies. There\nis also the economic power that has brought together\nthe major industrial nations in a collectivity which has\na significant influence on the implementation of world\nstrategies. This is not to mention the giant economic\ngroupings which exist in the world of today.\n\u201cAccordingly, the Open-ended Working Group\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council,\nand other Matters Related to the Security Council,\nwhich has been examining the question of reform and\nexpansion of Security Council membership for the\npast four years, should take these new facts of life\ninto consideration. Once agreed upon, the new\nmembership composition should reflect a collective\nand emphatic will to address adequately the issues at\nhand. Permanent members of the Council should be\npolitically capable and should be financial and troop\ncontributors. They should also be adept at crisis\nmanagement, and able to act decisively, without\nhesitation, when the situation warrants such action.\n\u201cIn the final analysis, membership of the\nSecurity Council is not a privilege as much as it is\na responsibility. It should not be a means for\nvisibility, but a product of conviction. Our view is\nthat the Security Council in its forthcoming\ncomposition should be a mirror reflecting a world\nshifting towards universalization and transparency in\norder to instil a better sense of security in all\nmembers of the world community, both North and\nSouth, East and West. Membership should not be\ndivided between diverse security concepts, some\nfavouring the North, while others are appropriate for\nthe South.\n\u201cIn this context, Kuwait affirms its full\ncommitment to the common Arab position and to the\nstand of the Non-Aligned Movement, both of which\nwere elaborated time and again in several meetings\nof the Open-ended Working Group.\n\u201cUndoubtedly, agreement on the concept of\nunconventional and common security requires in the\nfirst instance recognition of some crucial facts. The\nfirst element is the conviction that the security of\nhumankind is universal and, in the final analysis,\nindivisible. The interests of members of the world\ncommunity have become more and more\ninterdependent, while civilizations and cultures are\ndrawing closer. The daily concerns of individuals are\nuniversal in nature, requiring complex solutions, and\nare multidimensional in their negative impacts. The\nsecond element is the emphasis on the concept of\neconomic and social development as a crucial factor\nin ensuring conventional security and collective\nhandling of development requirements. This also\ncalls for the involvement of international institutions\nin contributions to the improvement of living\nconditions in the poor nations that face severe\nimpediments in their development efforts.\n\u201cThe third element is a firm belief in and\ncommitment to the dignity of the human person as\nbeing the essence of human relations both within a\n19\n\n\ngiven society and among nations. In effect, this means\nupholding the dignity of the human person in the face\nof bloody regimes which flagrantly violate the\nprinciples of human rights and destroy their own\nnations to arrogate power to themselves. This brings\nus to the necessity of safeguarding the principles set\nforth in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human\nRights and in the Charter of the United Nations.\n\u201cFourthly, all members of the world community\nshould adopt peaceful policies which renounce\nviolence, recognize the legitimate interests of others\nand respect their rights, expand the zones of mutual\ninterests, give due priority to development and reject\nthe arms race. Such peaceful policies should also\nabstain from behaviour and political expressions which\ndisturb peace. They should observe civilized conduct\nin relationships among peoples, without the pursuit of\nany party\u2019s privileges at the expense of others. No one\nshould claim an imaginary historical role outside the\nparameters of justice, equality and the rule of law.\n\u201cThe world today is indeed a small planet whose\nproblems interact and overlap. Its pressing problems\nare a global responsibility. When viewed through a\nhuman and global prism, we can see that the\nprosperity of the North pales in the shadow of the\npoverty of the South. The security of Europe will not\nbe assured against a background of a marginalized\nAfrica. There will be little peace of mind in America\nin the face of a population explosion in Asia, and with\nthe widening gap between those with an abundance of\nwealth and those who suffer in deprivation. Dealing\nwith the new developments in the world environment\nrequires the evolution of a comprehensive concept of\nsecurity. Any such concept must be anchored in\nunderstanding, coexistence, common interests, and the\nutilization of the universal technological revolution in\nmanaging vital national projects. This concept should\nreplace the outdated concepts of security based on the\nbalance of power, mutual deterrence and military\npresence.\n\u201cThe achievements made by the United Nations\nshould provide the Organization with a further impetus\nto pursue the same course it has charted since the end\nof the cold war.\n\u201cWe welcome the movement towards the\nprohibition of the production, stockpiling and use of\nlandmines. This would be yet another positive step\nadded to similar measures, such as the Chemical\nWeapons Convention, the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty and the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Despite such\ninstruments, some States continue to export weapons\nof mass destruction as a vital source of increased\nnational income. We welcome the regulations that\nhave been concluded to control arms, to reduce the\nlevel of nuclear threat, to tighten controls over the\narms trade and to increase transparency regarding\nweapons expenditures.\n\u201cIn the same vein, we cannot underestimate the\nachievements made in the area of peacekeeping\noperations, where the United Nations has managed\nto contain dangers and defuse crises in several\ninstances, although many regional problems remain\nunresolved and constitute flash-points of tension.\n\u201cIn this regard, we in Kuwait cannot but recall\nwith admiration the firmness with which the Security\nCouncil responded to the aggression by the Iraqi\nregime against the State of Kuwait in August 1990.\nThe Council\u2019s response was characterized by\nfirmness in rejecting aggression, resoluteness in its\nconfrontation, and decisive action to abort the\naggression through a series of resolutions that made\nthe Council\u2019s position perfectly clear. It started with\nrejection of aggression, then moved to deterrence,\nand culminated in decisive action. In all its\ndimensions and ramifications, that case has become\na historical precedent that might constitute the basis\nfor a solid background for dealing with any similar\naggression, irrespective of its origin, against any\nState.\n\u201cBut Iraq, despite the dire need of its people\nfor the lifting of economic sanctions imposed by the\nSecurity Council, has not yet fulfilled basic\nconditions required for ending the sanctions. There\nis the question of Kuwaiti and third-country\nprisoners and detainees. This is a humanitarian issue\nthat affects several hundred families who still do not\nknow the whereabouts of their loved ones. Young\nchildren continue to cry, appealing for help to rescue\ntheir missing fathers. The ad hoc Tripartite\nCommission continues to meet in Geneva while its\ntechnical sub-group still convenes in the border area\nbetween Kuwait and Iraq. Despite the formal nature\nof such regular meetings, which attract media\nattention, there has in effect been no progress in\n20\n\n\ndetermining the fate of these missing persons. In fact,\nthe Iraqi regime has been exploiting their fate as a\nbargaining chip in its diplomatic manoeuvres. Iraq also\ncontinues to refuse to return a great deal of Kuwaiti\nproperty taken from the public and private sectors, the\nmost important of which is an air defence system and\nother military equipment, in addition to the principal\nState documents, which have been referred to in the\nSecurity Council as State memory.\n\u201cAmong the other key obligations the Iraqi\nregime has failed to fulfil is the elimination of\nweapons of mass destruction, a subject that is being\nhandled by the Special Commission. In this context,\neven after seven years of formal acceptance of\nrelevant conditions, Iraq continues to indulge its hobby\nof procrastination, subterfuge and deception. Iraq hides\ncertain weapons only to acknowledge later their\nexistence after the Special Commission secures\ndefinitive proof of Iraq\u2019s ownership of such weapons.\nIt denies having certain types of missiles and\nbiological components only to recant its assertions\nonce the international teams of inspectors discover\nthose items.\n\u201cKuwait welcomes Security Council resolution\n1111 (1997) regarding the extension of the\nimplementation of the provisions of resolution 986\n(1995), which aims at alleviating the suffering of the\nbrotherly people of Iraq. Indeed, the hardship faced by\nthe people of Iraq has long persisted, due to the\nfailure of the Iraqi regime to meet its obligations, and\nto its pursuit of a policy of procrastination and\ntrickery. Iraq is called upon to follow a peaceful\npolicy with neighbouring States in order to prove its\ngood intentions. This is a substantive condition for the\nmaintenance of regional security, which was shattered\nby the Iraqi regime.\n\u201cWe in Kuwait have gone through bitter\nexperiences with regard to the intentions of the Iraqi\nregime, which seeks territorial expansion, regional\nsupremacy, and military superiority at the expense of\nneighbouring countries and of their peace and stability.\n\u201cIn the light of our eager interest in the\nmaintenance of security and stability in the region, we\naffirm the need to preserve the unity and territorial\nintegrity of Iraq.\n\u201cThe supreme goal is to build a solid regional\nsystem firmly rooted in common understanding among\nneighbouring States which seek to expand avenues\nof mutual interests. This can be achieved through\nrespect for and non-interference in the internal\naffairs of others, and through civilized coexistence\namong neighbouring peoples. In this respect, I\nshould point out that my country is concerned over\nthe continued existence of the problem of the\noccupation by Iran of three United Arab Emirates\nislands. Here I wish to emphasize Kuwait\u2019s full\ncommitment to the decision taken by the Gulf\nCooperation Council on this subject.\n\u201cI wish also to call upon the Islamic Republic\nof Iran to respond favourably to the peaceful\ninitiative launched by His Highness Sheikh Zayed\nbin Sultan Al Nahyan, President of our sister United\nArab Emirates, to engage in a serious dialogue that\nwould take into account the inalienable rights of the\nUnited Arab Emirates to the islands in question, in\naccordance with the principles of good neighbourly\nrelations, international law and the United Nations\nCharter.\n\u201cThe question of the Middle East and the\nsuccess of the peace process there are crucial\nmatters for world peace and security. You follow\nwith us with deep regret the paralysis which befell\nthat process and the increasing frustration and\ntension throughout the region. The current stalemate\nhas touched off a flurry of threats and\nrecriminations. All this is the net sum of the\nconcepts put out by the Israeli Government\nregarding the frame of reference underlying the\npeace process in the region.\n\u201cThe Government of Israel has backtracked\nfrom the rules and principles of the Madrid Peace\nConference and has replaced them by extraneous\nelements which contravene the rules unanimously\nagreed upon by the international community as a\nframework for the peace process, namely Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973),\ntogether with the \u201cland for peace\u201d principle.\nFurthermore, Israel has not committed itself to\nimplement bilateral agreements reached with the\nPalestinian Authority, including withdrawal from all\noccupied territories, including Jerusalem. Also, Israel\nhas not desisted from its policies of annexing Arab\nJerusalem, its Judaization and expansion of its illegal\nsettlement in order to change the demographic\ncomposition of the Holy City which lies at the very\ncore of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In this regard,\n21\n\n\nwe call upon the co-sponsors of the peace initiative to\nmaintain even-handedness while doubling their efforts\nto revive the peace process in order to achieve a\nlasting, comprehensive and just resolution of the\nquestion of Palestine.\n\u201cThe people of Palestine have suffered for too\nlong the excruciating pain of oppression, homelessness\nand neglect. It is the inherent right of the Palestinian\npeople to exercise self-determination and to establish\ntheir own independent State, with Jerusalem as its\ncapital, similar to other peoples who gained\nindependence, so that they may contribute, within their\nown capacity, towards building world peace.\n\u201cAlong similar lines, Kuwait emphasizes the\nimportance of Israeli withdrawal from the occupied\nSyrian Golan, which has been under occupation since\n1967. This question cannot be ignored if we desire the\npeace process to be complete. Indeed, the peace must\nbe comprehensive, covering all tracks. It should be\nanchored in good faith, in respect for the rights of\nothers and in mutual confidence. In this regard, we\nsupport Syria\u2019s position that negotiations with Israel\nshould resume from the point where they halted\ninstead of starting new rounds of talks whose terms of\nreference have not been defined. Kuwait also supports\nLebanon\u2019s firm stand that Israel is duty-bound to\nimplement all provisions of Security Council\nresolution 425 (1978) and to preserve Lebanon\u2019s\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. This can be\nachieved only by full, unconditional Israeli withdrawal\nfrom southern Lebanon, so that Lebanon could resume\nits traditional role in consolidating development and\nprosperity.\n\u201cKuwait notes with deep regret that ethnic,\nfactional and civil conflicts among tribal chiefs in both\nAfghanistan and Somalia still continue. We remain\nhopeful that the United Nations will take more\neffective steps to address these problems that have\ntorn asunder those two countries and have continued\nto undermine regional security. We also appeal to all\nparties in these two countries to put an end to acts of\nviolence and to put overall national interests ahead of\ntheir tribal and ethnic interests.\n\u201cKuwait lauds international efforts to implement\nfully the Dayton Agreement, which aims at achieving\nsecurity and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina and\nupholding international legitimacy at this stage. In this\nrespect, we applaud the Security Council resolution to\nindict and prosecute certain political and military\nleaders in Bosnia and Rwanda for their crimes\nagainst humanity.\n\u201cWe live in a world bursting with events.\nDistances have shrunk, interests have grown, and\nsecurity dimensions have become more interlinked.\nAdverse developments in the South worry the\npopulation of the North. Failure of development\nefforts has given impetus to chaotic waves of hungry\nmigrants. Threats resulting from peoples\u2019 frustrations\nhave become interwoven. But, in our common\npursuit of a better tomorrow, we must act on the\nbasis of a universal conviction that armaments by\nthemselves do not guarantee full security, that\ndevelopment is the core of progress, that dialogue is\nthe bridge to understanding and that serious work\ngives birth to hope. Giving is an obligation, not an\nact of charity. Respect among nations is a key to\nstability, and self-improvement is a motive for work.\nParticipation is the path to cooperation. Monopoly is\none of the evils of bygone days, and openness is the\nroad to a better future. Investments are the tools of\ndevelopment. Bigotry is repugnant to contemporary\ninternational relations. People prosper in a civilized\nenvironment that imbues them with the virtues of\ndoing good and giving, reaching out towards those\nin need and moving against the odds in efforts to\ncreate a world that exudes friendship and amity, a\nworld resting on the rules of international legality, a\nworld enjoying security, peace and prosperity.\n\u201cOur last prayer is to bless Allah, the lord of\nthe universe.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn accordance with tradition,\nI take this opportunity to begin by congratulating the\nPresident most warmly on his assumption of the\npresidency of the fifty-second session of the United\nNations General Assembly. His unanimous election,\nwhich has placed him in this highly responsible post in\nthis important international arena, is a warm tribute to his\ncountry, Ukraine. I wish him every possible success in the\ndischarge of his difficult duties.\nI would also like to congratulate his predecessor,\nMr. Razali Ismail, Permanent Representative of Malaysia,\n14\n\n\non his dynamic presidency during the last session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nThe Lao delegation also wishes to express its\nappreciation to Mr. Kofi Annan, our new Secretary-General,\nfor his good work so far. His first nine months at the helm\nof our Organization have been a time of strenuous effort\nand resolute action aimed at reforming our universal\nOrganization to make it more effective and better suited to\nmeeting today\u2019s challenges. To our new Secretary-General,\nwe express our sincere wishes for success in shouldering\nhis weighty and great responsibilities.\nThe general trend towards dialogue and cooperation\nbetween States and peoples for the progress of humankind\nin this new era continues to characterize international\nrelations. Clearly, we are delighted because on the whole\nthis is highly positive. However, in several regions of the\nworld we still witness persistent tension and conflict, due\nto interference in the internal affairs of States; the\nimplementation of policies aimed at hegemony over\ndeveloping States; and tribal, ethnic, religious and other\ndivisions. This situation of tension and conflict is a\npotential threat to peaceful coexistence and harmony\nbetween States, and may even jeopardize the current\natmosphere of international cooperation to promote\ndevelopment. In the interests of world peace, a sine qua\nnon for the promotion of socio-economic development, we\nshould work together patiently and resolutely, to find\nrealistic and appropriate solutions as soon as possible.\nIn Europe, the peace accords signed in Dayton on 14\nDecember 1995 opened the door to resolving the painful\nand destructive conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We\ntruly hope that the parties concerned will sincerely and\nstrictly honour their commitments in order to preserve the\nfragile peace and cooperation in that region.\nIn some African countries tribal and ethnic conflicts\ncontinue to rage, causing serious harm to their peoples. We\nexpress our sincere sympathy to the peoples of these\ncountries over the untold suffering they have had to endure.\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic considers it\nimperative that the international community, and in\nparticular the countries concerned, redouble efforts to\nresolve these disputes as quickly as possible.\nIn the Caribbean, multifaceted cooperation between the\nStates of the region continues to grow, thus contributing to\npeace and security in that part of the world. In this context,\nit is time the United States of America made greater efforts\nand undertook reasonable negotiations with the Republic of\nCuba to resolve their differences, in the interest of both\nthe American and the Cuban peoples and in the interest\nof regional and global peace.\nIn the Middle East, the establishment of the\nPalestinian Authority, in accordance with the Washington\naccords signed in 1993, marked a crucial stage in the\nsearch for a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict, which dates back over 30 years. The\npeace process which had been set in motion is now\nconfronting grave difficulties, as the recent violence\nclearly demonstrates. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic\nRepublic expresses its grave concern regarding this\nsituation. We very much hope that the parties\nconcerned \u2014 Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization \u2014 will show great wisdom, and even\ngreater restraint, and will engage in serious negotiations\nto resolve their problem, thus contributing to restoring\npeace and stability to this sensitive region.\nIn the Korean peninsula, the implementation by the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United\nStates of America of agreements that had been concluded\nand the recent opening in New York of preliminary\nquadripartite talks on peace in Korea are important stages\nin the efforts to ease tension and confrontation in that\nregion. In this context, the Lao Government and people,\nwhile welcoming the efforts of the parties concerned,\nexpress their unswerving support for the legitimate\naspirations of the Korean people to live in peace and\nachieve the peaceful reunification of the Korean\nhomeland.\nIn South-East Asia, efforts to strengthen economic,\ncultural and other cooperation and improve the settlement\nof disputes by peaceful means are clearly priorities.\nThe admission of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic\nRepublic and Myanmar as fully fledged members of the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) on\n23 July last was a historic event of great significance. It\nis our firm hope that an ASEAN of 10 will become a\nreality in the near future and will contribute to\nstrengthening our region, and making it more prosperous,\nin the interests of peace, stability and cooperation in Asia\nand the Pacific, and in the world at large.\nAnother problem which has aroused international\nconcern is the recent event in Cambodia. Fortunately, the\ncurrent Government has been able to restore normality in\naccordance with the country\u2019s legislative procedures. The\ninternational community, including the Lao People\u2019s\n15\n\n\nDemocratic Republic, continues to recognize and respect\nHis Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk as Head of State of\nCambodia. It is our hope that all countries and the United\nNations will also respect his royal authority.\nIn the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, political\nstability continues to be solidly guaranteed. The multi-\nethnic Lao people are living in solidarity and unity \u2014 a\nfact which ensures social harmony. In accordance with our\nConstitution, the fourth elections for the National Assembly\nwill be held in mid-December. That election will once\nagain demonstrate the fervent patriotic spirit of the Lao\npeople and the development of its democracy towards the\nestablishment of a State of law, a State of the people, by\nthe people and for the people.\nIn the economic sphere, implementation of the renewal\npolicy, which began in 1986, has made it possible for our\neconomy to experience sustained growth, with an annual\nrate for the past five years of approximately 7 per cent.\nUnfortunately, this year, my country suffered equally\nsizeable losses because of natural disasters and the\nrepercussions of financial recession in South-East Asia.\nNonetheless, cooperation between Laos and the\ninternational community remains very strong.\nParallel with its admission to ASEAN, the Lao\nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic continues to strengthen its\nrelations of bilateral cooperation with neighbouring\ncountries in the region and in the world on the basis of the\nprinciples of equality and mutual interest. In order to ensure\nthe sustained development of the national economy, the Lao\nGovernment has taken important measures to integrate its\neconomy and its market with those of the region and of the\nworld. This integration is of great benefit to national and\nforeign investors thanks to the country\u2019s economic and\nother potential such as its geographical location, in relation\nto major regional markets, its transit role, its role as a\nsupplier of hydroelectric power to neighbouring countries\nand export producer, using the country\u2019s raw materials, and\nits innumerable natural tourist attractions.\nFollowing up its endeavours and successes of the last\n10 years through the implementation of its renewal policy,\nthe Lao Government firmly intends to continue its policy of\ndeveloping the country on the basis of a market economy\nand broadening relations of cooperation with the\ninternational community. Its aim is to extricate the country\nfrom its state of underdevelopment by the year 2020 and to\nestablish a preliminary basis for its gradual transformation\ninto an industrialized, modern country under the slogan\n\u201cBuilding a strong and prosperous country, ensuring the\nwell-being of the people, forming a civilized and fair\nsociety\u201d.\nThe world economy is seeing some signs of growth.\nNonetheless, this growth falls short of expectations. We\nwitness growing inequalities between developing and\ndeveloped countries. The international economic\nenvironment in terms of access to markets and financial\nresources granted on preferential terms for development\npurposes is, in general, in decline. Faced with this\nsituation, the developed countries must spare no effort to\ntake the necessary steps by coordinating their\nmacroeconomic policies in order to bring about a\nrecovery of the world economy thanks to a stronger\nliberalization of trade, which would contribute to\nestablishing an international economic environment more\nfavourable to development.\nThe problem of drug abuse remains a subject of\ninternational concern. My country has taken many\nnational and international measures with a view to\ncontributing to the global effort to eradicate this scourge\nfrom the face of the earth. For the first time, in May, the\nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic was unanimously\nelected a member of the important Commission on\nNarcotic Drugs by the Economic and Social Council. We\nare profoundly grateful to the international community for\nthis demonstration of confidence and support and we will\nmake every effort to discharge our responsibilities\nhonourably.\nLast June, after over three years of hard work, the\nGeneral Assembly adopted, without a vote, An Agenda\nfor Development. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\nis pleased at its adoption, which it regards as an important\nstage in the effort to build a real partnership between the\ndeveloped and developing countries. The Agenda for\nDevelopment, a highly valuable document, provides a\nfoundation of principles, objectives, measures and actions\nwhich can serve as a guide to Member States in the\nglobal approach to development questions in the\nimmediate and long term and at the national and\ninternational levels.\nThat June, the General Assembly met in special\nsession to review the implementation of Agenda 21 five\nyears after the Rio Summit on environment and\ndevelopment. At the conclusion of that session, a follow-\nup programme on the implementation of Agenda 21 was\nadopted without a vote; the importance of that\nimplementation, inter alia, to the eradication of poverty\nin the years to come was stressed. The international\n16\n\n\ncommunity is therefore called on to exert every effort to\nstrengthen cooperation to make this programme a reality.\nAs we near the twenty-first century, the United\nNations \u2014 the only universal multilateral body \u2014 has an\nimportant role to play in the consideration and management\nof international affairs. If it is to be commensurate with that\ntask, our Organization must adapt to the new dynamic and\ncomplex world. In this context, we express our sincere\ngratitude to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the\nimportant initiatives of his programme of reform, issued last\nJuly, which aim at reorganizing our global body in order to\nmake it more flexible in its structure and more efficient in\nits actions. This very important programme generally tries\nto take the interests of Member States into account.\nIn considering these questions, it is necessary to\nemphasize that any reform process must have the primary\ngoal of strengthening the Organization\u2019s capacities to\npromote social and economic development for all States,\nparticularly the developing among them. At the same time,\nthis promotion must be undertaken while addressing\nquestions related to peacekeeping, human rights and\nhumanitarian activities. It is on the basis of these essential\ncriteria that we would wish to see the Organization\nreformed and revitalized and given an improved structure,\na more democratic regime and a solid financial footing. If\nwe do so, the United Nations will be able effectively to\nmeet the new challenges of our times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, it is with pride\nthat I congratulate you, a representative of Ukraine, on your\nelection to the international community\u2019s highest political\npost. I am confident that you will use to the full your rich\npolitical experience and internationally recognized\ndiplomatic skills, as well as your profound knowledge of\nthe United Nations system, to which you have devoted\nmore than 20 years of your life, to the benefit of mankind.\nI wish also to address words of gratitude to\nrepresentatives of all United Nations Member States for\ntheir support of the candidature of the Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of Ukraine for the honourable and responsible\nposition of President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nsecond session. We interpret that support as a manifestation\nof a high level of confidence in Ukraine\u2019s foreign policy,\nits peaceful initiatives and its commitment to the ideals of\nthe United Nations and to the objective of reviving and\nstrengthening the Organization. We regard it also as\nrecognition of Ukraine\u2019s contribution to the maintenance\nof international peace and security, to the process of\nnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, to the\npromotion of the noble principles of democracy in\ninternational life and of respect for fundamental human\nrights and freedoms.\nAllow me also to pay a tribute to the President of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-first session, Mr. Razali\nIsmail, who made a notable contribution to the\nOrganization\u2019s progress along the path of reform.\nThe recent history of the United Nations and the\nhistory of the development of independent Ukraine have\nmuch in common. The first common feature is that both\nmy State and the United Nations are now experiencing\nthe complicated process of internal reform. Profound,\ncomprehensive change is proving to be an extremely\ndifficult matter. But the choice is final and irreversible:\nUkraine has become a democratic State with a policy\naimed at ensuring the needs and rights of its citizens, and\nat establishing a civil society. There is every reason to\nconclude that during our six years of independence we\nhave laid the foundation of further State-building.\nAs early as next year we will certainly experience\ngradual economic growth and the forging of a socially\noriented market economy in Ukraine. All the conditions\nnow exist for this to become reality, both internal \u2014 as\nillustrated by the political stability in Ukraine \u2014 and\nexternal.\nUkraine has consistently conducted, and is\ndetermined to continue, a policy aimed at strengthening\nsecurity and stability throughout the world. I would recall\nthat last year we removed the last nuclear warhead from\nour territory, thus transforming a nuclear-weapon State to\na non-nuclear-weapon State for the first time in history.\nUkraine thus demonstrated its good will, proved that\ngenuine nuclear disarmament is possible, and made a\nsubstantive contribution to the achievement of the ideal of\na nuclear-weapon-free world in the twenty-first century.\nNo less significant is my country\u2019s contribution to\nradical positive changes in the Central and Eastern\nEuropean region, creating favourable conditions for a\nnew, more stable and more secure geopolitical situation\nthroughout the continent.\n3\n\n\nImportant steps in that direction included the basic\npolitical treaties that Ukraine has signed with the Russian\nFederation and with Romania, and the agreement with the\nRepublic of Belarus on State borders, the first of the kind\nto be signed in the history of the newly independent States.\nThe signing by the Presidents of Ukraine and of\nPoland of the joint statement on reconciliation and unity\nwas of exceptional significance for the improvement of the\nsituation in Central and Eastern Europe. We view that\ndocument as exemplifying a balanced and unbiased\napproach to the evaluation of complex pages of history, and\nas a deliverance from the burden of the past for the sake of\nthe development of mutually beneficial cooperation now\nand in the future.\nThe resolution of the problem of the division of the\nBlack Sea fleet has contributed to enhanced security in the\nBlack Sea region and throughout Europe.\nAmong the most recent of important events, I wish to\nnote the signing at Madrid of the Charter on Special\nPartnership between Ukraine and the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO). The establishment of a special\npartnership with the alliance has tangibly strengthened\nconfidence in Europe and is now one of the important\nelements in the establishment of a new system of European\nsecurity.\nIt is generally acknowledged that the future of the\nEuropean security architecture as an important element of\nglobal security should be based on principles of\ncomprehensiveness, indivisibility and partnership, and, in\nthe long run, on collective rather than unilateral action. It\nis in that context that Ukraine is developing active\ncooperation with European and transatlantic security\nstructures.\nAn important place in Ukraine\u2019s foreign policy\npriorities belongs to developing mutually beneficial\nrelations with the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin\nAmerica. Ukraine is also devoting special attention to the\nMovement of Non-aligned Countries, which is one of the\ninfluential factors in contemporary international relations.\nOur observer status in that movement testifies to the fact\nthat Ukraine is today a non-bloc country.\nAll of this can be summarized in a single conclusion:\nthanks to Ukraine\u2019s persistent efforts, its borders are now\npeaceful and it is open to partnership with neighbouring\ncountries. Our multifaceted foreign policy has promoted the\nimage of Ukraine as a reliable and predictable partner.\nWe have been guided by, and still abide by, the\nwell-known principle: think globally and act locally. I\nbelieve that this approach \u2014 based, incidentally, on\nfundamental provisions of the United Nations Charter \u2014\nwill lay the foundation for future relationships among all\nmembers of the world community.\nThe events on the European continent since the end\nof the Cold War have persuasively shown that threats to\nsecurity on the continent will henceforth emanate not\nfrom confrontation between military-political blocs, but\nrather from regional and local conflicts. A good reminder\nof this is the series of tragic events of recent years in the\nBalkans, in the Transdniestr region, in the Caucasus and\nelsewhere. At the same time, discussions on the future of\nEuropean security have so far focused mainly on the\nissues of NATO and European Union enlargement, the\nrole of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope and so forth. It is not my intention to minimize\nthe importance of these issues, but we are certain that all-\nEuropean stability will be unattainable without\nstrengthening regional security and establishing mutually\nbeneficial and good-neighbourly relations between\nUkraine and other nations.\nIt is to that end that European countries \u2014\nespecially those of Central and Eastern Europe, among\nthem Ukraine \u2014 should exert the best of their efforts. It\nwas for this very reason that we proposed to hold in\nUkraine the 1999 summit meeting of the Baltic and Black\nSea States.\nBy the will of destiny, we are living at the threshold\nof a new millennium, which has coincided with a turning\npoint in the development of mankind. The United\nNations \u2014 a unique instrument for the maintenance and\nstrengthening of international peace and security \u2014\nshould be well prepared for the changes ahead and should\nbe ready to respond to the challenges of today and of the\ntwenty-first century.\nIt is difficult to overestimate the positive changes in\nthe world in which the United Nations has played a key\nrole. It is true that the Organization has not been able\ncompletely to cure all social evils. However, it is equally\ntrue that the United Nations has always sent a timely\nsignal regarding the emergence of new hazards and has\nunited the world community to address urgent global\nproblems.\nThe substantive outcome of these joint efforts relates\nin particular to environmental protection in its global\n4\n\n\ndimension: prohibiting chemical and bacteriological\nweapons and reducing nuclear weapons, as well as\nformulating a new concept and practice of peacekeeping;\nensuring human rights; and codifying international law on\nnon-renewable resources.\nAt the same time, we must admit that the United\nNations has not always been able adequately to respond to\na number of the problems it has faced. This makes it\nnecessary further to improve its structure and internal\norganization and to increase the effectiveness of its work.\nUnfortunately, we must take note of the fact that no\ninstitution other than the United Nations so clearly confirms\nthe validity of Parkinson\u2019s law, which states that the\nexpansion of bureaucracy has no limits. For that reason, I\nbelieve that today no one has any doubts that changes in\nthe United Nations are urgent and are objectively required.\nI hope that the current session will make a substantive\ncontribution to this important cause and that we will have\nall due reason to refer to it as \u201cthe session of reforms\u201d.\nThe well-known seventeenth-century Ukrainian\nphilosopher and educator Hryhoriy Skovoroda once said\nthat\n\u201cYou do your best work and save yourself when you\nfirmly embark upon the road of common sense\u201d.\nThis, in our view, is the path that the process of United\nNations reform should also take. Ukraine is actively\nsupporting measures aimed at bringing the structure and\ntasks of the Organization in line with new realities.\nIt is from this perspective that we are now considering\na package of proposals by the Secretary-General aimed at\na wide-scale reorganization of the United Nations structure\nand its programme activities. While these proposals may\nnot fully coincide with the interests of some countries or\nregions, they have been elaborated on the basis of\ncompromise and, in fact, constitute the first real attempt to\nstop marking time in the process of reforming the\nOrganization. Therefore we have to be pragmatic and\nattempt to avoid drowning this issue in endless discussions\nand appeals, as has happened repeatedly in the past.\nWe should begin without delay concrete work on the\nproposals of the Secretary-General, without dividing the\npackage into separate components. Furthermore, we must\nkeep in mind that the implementation of these proposals,\nfollowing their final approval and endorsement by the\nGeneral Assembly, will be only the initial stage in the\nprocess of the radical transformation of the United\nNations, which will have to embrace its most important\ncomponents, primarily the Security Council and the\nbudgetary and financial system.\nIn this context, equitable geographical representation\nin the Security Council and the increase of its\nmembership take on special importance. It would not be\na mistake to say that this problem is considered by the\nmajority of Member States as a priority issue and that its\nresolution, to a great extent, will determine the results and\nthe success of the reform of the Organization. In general,\nUkraine shares this point of view. But we also believe\nthat the overall process of the renewal and rebuilding both\nof the United Nations structure and of its activities should\nnot be held hostage to the solving of one issue, albeit a\nvery important one.\nThe negotiations that took place within the\nframework of the Open-ended Working Group on the\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in\nthe Membership of the Security Council during the fifty-\nfirst session of the General Assembly were, in our\nopinion, useful and productive. The positions of many\nMember States have shifted, moving towards achieving\ncompromise. We can realistically expect participants in\nthe negotiations to reach the general accord that is\nnecessary for the adoption of a decision, as required by\nthe relevant resolution of the General Assembly. I should\nlike to call on Member States to exert maximum efforts\nto reach a consensus decision. The most important thing\nnow is to transcend nationally focused approaches by\ntaking into account the common interests of the\ninternational community.\nConcerning the enlargement of the Security Council,\nI believe that the solution to the problem should be based\non the following general principles.\nFirst, all the regional groups, including the Group of\nEastern European States, should enlarge their\nrepresentation in the Security Council; secondly, the\nenlargement should not negatively affect the efficiency of\nthe work of the Security Council; and thirdly, the process\nof enlargement should not be given a strict time limit,\nalthough a decision on this issue should preferably be\ntaken in the near future.\nThe elaboration and practical implementation of an\noverall concept of peacekeeping activities is an extremely\npressing issue that can be settled only within the\nframework of the United Nations. Two years ago, at the\n5\n\n\ncommemorative meeting of the General Assembly on the\noccasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Organization, I\nproposed gradually to re-orient United Nations\npeacekeeping activities towards preventive diplomacy. The\nexperience of Blue Helmets operations in hot spots around\nthe globe in recent years has further convinced us of the\nneed to strengthen the preventive component.\nIn this context, we consider the system of United\nNations standby agreements to be promising. Ukraine,\nstriving to make a real contribution to the strengthening of\nthis mechanism, recently signed the relevant memorandum\nof understanding with the United Nations.\nImproving the efficiency of peacekeeping operations\nis not an abstract notion for our country. Let us recall that\nthe first Ukrainian peacekeeping unit was deployed five\nyears ago to the United Nations peacekeeping force in the\nformer Yugoslavia. Since then Ukraine has participated in\nmore than 10 United Nations peacekeeping operations. In\naddition, our military contingent has taken part in the\noperations of the multinational stabilization force in Bosnia.\nFrom this lofty rostrum, I reaffirm Ukraine\u2019s readiness\nto participate directly in a settlement of the Georgian-\nAbkhaz conflict, to join the activities of the group of\ncountries known as Friends of the Secretary-General on\nGeorgia, and to dispatch its personnel to the United Nations\npeacekeeping mission in that country.\nUkraine will also continue its efforts to bring about a\nfinal settlement of the conflict in the Transdniestr, acting\ntogether with Russia and with the participation of the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe as a\nguarantor of the special status of the Transdniestr as an\nintegral part of the Republic of Moldova.\nThe nineteenth special session of the General\nAssembly held earlier this year, which was devoted to\nreviewing progress in the implementation of Agenda 21,\nwas a major international event. I know that many countries\nhave assessed its results rather critically since, in their\nopinion, the session did not fully meet expectations. But it\ndid confirm the adherence of the overwhelming majority of\ncountries to the principles of sustainable development\ndeclared in Rio, and it also provided the world community\nwith a number of constructive proposals with regard to a\nfurther strengthening of global partnership in the field of\nenvironment protection.\nWe must all remember the equal right of present and\nfuture generations to a viable living environment. Our\nshared obligation to them is to join our efforts for the\nsake of the survival and development of human\ncivilization. That was the essence of Ukraine\u2019s proposal\nconcerning the elaboration in future of an international\nlegal document that would serve as a reliable legal basis\nfor safe and sustainable development worldwide.\nFor Ukraine, environmental problems are not just\nabstract theory. The Chernobyl nuclear-power plant\naccident has been a real national tragedy for my country.\nEvery year up to 15 per cent of the State budget is spent\non compensating for the losses it has caused and on\nensuring social benefits for the people affected.\nUkraine made a political commitment to\ndecommission the Chernobyl nuclear power plant by the\nend of the millennium and has made continuous efforts to\nfulfil it. We expect other countries to meet their\ncommitments in this regard.\nAt the same time, the problem of Chernobyl cannot\nbe limited to the decommissioning of the nuclear power\nplant. This accident unleashed a series of problems that\nare global in nature and could scarcely be overcome alone\nby even the most developed nations. Chernobyl today is\nnot the exclusive problem of Ukraine. In paying tribute to\nthe United Nations efforts aimed at eliminating the\nconsequences of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear\npower plant, I wish to emphasize that an overall solution\nto this global problem is simply impossible without large-\nscale international assistance.\nAt present, the United Nations is going through a\ndifficult but crucial moment of renewal. The same can be\nsaid about Ukraine, which is more than ever before\nconscious of its dependence on the world order and relies\non the support of the international community. That is\nwhy the question of what form the world order will\nassume in the future \u2014 to which this session is expected\nto provide an answer \u2014 is of particular and, without\nexaggeration, fateful importance to us.\nThe future of the world order, of the United Nations\nand of every country, is our common future. Thus, while\ndeciding today on the fate of the United Nations, we\nshould be aware that we are also determining our own\ndestiny.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI have the honour to present\nmy personal compliments to His Excellency\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko and to wish him every success\nduring his presidency.\n24\n\n\nI have the honour also to deliver the address of His\nExcellency Mr. Charles Ghankay Taylor, President of the\nRepublic of Liberia, who regrettably cannot be here today.\nThe text of his address reads as follows:\n\u201cAt the outset, I wish to convey sincere\ngreetings, on behalf of the Government and people of\nLiberia and in my own name. We are here today,\nhaving endured and survived a severe civil crisis of\nnearly a decade, through the acute consciousness of\nour subregion, whose empathy with Liberia\u2019s plight\ncreated and orchestrated a mechanism to prevent us\nfrom self-destruction. And we stand no less indebted\nto a sea of humanitarian outreach through the\ninternational community, most notably the European\nUnion (EU) and the United States; but absolutely, as\na living testimony to God Almighty, whose\ncompassionate will has removed the hand of evil from\nthe activities of our nation.\n\u201cIndeed, we are here because Liberia has stood\nthe test of time and the full assault of hardship.\nToday, one added voice of a sovereign State of\nAfrica \u2014 and an original Charter Member of this\nOrganization \u2014 is being heard through its constituted\nHead of Government, which we symbolize, and for\nwhich we give all glory to God.\n\u201cIt is my pleasure to congratulate His Excellency\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko on his election to the\npresidency of this fifty-second session of the General\nAssembly. To this we add our best wishes for his\nsuccess in meeting the challenges of this awesome\nassignment. Also, it is befitting that we extend our\nthanks to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Razali\nIsmail, whose tenure was characterized by a resolute\ncommitment to finding solutions to the many issues\nwhich impacted the proceedings of the fifty-first\nsession.\n\u201cI wish also to seize this opportunity to\ncommend, on behalf of the Government and people of\nLiberia, Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Already, he\nhas demonstrated that he understands the problems\nwhich afflict Africa, his native continent, and that his\nleadership is not confined to the accomplishments\nwhich he earned as a son of Ghana. Day by day,\nglimpses of his ability as an effective spokesman for\nall mankind are being made clearly visible. Permit me\nto also pay special honour to the former Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose sense of\npurpose and invaluable efforts to strengthen the role of\nthe Organization in the pursuit of international peace\nand security have brought benefits to mankind. We\nstand convinced that the patience he exercised and\nthe many initiatives and the personal commitment he\ninjected into the search for peace and understanding\nduring his tenure deserve appropriate commendation\nby this Organization.\n\u201cThe establishment of the United Nations over\nfive decades ago marked the beginning of a new era\nin international relations. The adoption of its\nCharter, a document of pride and durability, which\nLiberia helped to formulate, instituted a working\nsystem of international cooperation. Thus, nations\nare resolved to eradicate the scourge of war; to\nstrengthen peace through justice and international\nlaw; to respect the equal rights of all nations \u2014\nlarge and small; to promote social progress and to\nprotect human rights throughout the world. We wish\nto reaffirm our avowed faith in the United Nations,\nand we retain the undiminished hope that this\nOrganization will continue to be a veritable\ninstrument for the good conduct of relations among\nall nation States. In so asserting our firm\ncommitment to its ideals, we, therefore, rededicate\nourselves to its objectives. Indeed, from nearly every\nperspective, this Organization continues to cater to\nthe common aspirations of the international\ncommunity. Today, with its increased image as a\ncentre for harmonization, the vision of its Charter\nMembers has expanded across its original spectrum\nof engagement.\n\u201cAccordingly, as one of its visionaries who\nactively participated in its creation, we felt it\npropitious that \u2014 despite our recent civil conflict\nand its heart-rending accounts \u2014 we be personally\nrepresented at this fifty-second session, not only to\nreaffirm our commitment to multilateralism, but also\nto explore new ways of transforming our hopes for\nsolidarity into concrete actions for peace and\ndevelopment; not only to make a ceremonial\nrepresentation, but also to add frankness to the scope\nof discussions for the improvement of our\nOrganization.\n\u201cOn 19 July, the eve of the sesquicentennial\nanniversary of our independence, the people of\nLiberia went to the polls and made a forthright\ndecision for a great new beginning for democracy,\nfor representative government within a constitutional\norder, and for peace and prosperity in the forward\n25\n\n\nmarch towards the twenty-first century. In that\nmomentous exercise, the Liberian people demonstrated\nonce again, as they had done throughout 150 years of\nsurvival, their resilience and unconquerable will to\novercome imponderable odds, to keep alive the flame\nof national independence in Africa.\n\u201cJawaharlal Nehru, India\u2019s first Prime Minister,\nat the birth of his nation defined independence as the\nmoment \u2019when an age ends, and the soul of the\nnation, long suppressed, finds utterance\u2019.\n\u201cThus, when the tragic events of our national\nexperience in the recent past are viewed within the\ncontext of historical inevitability, we can safely say\nthat the elections of 19 July 1997 gave rise to a newly\nliberated soul of the Liberian nation.\n\u201cIt is in this light that we see the landslide\nvictory of 19 July 1997 as the final coming together\nof all of our people in a national embrace of unity to\ngive vibrancy to the liberated national soul. The vote\ntook place during the week of the solemn celebration\nof the 150-year anniversary of the founding of the\nnation. It was a vote rooted in renewed hope, which\nconcurs with what one writer refers to as \u2019idealism\nsuffused with a sense of ending\u2019. The people voted to\nend civil war and national turbulence and to begin a\nnew era of peace, stability, democracy, responsible\ngovernment and prosperity.\n\u201cWe have fully grasped the message of our\npeople\u2019s verdict. Upon our inauguration on 2 August\n1997, we set out to form a Government of inclusion.\nWe have also embarked on a process of national\nreconciliation. We have invited all Liberians,\nirrespective of political party affiliation, religious\norientation and ethnic origin, to come and join hands\nwith us in rebuilding our country. We have assured all\nthat our primary objective is to foster national unity as\nthe best hope for genuine peace and progress in our\ncountry.\n\u201cWe have also reaffirmed the 1986 Constitution\nas the Organic Law of Liberia. That Constitution\nguarantees and protects the fundamental rights and\nfreedoms of all alike. We are committed to making\nthat sacred document work. Our Administration will\nguarantee and promote the functioning of a credible\nand independent judiciary. We shall also protect\nhuman rights and freedom of the press. Above all, we\nshall endeavour to promote internal stability through\na Government of inclusion and national unity.\n\u201cOur experience as a nation convinces us that\nthe right to self-determination is a necessary\nprerequisite for any people to ensure national\ndevelopment and to play a meaningful role in the\ncommunity of nations. The right to self-\ndetermination is not, in our view, limited to\nliberation from external control, but also applies to\nliberation from internal tyranny. It is being\ndemonstrated time and again that it is unhealthy for\nexternal support to be tied to the survival of a\nparticular regime rather than to the growth and\ndevelopment of the nation. There is no substitute for\nlegitimacy and good governance. Internal liberation\nawakens a new consciousness about peace, security,\nstability and conflict resolution within a society. The\ninstitutions of the market economy are strengthened,\nand the people develop greater hope for a decent and\nbetter standard of living.\n\u201cIn this connection, and based on our\nexperience, Liberia will continue to play the role of\npromoting regional peace and security, fostering\nnational development through regional and\nsubregional integration and promoting democratic\nvalues through institution-building.\n\u201cWe are aware of the significant changes which\nare taking place, including the increased tendency\ntowards political pluralism and democratization, the\nrise in economic growth in a number of countries\nand the upsurge towards market economies, as well\nas progress towards the liberalization and\nglobalization of the world economy.\n\u201cThe end of the cold war has resulted in a\nrelaxation of tension, particularly between world\nPowers, and improved interactions among and\nbetween States. My Government must nevertheless\nregister its grave concern that since the advent of the\nhistoric fiftieth anniversary of this Organization,\nsome regional conflicts which appeared on the verge\nof resolution have defied settlement. We are deeply\ndisturbed by ongoing conflicts in Africa, the Middle\nEast, Europe and Asia. Historical evidence has\nshown that conflicts, whether in Africa or elsewhere,\nwill have negative consequences, not only for the\ncountries directly affected, but also for their\nneighbours and the regions of which they are a part.\nLiberians know only too well the consequences of a\n26\n\n\nprotracted conflict and therefore urge all parties to the\nvarious conflicts to seek a negotiated settlement of\ntheir differences.\n\u201cIn recent times, several unfavourable\ndevelopments have continued to threaten international\npeace and security. At present, in the Middle East, the\nconflict between Israel and the Palestinian Authority\nis permeated with accusations, charges and counter-\ncharges, despite the signing of the Agreement of 28\nSeptember 1995. In spite of the fact that efforts to\npacify the situation are being undermined, we urge\nStates within the region which are taking concrete\nsteps, as well as the international community, to give\nmore attention to ensuring that the peace process\nremains on course.\n\u201cWithin our subregion, while we draw immense\nsatisfaction from the fact that the Liberian crisis has\nfinally ended and the Liberian people have achieved\ndurable peace and stability, we lament the reality of\nthe threatening situation which recently has developed\nin neighbouring Sierra Leone. This matter truly leaves\nmuch to be desired, and we cannot overemphasize the\nfact that it is in the best interests of Liberia and its\nneighbours that peace be soon established in Sierra\nLeone and its people reconciled.\n\u201cLiberia, a member of the Economic Community\nof West African States (ECOWAS) Committee of Five\non Sierra Leone, is committed to a peaceful,\nnegotiated settlement of the Sierra Leonean crisis. We\nare of the firm conviction that it is our responsibility\nto ensure security and stability within our subregion.\n\u201cNotwithstanding the individual and collective\nefforts of African States to achieve socio-political\ntransformation, acts of destabilization continue to pose\na serious threat to these countries. That is why African\ncountries have intensified cooperation at the regional\nand subregional levels to stem this trend. We welcome\nthe growing cooperation between the United Nations\nand regional organizations in the fulfilment of Chapter\nVIII of the United Nations Charter, and the renewed\ncommitment to conflict resolution through preventive\ndiplomacy, peacekeeping and peace-building.\n\u201cIn the economic sphere, recent conscientious\nefforts have resulted in the registration of positive\nsigns in the revitalization of the global economy. This\nprogressive trend has been taking place against the\nbackdrop of explosive growth in world trade and\nprivate investment flows. In the meantime,\ndeveloping countries have thus far contributed 70\nper cent of the growth in global gross domestic\nproduct and half of the growth in world trade.\nNotwithstanding this, the gap between developed and\ndeveloping countries continues to grow, leaving\nmany countries behind amidst the general positive\neconomic progress occurring in the world. More\nimportantly, official development assistance required\nto fill the gap in resource depletion has fallen to its\nlowest point in real terms during the past 23 years,\nthereby forcing many of the world\u2019s poorest\ncountries deeply into debt, and making it virtually\nimpossible for them to undertake or sustain\neconomic reforms.\n\u201cThis situation has affected most developing\ncountries, particularly those in Africa which continue\nto experience the crippling impact of external debt,\ndeteriorating terms of trade and decline in\ninvestment and financial flows. While we\nacknowledge that the development of the African\ncontinent is primarily the responsibility of its people,\nwe hope that Africa\u2019s development will, of\nnecessity, remain an area of concern to the\ninternational community. We commend the\nSecretary-General for his continuing initiatives for\nthe development of Africa. The Government of\nJapan also deserves Africa\u2019s appreciation for helping\nto sensitize the international community to the need\nto assist African countries to overcome the negative\ntrends which are impacting on their economies.\n\u201cClosely related to the issues of development is\nthat of the environment. The human impact on the\nenvironment has increased dramatically, with\nunprecedented effects on mankind. Nevertheless, we\nremain hopeful that the growing awareness of the\ndegradation of the environment and the need to\nreverse this trend will remain a priority on the global\nagenda. In this connection, my Government\ncommends the holding of the recent high-level\nmeeting convened by the United Nations to review\nprogress on the implementation of decisions reached\non Agenda 21 since the 1992 Rio Conference on\nEnvironment and Development.\n\u201cThe Government of Liberia is concerned about\nthe alarming incidence of drug trafficking and drug\nabuse, which have already destroyed and continue to\nruin countless lives. While this unfortunate\ndevelopment has undermined the integrity of many\n27\n\n\nGovernments, we commend cooperative efforts\nbetween Governments that have taken bold action to\nprevent and eradicate drug trafficking and drug abuse.\nWe welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal to\nmerge the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice\nDivision and the United Nations International Drug\nControl Programme.\n\u201cThe Liberian Government is prepared to work\nvery closely with the international community in order\nto bring success to the international campaign that\nstrives to undermine the production of and trafficking\nin illicit drugs. We are assured in this connection that,\nworking in the framework of international cooperation\nand given our commitment, we are bound to succeed\nin our efforts to make our world a safer place for\nourselves and our children.\n\u201cRegarding the restructuring of the Security\nCouncil, we must recall that with the founding of this\nOrganization we committed ourselves and succeeding\ngenerations to continuously preserve peace and\nsecurity in our world. Let us remember that peace will\nbe elusive in the world where social, economic and\npolitical rights are flouted. In this connection, and in\nview of the Security Council\u2019s primary role in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, its\nreform is of particular urgency. We note the\nemergence during the fifty-first session of the growing\nconsensus to restructure the Council so as to ensure\nthat it becomes more representative and democratic.\nThis would encourage the advent of a greater balance\nbetween the requirement of efficiency and that of\nexpansion, as well as transparency in its method of\nwork. Moreover, with optimum utilization of the\nresources of those Member States that can contribute\nsignificantly to peacekeeping operations, immense\nsuccesses will redound to the credit of this\nOrganization.\n\u201cDue to the far-reaching implications for global\npeace of the Security Council\u2019s decisions and actions,\nthere have been persistent demands to expand its\nmembership to reflect geographic balance and ensure\nequitable representation. Besides, of the fifteen\nmembers of the Council, five enjoy the veto power.\nThe right of veto, we believe, is against the principle\nof universality and leaves the fate of our world to be\ndecided by only a few Members of the United\nNations.\n\u201cAccordingly, Liberia joins the call for\nexpanded membership of the Security Council. We\nalso request that, as the region with the single\nlargest number of Members, Africa be given two\npermanent seats on the Council. We further call for\nthe elimination of the veto power.\n\u201cLiberia believes that no country or institution\ncan prosper if it is resistant to change \u2014 the United\nNations being no exception. In this connection, we\nagree with the Secretary-General\u2019s decision to\ninstitute reforms in the administrative and\noperational aspects of the Organization.\nNotwithstanding this, we support a reform process\nthat does not diminish the capacity of the United\nNations to perform the Charter-mandated functions\nin the area of development, more especially to meet\nthe needs of developing countries. We are, therefore,\nheartened by the Secretary-General\u2019s indication that\nsavings accrued from the exercise will be utilized to\nestablish an economic- and social-development\naccount for the sole purpose of financing\ndevelopment programmes launched by the United\nNations. We note that $200 million will be saved for\ndevelopment by the year 2002.\n\u201cThe issue of sanctions has occupied much\ntime and energy here over the years, and Liberia,\nlike other African nations and nations around the\nworld, has watched sanctions succeed, and fail, as a\nmeans of encouraging change. Sanctions\u2019 greatest\ntriumph was perhaps in South Africa, where\ninternational sanctions isolated the racist apartheid\nregime and contributed to its eventual downfall.\n\u201cBut unfortunately, as we know, sanctions are\nnot always so successful. Time and again, nations\nsingled out for punitive sanctions have been able to\ncircumvent the edicts of this world body and obtain\nthe goods or the weapons they seek. Still worse, the\nleaders of these nations, who are the real targets of\nthe political and economic pressure that sanctions\nare meant to deliver, often feel no pain. Sadly, it is\nthe innocent people \u2014 already the victims of these\nregimes \u2014 who suffer the most. On balance, then,\nour Government is sceptical about sanctions as a\ntool for change. Unless they are universally adopted,\nstrictly enforced and carefully designed to achieve\nspecific political goals, we believe that sanctions can\ntoo easily end up harming those they are designed to\nhelp.\n28\n\n\n\u201cThe Liberian civil war was to a great extent, a\nprotest against the blatant disregard for and violation\nof the rights of Liberians. At the end of seven years of\ncivil war, the need to consolidate peace is of the\nhighest priority to my Government. It is essential to\nnational survival and the sustenance of our newly\ncreated democracy that the post-war reconciliation\npolicy be firmly grounded in developing a culture and\ntradition consistent with international norms of respect\nfor basic human rights.\n\u201cIn furtherance of this objective, my Government\nhas initiated a process to create by law a National\nCommission on Human Rights that will operate\nindependently and that will investigate, document and\nreport cases of human rights violations. Additionally,\nthe post of Deputy Minister for Human Rights has\nbeen created within the Ministry of Justice, with\nspecific responsibility to ensure the protection of basic\nhuman rights.\n\u201cSince its inauguration on 2 August, our\nGovernment has taken prompt and appropriate steps\nthat will protect the rights of all people, whether\ncitizens or aliens, residing in the country. As a\ntestimony to this commitment, some immigration\nofficers were dismissed when they were found guilty\nof having brutalized some alleged aliens. Additionally,\na private lawyer successfully filed a writ of habeas\ncorpus against the Minister of Justice, the\nCommissioner of Immigration and the Director of\nPolice for detaining a number of aliens for over forty-\neight hours without the formal charge required. The\nlawyer won the case and the aliens were released.\n\u201cWithout a doubt, we as a Government are aware\nthat we are being keenly observed, as if through a\nmicroscope, both internally and externally.\nAccordingly, we do not intend to water down our\npromise that matters relating to human rights will be\nkept clean and our record maintained unadulterated.\nAs a candidate for the presidency, we made it\nabundantly clear that, when elected, there would be no\nwitch-hunting. On this account, we stand to be\nchallenged.\n\u201cWe are witnesses to the rapid growth of the\nglobal village through advances in technology,\ncommunications and tolerance, which, too, have\nencouraged world peace and stability. Indeed, when\nthe illustrious architects of this noble Organization\nconceived the idea, from the Dumbarton Oaks\nConference to the Yalta Conference, before drawing\nup the United Nations, the world was not as it is\ntoday. From its original membership of 51 nations in\n1945, the United Nations now has an impressive\nmembership of 185 nations. Out of this number, 28\nhave been admitted just since 1990, the latest being\nPalau, in 1994.\n\u201cThe parallel existence of the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China and the Republic of China on\neither side of the Taiwan Strait constitutes for my\ncountry, a founding Member of the Organization,\none of the difficulties and the source of the prevalent\nsense of frustration that continue to persist on the\ninternational political scene since the end of the cold\nwar.\n\u201cIt really begs the issue to review the decision\nof the General Assembly on 25 October 1971, when\nits Members voted to admit the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina to membership while ignoring a compromise\nproposal that the Republic of China retain a seat in\nthe General Assembly. My country, a life-long\nsupporter of the principle of including every nation\nin the United Nations system, feels that there should\nbe a re-examination of the proposal to which I have\njust referred, with a view to admitting the Republic\nof China to the General Assembly. Quite clearly,\nexisting global realities make it necessary and\nprudent for us to review the action taken in 1971.\nWe believe that the United Nations is the proper\ninstrument for the correction of many seemingly\nintractable problems. We would add that this\nOrganization is the most significant international\nforum for the resolution of complex crises and that\nall nations that desire to participate in the United\nNations should have that right. Yet, in the highest\nsense, we believe that until reunification is achieved\nthe parallel participation in the United Nations of the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and the Republic of\nChina would be conducive to regional security and\nworld peace.\n\u201cOne of the principal challenges facing Liberia\ntoday is the revitalization of its economy. The past\nprosperity of the Liberian economy was built on the\nsuccessful development of the country\u2019s abundant\nnatural resources and the active participation of the\nprivate sector. We also enjoyed the benefits of a\nlively transit trade with our neighbours. During the\nyears of economic mismanagement and civil strife,\n29\n\n\nthe economy collapsed and the livelihood of ordinary\npeople was impaired.\n\u201cBringing prosperity back to the country is an\nenormous challenge. We are determined that the\nbenefits of such prosperity should reach all the people\nof Liberia, and not merely the privileged few. I am\nconvinced that the private sector has a key role to\nplay. The management of the economy must be\ntransparent and cost effective. The burden of external\ndebt, which we inherited, needs to be addressed. A\npositive relationship with the international financial\ninstitutions is central to the success of our\nreconstruction programme. We need an early infusion\nof financial resources on favourable terms to launch\nthe post-war reconstruction programmes.\n\u201cPrivate-sector operations in rubber, timber and\nmining will provide jobs and earn foreign exchange\nfor the country. We need to create a favourable\nclimate for new investment. This means that the fiscal\nregime must be reformed and simplified and that taxes\nbe paid to the Government. My Government has\nalready implemented a programme to centralize all\nrevenue collection under the Ministry of Finance. Our\nexchange rate and currency practices are being\nreviewed in order to guide local and foreign investors\nand inform them about the transaction costs of doing\nbusiness.\n\u201cIn managing the economy we must make the\nbest use of scarce resources. There is no place in the\nnew Liberia for ineffective public corporations and a\nbloated civil service that are a drain on the budget.\nRevenue collection is being tightened up, expenditure\nstrictly controlled, and the budget used as the main\nvehicle for prudent fiscal management and public\naccountability. Given our very limited resources, this\nwill mean that many priority projects will have to\nwait.\n\u201cLiberia\u2019s external debt to international financial\ninstitutions and other external creditors, inherited from\nprevious Governments, imposes a huge burden on my\nGovernment. We believe that the size of that burden,\ncoupled with the cost of rebuilding a shattered society,\nmakes it essential that the international community\nmake special concessions.\n\u201cMy Government intends to manage public\nfinances in accordance with the high standards\nexpected of any good government. But we cannot\nconsolidate the transition from war to peace unless\nimmediate funds are available to run the machinery\nof government and to start up the reintegration\nprogrammes designed by donors, in consultation\nwith our Government.\n\u201cI stand here in this great Hall and before\nhonoured representatives of independence as the\nrepresentative of a nation that only 75 days ago\nunderwent a free, fair and peaceful election \u2014\nperhaps one of the most transparent elections ever\nheld anywhere in the world. I hail from a national\nheritage which, more than a century and half ago,\nwas born out of enslavement, servitude and racism\nand which progressed from thence to freedom and\nindependence, and my proud homeland, in its\nstruggle to maintain its sovereignty and\nindependence, lost almost half of its territory to\nexternal Powers. Indeed, I speak of a land of liberty\nthat has passed through more than its share of\npolitical crucibles.\n\u201cWe have come, but not in anger. Rather, we\nhave emerged from a stained past of self-inflicted\nsuffering, which is perhaps not the surest rationale\nfor qualifying. But our scars enable us to speak, with\nsome constraint, at nearly first hand about how we\nhave been able to survive and keep our dignity as a\nsovereign State and people. We ask that the\nAssembly accord us the requisite attention, while\nretaining the hope that the experience of conflict\nresolution in Liberia and the engagement of the\nUnited Nations and the international community, in\ncollaboration with the Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS) through its\npeacekeeping instrument, the Economic Community\nof West African States Monitoring Group\n(ECOMOG), which helped restore peace and\nharmony to Liberia, will enlighten members on\nfuture undertakings in the arena of civil conflict.\n\u201cIn all candour, if there is anything of\nsubstance that must be said, it is this: Let us never\nagain allow any form of human anguish to be left in\nisolation, no matter how meaningless it may appear\nin the eyes of controlling Powers. Should it not be\nunderstood that one human tear is just as painful as\nanother and that the entire globe is united by the\nsame life-generating substance?\n\u201cWe have come to the United Nations to\nadvocate international cooperation. Let us not close\n30\n\n\nour eyes to the countless failures in the achievement\nof our common objectives as we enter the twenty-first\ncentury. Let us take note of the dangers and work\ntogether so that reason can prevail. The economic\nproblems and social dangers the world faces are\nimmense, and we have no right to postpone solutions\nor open the door to conflict and instability. Strategic\nconfrontation dominated the best minds of this\ncentury. Perhaps it is now time to turn our eyes upon\nourselves, upon our peoples and our societies, to\nassess their condition, their moral needs and their\ncrises, and to attempt to find solutions.\n\u201cTo conclude, I wish to make an appeal to the\nheart, without distinction as to creed, dogma,\npolitical colour or national faction. I should like\neach of us to look the other in the eye and ask\nourselves sincerely and frankly: Is this the world our\nchildren deserve? Will we be satisfied when, in the\nnear future, the voice of history and of our blood\nsummons us to judgement? The United Nations\nsystem and the entire international community will\nbe judged on the basis of their response to those\nimportant questions.\u201d"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, on behalf of the\nGovernment and people of Nepal and on my own behalf,\nI should like to extend to you, Sir, our warmest\ncongratulations on your election as President of the fifty-\nsecond session of the General Assembly. I am confident\nthat with your rich experience in international affairs you\nwill guide the work of the Assembly to a successful\nconclusion. I wish also to assure you of the full\ncooperation of my delegation in the discharge of your\nresponsibilities.\nI would like to take this opportunity to offer our\ndeep appreciation and thanks to the President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session, Ambassador\nRazali Ismail of the friendly country of Malaysia, for the\nenthusiasm, dedication and zeal he brought to bear on the\nwork of the previous session.\nTo Secretary-General Kofi Annan, I bring greetings\nand best wishes from Nepal. In every way, he is proving\nhimself worthy of the great trust the membership has\nplaced in him. Having shown his deep commitment to\nUnited Nations reform from the day of his appointment as\nSecretary-General, he has presented us with a set of very\nserious and far-reaching proposals of impressive breadth\nand scope, with a view to reshaping the United Nations\nso that it can better serve humanity in the years ahead.\nThe Secretary-General has asked us to make this\nsession of the General Assembly one of reform. We agree\nwith him that United Nations reform is the shared concern\nof all Member States and that the purpose of the reform\nis to strengthen the role of the United Nations and\nenhance its efficiency. In the aftermath of the end of the\ncold war, the world situation is continuously undergoing\nprofound changes, evolving progressively towards a world\n25\n\n\nof multipolarity which reinforces the core of the United\nNations Charter: peace and development in larger freedom.\nThe universal cause, therefore, is to make the United\nNations a more vibrant world Organization that is more\nproperly equipped, institutionally and financially, to meet\nthe evolving challenges of the next century.\nThe proposals of the Secretary-General complement\nthe ongoing intergovernmental process regarding the\nrevitalization of the United Nations, particularly financial\nreform and reform of the Security Council.\nThe United Nations, if it is to perform the mission set\nout in its Charter, cannot limp from one year to another on\nthe verge of bankruptcy. No country should bear an\nexcessive burden, but the fundamental principle of any\nscale of assessments should be the capacity to pay,\ncalculated on the basis of the country\u2019s share of global\ngross national product. It also does not make sense that half\nthe total membership is assessed the same amount in\ncontributions. A change in the scale of assessments is\noverdue. Countries, rich and poor, must pay their assessed\nshare in full, on time and without conditions.\nWith regard to the reform of the Security Council, the\norgan which bears the primary responsibility for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, Nepal\u2019s\nposition coincides basically with the position taken by the\nNon-Aligned Movement, as reflected, in particular, in the\nCartagena summit Declaration and the subsequent\nDeclarations of the meetings of Foreign Ministers of the\nNon-Aligned Movement. The Security Council should\nbetter reflect changes in contemporary political and\neconomic realities. It should be more representative in\ncomposition and more transparent in its functioning. It must\nbe more democratic in character. It must be more reflective\nof balance between the North and South. It must, above all,\nbe capable of prompt action when peace is threatened. The\ncontribution of Member States to international peace and\nsecurity should be the guiding criterion for the selection of\nMembers of the expanded Security Council in both\npermanent and non-permanent categories. Since the Security\nCouncil is the principal instrument of the international\ncommunity in the area of collective security, I must\nemphasize here that any reform must be the fruit of\nratifiable global consensus and must in no way diminish the\nCouncil\u2019s capacity for prompt and effective action to\nmaintain international peace and security.\nIn the view of my delegation, the reform proposals of\nthe Secretary-General, which deserve our appreciation and\nsupport, are categorized in three broad areas: management\nof conflicts and peacekeeping; strengthening and\nintegration at headquarters, and field levels of United\nNations development activities; and protection and\npromotion of human rights.\nToo often in the past, the United Nations has\nsuffered from a sore need for a capacity to act in the face\nof conflicts. The Secretary-General must be encouraged\nand supported financially to make use of his high office\nfor the resolution of emerging conflicts. When\npeacekeeping operations are mandated by the Security\nCouncil, the capacity of the Secretary-General to organize\nand mount them in time should be strengthened.\nPeacekeeping, to be effective, is dependent largely on the\nmaintenance of elements within the national armed forces\nof Member States that can be made available promptly to\nthe United Nations. Sixty-six countries are now\nparticipating in United Nations standby arrangements, and\nI am happy to say that Nepal is one of the 10 countries to\nsign the Memorandum of Understanding which commits\nmy country to contribute 2,000 troops, including doctors,\nengineers, observers and headquarters staff and 200\ncivilian monitors for peacekeeping purposes, at short\nnotice. It is high time that the rapidly deployable mission\nheadquarters became operational.\nNepal is confident that the Secretary-General\u2019s\nproposals for a new United Nations Development Group\nand a United Nations Development Assistance Framework\nwill provide clearer focus and direction to United Nations\ndevelopment activities aimed at sustainable development\nand the eradication of poverty. In Nepal, many of the\ndevelopment activities carried out by the United Nations\nare already practically integrated at the field level. Care\nhas to be taken, however, that in the name of integration\nor merger, the demonstrated strength of individual\nprogrammes, funds or agencies is not lost. We also find\nthe proposal for a Special Commission to look at the\ndivision of labour among the various specialized agencies\nacross the United Nations system very interesting and\ndeserving of careful consideration. With a view to\nachieving greater harmonization of international\ndevelopment efforts, Nepal feels the need for a closer\nrelationship between the United Nations and international\nfinancial institutions and the World Trade Organization.\nSince peace, progress and humanity are the core\nconcern of the United Nations, Nepal, as a functioning\ndemocracy with a deep commitment to human rights,\nappreciates the intention of the Secretary-General to\nstrengthen and broaden the capacity of the United Nations\n26\n\n\nin the field of human rights. We welcome the strengthening\nof the Human Rights secretariat and the choice of Mrs.\nMary Robinson, former President of Ireland, as High\nCommissioner for Human Rights. There could hardly be a\nbetter choice. I wish to congratulate the new High\nCommissioner and express the confidence of my delegation\nthat she will be an independent and credible defender of\nhuman rights. We welcome her determination to narrow the\ngap in the perception of human rights. She has rightly\nobserved that collective and individual rights are not\nmutually exclusive and that the scope of human rights is\ninterlinked with social, cultural and economic issues\nrequiring a broad approach.\nAs a signatory of all basic international human rights\ninstruments and a participant in the World Conference on\nHuman Rights in Vienna, Nepal looks forward to the\nfiftieth anniversary next year of the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights. Together with freedom of speech and\nbelief, the Declaration characterizes freedom from fear and\nfreedom from want as the highest aspirations of human\nbeings. Along with concerns for peace and sustainable\ndevelopment, it is right that concerns for human rights\nshould also be made an integral part of the work of the\nUnited Nations.\nPeace in many parts of the world continues to remain\nfragile. Nepal is deeply concerned over the setbacks in the\npeace process in the Middle East. The settlements policy\nhas retarded the process. Nor has the spate of violence in\nthe region helped restore the mutual confidence without\nwhich no peace process can succeed.\nWithout a resolution to the Palestinian problem, no\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace will be possible in\nthe Middle East. We urge the concerned parties not to\ndeviate from their professed commitment to resolving the\nproblem through peaceful means.\nThe extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons and the adoption of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty represent a fine\nmoment in the history of nuclear-arms control and\ndisarmament. The Convention on Chemical Weapons has\ncome into force, to our great satisfaction. With the creation\nof nuclear-weapon-free zones in South-East Asia and Africa\nlast year, we hope that efforts to create such zones in other\nregions, such as the Middle East and South Asia, will be\nrelentlessly pursued.\nDisarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, means\nnothing if it does not provide security to nations and\npeoples. Only a complete elimination of nuclear weapons\nwill provide such security. It is in this spirit that we have\nsupported the programme of action advanced by 28 NAM\nand neutral countries, members of the Conference on\nDisarmament, for the elimination of nuclear weapons\nthrough phases over a period of time. We are\ndisappointed by the complete lack of progress in this\nyear\u2019s session of the Conference on Disarmament.\nNepal is in favour of strengthening the role of the\nConference on Disarmament as the principal global\ndisarmament negotiating forum.\nNepal welcomes the agreement in Oslo this month\non the text of a convention for the total ban on anti-\npersonnel landmines and will seriously consider signing\nthe convention in Ottawa in December. Landmines should\nnot be allowed to be used indiscriminately and to maim\nand take innocent lives, including those of women and\nchildren.\nWhile the importance of the issues of weapons of\nmass destruction cannot be overemphasized, it is to be\nnoted that it is conventional weapons that have killed the\nmost people throughout history. Therein lies the\nimportance of the United Nations Register of\nConventional Arms. The work of the United Nations\nPanel of Experts on Small Arms, one of whose sessions\nwas hosted in Kathmandu this year, has laid the\nfoundation for future United Nations action in this area.\nConfidence-building measures and regular dialogues\nin informal settings represent an indispensable element in\nthe long and arduous efforts undertaken on behalf of\ndisarmament and security. I am pleased to note that the\nUnited Nations Regional Centre for Peace and\nDisarmament in Asia and the Pacific, located in\nKathmandu, has been found to be a useful forum for such\ninformal dialogues on disarmament and security issues.\nNepal\u2019s consistent participation in United Nations\npeacekeeping operations reflects our abiding faith in the\nideals of the United Nations. Over the past four decades,\nNepal\u2019s peacekeepers have served with pride in all\nregions of the world under the United Nations for the\ncause of peace. Many of the Nepalese Blue Helmets have\nlost their lives and limbs in the pursuit of peace. Nepalese\nsoldiers have served the United Nations with dedication\nand professionalism. Nepal will continue to serve the\ncause of peace by responding positively and promptly to\nevery call for assistance from the United Nations.\n27\n\n\nThe adoption of An Agenda for Development this\nyear, following protracted and tortuous negotiations over a\nperiod of three years, is a welcome sign for the renewal of\ndevelopment cooperation between the North and South. The\nAgenda identifies groups of countries in special need: least\ndeveloped countries, Africa, landlocked developing\ncountries, small island developing countries and countries\nwith transitional economies. The usefulness of the Agenda\nwill be measured only in terms of its faithful\nimplementation. The provision of additional resources on an\nassured and predictable basis is a prerequisite to the\nsustainable development of the least developed and\nlandlocked countries.\nThe decision of the General Assembly last year\nestablishing the First United Nations Decade for the\nEradication of Poverty represents the long-awaited\nrecognition by the international community of the pervasive\nnature of poverty, which today is the greatest threat to\npeace, sustainable development and human rights. The\neradication of poverty, therefore, should be a core activity\nof the United Nations. We recognize that this is the\nprincipal thrust of the reform measures and proposals of the\nSecretary-General. I wish once again to pledge my\ncountry\u2019s full support and cooperation to the Secretary-\nGeneral in this regard. Poverty alleviation is the priority\narea of sustainable development planning in Nepal. A\nmassive programme is needed to reduce poverty in a\nmeaningful way.\nThe rapid decline of living standards today in almost\nall the least developed countries and developing landlocked\ncountries is an ironic testimony to the gross marginalization\nof those countries, despite the new trade regime that is\nsupposed to usher in an era of prosperity throughout the\nworld. This anomaly is further compounded by the\naccelerating reduction of official development assistance to\nthe least developed countries. For the least developed\ncountries, and the landlocked among them, which suffer\nfrom additional physical handicaps, foreign direct\ninvestment cannot be a substitute for official development\nassistance for some time to come.\nI would like to affirm Nepal\u2019s unreserved\ncondemnation of terrorism in all its forms and our\ndetermination to prevent terrorists from deriving benefit\nfrom their acts. It is our firm position that terrorism is a\nthreat to both internal and international security and to\npeaceful relations between States. It is, moreover, a threat\nto the growth and functioning of democratic institutions and\nto the enjoyment of human rights all over the world. Nepal\nwill never allow its territory to be used by terrorists\nagainst other countries.\nNepal holds the view that States should create an\nenvironment in which people do not have to be displaced\nor flee their countries as refugees. The number of such\npeople is in millions and, in the words of the Secretary-\nGeneral, unquantifiable. Nepal is also bearing the burden\nof refugees. Nepal being a least developed and landlocked\ncountry struggling to cope with the rising aspirations of\nits people in a parliamentary set-up with deep human-\nrights commitments, the burden is painful for us. We have\nreceived international humanitarian assistance, for which\nwe are grateful. The magnitude of the problem for us can\nbe judged by the fact that one in every 200 people in\nNepal today is a refugee. We uphold the right of the\nrefugees to return to their home in peace and honour. His\nMajesty\u2019s Government of Nepal is determined to solve\nthe problem peacefully by dialogue.\nNepal is a founding member of the South Asian\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Nepal is\nactively pursuing a policy of promoting regional\ncooperation and understanding under the umbrella of\nSAARC, an Association which forms a critical part of our\nbroad policy of peace, friendship and cooperation with all\ncountries of the world in conformity with the Charter of\nthe United Nations and non-alignment.\nThe seven countries of the region are engaged in\nvarious areas of cooperation, including the suppression of\nterrorism and drug abuse, environmental preservation,\npoverty alleviation and the promotion of regional trade.\nWe are endeavouring to harmonize the policies of the\nseven member countries on important global issues. We\ndid so during the nineteenth special session of the General\nAssembly devoted to environment and sustainable\ndevelopment. Many ministerial meetings in the region are\nnow annual events. Foreign Ministers of the region will\nbe meeting in New York in an informal setting during the\nannual session of the General Assembly. SAARC has\nlagged behind other similar associations, but the countries\nof the region are persevering in their efforts to develop\nboth the habit and concrete measures of cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to extend my\nsincere congratulations to the President on his assumption\nof the office of the presidency of the fifty-second session\nof the United Nations General Assembly. His election to\npreside during this critical stage of change and reform in\nthe United Nations system is a reflection of the\nconfidence that the entire membership has in him and his\ncountry, Ukraine. I wish him a successful term of office,\nand assure him of Malawi\u2019s full cooperation.\nAllow me to pay tribute to last year\u2019s President, His\nExcellency Mr. Razali Ismail, for the excellent manner in\nwhich he handled the recently concluded fifty-first session\nof the General Assembly. President Razali Ismail brought\nwith him a refreshing sense of purpose in the work of the\nGeneral Assembly and the United Nations. His\npunctuality and forthrightness are attributes which will\ninspire us all as we move forward. My delegation wishes\nhim well in all his future endeavours.\nSpecial tribute is due to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, who, within a short period of time, has\ndemonstrated that a revitalized United Nations can work\nmeaningfully towards the full realization of the principles\nand purposes of the Charter. He can count on Malawi\u2019s\nsupport as he continues to discharge his responsibilities.\nMalawi welcomes the reforms that are taking place\nwithin the Organization. The Secretary-General\u2019s\ncommendable efforts in this regard will surely\ncomplement the work that has been, and continues to be,\nundertaken through the various intergovernmental\nprocesses. My delegation expresses its satisfaction with\nthe recent adoption of the report of the General\nAssembly\u2019s High-level Open-ended Working Group on\nthe Strengthening of the United Nations System. By\nfocusing attention on the institutional aspects and\n23\n\n\noperations of the United Nations, the outcome of the\nWorking Group represents an indispensable input to the\noverall programme of reform. The two-track programme of\nreform submitted to us by the Secretary General adds, in\nour view, a comprehensive and useful thrust in the reform\nand transformation of this world body. My delegation looks\nforward to participating in the consultations that are\nnecessary to carry through these proposals during this\nsession.\nWe welcome, too, the conclusion of negotiations on\nAn Agenda for Development. We need a strong United\nNations in development \u2014 a United Nations that is\nefficient, effective, relevant, able and well-resourced, to\nrespond to the many needs of Member States. Such an\nOrganization, however, cannot exist without meaningful\nprogress in the other areas of reform. We therefore look for\nsome tangible progress in the work of the Working Groups\non An Agenda for Peace, on Security Council reform and\non the financial situation of the United Nations during the\ncurrent session.\nLast year my delegation observed that Malawi did not\nbelieve that the Working Groups that we had established\nwere open-ended in time. We continue to hold this view.\nWe need to seize the opportunity for change when the time\nis ripe. While a time-frame may not be imposed, we believe\nthe time for change for the Organization is now, as we\napproach the next millennium. Progress in the three\nremaining Working Groups will make complete the changes\nthat we all seek for the Organization.\nIt is now over three years since the dawn of true\ndemocracy in Malawi. The Government of Malawi\ncontinues to work towards consolidation of good\ngovernance and respect for human rights. We seek to build\na Malawi that is democratic and economically viable.\nMalawi has made commendable efforts to improve the\npromotion, protection and enforcement of human rights. A\nnumber of independent institutions for the protection and\npromotion of human rights are now in place.\nLet me also note that Malawi has acceded to the major\ninternational human rights instruments. With regard to the\nSecond Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on\nCivil and Political Rights aiming at the Abolition of the\nDeath Penalty, the Government has decided to hold national\nconsultations on whether or not the death penalty should be\nabolished. The initiative, whose modalities are being\nworked out, has received wide publicity. In this regard, I\nwish to register Malawi\u2019s appreciation for the offer of\nassistance by Amnesty International to facilitate these\nconsultations. In the meantime, our President, His\nExcellency Dr. Bakili Muluzi, has announced a stay until\nthe outcome of the national consultations is known.\nWith respect to the combat of illicit trafficking in\nnarcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, Malawi has\nacceded to the 1988 Convention, and activities are under\nway to put in place an effective administrative machinery\nto coordinate the activities of government departments\nand civil society. We expect to establish a national\ncommission on drug control as a focal point for internal\nand international activities, including the promotion of\ncooperation within the Southern African Development\nCommunity (SADC) region in the fight against drug-\ntrafficking. Malawi would greatly appreciate any\nassistance from the international community, including the\nUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme, to\nimprove our own and the region\u2019s ability to deal with the\ndrug problem.\nWe continue to make strides in socio-economic\ndevelopment. Against the background of prudent\neconomic management, we have succeeded in arresting\nrising inflation and the stagnation in industry and\nconstruction as well as the total loss of confidence in the\nbusiness sector. Although the situation is currently\nmanageable, we are the first to realize that much more\nneeds to be done. Like many other small countries, our\neconomy continues to weather stormy turbulence caused\nby many exogenous factors. Drought has wrought havoc\nin the region in recent years. According to the current\nforecast, this season the region will experience yet\nanother drought. Poverty continues to be the main source\nof concern. There is no doubt that democracy in Malawi\nhas engendered massive expectations among the people,\nespecially after having lived in an atmosphere of\ndeprivation for decades. The level of expectation has\ngenerated insurmountable pressure on the limited\nresources which the Government has at its disposal.\nAs a developing country, and one of the least\ndeveloped among them, we are not yet able to mobilize\nadequate resources to accomplish all our national\ndevelopment programmes. Recurrent drought in the\nsouthern Africa region this decade, the weak economic\nbase of the country, which is almost exclusively\nagricultural, a rather unbalanced social infrastructure,\nwhich is partly due to the low literacy rate inherited from\nthe previous regime, and the problem of disease,\nincluding HIV/AIDS, pose a serious threat to our nascent\ndemocracy. A combination of these domestic as well as\nother factors of an international character bear the\n24\n\n\nfrightening potential of reversing the noble gains we have\nmade over the past three years.\nDespite these adverse forces, the Government is\ndetermined to broaden the economic base of our country.\nPolitical stability now obtaining in the country has created\na conducive atmosphere for foreign investment. Malawi has\nabolished all retrogressive legislation which hindered both\ndomestic and foreign investment. The economy has been\nliberalized, and a number of incentives have been\nintroduced for potential investors. Measures include a\ncomprehensive privatization programme.\nIn a further effort to tackle the root cause of poverty\nin my country, our Government has instituted measures\nwhich seek to empower the common person, including\nyouth, and women. Free primary education was introduced\nin 1994 to develop our human resources. This is coupled\nwith the provision of free tuition at secondary school for\nthe girl child. The aim of the Malawi Government is to\ndouble the average literacy rate by 1999.\nThe efforts and impact of globalization are well-known\nto us all. Malawi cannot go it alone in the implementation\nof its development programmes. International cooperation\namong all nations in all sectors of human endeavour is no\nlonger an option, but necessary for the very existence and\nsurvival of humankind. The truth of this proposition is very\napparent and clear today, particularly in the areas of\nenvironment, development and international peace and\nsecurity.\nWe in Malawi recognize the importance of protecting\nthe environment for the sustainable livelihood of all the\npeople. The Government of Malawi participated in the\nnineteenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted\nto the overall review and appraisal of the implementation of\nAgenda 21, held in this very Hall from 23 to 27 June 1997.\nWe trust that having candidly taken stock of the state of\nimplementation of Agenda 21, and taking into account the\nshortfall at mid-decade, the international community will\nnow redouble its efforts to fulfil its commitments in the\nnext five years and beyond. The common and differentiated\nresponsibilities that were agreed upon at the Earth Summit\nregarding the protection and preservation of the\nenvironment in order to achieve sustainable development\nwere reaffirmed and accentuated, once again underscoring\nthe importance of international cooperation. We will play\nour part in the protection of the environment for the benefit\nof present and future generations.\nThe critical socio-economic situation of Africa\ncontinues to be an area of priority concern to us. More\nthan one year after the United Nations System-wide\nSpecial Initiative on Africa, the situation still leaves\nsomething to be desired \u2014 though there are, of course,\nsome hopeful signs for improvement. We find\ngratification in the fact that African ownership of African\ndevelopment is becoming a reality. We look forward to\nthe consolidation of a global partnership for Africa.\nMalawi appreciates the assistance that it receives from the\ndonor community. There is absolutely no doubt that\nincreased international assistance and initiatives for debt\nrelief or cancellation, increased official development\nassistance to meet agreed targets, private capital flows,\nincreased foreign direct investment, and improved terms\nof trade would play a catalytic role in Africa\u2019s efforts to\nachieve economic development. The remarkable progress\nachieved in the areas of regional integration and South-\nSouth cooperation gives us hope. Africa is indeed not a\nhopeless case. A genuine partnership in development and\nfinance is, therefore, imperative.\nThe demise of the cold war rekindled all our\naspirations for lasting global peace and prosperity. The\nhighly symbolic tumbling down of the Berlin Wall\nheightened expectations for a peace dividend.\nUnfortunately, the situation has not improved. Today, the\nUnited Nations continues to utilize most of its resources\nin managing or containing conflicts of varying origins and\nintensity. The role of the Organization in the maintenance\nof international peace and security has become more\nrelevant than before. The situations in Angola, Burundi,\nthe Republic of the Congo, the Great Lakes Region,\nSierra Leone, Western Sahara, Afghanistan, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and the Middle East, among many others,\ncontinue to occupy the work of this Organization.\nIt certainly should be possible to resolve many of\nthese problems that beset the world so that the United\nNations can rechannel its efforts towards promoting the\nmost refreshing aspects of the human experience. And\nthere are many examples where the human spirit has\ntriumphed over forces of doom and despair.\nDevelopments in Liberia and in the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo are among the most recent examples.\nWe congratulate the people of Liberia on choosing\nthe way of peace. The role played by the United Nations\nObserver Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL), by the\nEconomic Community of West African States Monitoring\nGroup, and by other international observers in the\nLiberian peace and electoral processes once again\n25\n\n\ndemonstrates that a global partnership for the maintenance\nof international peace and security can succeed and is\nperhaps the only way forward.\nDemocracy, transparent and accountable governance\nand the protection and promotion of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms are necessary for successful people-\ncentred development to take place in our countries. It is\nunfortunate, though, that there are some around us today\nwho believe that they can continue to deprive their own\npeople of their birth rights and freedoms. We deeply regret\nthat in Sierra Leone a military junta that usurped power\nfrom a democratically elected Government is still holding\non, in spite of the international community\u2019s opposition.\nMalawi calls upon the junta to hand over power to the\ndemocratically elected Government and President Kabbah\nso that the people of Sierra Leone can experience the peace\nthat has eluded them for so long.\nThe situation in Burundi continues to be as depressing\nas it was last year. We remain convinced that there is no\nalternative to freedom and democracy. We strongly urge the\npeople of Burundi to set aside their differences and\nnegotiate so that they may put in place a Government that\nwould bring that country once again to normalcy.\nMy Government has followed closely developments in\nthe painstaking peace process for Angola. We have admired\nthe magnanimity of the Government of Angola in fulfilling\nits obligations under the Lusaka Protocol and related\nagreements. We on the other hand regret the continued\nintransigence of Dr. Jonas Savimbi and his National Union\nfor the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). While\nsupporting wholeheartedly the Security Council resolutions\non the situation in Angola, we make an earnest appeal to\nthe UNITA leadership to fulfil its obligations in the peace\nprocess without further delay so that the people of Angola\nand the entire southern African region may realize their\ndesire for a peaceful and prosperous future.\nWe similarly regret the recent developments in the\nRepublic of the Congo. We appeal to all the major players\nin this senseless struggle to exercise restraint and amicably\nresolve their differences. The Congolese people definitely\ndeserve much better.\nWe note with growing concern the apparent lack of\nmeaningful progress in the implementation of the settlement\nplan for Western Sahara. Malawi applauds the indefatigable\nefforts of the United Nations in its search for a lasting\nsolution to Western Sahara. It is our sincere hope that the\nrecent appointment by the Secretary-General of Mr. James\nBaker as his Personal Envoy for Western Sahara will help\nin the resolution of that problem. We call upon the main\nactors to honour their obligations without further delay.\nMy delegation is gravely concerned about\ndevelopments in the Middle East. A few years back, we\nhailed the Middle East peace process as having acquired\nirreversible momentum. Malawi strongly believes that\nthere is no alternative to the peace process launched in\nMadrid on 10 October 1991; there is no cogent alternative\nto this process for genuine peace and stability in the\nMiddle East. However, recent developments have\nobviously shown that any provocative moves by any of\nthe parties concerned will not help the process. We appeal\nfor the utmost restraint and the quick resumption of\nnegotiations.\nMy Government is similarly pleased to note that the\ntwo Governments on the Korean peninsula are working\ntogether, although in a limited sense. It is our hope that\nthis is a starting point from which a lasting solution to the\nexisting tensions on the peninsula will be realized.\nIn recent years the world has made major strides in\nthe field of disarmament. The adoption last year of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was indeed a\nmajor breakthrough for all peace-loving nations. For\nMalawi, however, the recent adoption of the Convention\non the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\nTransfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their\nDestruction stands out as most significant. Our resolve to\nroot out an evil that has adversely affected the lives of\nmany in the world shall remain undeterred. The support\ngarnered for the Convention within a short period of time\nis a clear sign of what human beings can achieve when\nworking together for a common goal. We welcome the\nConvention and look forward to its universal acceptance.\nThe United Nations today stands at the threshold of\na new millennium. We pray that it continues to play its\nrightful role in the many issues that occupy us all in our\neveryday life. As we approach the twenty-first century,\nthe relevance of the United Nations in enhancing\ninternational cooperation in all areas of human endeavour\nis, to us, no longer a matter of doubt but reality. We\nbelieve that the reforms we all desire will harness the\ngains already made in the area of international\ncooperation. We all seek a United Nations that responds\neffectively and efficiently to the needs of all people.\nLet me reaffirm the commitment of the Government\nand the people of Malawi to the noble goals and ideals of\n26\n\n\nthe United Nations, an institution that continues to make a\ndifference for humankind. We will continue to make our\nmodest contribution to this intergovernmental process, for\nwhich we find no credible or viable alternative to its service\nto \u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAs I\ntake the floor on behalf of the delegation of the Republic of\nBenin, I would like first to associate myself with the words\nof congratulations and deep appreciation expressed to Mr.\nHennadiy Udovenko by previous speakers. They spoke so\neloquently that I will confine myself to saying how hopeful\nI am that this session will benefit from his proven\ncompetence and his remarkable analytical mind in order to\ndraw from our debates constructive conclusions that\npreserve a just balance between the different suggestions\nand recommendations contained in the various statements.\nThe particular significance and nature of this session\ndo not reside only in the impressive gathering of leaders\nfrom 185 Member States. That has long been customary,\nand has even become ritual, during this period every year\nsince the establishment of the United Nations in 1945.\nWhat confers on this fifty-second session a distinctive\ncharacter, and what promises it an excellent place in the\nannals of the United Nations, is the central focus of its\nagenda, which, as we all know, is devoted to structural\nreform.\nWhat is our assessment of the specific reform\nprovisions that are to be discussed and decided upon in the\ncourse of these meetings? What are the ins and outs of\nreform, the issues at stake and the real objectives? Are the\nreforms capable of giving the Organization the means for\nproductive and effective action to meet the complex\nproblems and numerous challenges on the horizon of the\nnext millennium, whose effects are already strongly felt in\nthe everyday realities of today\u2019s world?\nThese are a few of the major concerns of countries,\nsuch as mine, that are today experiencing both hope and\ndoubt: hope based on the enormous potential of our Earth,\nwhose intelligent, rational and well-directed use should\nmake it possible to ensure the progress, prosperity and\ndevelopment to which all peoples legitimately aspire; but\nalso doubt, a feeling of stubborn and profound uncertainty\nconstantly fuelled by misery and poverty, ignorance and\ndisease, technological lags, and the economic\nbackwardness that over 1.5 billion human beings suffer\nfrom.\nSince his election in January 1997 our Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, has resolutely tackled, with\ncommendable diligence, strength and motivation, the\npreparation of a programme for reform, which he himself\nrightly describes as\n\u201cthe most extensive and far-reaching reforms in the\nfifty-two year history of this Organization.\u201d\n(A/51/950, Letter of Transmittal, first paragraph)\nIt is reform aimed at giving the United Nations\n\u201cthe ways in which the United Nations can more\neffectively and efficiently meet the challenges that\nlie ahead as we enter a new century, and a new\nmillennium\u201d. (ibid.)\nWe regard as appropriate the global approach taken\nby the Secretary-General, his view of general and sectoral\nproblems, the thrust of the measures and solutions he\nadvocates, in accordance with a methodology that\ncombines pragmatism and the need for democratic and\nmore effective functioning. Therefore, the delegation of\nBenin is in favour of the bulk of the proposals in the\nreport.\nNonetheless, I must draw attention to the following\nconsiderations to which my country attaches great\nimportance.\nFirst, Benin believes that it would not be appropriate\nto eliminate the Committee for Development Planning,\nwhich is, inter alia, entrusted with developing the\nperformance criteria for the least developed countries. We\nbelieve that rather than having it replaced by groups of\nexperts created by the Economic and Social Council we\nshould consider purely and simply retaining the\nCommittee.\nSecondly, since the situation in Africa is one of the\npriorities on which the Secretary-General would like to\nfocus in the next five years. My country would hope that\nthe Office of the Special Coordinator for Africa and Least\nDeveloped Countries might be strengthened in terms of\nhuman and financial resources in order to be better able\nto play a full role within the United Nations system.\n25\n\n\nThirdly, although on 20 June 1997, following over\nthree years of negotiations, the General Assembly adopted\nthe Agenda for Development, it is regrettable that the\nSecretary-General\u2019s reform programme made no mention or\nexplicit reference to mechanisms and means for\nimplementation and assessment of the Agenda. My\ndelegation hopes that this question will be taken into\naccount in the framework of measures envisaged in order\nto bring about the renewal of the Organization.\nLastly, I would like to anticipate the results of our\nsession by saying that, both individually and collectively,\nwe must firmly commit ourselves to implement the\ndecisions and measures that will be taken in the framework\nof this long-awaited reform.\nOur consensus will be not a triumph for the ideas of\none State or group of States over another, but, rather, the\nfruitful result of a shared political resolve to adapt our\nuniversal Organization to the changes and developments of\nthis end of the century period.\nHere, and with specific reference to reform of the\nSecurity Council, Benin strongly recommends that the\nfollowing principles should be taken into account: an\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council truly\nreflecting the political and economic configuration of\ntoday\u2019s world; equitable geographical representation of the\nfive regional groups, with the African group entitled to four\nseats, two permanent and two non-permanent; and\nprotection of democratic and transparent functioning,\nultimately involving the elimination of the right of veto.\nBy formulating the 15 priority objectives of his reform\nprogramme as a series of profound changes of major scope\nwhich should enable the United Nations to embark\nresolutely on a course of radical reform, the Secretary-\nGeneral produced a document of undeniably high quality,\nwhose title \u2014 \u201cRenewing the United Nations\u201d \u2014 is\nsignificant in more than one respect.\nGiven the noble and legitimate aspirations of the entire\ninternational community for the future of the planet, the\nOrganization certainly needs to be renewed in order to\nconfront effectively and successfully the exciting yet\ndisturbing challenges posed by globalization. Renewing the\nUnited Nations requires a new vision of the world, new\nconceptions and approaches to partnership among nations,\nand new methods for the Organization and for handling\nrelations among States in a new world. That is the real\nproblem. Those are the real stakes at a time when we are\ninexorably approaching a new millennium. Globalization is\nboth a phenomenon and a process; it has become the\nrecurrent and omnipresent theme of all debates and of all\nconcerns.\nLike other members, I noted with particular interest\nthat President Clinton \u2014 first at the Waldorf Astoria hotel\non the evening of 21 September, then the following day\nin this Hall \u2014 forcefully and germanely stressed the need\nfor the United Nations to ensure that the globalization of\nthe economy does not create deep disparities between rich\nand poor and that it establishes innovative partnerships\nbetween the private sector, non-governmental\norganizations and international financial institutions.\nAs the representative of a least developed country,\nBenin, I cannot but welcome this great and noble idea,\nimbued with generosity, pragmatism and a spirit of\nsolidarity. But, looking the facts in the face, what do we\nsee?\nWhen on 18 December 1991 the General Assembly\nadopted the United Nations New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s, it created a new\npolitical covenant, one of whose vital features was the\nprinciple of shared responsibility and the international\ncommunity\u2019s full and complete involvement with Africa\nwith a view to achieving development objectives\nincluding a real growth rate of at least 6 per cent per\nannum in gross domestic product, and a minimum net\ntotal of $30 billion in official development assistance for\n1992, with an annual increase averaging 4 per cent\nbeginning in 1993.\nToday, six years after the adoption of the New\nAgenda, in spite of all the efforts of African countries to\nmake better use of official development assistance, and in\nspite of the express intention of a number of developed\ncountries to support the development of Africa, the total\nvolume of official development assistance to Africa has\ndeclined considerably: by about one third compared with\nthe forecast of $30 billion.\nIt was in this context of the decline in official\ndevelopment assistance that the famous United Nations\nSystem-wide Special Initiative for Africa was launched in\nMarch 1996 in order to lend fresh momentum to the New\nAgenda. But it is obvious that this great initiative can be\nsuccessful only with the support of the international\ncommunity, through a massive mobilization of financial\nresources to carry out the programmes and projects that\nhave been set up. While, to be sure, it is first and\nforemost up to the African countries to make the greater\n26\n\n\npart of the effort, the excessively restrictive procedures and\nconditionalities for the granting of loans, and the lukewarm\nreaction of certain creditors to the idea of simply cancelling\nthe foreign debt of poor countries, are obstacles to the\neffective mobilization of the expected financial resources.\nIn a publication issued at Washington just a few\nmonths ago, in May 1997, the International Monetary Fund\ndefined globalization as\n\u201cthe growing economic interdependence of the entire\nworld caused by an increase in the volume and variety\nof transborder transactions in goods and services, and\nin international capital flows, along with the rapid and\nbroad dissemination of modern technology\u201d.\nWelcomed by some, feared by others, globalization\nhas become an unavoidable economic reality for all nations.\nFor most experts and other analysts, this process marks the\nsuccess of the global spread of an economic liberalization\nthat began in Europe half a century ago with the Marshall\nPlan. In their view, it brings unprecedented possibilities to\nbillions of people all over the world.\nFor us in Africa, that optimistic vision needs to be\ntempered, for possibilities are not realities. So that it can\nbecome a reality, the harmonious pursuit of the\nglobalization process, in the context of real development for\nall those billions of people throughout the world, especially\nin Africa, necessarily presupposes a new international\nprogramme of solidarity and cooperation for the poor\ncountries, without which globalization will very soon\ntransform their regions into a poor and marginalized\nperiphery of a hyper-rich and hyper-developed world.\nIn fact, the developed countries are already doing a\ngreat deal for Africa, if we consider the sum total of the\nloans made to the continent through bilateral and\nmultilateral assistance. And yet, contrary to what statistics,\ncurves, graphs and growth rates would have us believe,\nAfrican populations have not yet felt any tangible\nimprovement of their standard of living in their daily lives.\nIn spite of all this, for the immense majority of Africans\nthe will to survive is stronger than despair, and hope\nprevails over resignation.\nThe ministerial meeting of the Security Council\ndevoted to Africa, held on the commendable initiative of\nthe United States last 25 September, led to a fruitful\nexchange of views that showed us a real will on the part of\nthe international community to become more actively, more\nsignificantly and more concretely involved in a new type of\npartnership with Africa in order to contribute to its\ndevelopment.\nThe signs of this real readiness on the part of the\ndeveloped countries have proliferated in recent years, as\nwe can see, inter alia, from the resolutions of the G-7\nadopted in Lyon and in Denver, assistance programmes of\nthe eighth European Development Fund, President\nClinton\u2019s initiative for a partnership for economic growth\nand opportunity and the Tokyo International Conference\non African Development (TICAD I), and so on.\nAll in all, it can be said that the will exists to help\nAfrica emerge from poverty and underdevelopment, that\nconcrete actions are being undertaken in this direction and\nthat new commitments are being made. Nevertheless,\nthere still remain, unfortunately, enormous problems, and\nAfrica continues to present to the world the desolate\nspectacle of endemic poverty, aggravated by crises and\nfratricidal conflicts.\nIn order to put an end to this distressing situation,\nAfrica\u2019s development partners should envisage a\ncomprehensive and integrated mechanism for flexible,\noperational and effective financing, free of bureaucratic\nimpediments and red tape, with the aim of establishing a\ncentralized funding entity to receive resources from all\nsources to be devoted to economic and social\ndevelopment.\nThe end of the cold war, the process of economic\nglobalization and the progressive realization of the\nconcept of sustainable development offer the opportunity\nfor profound change, calling into question some of the\ntraditional solutions and conventional answers to\ndevelopment problems.\nIn the dark centuries of the slave trade, Africa\ncontributed blood, sweat and the toil of its strongest arms\nto the building of the bases of the economy of the New\nWorld. The collective memory of humankind must not\nforget this important historical fact. Today the developed\ncountries have the moral duty to be as concerned as\nAfricans themselves about the destiny of Africa, not to\nabandon Africa along the roadside of globalization and to\nmake available to it part of their enormous material,\ntechnological and financial strength, in order to support\nAfrica\u2019s efforts in the struggle to emerge from\nunderdevelopment and to enter the modern age.\nIn order that the implementation of the United\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\n27\n\n\nthe 1990s (UN-NADAF), the United Nations System-wide\nSpecial Initiative on Africa, Agenda 21 and other\nprogrammes of action can be truly successful, it will be\nnecessary to establish a global system of operations and\nfinancing for Africa, like the Marshall Plan, which\ncontributed greatly to the reconstruction and economic and\nsocial recovery of Europe after the Second World War. The\nestablishment of this mechanism before the year 2000 will\nmake it possible for Africa to stride confidently, not slouch,\ninto the twenty-first century.\nShortly before the statement that was made on 5 June\n1947 at Harvard University by General George Marshall to\ndefine the foundations of his well-known European\nRecovery Programme, President Harry Truman stated:\n\u201cOur duty is to help free peoples to fashion their own\ndestiny in their own way. I believe that our assistance\nmust be first of all economic and financial, because\nthis is essential to economic stability and political\norder.\u201d\nFifty years later, this magnificent and noble spirit of\nsolidarity, displayed voluntarily by the great American\npeople and its Government, still retains all its validity and\nall its historical meaning.\nThere are cases in which, because of the requirements\nof its own unfolding, history repeats itself. Here at the end\nof a century, we are experiencing one such case: it is\nnecessary to meet the urgent need for a new Marshall Plan\nfor Africa. And the upcoming second Tokyo International\nConference on African Development (TICAD II) could\nprovide one of the best opportunities to do so.\nIf the international community works resolutely in this\ndirection, we will have laid the solid and indestructible\nfoundations for a road on which we will all be able to\nmarch triumphantly into the third millennium.\nFor its part the Government of Benin, while awaiting\nthe fulfilment of that hope, has developed the concept of a\nshared social minimum level in order methodically and\neffectively to take actions and measures aimed at\neliminating poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy,\nproviding adequate housing, guaranteeing productive\nemployment, improving standards and conditions of living\nand ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources. This\nconcept was the subject of an international symposium,\nsupported by the United Nations system, which was held in\nCotonou from 4 to 6 August 1997.\nThe consolidation of our process of democratic\nrenewal, which began after the historic National\nConference of the Active Forces of the Nation in\nFebruary 1990, necessitates immediate and short-term\nsocial and economic successes. That is why we are\nendeavouring, with our limited resources, to take\nmultifaceted actions to improve the living and working\nconditions of our rural and urban populations. However,\nwe know that we can rely on international cooperation,\nfounded not only on solidarity, but on mutual interest and\npartnership, to overcome the difficulties confronting us, to\nsupport our efforts at economic and social recovery, to\nbuild a State genuinely based on the rule of law and to\nconstruct a free, democratic, modern and prosperous\nnation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy delegation welcomes\nthe experience and expertise which Mr. Hennadiy\nUdovenko brings to the leadership of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly, and would like to applaud his\npredecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for his\noutstanding contribution during the fifty-first session.\nWe feel a quiet sense of elation that the Secretary-\nGeneral has emerged as the personification of the new\npossibilities of the United Nations. His recent succession to\nthe distinguished position of Secretary-General of this body\nis symbolic of the new vision and the new order which\nheralds our entry into the twenty-first century.\nOur historical moment is a defining one. Change has\nbrought us to the stage at which we can either transform or\nbe transformed. All of us \u2014 large as well as small nations,\nindividuals as well as Governments \u2014 are challenged to\nmake a decisive break with the old ways of doing and\nseeing things. The people of our planet continue to yearn\nfor justice, equality and fairness. The human spirit\ncontinues to thirst for all that is good and beautiful. The\nsoul of humankind is still seeking to reinvent itself in ways\nthat are noble, kind, compassionate and caring. That is the\nnew wave that is beginning to swell on the cusp of the new\nmillennium, and we can discern its gathering momentum in\nthe emotive milestones of the past few months. The\nexpression of universal public grief infused with private\nintensity over the deaths of Mother Teresa and Diana,\nPrincess of Wales and the donation of $1 billion by Ted\nTurner to United Nations charitable causes \u2014 these are the\naffirmations of the emergent humanist temperament of the\nnew age.\nIn these times, this body must welcome the inspiration\nof those who, by their example, generosity, selflessness and\ncourage, seek to protect the defenceless in a bid to reshape\nthe horizons of our common humanity. It is a global wave\nsweeping local shores as well as distant ones. In my own\ntropical corner of our global village, Saint Lucia, on 23\nMay 1997 the people elected a new Government with a\ndecisive mandate predicated on a vision of hope, change\nand possibility.\nThe wave of people\u2019s aspirations at the national level\nis faced with its own counter-turbulence in the conduct of\nrelations among States. Arrayed against this popular\nimpulse for humanism in affairs of state is the assertion of\nall that has been selfish, greedy and exploitative. The\npowerful continue to parade their might without any regard\nfor others. They exercise their influence without any\ncompassion, and accumulate their wealth without any\ncharity.\nThe icons of free trade, market liberalization and\neconomic liberalism represent the hardening of the\narteries of human conscience in the sphere of commerce.\nThe movement away from concerns of social and\neconomic justice to the preoccupation with market forces\nand economic rationality is leading inexorably to a new\nworld order at odds with the impulse of the world\u2019s\nbillions for a more caring and compassionate world.\nAt the level of the international system, we are\nwitnessing a rolling back of the structures of social\nresponsibility, the progressive erosion of the capacity to\nrespond and the annihilation of the will to act humanely.\nWe see the inability to care for the welfare of the people,\nthe apathy towards their growing material deprivation and,\nmost frighteningly, the calculated institutional insensitivity\nto the plight of the disadvantaged who wish to continue\nto earn with dignity and by the sweat of their brows.\nThere is no better example of this callous disregard\nthan the situation facing the African, Caribbean and\nPacific (ACP) countries, and in particular the banana\nproducers of the Caribbean. Only last month, the small\nbanana-producing countries of the Caribbean Community\nreceived a particularly harsh and crushing blow, when the\nappeals board of the World Trade Organization (WTO)\nupheld an earlier finding that the preferential treatment\naccorded in the European market to bananas of the\nMember States of the ACP contravened World Trade\nOrganization rules on free trade.\nThe intent behind the current move towards\nglobalization as manifested in the World Trade\nOrganization is evidently most commendable. Indeed,\nSaint Lucia was among the founding members of the\nWTO. We were led to believe that the World Trade\nOrganization would help raise the living standards of our\npeoples and, by emulating the ideals of the United\nNations, would promote fairness in world trade. It was\nour hope that it would end, once and for all, the law of\nthe jungle as the dominant feature of international\ncommercial relations. In short, it was hoped that the WTO\nwould establish a standard of arbitration premised on\nfairness, civilized negotiation of vital interests and the\ninculcation of equity in international trade and commerce.\nThe WTO ruling on the European banana regime is\nnothing short of a capitulation to the machinations of\nthose who are blinkered by free trade and sheer greed.\n22\n\n\nWe speak in these strong terms because the world\ncommunity must understand that the WTO, and the\ncomplainants to the European banana regime, completely\nand steadfastly ignored the fact that the import of its ruling\nis the economic and social destruction of a number of small\nMember States of this body that together enjoy a miniscule\n2.5 per cent of the world trade in bananas and only 5 per\ncent of the European market.\nConsider for a moment the flaws in the process\nthrough which the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement body sought\nto resolve this issue. The initial panel did not have a single\nrepresentative from a developing country, although the\nmatter was of utmost importance to developing countries.\nTo render fair play even more remote, the appellate board\nwas chaired by an American, despite the fact that the\nprincipal complainant was the United States of America.\nWhile that may have been permissible under the rules,\nsurely good sense and fairness should have dictated that it\nwas nothing but highly improper and undesirable. But then,\neven the nature of the major complainant was improper: the\nUnited States of America does not produce a single banana\nfor export. Yet, while it activated and participated in the\nproceedings, we, the banana-producing countries, were\ndenied the right to full participation and were relegated to\nthe sidelines as spectators.\nThe WTO has dismally failed to match up to the\ncommendable goals which inspired its creation. The\nimplementation of the ruling will bring about a generalized\nreduction in the living standards of our peoples and an\nacceleration of poverty.\nFar from providing reassurance of a civilized approach\nto resolving world trade disputes, the ruling leaves a\nlingering suspicion that \u201cmight\u201d will always be \u201cright\u201d and\nthat the strong and powerful will always be able to use the\nsystem to achieve their own ends, regardless of the human\ndislocation and suffering that result.\nIf the World Trade Organization is to be of any value\nto us small, developing countries, there must be a\nfundamental reform of its system of dispute settlement. This\nis essential, because the implications of the scope of the\nruling on bananas are not confined to bananas. The ruling\nraises questions about other import arrangements for\nagricultural goods as well as the future of trade and\ndevelopment cooperation agreements between rich and poor\ncountries. The real challenge to the WTO is not how\neffective its Dispute Settlement Body can be in rigidly\napplying the letter of its regulations, but, rather, whether the\nprocess by which decisions are arrived at is perceived as\nbeing fair. The system must be reformed so that it takes\naccount of the consequences of the implementation of its\nrulings. It must of necessity consider the impact of its\ndecisions, particularly when, as in the case of the ruling\non the banana regime, the affected countries have small,\nvulnerable and fragile economies.\nTrade and development must, in the final analysis,\nbe about the development of people. Therefore, the WTO\ncriteria for settling disputes must be redesigned to take\ninto account social, health, cultural and environmental\nissues. If national security issues can be raised as a reason\nwhy the law of one powerful country should not be\nbrought before WTO jurisdiction, then why should the\nWTO not take into account the special social and\neconomic circumstances of small, vulnerable countries in\nits dispute deliberations? What is the point of the WTO\u2019s\nDispute Settlement Body rigidly applying rules, when in\nso doing it takes decisions which are in direct contrast to\nthe very principles which justify its existence? In such a\nsituation the principles become worthless and the\norganization becomes amenable to manipulation.\nWe do not seek international charity for our banana\nfarmers. We seek only fairness and opportunity. We are\nnot irrevocably opposed to free trade, but we need fair\ntrade. We are a proud people seeking to earn our living\nin as honest a manner as the wealth of nations permits.\nThe nations of the European Union entered into a\npartnership for development with us when, together, we\nsigned the Lom\u00e9 Convention. We call upon them not to\ncast aside their solemn commitments and obligations\nunder that Convention, as they respond to those who want\nthis most unfair ruling by the World Trade Organization\nimplemented immediately and in its entirety. We are\nheartened by the statements made so far by the European\nCommission expressing the European Union\u2019s deep\nconcern about the negative political, economic and social\neffects of the WTO ruling on a number of countries from\nthe African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of\nStates. We take comfort from the Commission\u2019s\nexpression of its intention to take these factors into\naccount, and to stand by the European Union\u2019s\ninternational obligations and the principles of its\ndevelopment policy. We also welcome the statements of\nsupport for Caribbean banana producers from the\nEuropean Parliament and its call for the revision of the\ncriteria used by the WTO in the resolution of trade\ndisputes. We look forward to working with the European\nUnion to find a formula which will allow us continued\naccess to the banana market in a manner which will\n23\n\n\npermit our farmers to continue earning a decent and\ndignified living. We urge the European Union to be\nsteadfast in protecting the spirit and substance of its\nobligations under the Lom\u00e9 Convention, to remain\ncommitted to ensuring development and equity in\ninternational economic relations, and to remain faithful to\nits ACP friends.\nSuch are the challenges confronting those who are\nsmall and weak, yet proud. It is within such a context of an\nuncertain international system that my country has to shape\nits foreign policy. The changing characteristics of the\ninternational system have necessitated that we redefine the\nboundaries of our alliances. We must look beyond the sea\nof uncertainty to the mountains of possibility. The\ncontemporary confluence of forces challenges us to create\nnew relationships to assist in our social and economic\ndevelopment. Having been forced out of our traditional\npartnerships, we must find new friends and reconstruct\nrelationships. In this process, we must be guided by the\nimperative of finding and mobilizing new sources of\ninvestment that are predicated on creating new paths to\nsustainable growth.\nFor us, foreign policy is about building bridges to\nother people, other cultures and other markets. It is about\ncontributing to the emergence of a new climate of tolerance\nand international understanding; it is about matching\ndomestic need with international possibility. Consistent with\nthese basic principles, Saint Lucia has proceeded in a\ndirection in which the majority of the States of the world\nhave already gone by establishing diplomatic links with the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China.\nSaint Lucia will always cherish the principles of\nrespect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and the rule of\ninternational law. All countries, regardless of size, must\nhave the comfort of these irrevocable principles and be\nsecure in the confidence that the conduct of nations will be\nguided by them.\nIt is in the context of these basic principles that we\nurge the United States of America to re-examine some of\nits recent policies towards the States of the Caribbean. Its\nlead role in the challenge to our banana marketing regime\nhas damaged our peoples\u2019 confidence in its declarations of\nfriendship. Its new immigration laws are causing\napprehension and dislocation for thousands of persons who\noriginated from the Caribbean, and is eroding the bridges\nbetween our peoples. The imminent deportation of persons\nwho have lived for decades in the United States will create\na humanitarian problem of mass proportions. This is no\nlonger a domestic matter. The consequences for the\nhuman rights of those affected have transformed it into a\nsubject for international concern.\nIn addition, the deportation of persons who have\nbecome hardened criminals to lands they do not know as\nhome is further rocking the social and economic fabric of\nour democracies. If there is a law of unintended\nconsequences, the United States of America must accept\nthe negative repercussions of its policies. It must therefore\nembark on corrective action to undo the damage which\nthese policies have unleashed on the peoples of the\nCaribbean community.\nIt is our concern for fairness, equity and\ndemocratization in the conduct of international relations\nthat has caused Saint Lucia to embrace and support the\nprocess of reform of the United Nations itself. Saint Lucia\nfirmly believes that if the United Nations is to adequately\naddress the challenges of the coming century, then three\nthings must happen.\nFirst, Member States must honour their financial\nobligations to the body. Saint Lucia continues to believe\nthat the United Nations financial crisis can be alleviated\nif all Member States, large and small, rich and poor, do\nso in a timely manner, without conditions. A United\nNations that is financially weak, that lurches from one\nbudget crisis to another, is in no condition to confront and\novercome the challenges facing mankind. If there is to be\nfinancial reform, then the precarious financial existence of\nthe United Nations must be consigned to the dustbin of\nhistory.\nSecondly, the United Nations itself must take steps\nto become more efficient and effective. We need a United\nNations where waste is abhorred, where the churning out\nof documents for documents\u2019 sake, at a cost of millions\nof dollars, is no longer a priority. We need a United\nNations that is leaner, but more capable of making the\nmaximum use of its resources.\nThirdly, the United Nations must become more\nresponsive to the needs of all its Member States. For the\nmajority of the United Nations Member States, the need\nis for sustainable development, for the eradication of\npoverty and of illiteracy. We need a United Nations that\nwill show an even greater sensitivity to those needs.\nThe United Nations must also answer the call for\nwider representation of the world peoples on the Security\nCouncil. Saint Lucia wishes to reiterate its support for an\n24\n\n\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council to\nreflect the universal membership of the General Assembly\nand to ensure the balanced representation of the developing\nworld.\nSaint Lucia applauds the initiatives of the Secretary-\nGeneral in his proposals to reform the United Nations to\ninspire greater confidence in its potential. Saint Lucia is\nparticularly interested in the proposed \u201cdividend for\ndevelopment\u201d, and welcomes the idea that a large portion\nof United Nations resources should be allocated to\ndevelopment, particularly to meet the needs of developing\ncountries. It is our hope, however, that this proposed\n\u201cdividend for development\u201d will not become like the peace\ndividend \u2014 a noble idea that is yet to materialize.\nIt is a moral responsibility of those who are strong to\nprotect the weak and vulnerable. The international\ncommunity, through the United Nations, must accept its\nresponsibility to establish and maintain mechanisms that\nwill protect the small, vulnerable economies of this world\nas they seek to build sustainable economies for the twenty-\nfirst century.\nSaint Lucia has begun to do its part through the\ndiversification of its economic base, through action to\nreduce unemployment, poverty, population growth and to\nimprove the educational standards of our peoples. We, too,\nwant to be better placed to exploit the new employment\nopportunities provided by the revolution in information and\ncommunications technology. But the United Nations must\nalso play its part by not forgetting that small island\ndeveloping States like Saint Lucia have peculiar needs that\nit must be vigilant to protect.\nWe applaud the work being carried out by the\nCommonwealth on updating its report on the vulnerability\nof small States and in revising the Vulnerability Index of\nSmall States, and we welcome the new report, \u201cA Future\nfor Small States Overcoming Vulnerability\u201d.\nSaint Lucia notes the preparation being made for the\nspecial session of the General Assembly in 1999 to review\noutstanding chapters and issues of the Barbados Programme\nof Action. However, we must express our disappointment\nover the lack of progress in implementing the Programme\nof Action, and Saint Lucia urges the international\ncommunity to support the mobilization of external resources\nto implement the plan.\nIn recent times, the vulnerability of small States to\nnatural disasters could not have been more clearly\ndemonstrated than in the case of the Caribbean island of\nMontserrat, whose very existence is threatened by an\nintermittently raging volcano. Since the fifty-first session\nof the General Assembly, the situation in Montserrat has\ndeteriorated. Half of the island\u2019s population has had to\nflee. The plight of the people of Montserrat is a human\ntragedy that the world ignores because, once again, its\nsetting is another small island State which seems to be in\na remote corner of the international community. The\npeople of Montserrat badly need sympathy, understanding\nand support.\nThe establishment of a Caribbean family of nations\nis a historical imperative for Saint Lucia. For this reason,\nwe shall continue to strengthen the integration process in\nthe Caribbean and the closer association of our peoples.\nWe have a vision of the entire Caribbean Basin merging\nas one nation, becoming one family, irrespective of the\ndivision of language, size, trade and political traditions\nand relationships. We may be small, but we are making\nour contribution to the enhancement of civilization.\nThe noble ideals and goals of the United Nations\nand its Charter will be meaningless if the international\ncommunity fails to protect small, vulnerable developing\ncountries like Saint Lucia from the predatory actions of\nthose who seek to destroy the livelihood of our peoples in\nthe name of free trade. These lofty goals will be hollow\nif, in the rush to espouse globalization and the\nliberalization of trade, the special circumstances of the\nsmaller, poorer States of this world are scorned, and their\nspecial needs are bulldozed and smashed by the injustice\nof international tribunals and the myopia of richer States.\nSaint Lucia does not wish to be trapped in a cycle of\ndependence. It merely wishes to be given the opportunity\nto be self-sustaining in this global order.\nThe noble aspirations of the United Nations will\nrank among the greatest failures of the twentieth century\nif, by failing to be involved in the control of the process\nof globalization, it allows its smaller, poorer Members to\nbe marginalized. The goal of sustainable development\nmust not be allowed to become yet another myth of our\ntimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn my address to this noble\nAssembly last year, I drew attention to the significance of\nvirtue and, furthermore, to the enhancement of the release\n11\n\n\nof the power which resides in virtue, through the supply of\nappropriate means. Moreover, I invited reflection on the\nquintessential sameness of all humankind and urged that\nthis, together with a genuine commitment to virtue, be\nadopted as the guiding principles of the General Assembly\nas it addresses and deliberates upon the realities of human\ninteraction in our contemporary world.\nAs it is for any individual society or nation, so it is for\nthe international global community. Ethics is the science\nwhose aim is to produce the good man and woman, while\npolitics is the science which aims at fashioning the good\nsociety. Thus, politics must be founded upon and\nunceasingly informed by ethics.\nDoubtless this is an ideal. Nonetheless, it is an ideal\nwe must constantly strive to achieve if we are to realize\npeace within and among our nations \u2014 peace, which was\ndescribed by Thomas Aquinas as the tranquillity of order.\nIn this era of accelerating change in so many areas in\nevery portion of our diverse global community, it is of\nsingular importance to the well-being of each of our\nindividual national communities, as it is for the overall\ninternational global community, that we recognize, observe\nand be faithful to those values and principles which,\ninherently, are unchanging.\nOne such unchanging value is that of right \u2014 moral\nright: what Plato conceived of as the virtue of justice, and\nwhat in Roman law was characterized as the jus, or moral\nlaw. Indeed, it is rather significant that Plato perceived the\nwhole function of education as being to elicit the best\nthings that are latent in the soul, and to do so by directing\nthe soul to the right things.\nI am highly honoured and deeply pleased to address,\non behalf of the Government and the people of Grenada,\nthis Assembly at its fifty-second regular session, during the\ncourse of which change must be a transcending theme, as\nalso must be the initiation, institution and prudent\nmanagement of change in the pursuit and conduct of\ninternational affairs.\nOn behalf of my delegation, I express to this\nAssembly the warm greetings of the Government and the\npeople of Grenada. I also express our sincere\ncongratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on his accession to the\noffice of Secretary-General, as well as on his manner of\naddressing the duties deriving therefrom. We rejoice in his\ndemonstration of virtue, and we believe that his profound\nknowledge of the United Nations augurs well for his\nleadership in pursuance of international peace and\nsecurity.\nMy Government is heartened by his commitment to\nthe reform of the Organization and is reassured by his\nefforts to fashion a more effective and efficient United\nNations system. We are hopeful that one of the benefits\nwhich will accrue from such an improved system will be\nthe enhancement of the economic viability of small\ndeveloping States, such as ours; and we further hope that\nhis efforts to realize the system envisaged will not be\nfrustrated by the withholding of the substantial overall\npayments which are due.\nMy delegation joins me in extending warm\ncongratulations to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine on\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-second session. We commend Mr. Razali Ismail\nof Malaysia for his exemplary conduct of the proceedings\nof the fifty-first session.\nThe rapidly changing global environment presents\ngrave challenges to small States, especially small island\nStates such as Grenada. It also does so for the United\nNations, whose very institution was prompted by the\nadoption of the ethic of a confraternity of nations\ninformed by a common subscription to the concept of the\nempowerment of virtue through the furnishing of adequate\nand appropriate means in order that right might prevail in\nthe international community.\nIn this latter regard, attention is especially invited to\nthe notion of global trade and liberalization as it is\ncurrently regulated by the World Trade Organization\n(WTO), with its inherent inconsistencies, which operate\nto the disadvantage of the smaller economies. The WTO\nrules relating now to the products of agriculture and agro-\nindustry bear testimony to the injustice inflicted upon\nthose of us who live and labour within the confines of\nsmall economies \u2014 witness the recent ruling on bananas,\nwhich underscores the insensitivity displayed by way of\nthe challenge which triggered it.\nMoreover, the Uruguay Round Agreements require\na massive legislative agenda on Grenada\u2019s part \u2014 as they\nundoubtedly do for most developing countries. Our\nnational laws in the areas of trade in goods and services\nas well as intellectual property must be reviewed and\nextensive legislative changes made. Thus we must acquire\nthe necessary legal expertise to work on this project until\nimplementation is fully accomplished - and all this by the\nend of the year 2000.\n12\n\n\nWe shall, of course, make full use of the assistance\nthat is available through WTO as well as that offered by\ninternational bodies such as the World Intellectual Property\nOrganization (WIPO).\nNonetheless, it must be explicitly stated that, in\nGrenada\u2019s view, the Uruguay Round Agreements have\ncreated for small developing States significantly more\nburdens than the benefits they are proclaimed to bring\nunder the banner of global free trade \u2014 at least now, and\nfor the foreseeable future, unless corrective measures are\nsoon instituted.\nMy Government continues in its efforts to restructure\nthe Grenada economy and is pursuing a programme of\neconomic diversification. This involves broadening and\nenhancing sectors such as agro-processing, light\nmanufacturing, crafts, services \u2014 including offshore\nfinancial services \u2014 tourism and agriculture.\nNevertheless, my Government is deeply aware that the\nsuccess of its economic policies will depend significantly\non the support of the multilateral financial institutions and\nalso of friendly countries in respect of training and the\ndissemination of knowledge and skills, as well as the\nsetting up of enterprises and facilities that are strategic to\nsecondary economic growth.\nAccordingly, my Government is pleased to have\nrecorded in the annals of the Assembly, its gratitude for,\nand appreciation of, the assistance which Grenada has so\nfar received, as well as that which we are currently\nreceiving, from the European Union through the Lom\u00e9\nAgreement, and from other friendly countries.\nDespite constraints such as I have referred to, as well\nas others, my Government continues in its efforts to\nstimulate employment and enhance employability. In the\nlatter regard, we are now in the process of institutionalizing\non-the-job training for our unemployed youth, whilst\nexpanding our formal programmes for skills training. As for\nstimulating employment, special emphasis is being placed\non self-employment \u2014 and this by way of fostering the\nsmall enterprise and micro-enterprise sectors. For we are\nconvinced that the development of these sectors is crucial\nto our preferred process for national development. We\nbelieve that through such endeavours our people will grow\nin dignity and self-reliance.\nMy Government will continue to provide an enabling\nenvironment for the private sector to thrive and expand.\nAnd we seek the active partnership of the multilateral\ninstitutions as well as of the international community,\nthrough joint ventures, technological transfers and\nfinancial and technical assistance to provide the impetus\nto sustained economic growth.\nDemocracy and good governance can flourish only\nin an environment of peace \u2014 an environment\ncharacterized by the tranquillity of order; not an order that\nis imposed, but an order which springs from mutual trust\nand mutual regard amongst the individuals who compose\nthe particular society; an order which is constantly\nrevitalized and continually enhanced by mutual love; an\norder which resonates to the truth that \u201cMy origin is their\norigin, my conscience is their conscience, my contention\nis their contention, and my pilgrimage is their\npilgrimage\u201d. In this context, we invite attention to the\napparent emergence recently of terrorism in the Caribbean\nregion, with the bombings in Cuba.\nThe kind of order referred to would inherently\ninvolve individual social and economic well-being: true\nprosperity, individual and societal.\nAt the international global community level, such\norder is realizable only by way of a concept and praxis\nfor a new global human order such as was enunciated by\nthe late President Cheddi Jagan of Guyana and\ncorroborated by the leaders of the Group of 7 countries in\ntheir communiqu\u00e9 \u201cMaking a Success of Globalization for\nthe Benefit of All\u201d (A/51/208, annex II).\nThe pursuit of true politics in relation to the\nfashioning of the confraternity of nations requires that we\nstrive to institute such a new global human order.\nWithin the compass of such a global human order,\nthere inevitably would be the eradication of the crippling\nand strangulating debt burden which afflicts so\ndevastatingly the very poor and so dehumanizingly the\npoorest countries of our world. So also would be action\nagainst environmental degradation, and towards\nsustainable economic development, especially in the\npoorer countries and particularly in small island\ndeveloping States.\nSimilarly, as to the eradication of poverty\nworldwide \u2014 and, in this regard it is fitting that I repeat\nhere the observation of the Right Honourable Clare Short,\nUnited Kingdom Secretary of State for International\nDevelopment:\n13\n\n\n\u201cA world that has one in five of its people living\nin abject poverty is certainly not just and it is also\ndangerously unstable\u201d.\nNatural disasters, particularly in small island States,\nrequire special concern on the part of the confraternity of\nnations. The devastation recently experienced in Montserrat\ntrumpets the need for a United Nations programme to deal\nwith the aftermath of such natural destruction.\nGrenada welcomes the recent United Nations initiative\nin respect of Haiti, and salutes every country participating\nin this noble endeavour, as well as the United Nations and\nits officers, whose vision informed that initiative.\nWe welcome also the steps towards achieving peace\nbetween parties in countries in Central America, and we\napplaud them. Indeed, as the current Chairman of the\nAssociation of Caribbean States, Grenada rejoices in such\naction. For, through the Association, we in the Caribbean\nregion seek to widen and deepen the process of integration\namongst the island States of the Caribbean and those\nmainland States whose shores are lapped by the Caribbean\nSea \u2014 and this includes Cuba.\nMy Government is acutely mindful that poor States are\npeculiarly vulnerable to the violation of their territorial\nintegrity, since they can ill afford the wherewithal to ensure\nnon-encroachment in the vicinity of their borders. And the\nlarger such poor continental States are, the greater that\nparticular vulnerability.\nSimilarly, for small island States, in particular those of\nthe Caribbean, where the threat is not so much to territorial\nintegrity but to security, that threat is posed by those\nengaged in the illicit business of narcotics trafficking, both\nby way of buying and selling. Our small island States of\nthe Caribbean have become primary and secondary\ntransshipment centres en route from the large producers to\nthe commensurately large consumers. My Government\ntherefore asks earnestly that this noble Assembly address\nthis matter in accordance with the ethic of the true politics\nrelating to the overall international community of\nhumankind.\nThe current United Nations International Drug Control\nProgramme is indeed commendable, and Grenada is pleased\nto be actively participating in it at the pace we can best\nafford.\nNonetheless, it cannot but be admitted that this\nProgramme does not offer, much less provide, the\nprotection which is needed for our people \u2014 particularly\nour youth \u2014 against the ravishment of drug use and the\nblight which eventually afflicts the small-scale\ntransporters, or so-called mules. Surely this process of\ntransshipment can be severely curtailed, if not completely\neradicated, through planned, concerted international\naction.\nMy Government\u2019s concern for youth and children is\nnot confined to Grenada. Nor is it limited to our brothers\nand sisters in the Caribbean Community or in the\nAssociation of Caribbean States. Our concern embraces\nyouth and children everywhere. Accordingly, we condemn\nthe exploitation of youth and children in any form. We\nsay no to the abuse of children for pornography and\nprostitution.\nMy Government welcomes the recent conclusion of\nthe Convention on the comprehensive banning of anti-\npersonnel landmines, and we urge a significant\nacceleration in the controlled destruction of those mines\nwhich are relics of campaigns of war of one scale or\nanother.\nIn relation to the Security Council, Grenada\nunequivocally supports its expansion in a manner such as\nwould facilitate the realization of true politics in the\noverall international community. This, we believe, would\ninvolve an increase in both the permanent and non-\npermanent categories of membership.\nBoth such increases, in our view, should be\ncharacterized by a significant presence of developing\ncountries. For, in Grenada\u2019s view, what is required in the\nreformed Security Council is not more of the same kind\nof distribution of perception, but more equity among the\ncomponent parts of the spectrum of perception.\nThe very notion of equity inevitably calls forth the\nnotion of justice. In the context of justice in the United\nNations, there arises quite effortlessly the case of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan. To all who subscribe to the\nprinciple of the right of a people to self-determination, the\ncase for membership in the United Nations for the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan is a compelling one.\nIndeed, it is incontestable. For, some 50 years ago, these\npeople chose self-determination. They voted with their\nfeet as they moved from their homes on mainland China\nto the island of Taiwan, and today 21.3 million people\npractise democracy in the Republic of China on Taiwan.\nTheir economic achievements are well and widely known,\n14\n\n\nas is their willingness to participate in the international\ncommunity as a Member of the United Nations.\nWhat more is required for the Republic of China to be\nadmitted to United Nations membership? One may well\nask. My answer: justice. The mention of justice evokes\nrecollection of two very insightful observations which\ndeserve to be shared in this noble Assembly. First,\nReinhold Niebur, in his Foreword to \u201cThe Children of Light\nand the Children of Darkness\u201d, offered the following\ncomment on justice:\n\u201cMan\u2019s capacity for justice makes democracy\npossible; but Man\u2019s inclination to injustice makes\ndemocracy necessary.\u201d\nWell might we enquire as to the origin of this\ninclination to injustice. But the success or failure to identify\nthat origin notwithstanding, an effective manner of dealing\nwith that inclination is provided by Plato\u2019s construct for\neducation, which is centred on exposure of the soul to the\nright things.\nAnd second, in his Foreword to Allan Bloom\u2019s\nthought-provoking study on American higher education \u2014\nthe number-one bestseller of its time, one decade ago, Saul\nBellow offered a view that is particularly pertinent to the\nnotion of exposure of the soul to the right things. Saul\nBellow contends that:\n\u201cIn the greatest confusion there is an open channel to\nthe soul ... The channel is always there, and it is our\nbusiness to keep it open, to have access to the deepest\npart of ourselves \u2014 to that part of us which is\nconscious of a higher consciousness ... The soul has to\nfind and hold its ground against hostile forces,\nsometimes embodied in ideas which frequently deny\nits very existence, and which indeed often seem to be\ntrying to annul it altogether.\u201d\nThe Assembly may well ask, \u201cHow does the soul hold\nits ground?\u201d My reply: through virtue and constant\nexposure to the right things. Let right prevail.\nMay God bless the President of, and everyone\nparticipating in, this fifty-second regular session of this\nnoble Assembly, which through His grace will be a\ntransforming blessing to our world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I would like to extend to Mr.\nUdovenko our most sincere congratulations on his\nelection to the high office of President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-second session, as a representative\nboth of a neighbourly and friendly country and of a\nregion that has significantly increased its presence in the\nUnited Nations family in recent years. At such a decisive\nmoment for the future of our Organization, he has a\nmandate of high responsibility and I offer him our full\nsupport.\nIt is a great honour for me to address, for the first\ntime, this prestigious forum, with its wide participation\nand global vocation, in my capacity as the representative\n17\n\n\nof a coalition Government that arose 10 months ago in a\ndemocratic transition of power. From the outset, I would\nassure the Assembly that the new Romanian Government,\nin its strategy of consolidating the rule of law and a free-\nmarket economy, means to cooperate with and rely on the\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies. We are\ninterested in making the Organization capable of reacting\nmore rapidly and efficiently to the current needs of Member\nStates and to the new global challenges at this twilight of\nthe millennium.\nA few weeks ago, the Romanian Government, with\nsupport from the United Nations Development Programme,\nconvened in Bucharest the third International Conference of\nNew or Restored Democracies. The Conference focused on\nthe link between democracy and human centred\ndevelopment, both as a subject and as the target of political\naction, a theme of great interest that is currently enjoying\ntop priority on the United Nations agenda.\nIn my capacity as Acting President of the Conference,\nI have the honour to submit to the Assembly\u2019s attention the\ndocument containing its proceedings and results.\nGovernment representatives from 77 States and, for the first\ntime, non-governmental actors of civil societies, along with\n14 international organizations, examined in a constructive\nand positive manner the current status and future issues of\nthe process of consolidating their democratic systems and\nadopted by consensus a review and a set of\nrecommendations, distributed as an official document of the\nGeneral Assembly at this session.\nThese recommendations spell out the need for good\ngovernance and for broad participation by civil society in\nthe democratic exercise, as well as for strengthening\ndemocratic institutions in order to face the challenges\ngenerated by globalization, corruption and organized crime.\nAt the same time, Romania believes that it is of the utmost\nimportance to ensure the continuity of the Bucharest\nConference\u2019s efforts and its practical consequences. That is\nwhy, in keeping with the recommendations advanced in\nBucharest, we suggest that a follow-up mechanism be\nestablished for the consolidation process of new or restored\ndemocracies.\nWe plan to continue consultations with the Secretary-\nGeneral and with interested States and international\norganizations on these themes and on the proposal to\nconvene a summit of the new or restored democracies in\nthe year 2000.\nI am confident that the results of the Bucharest\nConference will act as points of reference in the debates\nof the current session. We shall work for the adoption by\nthe General Assembly of a resolution reaffirming the\nsupport of the United Nations system for the efforts of\nGovernments to consolidate the new or restored\ndemocracies.\nIn line with the collective commitment we made at\nthe United Nations fiftieth anniversary ceremonies, we are\namong those who believe that the strengthening of the\nOrganization\u2019s capacity to respond adequately to the new\nneeds and challenges of the twenty-first century is of\nhighest priority. It is in the interests of our Organization\nto achieve, even at this session, realistic and balanced\nresults, of mutual interest and the widest possible benefit,\nto enhance its credibility and viability. We welcome the\nSecretary-General\u2019s report on a programme for reform\nand we assure him of our confidence and support in\nachieving its objectives.\nWe associate ourselves with the European Union\u2019s\nposition. Indeed, reform should be not a cost-cutting\nexercise, but rather a matter of strengthening the\nOrganization\u2019s role as an active and efficient world\nforum. Our objective is to make the United Nations more\nefficient, more transparent, more responsible and, last but\nnot least, more credible.\nWe also believe that the dividends obtained through\nbetter financial and personnel management \u2014 the so-\ncalled \u201cdividends of reform\u201d \u2014 should be reallocated to\ndevelopment activities for the developing countries. It is\nin this spirit that the delegation of Romania will take part\nin the reform process and cooperate with all interested\ndelegations in identifying solutions enabling the General\nAssembly to reach a general agreement on a coherent and\nconstructive response to the Secretary-General\u2019s\nproposals.\nWe have the opportunity today to live in a world\nawakened from the cold-war nightmare that divided us\nirreconcilably into friends and enemies, a world of\ncommunications and interaction in which closed societies\ncannot survive. Increasing globalization should help us to\nknow each other better and bring us closer together to\nbuild common projects. We are even invited to rethink\nour global society, the relations among us and the\ndirection of our political actions. A new political\nphilosophy, the philosophy of partnership, asserts itself in\nthe context of relations between States, whereby what a\n18\n\n\ncountry gains is added to and not deducted from its\npartner\u2019s benefit.\nThis philosophy was promoted in the last half century\nin European and Euro-Atlantic structures, with\nacknowledged positive results in the field of stability and\ncooperation on the continent. This is also why Central and\nEastern European countries are naturally keen to integrate\nthemselves into such structures.\nThat is also the philosophy Romania uses as a basis in\ndeveloping a solidarity and cooperation policy at the\nsubregional, regional and international levels aimed at\nconsolidating and activating stability in its geographic\nregion and throughout the world. We have tried fully to\nnormalize relations with our neighbours, and we have\nproposed trilateral cooperation plans to our partners in the\nregion. At the same time, we launched the idea of reviving\nthe traditional commercial routes to Northern Europe and\nCentral Asia. The same concept of building a network of\ncommunication and mutually beneficial cooperation is the\nbasis for the development of economic cooperation in the\nBlack Sea region and for our involvement in the Central\nEuropean Initiative, the Central European Free Trade\nAgreement, the Southeast European Cooperative Initiative\nand so forth.\nThe participation of Romania in the United Nations\npeacekeeping Mission in Angola, in the stabilization efforts\nof operation Alba in Albania and in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, under the auspices of the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO), are testimony to our political\nwillingness to act as a stabilization factor. At the same\ntime, I would like to point out that Romania is ready to\nincrease its contribution to the Stabilization Force (SFOR)\nin Bosnia and to contribute to other similar actions, such as\nthe United Nations Preventive Deployment Force\n(UNPREDEP) in the former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia and other forces that remain necessary in that\narea.\nAll these efforts to establish an environment of\nconfidence and cooperation that generates peace and\nsecurity in Central and South-East Europe, as well as in\nsome hot spots of the world, reveal not only a new\napproach, but also a new stage that Romania is passing\nthrough on its way from totalitarianism to democracy. In\nthe current \u201cpost-transition\u201d phase, the results achieved in\nthe democratic processes and economic reform, which have\nbeen recognized by the international community and\nfinancial institutions, qualify Romania legitimately to play\na clearer and more active role in defining and designing\ncommon projects of security and progress in the region\nand in the world, including within the United Nations and\nits specialized agencies.\nI would like to make a few remarks on some other\nimportant items on the agenda.\nFrom the experience we have gained in our region\nand in neighbouring regions \u2014 Central and South-East\nEurope, the Middle East and the Caucasus \u2014 it can be\nconcluded that poverty, the absence or weakness of\ninstitutions that are characteristic of the modern\ndemocratic State and distrust are among the causes of\ncrises and conflict situations. Specific steps by the United\nNations system and the entire international community are\nrequired to eradicate poverty. They should be aimed at\nsupporting the countries of the region that are confronted\nwith this phenomenon so that they can increase their\nproduction through the adequate use of their own specific\nresources and economic capabilities. Hampering such a\nprocess can have only negative consequences in the field\nof security and stability.\nWith regard to strengthening institutions that are part\nof a State based on the rule of law, it is necessary to\ncreate, alongside rapid-reaction forces for peacekeeping,\na so-called civilian rapid-reaction force to support the\nestablishment of institutions capable of maintaining State\norder and coherence in an open and free society.\nBuilding up confidence involves dialogue and\ncommunication, as well as the elimination of any form of\nisolation. The United Nations should be efficiently\ninvolved in the dismantlement of terrorist infrastructures\nall over the world. At the same time, it is necessary to\ngive up rhetoric and spectacular gestures in favour of\ndirect negotiations between the interested parties, in a\nquiet and discreet atmosphere.\nWe would like to point out the importance Romania\nattaches to dialogue conducive to solutions negotiated by\nthe parties directly involved, be it in the Middle East,\nCyprus or the former Yugoslavia. It is our firm belief,\nparticularly since our latest political contacts in the\nMiddle East and in Bucharest, that the resumption of\nnegotiations between the interested parties, based on the\nprinciples agreed in the Madrid and Oslo accords, is the\nonly way to achieve an equitable and lasting peace in the\nregion.\nWe welcome and support the recent United States\ninitiative, as well as the efforts of other countries, to\n19\n\n\nunblock the peace process. We also welcome the direct\nnegotiations, under the auspices of the United Nations,\nbetween the two communities of Cyprus with a view to an\nequitable and lasting solution to the Cyprus issue, and we\nexpress our willingness to take part in the peacekeeping\noperation in that country.\nAs main guarantor of peace and international security,\nthe United Nations should play an active role in crisis\nprevention and management, using preventive diplomacy\nand, when necessary, peacekeeping operations. Romania\nwill support such United Nations actions and intends to\ndiversify its contribution by including civilian components\nin its contributions.\nIn the field of arms control and disarmament, we\nconsider that the United Nations can and should set an\nexample of change in concept and approach that go beyond\nthe vestiges of the bloc mentality and lead to arms control\nand disarmament solutions capable of ensuring global\nsecurity, with the existence of several centres of economic\nand cultural power. We attach special importance to nuclear\nnon-proliferation issues, including the negotiation of a\ntreaty to ban the production of fissionable materials for\nmilitary purposes, the implementation of the Chemical\nWeapons Convention, the United Nations Register of\nConventional arms and the processes aimed at banning anti-\npersonnel landmines.\nThe debates on economic and social issues should\ncreate the foundations for the necessary relaunching of the\nNorth-South dialogue on development, as such issues have\nbeen largely ignored in the context of the political\ndevelopments subsequent to the collapse of the Soviet bloc\nand the end of the cold war or on matters linked to the\nexpansion of NATO and the European Union. Our debates\nwill have to take into account the recent trends in world\neconomy \u2014 such as high rates of growth, far exceeding\nthose of gross world product achieved by world trade;\ntransportation; and the volume of direct investment and\ninternational financial transactions \u2014 and the necessity of\nensuring a wider access of goods produced in developing\ncountries to the developed countries\u2019 markets and enhanced\ncooperation on third markets. All these elements call for a\nconceptual reconsideration of the development process that\ngives due attention to the social component and ensures the\nparticipation of the main actors: Governments, private\nsectors, transnational corporations and civil society. In this\nrespect, we suggest that thought be given to the idea of\nsetting up a social solidarity fund to help disadvantaged\npersons and support the integration of unemployed and\nmarginalized persons into productive activities.\nThe Romanian economy has reached macroeconomic\nstability, by decreasing the inflation rate and the\nbudgetary deficit, and started structural reform, in\nparticular in the agricultural sector. Consistent efforts are\nbeing made to speed up privatization and attract foreign\ninvestors. With all this going on, we are interested in\nparticipating in a debate that can highlight measures\nenvisaged by Governments for what the Managing\nDirector of the International Monetary Fund recently\ncalled \u201csecond generation reform\u201d, which will focus on\nmicroeconomics and social protection policies.\nWe believe that development assistance requires new\nand increased mobilization from the international\ncommunity, and we favour enhanced coherence in the\ncountry programmes undertaken by United Nations bodies\nand funds, and more efficient use of resources allocated\nfor development.\nIn view of the new threats facing our societies and\ninstitutions, we support measures aimed at strengthening\nthe capacity of the United Nations in international drug\ncontrol and the fight against corruption and organized\ncrime. We welcome the establishment in Vienna of a\nsingle Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, as\nwell as the convening, in 1998, of a special session of the\nGeneral Assembly on drug control. Furthermore, we\npropose consideration of the United Nations declaring an\ninternational year for the fight against corruption and\norganized crime. This major issue could also be the\nsubject of a special high-level segment of the General\nAssembly. Our objective is to elaborate and put into\npractice international cooperation instruments that enable\nus to work together to protect ourselves and eradicate\nthese scourges.\nWe shall soon begin preparations for celebrating, in\n1998, the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights. Let us take this opportunity to reaffirm\nour firm commitment to the universality of all human\nrights, whose promotion and protection should always\nremain a priority for the United Nations. We support the\nmeasures envisaged by the Secretary-General to\nstrengthen the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights and we welcome the\nappointment of the former Irish President, Mrs. Mary\nRobinson, as High Commissioner.\nWith regard to administrative and budgetary\nquestions, the Romanian delegation is in favour of the\nSecretary-General's proposals for the regular budget for\nthe 1998-1999 biennium, with the understanding that the\n20\n\n\nreductions will not affect the future capacity of the\nOrganization to fulfil its mandate. We support the efforts to\nimprove the Organization's financial situation and place it\non a sound and predictable footing. It is particularly\nimportant that, through open and constructive negotiations,\nwe achieve feasible solutions with regard to the future\npayments of arrears and a new scale of assessments for the\nregular and peacekeeping budgets, thus reflecting the new\nrealities and real capacity to pay of each State.\nFinally, I assure the Assembly, once again, of the full\ncooperation of the Romanian delegation in our joint efforts\nto strengthen and enhance the efficiency of the United\nNations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a great pleasure for me to congratulate you, Sir, on\nyour outstanding election. Your competence and your vast\nexperience in multilateral diplomacy, to which you have\ndevoted a large part of your professional life, together with\nyour personal qualities assure us that our work will be\nconducted properly and be successful.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay a\nwell-earned tribute to Ambassador Razali of Malaysia for\nthe effective way in which he conducted the fifty-first\nsession of our General Assembly.\nI congratulate, also, the members of the Bureau, who\nI am convinced stand ready to do their utmost to ensure\nthe success of this important session.\nIt is in fact an important session because, upon the\ninvitation of the Secretary-General, it is being devoted\nlargely to an exchange of views, which I hope will be\nproductive, on the reform of the Organization.\nThe document before us, entitled \u201cRenewing the\nUnited Nations: A Programme for Reform\u201d, is of the\ngreatest interest to my country's authorities. The desire to\nmake the Organization, and above all its Secretariat, more\nefficient by improving the coherence and coordination of\nits activities is the very judicious inspiration for the\nproposed reform process. That desire is easy to\nunderstand and endorse, given its obvious responsiveness\nto current real needs.\nDuring the 52 years of its existence, the United\nNations has regularly been challenged by the requirements\nof an ever changing world and has thus been led to\ndevelop or create new structures \u2014 without, however,\nalways reducing or suppressing old ones.\nThe current exceptionally broad changes in the\npolitical, economic and social spheres irresistibly call for\na profound transformation of multilateral cooperation.\nThey require the Organization to make an ineluctable\n\n\neffort to adapt that cannot be delayed without jeopardizing\nits prestige and seeing its international role inexorably\nwither. Thus, we can only endorse the will demonstrated by\nthe General Assembly at the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations and the recent initiatives undertaken. In our\nview, it is rational to concentrate and better coordinate the\nOrganization's missions around the five great pillars of its\nCharter responsibilities: international peace and security,\ndevelopment, humanitarian affairs, economic and social\naffairs and human rights.\nThe promotion and protection of human rights, which\nthe Secretary-General very rightly proposes to strengthen,\nreceive the intersectoral treatment which their\nmultidisciplinary nature naturally evokes. That nature must\nnot allow us to forget, however, that this fundamental area\nof the Organization's competence requires the strengthening\nof its appropriate structures. The High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, who has just assumed\nher office \u2014 and whose arrival we welcome sincerely and\nconfidently \u2014 must be given sufficient human and financial\nresources, as well as the decision-making autonomy,\nnecessary to fulfil the essential duties that have fallen to\nher.\nNext year's celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights should be an\nopportunity to recall the commitments undertaken by the\nMember States when they adopted that text on 10\nDecember, 1948, and, a few years later, on 16 December\n1966, the two international human rights agreements which,\nI am pleased to say, the Principality has recently ratified.\nThe Emergency Relief Coordinator entrusted with\nhumanitarian assistance must also enjoy the greatest\nautonomy and the means necessary to allow him to\nintervene effectively and promptly when necessary \u2014 a\ntask that the Government of the Principality accords the\nhighest priority.\nThis autonomy must, more generally, touch the entire\ninternational civil services. The independence of United\nNations agents \u2014 the Secretary-General first among\nthem \u2014 is the guarantee of the quality of their service and\nof the trust which the international community places in\nthem.\nThe decision to bring together all the field\nprogrammes and information centres in common premises,\nto be known as United Nations Houses, is both rational and\nsymbolic. It is an ideal response to the current needs to\nconcentrate and better coordinate operational activities,\nwhile promoting a strong and cohesive image of the entire\nsystem. We strongly encourage the Secretary-General to\npursue this approach, which has recently been undertaken\nin South Africa.\nFor those States that will not have the opportunity to\nhost such Houses, might we not consider establishing a\nUnited Nations presence in the form of a volunteer\nhonourary representative: a national figure mandated,\nalongside the authorities, to disseminate information and\nheighten general awareness? The widespread practice of\nappointing honourary consuls could, in this respect, serve\nas an example.\nThe special team dedicated to reorienting\ninformation activities highlights, in the Secretary-\nGeneral's report, a need which we understand: to improve\nand enlarge the United Nations capacity to communicate\nat the country level through innovative local partnerships.\nThe establishment of honourary United Nations\nrepresentatives would be one way to follow up that\nsuggestion on a practical and affordable level.\nAs the Secretary-General points out, public interest\nin the United Nations could also be sharpened by the\norganization of high-level thematic debates within General\nAssembly bodies. We agree with this, given that such\ndebates would receive more attention from the press and\npublic opinion than those currently held and would lessen\nthe need for large world conferences.\nThe Security Council has already taken steps to\nimprove information services and exchanges with Member\nStates that are not members of the Council and with the\ninternational community at large. These steps are useful\nand welcome and are beginning to bear fruit.\nThe important question of enlarging the membership\nof that principal organ, which depends on a decision from\nthe Member States, is also of great interest to us. The\nHigh-level Working Group on that subject has worked\ntremendously hard under the leadership of successive\nPresidents of the General Assembly and the dedication of\nits Vice-Presidents. We convey to them our warmest\nthanks. The Principality of Monaco is ready to endorse\nunreservedly any commitment or solution that might be\nachieved, including the creation of long-term seats lasting\nsix to 10 years, for example.\nIn tandem with the improvement already begun in\nthe functioning of the Economic and Social Council, some\nconsidered attention also appears to be necessary to the\n2\n\n\nTrusteeship Council. The suggestions made by the\nSecretary-General seem to us to be wise and far-sighted.\nThe Principality of Monaco could support the idea of\nentrusting that organ with new trusteeship responsibilities\nin the spheres of the environment and the protection of the\ncommon human patrimony. Outer space, the atmosphere,\nthe high seas, as well as the free zones of the Arctic and\nAntarctic \u2014 especially in the spirit of the 1959 Treaty \u2014\nwould all stand to gain, under certain conditions, by being\nplaced within its competence. The Council might also be\nentrusted with the ongoing task of considering the great\ntransformations that would be entailed by predictable\nadvances in science and technology.\nWe must hope that the proposed reforms will be\nspeedily enacted, so that the Millennium Assembly\nproposed by the Secretary-General for the year 2000 will\nindeed be an occasion for celebrating an updated and\nmodernized United Nations.\nThe Principality, which this year is celebrating the\n700th anniversary of my family's dynasty in Monaco, can\nonly wish long life to a United Nations strengthened and\nmore open to civil society.\nTurning now to the nearer future, allow me to\nemphasize the importance that my country attaches to\nconcluding the work on the international criminal court,\nwhich should lead to a plenipotentiary diplomatic\nconference next year in Rome. A collective morality that is\nuniversal in scope cannot exist without institutions to\ndisseminate it, implement it and ensure its respect.\nThe adoption of a Convention on anti-personnel\nlandmines, which continue to inflict their savagery on\ncivilian populations, has long been one of our goals. Is not\nrespect for the dignity and physical integrity of human\nbeings one of the most essential and universally recognized\nvalues, one that underlies both human rights and\nhumanitarian law?\nThe meeting convened by Canada last October and the\nseries of meetings held in Vienna, Bonn and Brussels this\nyear, as well as the diplomatic conference that recently took\nplace in Oslo have led to the drafting of a text, which, in\nthe spirit of resolution 51/45 S, prohibits not only the use\nbut also the development, stockpiling and transfer of such\nmines. We truly welcome this development.\nIn the same vein, I should like to note that the\nPrincipality has recently submitted its instruments of\naccession to the Convention on Prohibitions or\nRestrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons\nWhich May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to\nHave Indiscriminate Effects, a Convention that we believe\nconstitutes great progress in the rules of warfare.\nNext year will be the International Year of the\nOcean, for which we are making active preparations. The\nmarine environment laboratory of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency in Monaco has recently moved\ninto new, spacious and functional offices made available\nto it by our Government. That laboratory, thanks to its\nmodern equipment, is helping to identify sources and new\nchemical markers of marine pollution. It regularly\norganizes training courses and consultative missions, and\nit is actively contributing, with the assistance of the\nUnited Nations Environment Programme and the\nIntergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, to the\nMEDPOL programme to combat pollution in the\nMediterranean \u2014 an issue of great interest to us.\nThe International Year of the Ocean should provide\nan opportunity to strengthen such programmes as well as\ninternational cooperation to promote the preservation and\nmanagement of marine resources, including certain fish\nstocks and marine mammals. At the nineteenth special\nsession of the General Assembly on the environment last\nJune, many delegations emphasized these issues. Echoing\nthe Commission on Sustainable Development, some quite\nrightly recalled the need regularly to assess, on an\nintergovernmental level and in the framework of the\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the\nquality of the marine environment. This has been done for\nalmost 20 years in France, Italy and Monaco under the\nRAMOGE programme. We hope that other regional\ncooperation activities of this nature will develop in 1998.\nFor coastal States as well as for the international\ncommunity, the oceans and the seas must be a protected,\nshared space, sparingly exploited \u2014 not a place for\nintense economic confrontation.\nFinally, like the European Union, whose views on\nmany issues we share, the Principality of Monaco remains\nvery concerned by the continued financial crisis in the\nUnited Nations. This crisis can be resolved only if\nMember States comply strictly with their commitments\nand pay in full, on time and without conditions their\ncontributions to the regular and peacekeeping budgets as\nwell as all accumulated arrears.\n3\n\n\nAs a member of the International Olympic Committee,\nI am pleased once again to remind the Assembly that the\nWinter Olympic Games will be held next February in\nNagano, Japan. The General Assembly at its fifty-first\nsession invited Member States, through resolution 50/13, to\nrespect a truce before, during and after both the Summer\nand Winter Olympic Games. Building a peaceful and better\nworld through sport and the Olympic ideal must remain our\nmotto at that great international meeting of the youth of the\nworld.\nFinally, I should like to convey my deep sorrow,\nshared by my father and by the people of Monaco, at the\nloss of lives resulting from the forest fires \u2014 an ecological\ncataclysm \u2014 that are raging in Sumatra, Indonesia, and\nfrom the air disaster that occurred in Maden this morning,\nas well as at the tragic results of last night's earthquake in\nthe Italian peninsula. I should like to extend, on my own\nbehalf and on behalf of my father and the people of\nMonaco, our deepest condolences and sympathy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI have the pleasure at the outset to extend to the\nPresident and his friendly country, Ukraine, my sincere\ncongratulations on his election as President of the fifty-\nsecond session of the General Assembly. In wishing him\nsuccess in conducting the proceedings of this session, I\nwould like to assure him of my delegation's readiness to\ncooperate with him in making his task a success and in\nachieving the desired objectives of the session.\nIt is also my pleasure to commend the dedicated\nefforts of the President's predecessor, Mr. Razali Ismail, in\npresiding over the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly, and to express the thanks and appreciation of the\nState of Bahrain to him and to his friendly country,\nMalaysia.\nI would like to take this opportunity to express the\nState of Bahrain's appreciation for the tireless and sincere\nefforts that the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has\nmade since his appointment and of the great attention he\npays to international issues and, to the reform of the\nOrganization and strengthening its role in the maintenance\nof international peace and security. By virtue of his\nextensive experience in the United Nations, he has gained\nexpertise in both international politics and the management\nof the Organization.\nI would be remiss in this connection if I did not\nexpress appreciation for the endeavours of the former\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and for his\nefforts and accomplishments with regard to reform of the\nOrganization.\nWe do not believe there has been in the history of our\nmodern world a period more harmonious with the spirit of\nthe United Nations or more expressive of its orientation\nthan the current period. Had the Organization not been\nestablished half a century ago by a farsighted initiative of\nthe founding Member States, it would have been incumbent\nupon the international community to proceed to create it\nnow, at this important juncture in history. This is because\ncurrent international developments relevant to various\naspects of human life require the existence of such an\nOrganization, which, by its composition and nature, and\nguided by its Charter, is equipped to handle world affairs,\nin the spirit of one great family. Not a single international\nissue is now beyond the scope of the Organization.\nThe impression that the role of the United Nations\nhas become marginal or marginalized in the wake of the\ncold war \u2014 true as it might be in certain isolated and\nlimited situations and cases of international action \u2014 does\nnot, in our conviction, reflect thoroughly and\ncomprehensively the current stage of our world's history\nor the aspirations of all its States. Such aspirations require\nthe existence of a world organization that is active and\neffective, not only in political and security affairs, but\nalso, and increasingly so, in civilizational, developmental,\neconomic, environmental, cultural and intellectual affairs.\nFor increasingly, now that they have become the focus of\nattention of all nations, big and small, those non-political\nmatters influence world affairs and the life and direction\nof peoples much more than political matters do.\nWe have followed with interest the work of the\nGeneral Assembly's Open-ended High-level Working\nGroup on the Strengthening of the United Nations System\nand carefully studied the Secretary-General's report\n(A/51/950) to the General Assembly, \u201cRenewing the\nUnited Nations: A Programme for Reform\u201d, which he\nsubmitted on 14 July. We express our appreciation for the\nSecretary-General's invaluable efforts regarding the\nreform process, and the measures and recommendations\ncontained in his report, and we would also welcome any\nGeneral Assembly actions that would reflect the general\nattitude of Member States vis-\u00e0-vis the reform process\nthat meets the current requirements and desires of\nMember States. My country is both interested in, and\nappreciative of, the work of the Open-ended Working\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security Council\nand Other Matters Related to the Security Council, in\nview of the great increase in the United Nations\nmembership. It should also be pointed out that it is in the\ninterest of the reform process that the work of the\nSecurity Council be transparent so that all other Member\nStates which are not members of the Council are aware\nof the latter's proceedings with regard to the reform\nprocess.\nBahrain has presented its candidacy for Security\nCouncil membership for the period 1998-1999 in the\nelections that will take place during this session, based on\nthe provisions of the Charter that allow participation for\nall Member States. The history of civilization has shown\nus that a number of smaller countries and peoples have,\nnot less than the larger nations, taken the lead in progress,\n12\n\n\ndevelopment and creativity. The independent policy which\nthe State of Bahrain has pursued throughout the 26 years\nthat it has been a Member of the United Nations, has\nqualified its candidacy as meriting the support of the Group\nof Asian States for the non-permanent seat allocated to that\nGroup.\nMoreover, Bahrain has a long record of constructive\nparticipation in support of United Nations activities and in\nsupport of the rights of peoples to independence, freedom\nand self-determination, in opposing apartheid and in\nsupporting decolonization. It has also been actively\ninvolved in the work of the United Nations system and\norgans dealing with the fields of disarmament and\neconomic and social development. In addition, Bahrain has\nbolstered Security Council efforts in the field of\ninternational peace and security, particularly in the Arab\nGulf region, which prompted the Secretary-General to pay\ntribute to that role to which he referred in paragraph 816 of\nhis 1996 annual report on the work of the Organization. He\nsaid:\n\u201cThe Government of Bahrain's support for the\nCommission's [the United Nations Special\nCommission] Field Office has been outstanding and\nremains essential to the continued logistics lifeline to\nthe activities of the Commission\u201d (A/51/1, para. 816).\nFurthermore, the State of Bahrain hosts a number of\nUnited Nations regional offices, including, in addition to the\nUnited Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) Field\nOffice, the offices of the United Nations Development\nProgramme, the United Nations Environmental Programme,\nand the United Nations Information Centre.\nThe State of Bahrain welcomes the endorsement its\ncandidature for Council membership has received from the\nAsian Group, the Group of Arab States and the member\nStates of the Gulf Cooperation Council, to which it belongs.\nBahrain, noting the overwhelming support of the Member\nStates, will have the pleasure to declare, when elected to\nthe membership of the Council, that it will do its utmost, in\ncooperation with other Member States, to fulfil its duties\ntowards the achievement of international peace and security\nand the upholding of the principles embodied in the Charter\nof the United Nations.\nThrough its experience in its region and larger area,\nmy country has played, since the early years of the\ntwentieth century, a significant and leading role in the\ndevelopment of civilization, culture and society, in\nmodernizing management and the economy, and in\nconsolidating the bases of an advanced civil society \u2014 a\npioneering role to which any objective historian of the\ndevelopment of civilization in the Gulf region will attest.\nThe question of regional security remains of crucial\nimportance to the State of Bahrain, in view of the\ndangerous ramifications and impacts it has on the\nsecurity, stability and safety of peoples and nations. The\nsituation in the Gulf region, which has witnessed in recent\nyears two devastating wars that have upset the region's\npeace and stability and delayed the implementation of\nnumerous development and construction projects, requires\nthat all the States of the region and the world Powers\nwith vital interests in the region promote and strengthen\nrelations among the States of the region on the basis of\ngood neighbourliness, mutual respect, non-interference in\nthe internal affairs of others and recognition of every\nState's national sovereignty.\nThe territorial and boundary claims currently\nwitnessed in the Gulf region, aim at changing the\nestablished and traditionally accepted boundaries,\ndisturbing the security and stability of the region. We\nbelieve that the optimum and most judicious course to\navoid that prospect is to respect the status quo; to refrain\nfrom any claims, total or partial; and to settle any\nconsequential disagreements by peaceful means acceptable\nto the parties to the dispute.\nInsofar as the situation between Iraq and Kuwait is\nconcerned, the State of Bahrain, being keen on the\nmaintenance of security and stability in the Gulf region,\nstresses that Iraq should fully comply with the\nrequirements of international legitimacy and uphold its\ncommitments under relevant Security Council resolutions,\nincluding those relating to the release of prisoners and\ndetainees of Kuwaiti and other nationalities. Bahrain is\nalso keen on ensuring the unity and territorial integrity of\nIraq and opposes any interference in Iraqi internal affairs,\nas any such interference is considered a violation of the\nsovereignty of a Member State of the Organization.\nThe State of Bahrain also expresses its satisfaction\nthat the oil-for-food agreement between the United\nNations and Iraq is alleviating the suffering of the\nbrotherly Iraqi people.\nIn the same context, the continued occupation by the\nIslamic Republic of Iran of the three islands, Greater\nTunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, all of which belong to\nthe United Arab Emirates, constitutes an important cause\nfor anxiety and concern to the State of Bahrain and the\n13\n\n\nother member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council, in\nview of the occupation's serious consequences for the\nsecurity and stability of the region and the effect it has on\ngood-neighbourly relations among the States of the region.\nConsequently, the State of Bahrain calls upon the\nIslamic Republic of Iran to respond urgently to the calls of\nthe United Arab Emirates to resolve the question of the\nislands through serious bilateral negotiations or through any\nother available peaceful means for the settlement of\ndisputes through reconciliation among States.\nThe ominous setbacks and impediments that have\nbeset the Middle East peace process which threaten that\nprocess and pose dangers to the entire region are but the\nresult of Israel's non-adherence to the basic premises\nunderlying the process since the Madrid Conference in 1991\nand to the agreements which emerged from the negotiations\nthat followed between the parties concerned. Only through\ncompliance with those commitments, which are based on\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and\n425 (1978), the implementation of the land-for-peace\nprinciple, and refraining from any actions that contravene\nthose commitments, can there be a viable basis for getting\nthe peace process back on its proper track and the\nachievement of progress on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks\nas well. A just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the\nregion is not conceivable without the return of the occupied\nterritories to their owners and the recognition of the\nPalestinian people's right to have their own independent\nstate on their own national soil, with Jerusalem as its\ncapital.\nFor a just and comprehensive peace to be attained, it\nis essential that Arab rights be restored, in accordance with\nthe relevant United Nations resolutions, which call for the\ncomplete withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Syrian\nGolan, southern Lebanon and the occupied Palestinian\nterritories, including, most importantly, Jerusalem.\nThe State of Bahrain has endorsed the peace process\nsince its inception in Madrid in 1991. It has participated in\nall the committees that have been established in connection\nwith the process and has hosted a meeting of the\nenvironmental committee. This was in support of\nendeavours to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in\nthe region, which should be the strategic option of all States\nof that region. A just peace which can guarantee that\npeople's legitimate rights are restored is what will ensure\nsecurity, stability and prosperity for the region's peoples.\nThe continued strife in Somalia has brought\ndestruction and devastation to the Somali people. We\nreiterate our appeal to all warring factions to implement\nall agreements reached so far and to exert concerted\nefforts with a view to reaching a genuine and durable\nsolution to the problem in order to preserve the unity,\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence\nof Somalia. With respect to the situation in Afghanistan,\nwe call for an immediate end to the fighting among the\nsons who belong to the same homeland, for support of the\nefforts being made to this end, and for the achievement of\nnational reconciliation with a view to preserving the\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of\nAfghanistan without any external interference.\nThe State of Bahrain reiterates its support for the\nDayton Agreement concerning peace in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. It calls for full and complete\nimplementation of that Agreement and for the creation of\nconditions that allow for the voluntary return of refugees\nand displaced persons in complete safety and security.\nSuch steps would enhance national reconciliation and help\npreserve peace and stability in the region as a whole.\nAs we reiterate our support for the unity,\nindependence and territorial integrity of the Republic of\nCyprus, we welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General\naimed at the achievement of a just and practicable\nsettlement in accordance with relevant Security Council\nresolutions.\nThe international arena has witnessed terrorist acts\nwhose repercussions have gone beyond the boundaries of\nthe countries concerned. Violence has become so rampant\nand ferocious that it is possible to say that terrorist acts\nconstitute crimes against the world order, the vital\ninterests of nations, the peace and security of humanity\nand the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.\nThe spread of terrorism has caused the death of hundreds\nof innocent people and the destruction of public and\nprivate property, thus shaking internal stability and\nimpeding the normal development of relations between\nStates. Consequently, my country calls upon the\ninternational community to seek the best possible ways\nand means for the elimination of all serious crimes of a\nterrorist nature.\nIn this connection, the State of Bahrain expresses its\nsupport for the provisions adopted by the General\nAssembly in its relevant resolutions 49/60 and 51/210,\nand hopes that the international community will cooperate\nin the elaboration of a strategy for cooperation between\n14\n\n\nStates with a view to combating terrorism and not providing\nhavens to terrorist organizations. Furthermore, States should\nallow neither their territories nor their media to be used, nor\ntheir civil liberties systems to be exploited, to the detriment\nof other States.\nBahrain, being a party to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, is of the view that the\nTreaty should achieve universality without any\nconsiderations or exceptions restricting it. At the same time,\nit would like to stress that the Treaty, as a vital pillar for\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, should\nbe upheld, its provisions respected and its purposes pursued\ntill fulfilment. It considers Security Council resolution\n984 (1995), albeit limited in terms of safeguards, a first\npositive step towards the achievement of comprehensive\nsecurity safeguards for all non-nuclear-weapon States.\nBecause it believes that international cooperation is\nessential for ridding our world of all weapons of mass\ndestruction, the State of Bahrain ratified last April the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and\non Their Destruction. Convinced of the importance of\npeace, stability and mutual confidence in the Middle East,\nit has also endorsed the initiative aimed at establishing the\nregion as a zone free of nuclear and all other weapons of\nmass destruction.\nThe world economy is currently experiencing a period\nof growth which, according to the estimates of this year's\nWorld Economic and Social Survey, is expected to reach\n3 per cent this year. An observer of the economic\nconditions in developing countries, however, can perceive\nthe extent of the difficulties faced by those countries in\ntheir endeavours to raise their economic level to the bare\nminimum and so enable their citizens to live with dignity.\nThe close link between economic development and social\ndevelopment has become a cornerstone of the security and\nstability of societies, both in developing and developed\ncountries. Yet the rising social tensions that we witness in\nnumerous societies in developing countries, emanating from\neconomic problems, underlines the need to address and deal\nwith that phenomenon at the international level.\nWhen developed countries contribute to the\ndevelopment of the economic systems in developing\ncountries they do not, in so doing, merely assist those\ncountries; they also enable the developing countries to\nbecome an effective economic partner, which can assist the\ndeveloped countries in combating the scourge of\nunemployment, inflation and economic stagnation.\nThe inability to strike a balance between social and\neconomic issues and the preservation and management of\nthe resources needed for development, coupled with an\nincreasing emphasis on environmental protection, has\nundermined development, a cornerstone of Agenda 21,\nwhich was adopted by the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro in\n1992. It is therefore imperative that international\nagreements reached and commitments made during that\nConference be implemented, and that measures to speed\nup the implementation of the Agenda be identified\nwithout any need to reopen discussions on matters already\nagreed upon. The issues addressed by the nineteenth\nspecial session of the General Assembly last June, in\nwhich Bahrain took part, for the purpose of an overall\nreview and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21,\nwere more detailed and specific in so far as poverty\neradication and environmental protection are concerned,\nalthough the desired results have not been attained.\nThe destructive effects on humanity of drug and\npsychotropic substance abuse, production and illicit traffic\nare among the most serious challenges we face. We\ntherefore welcome the convening of a special session of\nthe General Assembly in 1998 to be devoted to this\nquestion and related crimes and to the achievement of\ntangible results in relation to the objectives envisaged in\nresolution 51/64 concerning the negative and destructive\nimplications of drug abuse, on the basis of the principle\nof joint responsibility in confronting the illicit drug trade.\nCollective measures should also be taken to solve this\nproblem, which constitutes a common threat to the\ninternational community.\nIn the light of the new world realities, the United\nNations should play a more effective role in providing\norganizational frameworks and appropriate forums to\nenable various Member States to contribute within their\ncapacities and capabilities to the reshaping of our modern\nworld, tending towards increased closeness and interaction\non various planes of human activity.\nThe current period, characterized by cascading\nchanges, requires a joint intellectual vision on the part of\nall Member States of the Organization and their peoples\nwith respect to what should be done for the common\ngood of mankind and to prepare for it. Such a vision\nshould transcend visions of conflicting ideologies, which\ncharacterized the world of the cold war as well as the\npredictions of future clashes of civilizations.\n15\n\n\nIt is also vital that the United Nations create a\nfavourable climate and appropriate management whereby it\ncan provide, in addition to the basic functions it undertakes,\na veritable forum for world thought, into which will flow\na variety of opinions, emanating from various regions,\ncivilizations and experiences. Thus, the Organization may\nhelp crystallize an overall human vision conducive to\nunderstanding, peace and cooperation, rather than a\nsituation in which new adversaries and enemies are sought\nfor one side or another.\nThe current period also requires us to bring about\ncohesion and integration among the various elements in the\nflow of information and satellite transmissions from every\ncorner of the Earth. The volume of this information is\nenormous, its sources diverse and its objectives conflicting;\nit has deluged societies. It is difficult to absorb all this\ninformation, and perceptions of it are often confused.\nUnless a common, comprehensive and inclusive vision\nis found to restore cohesion and compatibility to this great\nmass of information, the world will be threatened with\nintellectual chaos that could take it back to a time when\ndisorder and contradictions held sway in mankind's vision.\nNo global mechanism is better suited to be the proper\nmeans and the appropriate international forum for this\nuniversal intellectual task than the United Nations. It should\nat this stage provide direction and guidance for all aspects\nof international cooperation, both within the framework of\nthe Organization and at the regional and national levels.\nWhile we look forward to such a comprehensive\nvision for our modern world, we must stress that it would\nbe prudent not to let globalization \u2014 which is a natural and\nacceptable phenomenon in the context of technology,\nscience, production, economic and information systems and\nthe related material components of our common human\ncivilization \u2014 be imposed, especially through coercion or\npressure, on special spiritual, religious, cultural and political\nattributes. If it is, the world will fall into the abyss of futile\nethnic, cultural and religious feuds. Development of the\nmoral aspects of civilizations and systems can only occur\ngradually, through inner conviction, and in tandem with the\nlogical internal development of each structure and system\nrather than through technological development that spreads\nrapidly from civilization to civilization. Coerced imposition\nof globalization on any spiritual or moral facet of a society,\nespecially through external sources, would constitute a\nwrongful revival of political and cultural colonialism,\nwhose cumbersome legacy and adverse effects the world\nhas barely eradicated. It is our hope that if it builds on the\nremarkable role it played in the elimination of the old form\nof colonialism, the United Nations will be able to play a\npositive part in steering the process of globalization in the\nright direction and in preventing the unilateral takeover of\na world of diverse spiritual cultures and civilizations.\nIn view of the Organization's contribution to the\npreservation of world peace and security and the role it\ncontinues to play in support of the causes of peace and\njustice and in the implementation of the principles of\ninternational legitimacy, its activities in the field of\npreventive diplomacy and peacekeeping operations, and\nits constructive role in resolving numerous questions and\ncrises, it is incumbent upon us to make available to the\nUnited Nations all possible moral and material support\nand to cooperate with it and with its specialized agencies.\nHence the importance, in our view, of formulating\nwithin the framework of the United Nations a balanced\nintellectual vision which, in addition to bringing out\nelements which are common to all peoples, would be\nbased on respect for legitimate pluralism as it relates to\nspecial spiritual, moral and political attributes. In the\nabsence of such a balanced vision, our world is apt to\ncontinue to be threatened with imbalance, instability and\na lack of security.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like first\nto thank for his work the outgoing President, Ismail Razali.\nMy Ambassador, the Andorran Vice-President for the fifty-\nfirst session of the General Assembly, was a firsthand\nwitness to both the diplomatic skill and dedication of his\nMalaysian counterpart. On behalf of the Government of\nAndorra and the Andorran people, I should like to pay\ntribute to his work and to thank him publicly for the trust\nhe placed in my representative to the United Nations during\nthis year \u2014 a year of great change and enormous\nchallenges for the Organization.\nAllow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election\nto the fifty-second session of the General Assembly.\nAndorra recognizes your reputation as a diplomat and\nyour extensive experience. I have no doubt, therefore, that\nyour presidency will be a great success and will bring\nabout the consolidation of the reform of the United\nNations, which we are beginning this year. Likewise, I\nextend my congratulations to the members of the General\nCommittee, who are beginning their term as Vice-\nPresidents.\nOn 16 July, in this same Hall, I spoke after\nSecretary-General Annan for some minutes in order to\nshow Andorra\u2019s support for his call for reform. The\nPrincipality of Andorra supports unconditionally the\nproposed reform of the United Nations, since we believe\nthe Organization to be indispensable. As a small State,\nweak in a world of stronger Powers, it is in line with our\nnational interest for us to desire that law and dialogue\nprevail over force and military strength. We also have\nmore liberty than many other States to dedicate ourselves\nto the goals of peace and progress that were set, in a\nutopian spirit, by our forefathers in San Francisco.\nFor we are small and humble, and have no vast\nterritories across the seas, no uranium mines on the other\nside of the world, no reserves of oil beneath our soil. Our\ninterests go no farther than our own boundaries. After all,\nwe possess the record for peace in the world \u2014 some 700\nyears. For all these reasons, Andorra and other small\ncountries have the liberty to reflect on the future of\nmankind and the well-being of peoples as we approach\n\n\nthe third millennium \u2014 without, I hope, any suggestion of\nthe occult.\nIndeed, many people have been surprised to discover\nthat we have for centuries democratically elected our\nGovernment, and that we last used the death penalty over\n50 years ago. In short, Andorrans are capable of resolving\ntheir problems without the use of force. And thanks to this\nlegacy, without any misplaced pride or privilege, we wish\nto promote those reforms that will enable the United\nNations to be the best hope for our peoples.\nImmanuel Kant, in an essay dated 1784, stated:\n\u201cIf it is now asked whether we at present live in an\nenlightened age, the answer is: No, but we live in an\nage of enlightenment'.\u201d\nAt the end of the twentieth century, are we now living\nin an enlightened age? The crises of development and the\nmilitary conflicts that still afflict our planet make us believe\nthe opposite. To reach our goal of an age of enlightenment,\nwe must count on the United Nations and its ideals, and we\nmust also count on the small countries, which will never\nfail to defend it.\nThe proposals for the reform of the United Nations\npresented by the Secretary-General are conscientious, fair,\ninnovative and practical. I will not comment at length on\nthe new administrative structure proposed by Mr. Kofi\nAnnan. To benefit from the assistance of a Deputy-\nSecretary-General appears to us a natural aspiration. All of\nthose who serve a country at the highest level know how\nmuch time must be allotted to issues of protocol and to\nsmall meetings. It is necessary for the United Nations that\nthe agenda of the Secretary-General be lightened so that he\ncan concentrate on larger problems. This innovation will\nprobably have the following consequences: the Secretary-\nGeneral will be considered as the statesman and the\nDeputy-Secretary-General as the manager. This seems to\nme to be a good division of labour. What must be avoided,\nhowever, is that the Deputy-Secretary-General become a\ncounter-force to the Secretary-General. The Deputy-\nSecretary-General must always be a faithful representative\nof the ideas of the Secretary-General in order to avoid\nadministrative tension at the United Nations.\nThe reorganization of the management structure of the\nUnited Nations is a prerogative that we must recognize as\nbelonging to the Secretary-General. I therefore lend my\nsupport, on behalf of Andorra, to reinforcing the role of the\nExecutive Committees established in January of this year,\nas well as to the creation of a forerunner to an executive\ncabinet, the Senior Management Group. I share the\nSecretary-General\u2019s desire to see an evolution towards\ngreater efficiency and productivity in the management of\nthe United Nations.\nAs many others have done, I take this opportunity to\ncongratulate Under-Secretary-General Joseph Connor for\nhaving brought a spirit of good management to our\nOrganization. It seems that during this decade in which\nbudgets have imposed the need for cutbacks, many\nGovernments have learned that it was necessary to\nreorganize resources, establish the proper relationship\nbetween work and goals and find the means to reorganize\ntheir bureaucracies and render them more efficient with\nregard to the work of their administrations. This was\noften inspired by the strategies used in private enterprise.\nI thank the Secretary-General for having had the\ncourage to begin this difficult task in the Organization.\nWe in Andorra will try to find inspiration in the\nprinciples which will lead the Secretary-General in his\nreforms in order to make our own administration in\nAndorra more efficient.\nAnother point which I would like to emphasize\nconcerns the decision of Secretary-General Annan to shift\nthe work of the United Nations towards concrete\nobjectives within specific time-frames. This strategy of\nworking towards objectives will probably save money for\nthe United Nations and serve as a model for the efforts\nneeded to achieve development. That is the strategy which\nwe follow in Andorra in the area of administration, and\nwhich every day becomes more accepted by many\ncountries throughout the world.\nIt is well understood that these structural and\nfunctional reforms will lead to significant savings in the\nbudget of the United Nations. However, it is of primary\nimportance that Member States pay their debts to the\nOrganization as they agreed to do in acceding to the\nCharter of the United Nations. Let us be clear: the delay\nin making payments to the United Nations acts as such a\nheavy weight on any attempt at reform that it will be\nnearly impossible to make progress if the conditions of\npayment are not met.\nI would like to emphasize that my country, Andorra,\npays its assessments to the budget of the Organization\ndependably and on a per capita basis, as do many other\ncountries. If each citizen of my country contributes almost\n$2 annually to the regular budget of the Organization,\n2\n\n\nwhy can the people of other developed countries not do the\nsame, even when the per capita amount that is asked of\nthem is significantly less than that of Andorra? Happily,\nthere are admirable and exemplary citizens who are able to\nmake up for the insufficiencies of their own countries.\nWe are, after all, touching on an important topic: the\nconfidence that we have or do not have in the United\nNations. Andorra has full confidence in the United Nations.\nEven though we believe that the creation of a revolving\nfund of $1 billion is only a temporary remedy for a\nfinancial situation that should never have existed, we are\nprepared to add an additional 10 per cent of our annual\ncontribution to this emergency fund if the other Member\nStates are equally supportive and on the condition that the\ndebtors \u2014 whether they be large or small \u2014 pay their\ndebts in the future.\nThe Secretary-General asks us to consider the\npromotion of sustainable development as a central priority\nof the reform of the United Nations. On a planet that is\ncapable before the third millennium of producing machines\nthat travel to the moon and to Mars, sophisticated\ncomputers to help us, travel networks that link Ulan Bator\nwith Johannesburg or Andorra La Vella with Lima in the\nspace of a few hours \u2014 on this planet of limitless\nadvances \u2014 the dawn of the year 2000 reveals the\nexistence of hundreds of millions of poor people and a\nworrisome decline in our environment. How can we go\nfrom speeches to acts, from bemoaning the problems of the\nworld to commitment, and undertake those actions which\nwill bring an end to the present degradation?\nOnly the United Nations, as a global Organization,\npossesses the structure to realize those projects needed to\nbring about global development in the long term. We\ntherefore applaud the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative to\nreform those practices leading towards development.\nAndorra supports him in his goal of reducing duplication\nand increasing the coordination of resources. In the next\ndecade we must bring to the United Nations the most\nbrilliant minds on the planet and put them to work in a\nshared spirit of rationalization in order to understand both\nthe causes of underdevelopment and the path to follow in\norder eradicate it in the twenty-first century. Just as the\nWorld Health Organization eradicates diseases that afflict\nthe citizens of the world, so too must the United Nations\nserve as a catalyst for the eradication of those evils that\nafflict the world\u2019s peoples.\nWe share the Secretary-General\u2019s particular concern\nfor the natural environment, which is the common\ndenominator of the world. If the Earth dies during the\ncoming centuries, it will take all of us with it, rich and\npoor, peoples of the North and the South.\nIn his inaugural speech last week the President\npointed to the nuclear disaster of Chernobyl as a disaster\nthat continues to haunt not only his own country, but all\nof us as well. We therefore approve of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s plan to transform the Trusteeship Council into\na body for protecting the integrity of the global\nenvironment and of shared areas such as the atmosphere\nand outer space.\nWe also believe in the mission of peace that the\nSecretary-General has foreseen for the United Nations.\nFor every conflict there is a \u201cbefore\u201d, a \u201cmiddle\u201d, and an\n\u201cafter\u201d. Andorra has learned during its seven centuries of\npeace that it is better to take action during the \u201cbefore\u201d\nstage. The world calls such action preventive diplomacy.\nIt is all too easy to dismiss the existence of small\ncountries as improbable and irrelevant accidents brought\nabout by historical providence. We do not appreciate\nsufficiently the troubles through which many of those\nStates \u2014 Andorra among them \u2014 have struggled at\ncertain historic moments and that might have resulted in\ntheir disappearance from the face of the Earth. Not having\nan army and not using force, we have learned by\nnecessity the importance of diplomacy. In the United\nNations we must use such diplomacy by choice and by\ndesire.\nWhy should we not consider, among other\npossibilities, the establishment of a reliable and discreet\nsystem of information to measure the political temperature\nof points of tension throughout the world? Why do we\nnot empower the Security Council to examine in its\ndebates these difficult questions before a conflict arises\nand temperatures become inflamed beyond the burning\npoint? Indeed, as we consider the reform of the Security\nCouncil, why do we not concentrate more on its deeper\naction, with a view to giving it the means to accomplish\npreventative diplomacy, as we consider its size and\nstructure?\nIt is truly a matter of regret that the United Nations\nis not the best instrument for armed intervention during a\nconflict, unless it is for humanitarian reasons. Perhaps this\nsituation will change if we succeed in establishing a\ngreater force with a greater capacity for military reaction.\nThe United Nations can help the healing after a conflict.\nIf we give it the means, the United Nations may become\n3\n\n\na humanitarian and preventive force of the highest order.\nAndorra, which does not have and does not wish to have an\narmy, is in the process of considering the establishment of\na humanitarian force that will align itself with these\nobjectives and with the words of international solidarity\ninscribed in our Constitution.\nThere is no better way to prevent conflicts than to\nteach and advance human rights and democracy. Political\nscientists tell us that democracies do not make war with\neach other. Common sense tells us that people who respect\nand revere the articles of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights will always find a peaceful way to negotiate\ntheir differences. For this reason, I have asked my\nAmbassador to the United Nations to devote, as he has\nbefore, a large part of his efforts at Headquarters to the\nThird Committee of the General Assembly. I have also\nasked him to study carefully the ways in which the Third\nCommittee might strengthen its procedures in order that the\nspirit of reform which permeates the United Nations during\nthis time might extend to all its forums of deliberation.\nAndorra believes in the United Nations and, at the\nglobal level, supports the desire of the Secretary-General\nfor reform. I have just explained our reasons for this, but,\nbecause people and States believe in the United Nations, we\nmust better understand its functioning and its\nweaknesses \u2014 which are similar to those of any\nhumanitarian organization \u2014 and especially its goals and its\nstrengths.\nToday, I would like to stress the need for a general\nand ongoing effort to present the United Nations to the\nworld. We live in a world of images, as the events of\nrecent weeks clearly demonstrate. During this time, two\ngreat humanitarian figures have died: one who selflessly\ndedicated her life to the poor, the other who dared to\nembrace the sick whom nobody dared to touch. These two\nwomen, Mother Teresa of Calcutta and Diana, Princess of\nWales, both lived under the light of public interest and used\nit to spread their humanitarian messages. In Great Britain,\nthe Princess of Wales Fund is becoming one of the largest\nin the world. And yet, it is difficult for us to gain public\nsympathy and donations for the United Nations, although it\nis the first and most important instrument for works\nbeneficial to all humanity.\nWhy is this so? Perhaps because it has an image\nproblem. In these closing years of the century, let us link\nthe United Nations to the peoples to which its Charter\nrefers. Let us show these peoples that the diplomats of 1997\nare not a club of ladies and gentlemen with little work who\nwander through the halls of this building. It might be a\ngood idea \u2014 in emulation of the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund, which has established a lively and\neffective presence in Andorra through its National\nCommittee \u2014 for us to ask celebrities and leaders of\nopinion to serve as spokespeople for the United Nations\nin their countries and across the world. We have the\nmessage, the mandate, and indeed the successes, but have\nbeen less successful in communicating them and allow the\npublic to forget our actions. Let us consider together the\nappropriate public relations and communication strategies\nfor the United Nations at this fifty-second session, a\nsession of reform.\nTwo months ago, during my participation in the\nGeneral Assembly when the Secretary-General announced\nhis reform, I wanted to underline two points of special\nimportance for the Andorran delegation. Today I should\nlike to reaffirm these two aspects. First, I emphasized the\nimportance of the small countries during this process of\nreform. If the reform leads to a shift away from the\nfounding principles of the United Nations, our\nOrganization will cease to be universal. I concede that,\nwithout the bigger countries, reform is not possible, but\nwithout the support of small countries reform will only be\npartial. Secondly, I called for the greater participation of\nyouth in the process of reform and the workings of the\nUnited Nations. This is a priority for our delegation: Let\nus make the future with those who will inherit it.\nI conclude my speech today with a call of hope and\na vote of faith: faith in the United Nations and its\ncapacity for transformation and improvement in its pursuit\nof peace and development; confidence in its Secretary-\nGeneral, who has begun his mandate with firmness and\ndecision, as he should; and, finally, an unshakeable belief\nin the irrepressibility of human progress. Through the\nUnited Nations, let us make the new millennium an age\nof enlightenment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset I should like to convey to you, Sir, the\nwarm congratulations of the Government of Gabon and of\nmy delegation on your outstanding election as President\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-second session. I\nshould also like to congratulate the other members of the\nBureau.\nIn selecting you, Mr. President, our Assembly\nacknowledged your country\u2019s role in world politics and,\nabove all, your personal qualities, which augur well for\nthe success of this session. I am indeed convinced that\nunder your guidance our work will be directed towards\ncontinuing our discussions in greater depth, taking\ncommon positions on important issues and adopting\nresolutions with the broadest possible consensus.\n14\n\n\nI should like to express our appreciation to your\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Razali, for the excellent\nwork he did during his presidency.\nThis is also the first opportunity I have had to express\nmy heartfelt congratulations to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, on his election as head of our\nOrganization. I assure him of Gabon\u2019s full support for all\nthe efforts he will need to make to ensure the success of\nthe action he takes in the service of the United Nations.\nIt is often said that the international context has\nchanged, that the fields of activity of the States that we\nrepresent are being subjected to attacks on all sides as\nscience and technology progress. The globalization of our\neconomies, based on the proclaimed virtues of liberalism,\nhas not yet yielded all that it could.\nThe new world order that we have so long hoped for\nhas not yet arrived, because so many contradictions are\nwoven into the fabric of international relations. Yet no one\ncan fail to see that it represents both the matrix and the\nsupport essential to carrying out the reform of the United\nNations so that it can better serve peace among nations and\nthe development of their peoples.\nI should like first to speak about peace, the chief\nwealth of nations, and I shall do so, of course, in the light\nof our own experience.\nIn Gabon our understanding of peace underlies all the\npolitical developments we have experienced and are still\nexperiencing today. The organization of successive local,\nlegislative and senatorial elections in a calm political and\nsocial context at the end of 1996 and early this year\nprovided proof of the fundamental role of the democratic\nlegitimacy sorely needed today for the exercise of political\npower.\nThis same perception underlies all the activities of\nwhich we are the beneficiaries and which have made\nGabon, through the personal presence of its President,\nOmar Bongo, a country that enjoys the great friendship and\ntrust of other members of the international community,\nespecially its neighbours.\nIn fact, Gabon has contributed in a substantial and\nsignificant manner to easing the tension in many parts of\nAfrica.\nGabon, together with Chad, Burkina Faso, Senegal\nand Mali, sent almost 300 soldiers as part of an African\npeacekeeping force to restore institutional stability in the\nCentral African Republic.\nOn behalf of my country I should like to pay tribute\nto the Inter-African Mission to Monitor the\nImplementation of the Bangui Agreements, established by\nthe Security Council.\nGiven the very disturbing situation in Congo\n(Brazzavile), and at the request of the Congolese parties,\nGabon agreed to take charge of the international\nmediation committee, under the leadership of His\nExcellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, assisted by the joint\nUnited Nations/Organization of African Unity Special\nRepresentative, Ambassador Mohamed Sahnoun. A\nsimilar request had already been made to President Bongo\nby our Congolese brothers during earlier crises, in 1992\nand 1993. The current crisis, which erupted in early July\n1997, is the longest and the most bloody \u2014 the official\ndeath toll is 4,000 to 5,000 \u2014 and the most complex.\nDespite the many obstacles that this mediation effort\nis encountering, Gabon is doing its utmost to find a\npositive solution to this conflict. It is essentially a\npolitical and internal conflict, but it must be clear to\neveryone that the situation could drift out of control, with\nrepercussions at the subregional and international levels.\nEven so, as the French writer Beaumarchais said,\n\u201cAs success becomes more difficult to achieve, the\nneed for action becomes more pressing.\u201d\nIn this connection, I am pleased to note the\nencouraging reaction of the international community in\ngeneral, and more specifically, of the European Union and\nFrance, which have voiced their support and renewed\ntheir expression of trust in international mediation and in\nthe Head of State of Gabon, and have urged him to\ncontinue his efforts.\nTo give the Assembly an idea of what has been\ndone, I would just like briefly to mention that President\nBongo has proposed, on the one hand, a ceasefire\nagreement and, on the other, a political agreement to\ncover the transitional period from now until the\npresidential elections.\nThe draft political agreement is the fifth one\nproposed since the negotiations began. It is based on the\nidea of power-sharing and the balanced participation of all\n15\n\n\npolitical forces in terms of holding power during the\ntransitional period. The breakdown is as follows.\nMr. Lissouba will remain as President of the Republic and\nHead of State. To counterbalance this, as it were, a Prime\nMinister, the Head of Government, will be appointed by the\nPresident from among the members of the Opposition. In\naddition, three Vice-Presidents of the Republic are to be\nappointed by the Head of State.\nWe were unable to finalize this draft agreement during\nthe discussions. Things started to happen quickly in\nBrazzaville: fighting continued; Mr. Kolelas, the Mayor of\nBrazzaville, who had been heading the national mediation\nefforts, was appointed Prime Minister; and a Government\nwas set up. Of course, all this has meant that negotiations\nare on hold.\nAgainst this background of uncertainty, President\nBongo invited nine Heads of State of Central and Western\nAfrica to a special meeting on the Congo which was held\nin Libreville on 14 and 15 September 1997. President\nLissouba was unable to join his colleagues but he sent his\nPrime Minister, Mr. Kolelas.\nThe Libreville summit reaffirmed support for\ninternational mediation efforts led by President Bongo. It\nalso made an urgent appeal to the warring factions to stop\nfighting and resolutely to continue with negotiations to try\nand find a political settlement to the crisis. So far, I have\nto say, the appeal has not met with the reaction on the\nground we had hoped for. But we are still hopeful that\ndiscussions will soon be resumed, for this is the only way\nwe are going to find a lasting and constructive settlement.\nFaced with this situation, what have we done here in\nthe United Nations? I should remind the Assembly that very\nsoon after international mediation began, the President of\nthe Republic of Gabon called for a commitment from the\ninternational community in terms of deploying an\ninternational force to separate the warring factions in Congo\n(Brazzaville).\nSeveral African countries in a commendable upsurge\nof solidarity, responded favourably, expressing their\nwillingness to provide troops for the international force.\nPresident Bongo brought the matter before the Security\nCouncil, which said it accepted the principle, but which\nimposed various conditions that, when analysed, leave one\nwith the impression that if they were met there would be\npractically no point in sending the force.\nTime is passing. Time is of the essence. Congolese\npeople are still dying; others are fleeing their country; and\nthousands more are still wandering, distraught and\ndesperate, in the forests of the Congo, seeking makeshift\nshelter.\nCan we really continue calmly to sit in Manhattan or\nin the offices of our capitals and discuss what is going\non? We know that in the recent past in other parts of the\nworld the same cunning preventive measures \u2014 I was\ngoing to say the same procrastination \u2014 did not prevail.\nNo, we must do something for the Congolese people.\nThey are citizens of the world, our world, as well.\nI must emphasize this: the impact of armed conflicts\nis so great that it is more necessary than ever to stress\nspecific measures to prevent them. For developing\ncountries, like mine, that cannot and must not afford the\nluxury of high military expenditure, the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security must be provided for\n\u201cupstream\u201d on the basis of preventive measures. It is\nbecause we believe deeply in this principle that the States\nin our subregion, Members of the United Nations\nStanding Advisory Committee on Security Questions in\nCentral Africa have been cooperating and taking action\nsince 1992 to strengthen mutual trust and security at the\nsubregional level.\nThese contacts have led, inter alia, to the signing in\nYaound\u00e9 in July 1996, by virtually all the members of\nthis Committee \u2014 except one \u2014 of a non-aggression\npact, which is an important measure to strengthen peace.\nMore recently, at its ninth Ministerial Meeting, last\nJuly in Libreville, attended by four out of five\nrepresentatives of the permanent members of the Security\nCouncil, we adopted a major plan of action whose main\nthrust is: the establishment of an early-warning\nmechanism as a way of preventing conflict in Central\nAfrica; the organization in the medium term of a regional\nconference on democratic institutions and peace in Central\nAfrica; and training seminars for law enforcement\npersonnel on peacekeeping operations, with the goal of\npreparing countries of the subregion to participate, with\nUnited Nations assistance, in possible future peacekeeping\noperations.\nIn my capacity as Chairman of the Bureau of that\nCommittee, I should like to draw the keen attention of all\nexecutive bodies operating under the aegis of the United\nNations and the European Union, and our partners in the\n16\n\n\nsubregion, to the benefits of effectively establishing this\nearly-warning mechanism before the end of 1997.\nStill in that capacity, I wish to appeal to all Member\nStates and to the international community as a whole to\ncontribute to the Trust Fund set up by the Secretary-\nGeneral to finance the work of the Committee.\nLooking at the crises that have erupted recently in\nCentral Africa, I have to say that today the subregion is\nfacing the possibility of many conflicts flaring up, involving\npopulations beyond our national boundaries, threatening the\nstability of our States and even calling into question the\nprinciple of the inviolability of borders \u2014 a principle that\nthe Organization of African Unity has held dear since its\ninception. The danger is real. We must ward it off.\nThrough me, Gabon welcomes the United States\ninitiative to convene a special meeting of the Security\nCouncil on the situation in Africa, the first of its kind. We\nare grateful for the fact that on that solemn occasion, on 25\nSeptember 1997, the Security Council reaffirmed its\nprincipal responsibility for the preservation of peace on our\ncontinent.\nBut how can we forget that United Nations files are\nbursting with piles of reports, declarations and resolutions\non Africa, all of them equally relevant?\nEveryone here will recall that some 10 years ago the\nGeneral Assembly held a special session on Africa. Yes, I\nknow \u2014 they say that now that the cold war has ended\nAfrica is no longer of prime strategic importance. Too bad\nfor us! For my part, I would say \u201cSo much the better for\nus\u201d, because we Africans have no reason to cry over the\nfall of the Berlin Wall. That was a tremendously important\nevent for us too; it opened up new prospects. Today,\nhowever, the African peoples, just like others, are no longer\nwilling to be paid in words and slogans. They thus expect\nconcrete measures to emerge from the special meeting that\nwas held by the Security Council last week.\nAlthough Africa is no longer of prime strategic\nimportance, is Africa not today, where the United Nations\nis concerned, its real challenge, I might even say its guilty\nconscience \u2014 because of the Organization\u2019s underlying\nphilosophy and vocation?\nLooking beyond Africa, Gabon is also greatly\nconcerned over the blockage in the Middle East process,\nand we invite all the parties there to resume the dialogue,\nwith the support of the whole of the international\ncommunity, for there, as elsewhere, no lasting solution\ncan be achieved through force.\nThe wars and conflicts we all deplore are made\npossible by the devastating force of weapons. We must\ntherefore patiently and resolutely succeed in disarming the\nnations of the world.\nThus, we welcome the progress made in this area by\nthe entry into force of the Convention on the prohibition\nof chemical weapons, which demonstrates the will of the\ninternational community to eliminate that category of\nweapons of mass destruction.\nIn the same connection, my country supports the\nOttawa process aimed at a complete ban on anti-personnel\nlandmines. The recent Oslo Diplomatic Conference on\nthat subject worked along the lines we had hoped it\nwould. We regret, however, that some countries were\nunable to join in the powerful and promising consensus\nthat emerged there. We trust that in the near future they\nwill be able to do so. The representative I sent to Oslo\ntold me that some of those present had tried to establish\nfor those weapons a special category that they would be\nable to retain, a category of what they called \u201cintelligent\u201d\nanti-personnel mines. I do not know what that means.\nIntelligent or stupid, anti-personnel mines kill, and they\noften kill the innocent. They must therefore be banned. If\nwhile playing in a field your child\u2019s leg is torn off by a\nso-called intelligent mine, you would find no consolation\nin the thought that the mine was an intelligent one.\nIn any event, Gabon urges all United Nations\nMember States to bend all their efforts towards adopting\na plan of action for general and complete disarmament.\nHumanity will be the better for it.\nWe are not sufficiently aware of the human suffering\nthat underlies armed conflicts, particularly the suffering of\nthe victims, and especially of women, the elderly and\nchildren, for killing them means killing the life, the past\nand the future of the human race. In that connection, one\ncan only employ the word \u201cabominable\u201d in describing the\ngrowing use of children in conflicts.\nOver the past decade a million children have been\nkilled, 6 million have been seriously wounded or\nhandicapped for life, more than a million have been\norphaned or separated from their families, and millions of\nothers are suffering serious psychological damage. This\ndark picture is even darker in Africa than in other\ncontinents. That is why Gabon, a party to the United\n17\n\n\nNations Convention on the Rights of the Child and a\nsignatory of the Charter of the Rights and Welfare of the\nAfrican Child, joins the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund\n(UNICEF) in condemning the use of children as soldiers\nand urges Governments and all combatants on the\nbattlefield to halt a number of particularly shameful\npractices, namely, the recruitment of children into the\narmed forces, the participation of children in combat, and\nviolations and abuses to which they are often subjected.\nIn another area, the Gabonese authorities are deeply\nconcerned by the struggle against the scourges of crime and\ndrug proliferation, which are other sources of human\nsuffering. We have taken a number of initiatives to combat\nthem, including the reorganization of our security services\nand the creation of an interministerial commission to\ncombat drug addiction. However, combating those\nphenomena clearly calls for resolution and determined acts\nof solidarity and cooperation at the international level.\nTurning now to the question of development, I should\nlike to recall that the final goal of government is the well-\nbeing of peoples.\nAgainst that background, the international community\nhas evidenced its will to improve the human condition by\norganizing various workshops, seminars and conferences. I\nwould just mention the Rio Conference on the environment,\nthe Vienna Conference on human rights, the Beijing\nConference on women, the Cairo Conference on population,\nthe Copenhagen Conference on social development and the\nStockholm Conference on the sexual exploitation of\nchildren, as well as the very latest special session of the\nGeneral Assembly devoted to the mid-term review of\nAgenda 21.\nHowever, even after all those meetings that aroused\nsuch hopes, it looks as though our community is not truly\ndetermined to fulfil the obligations it has freely entered\ninto. It seems to be difficult to translate proclaimed\nintentions into action.\nGabon therefore hopes that there will be greater\nmovement towards action at the forthcoming Kyoto\nConference on climate change, which will be a test of the\nindustrialized countries\u2019 commitments to sustainable\ndevelopment.\nSimilarly, we would encourage the International\nSeabed Authority to continue its work, particularly on the\nelaboration of a balanced mining code that takes into\naccount the interests of all States as well as environmental\nquestions.\nThe importance of the eight most developed\ncountries and their real ability to have an impact on the\ninternational economy give us ground to hope that the\ncommitments entered into at the recent Denver summit\nwill enable us to work towards strengthening an\ninternational economy at the service of humanity.\nThis may sound like a litany of ills, but until the\nsituation improves we must continue to repeat that Africa\nis suffering from very serious structural problems. These\nconsist, inter alia, of economies, often based on a single\ncrop, that are dependent on the outside world;\ndeterioration in the terms of trade; reverse finance flow;\nthe lowest level of development; the largest number of\nleast developed countries and of displaced persons and\nrefugees.\nHowever, I think it is important to highlight the fact\nthat in addition to its potential, which it owes to raw\nmaterials, Africa also represents an effective market of\nmore than 700 million inhabitants.\nWe know that if it is to develop, our continent must\nfirst and foremost rely on itself. Yet there is so much to\nbe done. We are familiar with the slogan, \u201cTrade, not\naid\u201d. It is not entirely untrue. But would it be outrageous\nto say that it is not completely true either, because it is\nobvious that in Africa there exist countries whose\ndevelopment level is already allowing them to cherish\nsome legitimate commercial and trade ambitions on the\ninternational market as well as countries that still require\nassistance, at least in certain areas, and particularly in the\nsocial area. To the latter countries, it would be better to\nsay: \u201cTrade and aid\u201d.\nIt is in that spirit that Gabon will attend the ninth\nsummit of the African, Caribbean and Pacific States\n(ACP) associated with the European Union in the context\nof the Lom\u00e9 Convention. My country will have the\nhonour of hosting this summit in its capital on 6 and 7\nNovember 1997. I take this opportunity to say to the ACP\ncountries \u2014 and all of them are here at the General\nAssembly \u2014 that we are ready to welcome them next\nmonth and that we await them all.\nGabon is a beneficiary of the international economic\nenvironment, and I would therefore like to share with the\nAssembly our experience in this area.\n18\n\n\nSince mid-1995, Gabon\u2019s economic performance has\nimproved considerably. The rate of growth has increased\nsignificantly; inflation has been reduced to a very low level;\nand our situation outside the country has been strengthened.\nStructural measures and administrative reform are\naccelerating. The Government is stepping up the\nliberalization of the economy and the cleaning up of the\nbusiness environment. A vast programme of privatizing\npublic enterprises has already been put into effect. It began\nwith the Gabon Water and Energy Company. The\nprivatization was carried out in very orderly and transparent\nconditions \u2014 to the surprise of not a few \u2014 and the\nprogramme will be continued in other spheres.\nAware of the decisive role the private sector has to\nplay in Gabon\u2019s prosperity and in increasing the standard of\nliving of its people, our Government is trying to establish\na legal and regulatory environment which will facilitate\nprivate investment and open up various sectors of the\neconomy to competition. We sincerely state that Gabon is\nopen to all private investment. As President Bongo likes to\nsay, \u201cGabon is not the private reserve of anybody\u201d.\nThe Gabonese authorities are making sure that our\ncommitments in the area of loans and repayments are\nrealistic and viable. They call for appropriate treatment in\nrespect of our foreign public debt, because the strict\ndeadlines for repayment often hamper our efforts to\nrevitalize our economy.\nFinally, partnership in all areas must be strengthened\nand the transfer of technologies encouraged, so that the\nnational capacities of our countries can be revitalized.\nIn his speech to the General Assembly, the Secretary-\nGeneral expressed the hope that this session will be known\nas the Reform Assembly. Indeed, the world today is not\nwhat it was in 1945. Our Organization must adapt to the\nnew realities. Gabon therefore welcomes the\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General for the reform\nof the Organization.\nThe current discussions must result in consensus\nmachinery that will safeguard the various interests of the\nMember States. But it remains true that no reform plan can\nbe successful until the financial situation of the United\nNations is cured.\nMy country recalls that we attach great priority to the\nrecommendations formulated by the Organization of\nAfrican Unity at its last summit, in Harare, and to the\nproposals made by the Non-Aligned Movement at its\nMinisterial Conference in New Delhi in April 1997.\nPresident Bongo spoke as long ago as 1977 on the\nquestion of an increase in the membership of the Security\nCouncil, and I had the occasion to repeat his position\nbefore the General Assembly in 1995 and 1996. Let me\nrepeat it one more time. Gabon suggests that we can\nreconcile the seemingly contradictory requirements in this\nway: by eliminating the geographical imbalance in the\nSecurity Council so as to consolidate its legitimacy and\neffectiveness; by making the decision-making process in\nthe Council more democratic; and by allowing for a fairer\nrepresentation of Africa. Africa calls for two permanent\nseats, with the same rights the other permanent members\nhave; the seats would be rotated in accordance with\nprinciples that the African Group will submit in due time\nto the General Assembly.\nGabon reaffirms here its commitment to the\nprinciples of universality and the sovereign equality of\nStates. These should underlie all the thinking in regard to\nreform.\nIt is my hope that this session of the General\nAssembly will enable us to take another step towards\nstrengthening the ideals we all share.\nThis transition towards a more humane world will\nnot be without perils. We will have to combat\nsimultaneously the upsurge of selfishness and the\ndevelopment of false solidarity, which can lead our\npeoples to fratricidal struggle.\nI am convinced that, united, we will take up the\nchallenge to build a better world.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a special privilege and\nhonour for me to address the General Assembly at the\nbeginning of its fifty-second session.\nAt the outset I would like to extend my sincere\ncongratulations to you, Sir, as the new President of the\nGeneral Assembly, confident that your extensive and\nproven diplomatic experience and skills will play an\nimportant role in the work of the Assembly.\nI should also like to express our gratitude to the\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session,\nHis Excellency Mr. Razali Ismail, whose devoted and\nvigorous work has shown that United Nations reform is\nmuch more than mere rhetoric, and who set a new standard\nof performance in the General Assembly.\nAs a Central European and Mediterranean country,\nCroatia highlights as its strategic priorities overall stability\nin the region, full integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions\nand the assertion of its position in the new post-cold-war\nEurope. Hence the special attention my Government pays\nto the policy of good neighbourliness and the development\nof stable relations with all neighbouring countries, based\non the principles of full respect for the existing\ninternationally recognized borders, for minority rights and\nfor the peaceful resolution of existing and possible\ndisputes in the spirit of the United Nations Charter. Today\nI can point out with satisfaction that Croatia has\nconcluded dozens of bilateral agreements with its\nneighbours, and relations with each of our immediate\nneighbours are being fully regulated and are steadily\nimproving.\nCroatia hosted two large-scale United Nations peace\noperations: the United Nations Protection Force\n(UNPROFOR) and the United Nations Confidence\nRestoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO). The United\nNations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia,\nBaranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES), in the\nDanubian area, and the United Nations Mission of\nObservers in Prevlaka (UNMOP) are still present. Croatia\nhas also played an important role in facilitating the\nStabilization Force (SFOR) operation in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina.\nI should like to take this opportunity to reiterate my\nGovernment\u2019s sincere gratitude for all the efforts that\nwere made by the United Nations to stop the war in\nCroatia and alleviate its consequences, as well as to\nexpress my country\u2019s sincere sympathies to the families\nof the \u201cblue helmets\u201d who have fallen while attending to\ntheir lofty duties.\nI am very grateful for the opportunity to express our\nappreciation and thanks to the United Nations Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his peace efforts in Croatia.\nAs a United Nations official in the field and as Under-\nSecretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations he made\na major personal contribution to overcoming the crisis.\nOur great thanks go to UNTAES and Mr. Jacques Klein,\nuntil recently Transitional Administrator in Eastern\nSlavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium, whose vigorous\nwork, leadership skill and successful cooperation with the\nCroatian Government have been instrumental in the\npeaceful reintegration of these areas into Croatia.\nDuring the many months of the United Nations\npresence in Croatia and elsewhere in the area of the\nformer Yugoslavia, my country had a chance to see for\nitself all the potential and the weaknesses of peacekeeping\noperations. It has been proven beyond any doubt that a\npeace operation can be successful only if its mandate is\nclearly defined, in terms of its goal as well as its time-\nframe, and if it is actively and fully supported by the\n12\n\n\nSecurity Council and the Secretary-General, and\nspearheaded by an uncompromising leadership explicitly\ndetermined to use all means required for the completion of\nits mission.\nThis knowledge has been gained at a high political,\nmaterial and, worst of all, human price, so it is to be hoped\nthat it will be wisely exploited in the future. For its part,\nCroatia is anxious to step out of its role as a country\nhosting peacekeeping operations and instead assume the\nrole of an active participant in such operations elsewhere.\nHere and now I can confirm the readiness of my country to\njoin the roster of United Nations Member States whose\ntroops participate in international peace endeavours.\nThe fifty-second session of the General Assembly is\ntaking place against a background of great obligations and\nequally great expectations regarding the reform of the\nUnited Nations system. The timely and far-reaching\nproposals put forward by the Secretary-General have\nopened the door for reforms. Croatia gives its firm support\nto his proposals, and we are ready to render any assistance\nneeded in introducing the kind of changes we owe both to\nthose who laid the foundations of this Organization and to\nfuture generations. As for the need to rationalize the work\nof the General Assembly and reduce its huge agenda,\nCroatia has put forward a proposal to delete the item on the\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s agenda entitled \u201cThe situation in the\noccupied territories of Croatia\u201d, as its title and topic no\nlonger correspond to the situation on the ground, which\nmakes it obsolete.\nIn view of the geopolitical realities, Croatia advocates\nan increase in the number of Security Council members,\nboth permanent and non-permanent. Half a century of old\nstereotypes ought to be phased out. Croatia supports the\nidea of granting permanent member status to Germany and\nJapan, with the right to permanent membership being kept\nin mind for those parts of the world, primarily Africa,\nwhich for more than 50 years, without any justification,\nhave been deprived of permanent Security Council\nrepresentation. Furthermore, my country supports the idea\nof assigning one more seat on the Security Council to the\nEastern European Group.\nCroatia strongly supports the reaffirmation and full\nimplementation of the universality of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). My country\nwas pleased to note that during this year\u2019s NPT Preparatory\nCommittee sessions some progress was achieved with\nregard to the principle of non-first use, especially against\nnon-nuclear-weapon States, and it calls on the nuclear\nStates to give due consideration to proposals to have this\nprinciple codified in a legally binding document.\nIn May 1996, the Review Conference of the States\nParties to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions\non the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May\nBe Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or To Have\nIndiscriminate Effects amended Protocol II on landmines.\nCroatia, which has played an active role during the\nOttawa process from the beginning, and which has\nalready put in place its own unilateral moratorium on\nlandmines, fully supports all the efforts which ultimately\nled to the decision at the recent Oslo conference to adopt\nthe text of a global treaty banning anti-personnel\nlandmines.\nCroatia\u2019s preoccupation with the global landmine\nproblem is also motivated by personal affliction. Millions\nof mines laid in the formerly occupied territories of\nCroatia during the war continue to pose a direct threat,\nespecially to the most vulnerable: civilians. It is also a\ngreat impediment to the reconstruction of war-affected\nareas. The clearing of mines in these areas is a\npainstaking process, and, in spite of our best efforts, it\nwill take many years to complete. Unfortunately, a lack\nof specialized equipment means that the process cannot\nmove any faster. Having said this, allow me to take this\nopportunity to express my gratitude to all those who have\nthus far provided financial and other aid towards\nalleviating the landmine problem in my country, and to\nmake a further appeal for any aid \u2014 material, financial or\nprofessional \u2014 which could help us expedite the mine-\nclearing process. In this context, I would like to express\nmy Government\u2019s appreciation for the efforts of the\nUnited Nations Mine Action Centre in Zagreb and the\nUnited Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs for\ntheir efforts in helping us launch this process.\nQuality of life, today and in the future, will greatly\ndepend on success in the protection of human rights it\nboth international and national levels. Protection and\npromotion of human rights \u2014 a cause in which the\nUnited Nations has played an indispensable role \u2014 is\nnecessary in order to guarantee international stability and\nsecurity. The Office of the High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights has successfully enhanced the role of the\nUnited Nations in this important field and, at this\njuncture, I would like, on behalf of the Croatian\nGovernment, to congratulate Mrs. Mary Robinson upon\nher appointment to this post. Because of her excellent\nqualifications and personal integrity, we are confident that\nshe will perform her duties admirably.\nCroatia\u2019s own human rights situation should be\nevaluated in the context of the exceptional circumstances of\nits recent history. Despite the trying circumstances of its\ninception, the Republic of Croatia has managed to build the\nfoundations of a democratic society based on respect for\nhuman rights. In this regard, I can announce that in the\ncoming month of October Croatia will ratify the European\nConvention on Human Rights. There are, of course, many\noutstanding issues, largely stemming from the war of\naggression waged against Croatia. These include the return\nof displaced persons and refugees; identification of missing\npersons; the rights of ethnic Croats in neighbouring States;\nand the return of all Croatian Serbs who left Croatia at the\ninstigation and under the orders of their leaders and who\nwish to return to Croatia. The Government of the Republic\nof Croatia intends to continue to deal with all these issues\nin keeping with its international human rights obligations as\nwell as its legitimate concerns for the security of the State\nand the safety and welfare of all its citizens.\nAs a victim of aggression, Croatia advocates the\nneed \u2014 and has even come up with its own initiatives \u2014\nto set up an international tribunal for the prosecution of war\ncrimes committed in Croatia and Bosnian and Herzegovina.\nCroatia has been cooperating with the International\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia since its\nfoundation. The Tribunal\u2019s Office has opened in Zagreb.\nThe Croatian Government has established its own Office\nfor Cooperation with the Tribunal and appointed observers\nto the Tribunal. Moreover, the Constitutional Law on\nCooperation with the International Tribunal has been\nadopted. Croatia\u2019s principled position is to cooperate with\nthe Tribunal within its obligations as defined in\ninternational law and in accordance with the relevant\nresolutions and the statute of the Tribunal adopted by the\nSecurity Council.\nHowever, Croatia cannot be completely satisfied with\nthe work of the Hague Tribunal to date. The charges raised\nso far, and the ethnic composition of the persons being tried\nin The Hague at present, do not properly reflect the\nresponsibility of the sides involved in the conflict or the\nextent of the war crimes committed. On the other hand, by\ntrying to subpoena the States and their high officials, the\nTribunal has gone beyond its own statute and international\nlaw.\nCurrent peace operations in the territory of Croatia \u2014\nUNTAES and UNMOP \u2014 are considered successful by my\nGovernment. Under the Basic Agreement signed between\nthe central authorities of the Republic of Croatia and the\nSerbs from the Croatian Danubian region, and pursuant to\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, the two-year\nUNTAES mandate expires on 15 January 1998. Croatia\nholds that at this moment there are no reasons whatsoever\nfor any prolongation of the UNTAES mandate beyond 15\nJanuary 1998. We are also firmly convinced that this\nmission will be fully completed on time and will go down\nin history as one of the most successful United Nations\npeacekeeping operations.\nThe results achieved under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations and with the full cooperation of the\nCroatian authorities can be described as highly\nsatisfactory. Demobilization has been completed. Local\nelections have been held through which the Croatian\nDanubian region has been reintegrated into the legal and\npolitical system of the country. Local Government has\nlargely been transferred to the newly elected and\nconstituted bodies.\nRules have been defined and designed in cooperation\nbetween the Republic of Croatia, UNTAES and UNHCR\nto enable a dignified, safe and organized return of\ndisplaced persons and refugees to their homes in and out\nof the Croatian Danubian region. So far a total of 1,500\ndisplaced Croats have returned to the Croatian Danubian\nregion, and a total of 8,000 Serbs have returned from the\nregion to their homes elsewhere in Croatia. The return of\ndisplaced persons and the international presence will\ncontinue after the departure of UNTAES. At the invitation\nof the Croatian authorities, the Organization for Security\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has undertaken to\nmonitor the developments in the Croatian Danubian\nregion after 15 January 1998.\nThe reintegration of the Croatian Danubian region\nhas never been an easy or simple process. The Republic\nof Croatia and all its citizens, especially the population of\nthe Croatian Danubian region, including the persons\nexpelled from it, owe a debt of gratitude to UNTAES and\nall the States whose troops have participated in this highly\nsuccessful operation.\nThe mandate of UNMOP, which has been given the\ntask of monitoring the demilitarization of the area from\nboth sides of the southernmost border between the\nRepublic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia, has been helpful in stabilizing security in that\narea and in creating conditions for a lasting settlement\nthere through bilateral talks. The Republic of Croatia has\nshown full understanding for the interests of the Federal\n14\n\n\nRepublic of Yugoslavia with regard to the security of the\nBoka Kotorska Bay, while being concerned for its own\nsecurity in the Dubrovnik hinterland. In this regard,\nUNMOP has played an important role, but it will not be\npossible to deal with the outstanding problems through\nendless prolongations of the United Nations mandate.\nWith relief and satisfaction, Croatia welcomes the\neasing of the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and remains\nfirmly committed to the principles and implementation of\nthe Washington and Dayton Accords. My Government\ngives its active support to preserving the integrity of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, as well as to the consolidation of the\nfederation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a foothold and\nframework for the survival and well-being of the Croatian\npeople in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nThe role of the international community, especially\nthat of the United Nations and the countries participating in\nSFOR, in the creation of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nis irreplaceable at this stage of the peace process. Too much\neffort, resources and prestige have been invested in peace\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina, and too much suffering has\nbeen experienced by the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nto allow any risk which may undermine what has been\nachieved in Dayton and in its wake. Croatia will persist and\npersevere in its role as an active peace agent in the region,\nexpecting other parties involved in the peace process to\nfulfil their obligations.\nThose standing in the way of the Dayton Accords and\ncontinuing to defy the integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina\nas a community of two equal entities and three constituent\npeoples have to be confronted with the same\nuncompromising determination of the international\ncommunity, and, if required, with the same measures as\nwere earlier applied in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which\nproved to be entirely necessary and productive. The\neconomic reconstruction of the country \u2014 in which the\ninternational community should play an even more vital\nrole \u2014 is also of special importance.\nThe agenda of the fifty-second session of the General\nAssembly is extensive, and a great deal of work lies ahead\nof us. There is also an opportunity before us to have this\nsession of the General Assembly recorded in the annals of\nthe Organization as a landmark in the Organization's\ndevelopment. Croatia will be only too glad to help make\nthis come true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is with great pleasure\nthat my delegation extends to you, Sir, its sincere\ncongratulations on your unanimous election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its current session.\nMy delegation also wishes to take this opportunity to\nexpress its deepest appreciation to your predecessor,\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for his exceptional\nleadership and creative energies during the past year. I also\nwish to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for the new dynamism which he has brought to the\nOrganization since he took office last January.\nThis fifty-second session of the General Assembly\ntakes place against the backdrop of transition and\ntransformation in the world. The euphoria that came in\nthe wake of the end of the cold war has given way to a\nsense of realism about the new, and no less formidable,\nchallenges that confront us all in this era of globalization.\nThe changes, led by technology and the globalization of\nbusiness and information, seem endless and increasingly\ncomplex. Governments, meanwhile, face the daunting task\nof constantly trying to discern and adjust to the new order\nof international relations.\nFor all the changes, some legacies of the cold war\nare still very much with us. Nothing brings home this\nreality more than the unfortunate events unfolding in\nCambodia. While the situation in Cambodia that confronts\nus today is very different from the one we faced before\nthe signing of the Paris Peace Accord, finding a solution\nis no less difficult.\nHow can we deal with a conflict which is basically\ninternal in character, particularly when our ability to\ninfluence events has become limited and we are overcome\nwith the fatigue born of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? Clearly, we cannot turn\nour backs on Cambodia. But the reality is that we in\nThailand and in the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN), as well as the entire international\ncommunity, can only be supportive to the extent that the\nCambodians themselves are willing to give peace a\nchance.\nThe situation in Cambodia reflects a peculiar aspect\nof this brave new age we are entering. Even as the world\nis being transformed by sweeping global trends, some\nproblems are so deep-rooted that they resist even the best\nefforts of the international community. The United\nNations, no stranger itself to intractable conflicts, will\ncontinue to be one of our best hopes for resolving such\nsituations.\nWhile tending to such traditional challenges, the\nUnited Nations must also address the many complex new\nchallenges brought on by the process of globalization.\nIndeed, globalization has come to mean different things\nto different people. To many, it holds out the promise of\nan unprecedented era of progress and prosperity. To its\nproponents, globalization has unleashed the forces of\ncreativity and productivity in the world economy.\n12\n\n\nGlobalization has been heralded for having spread the ideas\nand values of democracy and freedom worldwide.\nOn the other hand, there are those who contend that\nglobalization has become an all-embracing pretext for the\nimposition of certain sets of ideas and values. They see\nglobalization as leading to a monopoly of economic power\nin the hands of a ruthless few whose sole allegiance is to\nthe workings of market forces, while the vast majority of\nhumanity is increasingly marginalized.\nThe reality most likely lies somewhere between these\ntwo extreme views. The fact of the matter is that we must\nall develop the capacity to cope with the effects of\nglobalization, both positive and negative. Even the more\nsuccessful developing countries have not escaped the\ntremendous turmoil that integration into the global market\ncan bring on, as evidenced by the currency crisis that\nThailand and many other countries in South-East Asia are\ngoing through.\nThailand\u2019s recent experience suggests that to thrive\nunder economic globalization, developing countries have to\nfully understand how market forces work and to adapt\nthemselves accordingly. Thailand has learned that financial\nliberalization requires a high degree of discipline from both\nthe public and private sectors. Also crucial is the need to be\nvigilant in improving prudential regulations. Moreover, a\nmore comprehensive macroeconomic analysis is needed in\norder to improve the monitoring of current economic\nconditions.\nBut Thailand\u2019s basic strengths remain. Our economic\nfundamentals are still underscored by a remarkably high\nsavings rate, relatively low inflation and a strong tradition\nof market-oriented policy framework. We are firm in our\ncommitment to free and open markets. We are also active\nin promoting regional cooperation and economic\nliberalization through such frameworks as the Association\nof South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free Trade Area,\nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council and various\nsubregional development schemes.\nMoreover, we are firm in our determination to achieve\ngood governance and greater democracy. This past\nSaturday, the Thai Parliament approved the new draft\nConstitution, which emphasizes transparency, accountability\nand the role of public participation.\nOur political reform goes hand in hand with our\neconomic reform. We realize that we can no longer put off\neconomic restructuring if we are to get back on track\nquickly. We are therefore seriously implementing the\nconditions of the International Monetary Fund rescue\npackage. We are also working with the World Bank and\nthe Asian Development Bank to restructure our financial\nsystem, enhance our export competitiveness and return the\neconomy to its long-term sustainable growth through\nnecessary reforms of the civil service, privatization,\nindustrial restructuring and the upgrading of the quality of\nour workforce, our technology and our infrastructure.\nI prefer to think of this crisis as a blessing in\ndisguise. While we have done many things right in the\npast \u2014 including progressive industrialization and\nliberalization of international trade and investment \u2014\nwith the benefit of hindsight, the macroeconomic\ncapability to cope with an increasingly open capital\nmarket was inadequate. Globalization of business and\nfinance compels us to become more competitive through\ngreater openness and transparency. Our economy is too\ndeeply integrated into the international economic system\nto do anything less. We cannot fight the market; what we\nmust do is ensure that the market works efficiently and\nequitably.\nAt the same time, Thailand\u2019s experience also shows\nthat the United Nations has an important role to play in\ncoordinating macroeconomic policy at the global level.\nCloser cooperation and coordination is needed between\nthe United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions,\nthe World Trade Organization and major industrial\ncountries to provide integrated support for the\nenhancement of capacity-building in those countries\nwhose economies are still weak. Globalization of course\nhas its winners and losers. The rules of the game should\ntherefore take into account both the weaknesses and\nstrengths of all countries concerned.\nAs a universal and multi-purpose Organization, the\nUnited Nations is the only institution in the world capable\nof forging a global partnership among States, big and\nsmall, rich and poor, powerful and weak. No single State\nor region can go it alone. This is why Thailand is\ncommitted to supporting the United Nations. This is why\nThailand welcomes the reform-action initiatives and\nproposals recently put forward by the Secretary-General.\nI hope that these measures will enable the United Nations\nto carry out its responsibilities with increased efficiency\nand effectiveness. I wish the Secretary-General well on\nthe further implementation of these proposals.\nThailand attaches great importance to the\nstrengthening of the role of the United Nations in\n13\n\n\npromoting international cooperation for economic and social\ndevelopment. We are pleased that in his reform proposals\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan argued that the promotion of\nsustainable development should be the central priority of\nUnited Nations activities. While the reform plan proposed\nby the Secretary-General requires more thorough\nconsideration, Thailand can support his proposal of\ndesignating the United Nations Development Group \u2014\ncomprising the United Nations Development Programme,\nthe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund and the United Nations\nPopulation Fund \u2014 to supersede the sectoral group of\ndevelopment operations. We hope that the United Nations\nDevelopment Group will facilitate consolidation and\ncooperation among United Nations agencies without\ncompromising their identities, so that they can respond\nmore effectively to the needs of developing countries.\nThailand also welcomes the creation of a development\ndividend by shifting resources from administration to\ndevelopment activities. According to the reform plan, the\nadministrative costs will be reduced by one third, the\nworkforce will be reduced by 1,000 posts and the\npaperwork will be cut by 30 per cent. However, downsizing\nshould not be an end in itself. The central element of the\nreform should concentrate on how to manage funds and\nimplement programmes so as to achieve equitable\ndevelopment, which is our common goal.\nAnother important point in the Secretary-General\u2019s\nreform plan is the proposal to mobilize more resources for\nUnited Nations operational activities. Thailand sees the\nUnited Nations as the main forum for the creation of an\nequal and workable partnership between developed and\ndeveloping countries \u2014 a partnership that should be\nresponsive to the needs and aspirations of the developing\nworld. The steady decline in voluntary contributions to core\nresources has inhibited the capacity of United Nations funds\nand programmes to play the roles assigned to them. In this\nregard, we support the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal on\ninnovative means of mobilizing new financial resources for\ndevelopment. The private sector is potentially an important\nsource of financial support, as demonstrated by the\nproposed donation of $l billion by Mr. Ted Turner.\nHowever, the funds from the private sector should be\nadditional to, and must not replace, official development\nassistance.\nThe restructuring of the Security Council is also a vital\npart of United Nations reform. Despite the end of the cold\nwar, the anachronistic yet so powerful veto power still\nexists in this supposedly more democratized institution. It\nis heartening, however, to note that the issue has been\nextensively debated. Thailand and its ASEAN partners, as\nwell as the Non-Aligned Movement, believe that this veto\npower should be curtailed with a view to its eventual\nelimination. The Security Council itself should be\nexpanded, taking into account the increase in United\nNations membership to enhance its democratic and\nrepresentative nature, while at the same time paying due\nregard to its efficiency and effectiveness.\nBut without the firm commitment of Member States,\nall these reform efforts would come to nothing. Member\nStates have the obligation under the Charter to bear the\nexpenses of the Organization by paying their assessed\ncontributions in full on time and without conditions.\nThailand has always taken its financial obligation\nseriously and has made every effort to fulfil it. For 1997\nThailand is among the 28 countries which paid their\ncontributions to the regular budget in full and on time.\nThailand believes that one of the main tasks of the\nUnited Nations is to set standards in international law,\nand in recent years there has been an encouraging trend\ntowards efforts to advance the cause of international law\nthrough the creation of legal norms and instruments. What\nthese norms and instruments symbolize is the desire of\npeoples to live in a more orderly world. Thailand will\ncontinue to support and participate actively in efforts to\nestablish an international criminal court, as well as in the\nelaboration of new legal instruments to combat terrorism.\nIn December of this year, Thailand hopes to be one of the\nsignatories of the Ottawa treaty banning all anti-personnel\nlandmines. We believe that there is no greater crime than\nmaiming or killing innocent civilians. It is high time that\nwe put an end to this. At the same time, greater efforts\nand resources should be devoted to removing and\ndestroying these landmines.\nAs a signatory of the South-East Asia Nuclear-\nWeapon-Free Zone Treaty, which was concluded in\nBangkok during the ASEAN summit in 1995, Thailand\nwould also like to take this opportunity to congratulate\nthe Governments of Central Asia for their initiative to\nestablish a Central Asia nuclear-weapon-free zone. Their\ncommendable effort adds to the strong evidence that the\npeoples of the world are no longer tolerant of nuclear\nweapons. At present, more than 100 United Nations\nMember States are signatories of nuclear-weapon-free\nzone treaties in their respective regions, treaties which\nnow cover the greater part of the world, including Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean, the South Pacific, Africa,\nSouth-East Asia and, soon, Central Asia. What we are\nwitnessing here is a new partnership, a partnership among\n14\n\n\nthe peoples of the world who dread nuclear arsenals and\nwish to eliminate these hazardous weapons of mass\ndestruction from the face of the earth.\nThe international environment in which we live is\nevolving rapidly. During the past year, there have been\nmany encouraging developments. But we also find\nourselves confronted with new and increasingly complex\nchallenges. In order to overcome these challenges, the\nUnited Nations as an Organization needs vision and\ninventiveness. But, more importantly, its Members need to\nspeak with one voice on issues which confront mankind. If\nwe are to succeed in doing this, a global partnership needs\nto be forged, be it in the area of politics, economic and\nsocial development, environmental protection or\nhumanitarian assistance. Sooner rather than later, we should\nall realize that, in this globalized world, our destinies are\nlinked together much more closely than we like to believe.\nThe time to forge this partnership is now. The place to\nbegin the process is here, at the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt\nis a great honour for me to address this great Assembly in\nmy capacity as President of the Republic of Paraguay. I\ntake this opportunity to express my deepest thanks to the\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-second\nsession, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine,\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko. Also, I would note the excellent\nwork done by Ambassador Razali Ismail, who so efficiently\nguided the work of the last session. In addition, I should\nlike to extend my best wishes to Mr. Kofi Annan, in\nconnection with his responsibilities as he exercises his\nfunctions as Secretary-General of the Organization.\nFor the people of Paraguay, throughout the long\nstruggle to acquire and strengthen their democratic\ninstitutions, the United Nations has always been a\nuniversal forum that ensures the free debate of ideas and\nthe participation of all the peoples of the world, without\nexclusion or discrimination, the vital issues involving\ndevelopment, equity, the maintenance of peace and the\npreservation of the environment.\nBecause of the great importance my country attaches\nto this forum, we recognize the urgent need to support the\ninstitutional reform of the United Nations by\nstrengthening the General Assembly and democratizing\nthe Security Council \u2014 adding both permanent and non-\npermanent members \u2014 so that this institution will be able\nto respond appropriately to the new challenges facing the\ninternational community.\nLast August last I had the great honour of chairing\nin Asunci\u00f3n the eleventh summit of the Heads of State\nand Government of the Permanent Mechanism for\nConsultation and Policy Coordination \u2014 the Rio\nGroup \u2014 the members of which are Argentina, Bolivia,\nBrazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Guyana,\nHonduras, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and\nVenezuela. There a Declaration was adopted on the\nstrengthening of the United Nations and the reform of\nSecurity Council, stressing certain principles and\nguidelines that I shall now describe.\nThe Declaration of Asunci\u00f3n expresses, first, full\nsupport for multilateralism, sovereign equality of States\nand steadfast respect for the rule of law.\n\n\nSecond, it expresses support for the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s initiative in putting forward a broad programme\nfor reform, presented on 16 July of this year, particularly\nreforms designed to strengthen the effectiveness of the\nSecretariat and to emphasize activities to promote economic\nand social development.\nThird, it notes the relevance of the process of\nincreasing the membership of the Security Council and to\nreforming it to correct the imbalances in its current\nmembership, improve its decision-making mechanisms,\nmake it more transparent so that it will reflect in a more\nlegitimate and representative manner the overall\nmembership of the Organization.\nFourth, it states that, because of its legal traditions and\ncontribution to the cause of peace, the Latin American and\nCaribbean region should be given special consideration in\nany proposal to increase the membership of the Security\nCouncil.\nFifth, it expresses the conviction that reform of the\nSecurity Council must respect the principles of equitable\ngeographical distribution and the sovereign equality of\nStates, and that any reform that entails discrimination by\ndeveloped countries against developing countries would be\nunacceptable.\nSixth, it expresses the ideal of moving towards the\ntotal elimination of the veto and, as a first step, limiting its\nuse to actions taken under Chapter VII of the United\nNations Charter.\nSeventh, it expresses the importance of transparency\nin management and decision-making in the Security Council\nand increasing the number of open meetings and orientation\nmeetings at which the Secretary-General or his special\nrepresentatives present reports.\nEighth, it considers that the increase in the Security\nCouncil\u2019s membership, the reform of its working methods\nand the question of the veto are integral parts of Council\nreform and must be addressed in the same agreement.\nNinth, it expresses the explicit resolve of our\nGovernments to continue to participate actively in the\nWorking Group in order to reach general agreement on this\nmatter.\nLet me say once again that this increase in the\npermanent and non-permanent membership of the Council\nmust necessarily envisage the presence of Latin America\nand the Caribbean and other geographical groups without\nany form of discrimination whatsoever. In this connection,\nParaguay reaffirms its support for permanent membership\nfor Brazil, Germany and Japan.\nIt is also important to note that the process of\nreforming the Organization must include a plan to\neliminate unnecessary expenditures and an attempt to\nmerge programmes designed to further the development\nof our peoples, which will lead to an optimum utilization\nof available resources as well as to the elimination of\nduplication in the use of human, technical or economic\nresources. The serious financial problems of the United\nNations deserve sincere and determined consideration.\nI am pleased to say that my country has always, in\nso far as it has been able, honoured its international\ncommitments, aware that the Organization\u2019s proper\nfunctioning requires the appropriate and equitable\ndistribution of its administrative costs among all Member\nStates.\nThis moment in history is indeed a very special one.\nAlliances are now being replaced by complementarity.\nIsolationism and confrontation have given way to\nglobalization and cooperation. We no longer speak of\nrivalry and struggle but, rather, of honest and creative\ncompetition. The asymmetries in the world order that\nhave historically meant that some nations have been\nsubordinate to others are now themselves being\nsubordinated to this influx of solidarity and mutual\nassistance.\nIt is of course true that many serious conflict areas\ncontinue to exist, but Paraguay is pleased to note the\ncommendable efforts that the United Nations has made in\nthe maintenance of peace in various areas of tension, and\nwe have followed closely the Organization\u2019s initiatives in\nsuch new areas of conflict as Cambodia and Sierra Leone,\nfor whose peoples my country most sincerely wishes the\nimmeasurable benefits of peace and harmony.\nWe have also followed with keen interest the\ndisturbing developments in the Middle East situation, and\nwe urge the parties there to redouble their efforts to seek\na lasting and stable peace. We warmly welcome the\nactions taken by the mediating nations, which untiringly\ncontinue to participate in all negotiations.\nWith regard to the particular case of the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan, Paraguay welcomes the attitude adopted\nby that country\u2019s Government and expresses its hope that\n2\n\n\nthere will be movement towards reconciliation and that it\nwill be possible to resolve the differences with the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China.\nIn keeping with the principle of the universality of the\nUnited Nations, all States that meet the requirements set\nforth in the Charter have the right to seek admission or\nmembership. In this respect, we believe that it would be\nadvisable to reconsider General Assembly resolution 2758\n(XXVI), which completely denies the 21 million inhabitants\nof the Republic of China on Taiwan the fundamental right\nto participate in international organizations and their\nactivities.\nThe challenges of peace, security and equilibrium are\nmore relevant to us today than ever before, and they are an\nabsolute imperative for building a world that guarantees\ndevelopment to nations in a context of universal harmony.\nOn the crucial issue of world disarmament, allow me\nto reiterate Paraguay\u2019s position of support for United\nNations efforts in this sphere. My country welcomes\noptimistically the preparatory work for the Review\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to be held in the\nyear 2000, hoping that by then the Treaty will have become\nuniversal. That Treaty, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty, the efforts of States to reduce their arsenals\nand the establishment of new nuclear-weapon-free zones are\nall important elements that will help prevent the\nproliferation of nuclear weapons and eventually achieve\ngeneral and complete nuclear disarmament.\nTrue to its pacifist principles, the Republic of\nParaguay has been following the Ottowa process with great\ninterest. We recently took part in the Oslo Diplomatic\nConference, which adopted the definitive text of the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on\nTheir Destruction, and we supported the majority position\nof the principal States to seek appropriate and effective\nlegal mechanisms to prohibit the manufacture, use and\ndistribution of the cruel devices of death and pain that are\nanti-personnel landmines.\nWe congratulate the international community on that\ndecisive step, and we reaffirm our unswerving decision to\nsign the Convention. We urge other Governments to do the\nsame without any doubt or delay, so as to ensure its earliest\npossible entry into force.\nI should also like to reaffirm my country\u2019s\nunswerving commitment to continue the struggle against\nterrorism, a destabilizing force that negates human rights\nand threatens to undermine the very foundations of\nsecurity in our regions.\nIt is fitting here to stress that Paraguay, along with\nthe entire international community, is concerned about the\ngrowth of drug trafficking. We therefore firmly reiterate\nthe Paraguayan people\u2019s determination to combat that\nscourge and its resolve to take integrated and concerted\naction, within the context of international cooperation and\nin conjunction with producing, transit and consuming\ncountries.\nIn this connection, I am pleased to inform the\nAssembly that in October 1996 my country\u2019s Parliament,\nat the initiative of the Executive, adopted a law that\nestablishes norms and punishments for the crime of\nlaundering money or goods derived from illicit traffic in\nnarcotics, psychotropic substances or dangerous drugs,\nthereby significantly improving the legal framework for\ncombating such crimes head on.\nOn 10 December 1998 we shall celebrate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the proclamation of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, a major landmark in the\nhistory of humankind and its endless struggle to ensure\ndignity and reciprocity among human beings. Much of\nwhat we have achieved along the way has been the\nproduct of blood and pain, but with due satisfaction we\ncan now confirm that the principles and objectives of the\nDeclaration are increasingly being put into effect and that\nthe concept of a State based on the rule of law is\ngradually becoming part of our national realities.\nMoreover, the new culture of democratic solidarity has\nmanaged convincingly to combat any aspirations for a\nreturn to anachronistic times in our political history\ncharacterized by authoritarianism and the denial of human\nrights.\nFor Paraguay, the road to freedom and the\nestablishment of an institutional basis which sits well with\nour republican ideals has been long. During this journey,\nmy Government has helped make the dream of every\nParaguayan a reality: the establishment of a system\nguaranteeing full freedom and a strengthened democracy\nallowing the peaceful transfer of the presidential mandate\nto another candidate, elected by the people, who will take\nup the office of President of the Republic in August 1998.\n3\n\n\nThis is in keeping with the undeniable\nachievements of the World Conference on Human Rights\nheld in Vienna in 1993, which reaffirmed the universality\nand indivisibility of human rights, while recommending that\ngreater attention be paid to the links between democracy,\ndevelopment and the satisfaction of the basic needs of the\nmost disadvantaged sectors of the population.\nMy Government has therefore tried to strengthen the\ninterrelationship between democracy, development and\nhuman rights, thus combining these democratic\nachievements, through a plan for social action designed to\ncreate opportunities so that all citizens, through their own\nefforts, can enjoy all the benefits of human development.\nObviously, a central feature of democratic governance\nis concern for social problems. If our democracies do not\nadapt to these new realities, not only will they be\nimpossible to govern, but they will remain on the sidelines\nof history. Even worse, that all the sacrifices made to\nstrengthen our institutions may have to yield to populist and\nMessianic pressures.\nI am pleased to state today that my Government has\nbeen able to lay the foundations for true development,\nwithout making any Messianic promises or pandering to the\npopulists. I should highlight the significant progress made\nin the institutional framework of this process, with electoral\nreform that has enabled us to move satisfactorily through\nall the stages of the democratic schedule. Equally historic\nis the balance achieved in civil and military relations,\nfollowing the successes of April 1996, when popular\npressure and the enormous weight of solidarity on the\ncontinent thwarted attempts to take us back to outdated\nforms of autocracy.\nI am convinced that our fledgling democracy has\ngathered new strength since those events and that it will be\nan insuperable obstacle to any attempts to bring down our\ninstitutions. Furthermore, the changes to the administration\nof justice, with a multiparty Supreme Court, prevent any\nmanipulation or distortion of the mechanisms laid down by\nthe Constitution and the laws of the Republic.\nManagement by parliament has become part of the\nprocess of joint cooperation in government, and this has\nbeen an enriching experience in the democratic life of the\ncountry.\nParaguay has a young population which is eager to\nlearn. Current and future generations must be able to equate\na free economy with democracy and democracy with a\nState based on the rule of law, with guarantees for human\ndignity.\nDuring the Eleventh Summit of Heads of State and\nGovernment of the Rio Group, which was held in my\ncountry, I spoke enthusiastically about the need for a bold\nstrategy to back up the ideals of democracy, sustainable\ndevelopment, equity and integration, and placed particular\nemphasis on what I called \u201ceducation for democracy\u201d.\nThe training of young people in this emerging world\nmust include guidelines based on sound ethical and\ndoctrinaire principles. The young must be given\nexperience in how to handle modern technological tools,\nso that they can deal with the requirements of the new\npolitical, economic and social processes which are\ndefining the current and future development of our\nnations.\nFurther thought needs to be given to the\nenvironmental issue. Five years after the Rio Conference,\nthe Republic of Paraguay is building on the increasing\nawareness of the need to preserve the ecosystem, whose\npriority nature is reflected in the 1992 Constitution. But\nI must also emphasize how urgent it is to give full effect\nto the principle of common but differentiated\nresponsibility put forward in Rio. If it is to be valid, this\nprinciple must enjoy the support of richer countries in\nterms of financial and technical assistance, so that we can\nput an end once and for all to the \u201cecology of poverty\u201d\nwhich forces many sectors of poor countries to destroy\ntheir environmental basis with the simple and tragic aim\nof ensuring their subsistence from day to day.\nI have every reason to be satisfied that my\nGovernment has been able to institutionalize various\ninstruments to improve the quality of the environment in\nour country \u2014 in particular, the strategy for managing,\nusing, preserving and protecting natural resources in the\ncontext of the programme for change in Agenda 21,\nwhose basic aim it is to strengthen the process of\nsustainable development.\nHighlights of the new environmental legislation now\nin force include laws on evaluating the environmental\nimpact, on wildlife, on protected rural areas and on\npenalties for ecological offences. In the context of the\nAgenda for Change, we are ratifying international\nagreements, and taking account of the importance of\ninternational cooperation on the environment. With regard\nto the United Nations Convention to Combat\nDesertification in those Countries Experiencing Serious\n4\n\n\nDrought and/or Desertification, particularly in Africa, we\nsubmitted the legal instrument for ratifying the instrument\nin January this year. In this context, the countries that share\nthe Gran Chaco Americano \u2014 Paraguay, Bolivia and\nArgentina \u2014 have entered into a new relationship based on\na model of cooperation for sustainable development in this\nvast region.\nThere is an old saying that nobody is so rich that he\ndoes not need anything and nobody is so poor that he has\nnothing to give. In line with those words of wisdom, every\nMember State of this Organization has given and received.\nIn the particular case of Paraguay, I have to point out that\ninternational cooperation has played a decisive role, and its\ntrue dimensions can therefore be assessed and appreciated.\nFor this reason, I am particularly grateful to the United\nNations, whose presence in Paraguay, through its various\nspecialized agencies, has been and continues to be so\npositive and dynamic.\nJust over six years ago the Argentine Republic, Brazil,\nParaguay and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, and later,\nthe Republic of Chile and the Republic of Bolivia, as\nassociated members of the Southern Cone Common Market\n(MERCOSUR), decided to cooperate in a spirit of solidarity\nin order to gain an increasingly advantageous position in\nthis globalized and dynamic world. In that context we have\nreached undeniably relevant milestones for the present and\nfuture of our peoples.\nToday, it is recognized that in MERCOSUR we are on\nthe right path, and we are receiving an encouraging\nmessage from the outside world concerning our integration.\nOur efforts are focused on trying to establish a common\nmarket, within a gradual and continuous process in which\nthe basic stages still need to be rounded off, improved and\nstudied in depth.\nMERCOSUR\u2019s experience is expanding. This is an\nimportant regional bloc. We have opened negotiations with\nthe Andean Community and the United Mexican States, and\nwe hope that by the end of this year agreements will be\nsigned allowing for trade preferences in the region.\nMoreover, MERCOSUR participates in the Free Trade Area\nof the Americas, and there are proposals to conclude shortly\na hemispheric free trade initiative involving the 34 countries\nof the Americas.\nMERCOSUR is also expanding towards the European\nUnion. We are making progress in defining political\ndecisions which would encourage the establishment of a\nfree trade zone between the two customs unions.\nThis has been my third address to the General\nAssembly as President of the Republic of Paraguay. I am\nhere today to reconfirm on behalf of my country \u2014 a\nfounding Member of the United Nations \u2014 our\ncommitment to the lofty ideals that inspire us. Our\nOrganization needs to be adapted and reformed so as to\nbe able to respond effectively to the major challenges of\nthe next millennium. Paraguay undertakes to make its\ncontribution to attaining those noble objectives.\nAt this very special moment I warmly embrace the\nAssembly, not only in the name of my people, but also on\nbehalf of myself, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, a citizen with\nfaith in democracy, struggled for his country\u2019s freedom\nand won.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection to your high office, and to express our\nconfidence in the success of the work of the current\nsession. I also wish to thank sincerely Ambassador Razali\nIsmail for his enormous contribution to the work of the\nsessions of the General Assembly over which he presided.\nThe changes which have been taking place in our\nworld in recent years and the formation of a qualitatively\nnew geopolitical system of international relations require\nthe adaptation of the United Nations to new realities, with\nthe creation of a flexible and efficient international\nmechanism which can take effective measures to address\nthe new challenges of our time.\nIn Uzbekistan we have a positive assessment of\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan\u2019s plan for reforming the\nUnited Nations. Although a number of these proposals\nrequire careful study and additional elaboration, we can\nalready highlight concrete aspects which deserve support.\nI refer primarily to the decision on the enlargement of the\npermanent membership of the Security Council through\nthe inclusion of Germany and Japan, countries which\n\n\ntoday are playing a significant role in world economic and\npolitical affairs.\nWe also support the enlargement of the non-permanent\nmembership of the Security Council, which, in our view,\nwould provide for a more democratic representation of\nother States in this body.\nTo promote efficiency in implementing the resolutions\nof the United Nations, there is a need to reinforce and\nbroaden the authority of the Secretary-General. In our view,\nwe should also support the proposal to establish the post of\na Deputy Secretary-General.\nThe idea of merging all the United Nations entities in\ndifferent countries under one flag in the so-called United\nNations Houses seems to us quite rational.\nThe reform of the United Nations administration\nstructure will allow for reallocation of the funds saved to\nenhance development programmes.\nThe creation of a single agency to combat crime,\nterrorism, drug-trafficking and money-laundering is also a\ntimely proposal.\nThe proposals on consolidating the economic and\nsocial departments, cutting down on United Nations\nadministrative staff, replacing the Department of\nHumanitarian Affairs and establishing a streamlined\nEmergency Relief Coordination Office to coordinate\nactivities of all the United Nations agencies in\nimplementing assistance projects, also merit our attention.\nMaintaining security and stability in Central Asia and\nproviding conditions for the sustainable development of the\nStates of the region are among the crucial guidelines for the\nforeign policy of Uzbekistan. To achieve these goals,\nUzbekistan has put forward concrete initiatives, particularly\nwithin the rostrum of the United Nations.\nI should like to take this opportunity to draw attention\nagain to a number of problems which require an immediate\nsolution, both at the regional level and at the broader\ninternational level.\nI refer first to the continuing conflict in Afghanistan,\nwhich has recently become particularly brutal, and to the\ncontinuing instability in Tajikistan.\nOur position of principle regarding the Afghan\nsettlement remains unchanged. Its major aspects include\nsuch points as the maintenance of the territorial integrity\nof Afghanistan; the rejection of force as a means of\nsettling the conflict; the cessation of external interference;\nthe imposition of an arms embargo; the participation in a\nphased peace process of all the major forces involved in\nthe conflict; the implementation of the peace process\nunder the aegis of the United Nations, and with the\nparticipation of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference (OIC); and the creation of a broad-based\ncoalition Government including all the various opposition\nparties.\nWe share the view of the Secretary-General that if\nthe meaningless civil war in Afghanistan is to be halted,\nregional and international participants must shoulder\nadditional obligations. Despite all the complications of the\nsituation around Afghanistan, trends have recently been\nobserved which can, and indeed must, be used to begin\nthe peace process.\nThe proposal on imposing an arms embargo deserves\nspecial attention. Such an embargo, which has already\nbeen proposed by Uzbekistan on many occasions, must be\nconsidered the principal condition for halting external\ninterference in Afghanistan\u2019s affairs. We are well aware\nof the technical difficulties related to the implementation\nof this initiative in the conditions prevailing in\nAfghanistan. However, we do not think that they are\ninsurmountable. In our view, the process of imposing an\narms embargo should be divided into two stages: first, the\nadoption by the Security Council of a resolution on the\nembargo, which would be political in nature; secondly,\nthe drawing up of United Nations control machinery for\ncompliance.\nWe welcome the stepping up of United Nations\nefforts to resolve the Afghan problem, in particular, the\nappointment of Mr. Brahimi as the Special Envoy of the\nSecretary-General. We hope that the United Nations will\nalso support our initiative for the creation of a contact\ngroup from among the countries neighbouring\nAfghanistan, as well as the United States, Russia and\nother interested States, together with, of course,\nrepresentatives of inter-Afghan forces.\nUzbekistan fully supports the principle of the\nindivisibility of security \u2014 internal, regional and global.\nOur country was among the first of the newly\nindependent States to accede to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. At the forty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly, in 1993, Uzbekistan\ncalled upon the international community to declare\n2\n\n\nCentral Asia a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and we have been\nconsistently moving towards the implementation of this\ninitiative.\nConcrete confirmation of this policy was the holding\nof the international conference \u201cCentral Asia \u2014 Nuclear-\nWeapon-Free Zone\u201d in Tashkent on 14 to 16 September,\nunder United Nations auspices and with the participation of\nhigh-level representatives of more than 60 international\norganizations and countries. This forum was a major\ninternational event in the history of the region. However,\nwe are well aware that the process of establishing a\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia is not a one-time\npolitical action. It must be carried out within the framework\nof existing agreements and in accordance with international\nexperience, in particular within the framework of the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nIn this regard, on the regional level a reliable system\nof collective efforts by States participating in this initiative\nshould be developed. Those efforts must ensure the non-\nproliferation regime, the ecological safety of hazardous\nindustries that involve nuclear raw materials and the\nprevention of leakage of nuclear technologies and materials.\nOn the international level it is necessary to give\npriority attention to the settlement of regional problems.\nThe phased advancement towards global security is possible\nonly after we create secure and stable regions. In other\nwords, when dealing with global problems, it is essential to\nfollow the principle of moving from regionalism to\nglobalism.\nIt is also necessary to fundamentally reconsider the\nsecurity guarantees provided to the non-nuclear States, first\nand foremost to those participating in nuclear-weapon-free\nzones. We need to organically combine the efforts for\npromoting non-proliferation and ensuring global nuclear\nsecurity with the resolution of regional problems. The\nproblem of non-proliferation must be considered in close\nlinkage with significant reductions of other types of\nweapons of mass destruction.\nUzbekistan highly appreciates the efforts of\ninternational organizations \u2014 first of all the United\nNations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (OSCE) and the International Atomic Energy\nAgency (IAEA) \u2014 for their support of the Central Asian\ninitiative. We would like to request the General Assembly,\nits President and the Secretary-General to assist in the\npassage of a special resolution in support of the initiative\ndeclaring Central Asia a nuclear-weapon-free zone and in\nthe establishment of a United Nations expert group to\nstudy the forms and elements of the regional agreement\non this issue.\nOur cooperation within the framework of the OSCE\nis making a significant contribution to enhancing regional\nsecurity in Central Asia. We consider the OSCE\nParliamentary Assembly Expanded Bureau Meeting\nSeminar, held in September 1997 in the capital of\nUzbekistan, as the world community\u2019s recognition of\nCentral Asia\u2019s importance in issues related to\nstrengthening peace and stability on the regional and\nglobal levels.\nThe creation of the Central Asian collective\npeacekeeping battalion by Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and\nUzbekistan was an important step towards safeguarding\npeace and stability in the region. For the first time on the\nterritory of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan broad-scale\nexercises of the Central Asian collective peacekeeping\nbattalion, Centrazbat 97, were held, with the participation\nof multinational forces. These exercises constituted a\nserious test, the successful completion of which confirmed\nthis battalion as a fully fledged unit in the United Nations\nreserve peacekeeping forces.\nOnce again we should like to take advantage of this\nUnited Nations forum to call upon the international\ncommunity to pool its efforts to tackle the serious threat\nto the security of the Central Asian region that may also\nhave consequences on the global level. I am referring to\nthe ecological situation in the Aral Sea basin.\nThe current session of the General Assembly \u2014 the\nReform Assembly, as it was called by Secretary-General\nKofi Annan \u2014 must give a fresh impetus to the joint\nefforts of the international community in combating\norganized crime, drug dealing and terrorism. We need to\ndevelop transnational programmes to confront these\nchallenges and threats.\nWe may confidently say that if favourable conditions\nand trends are maintained, in the twenty-first century\nCentral Asia, given its geostrategic significance and its\nvast natural, energy and human resources, will become a\npromising and dynamic regional market of a global\nimportance.\nThe interdependence of the situation emerging in\nCentral Asia, the common European security system\ntaking shape and the outlook for developing situations\n3\n\n\nwithin the vast Asian continent means there is an urgent\nneed for the international community to take measures to\nensure durable peace and stability in this region along with\nits sustainable development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSpeaking here on behalf of my country, I wish to\ncongratulate the new Secretary-General of the Organization,\nMr. Kofi Annan, who, after nine months in his post, now\nfor the first time faces the responsibility of a session of the\nGeneral Assembly, a session that is likely to be noteworthy\nand hard-working. Given his vast experience, he is well\naware that the prestige and influence of his important post\nderive from the impartiality that places him above all\npressure of interests and raises him to the permanent status\nof arbitrator for all and a symbol of the Organization.\nI also wish to offer my congratulations to the Minister\nfor Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko,\non his appointment as President of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nThe pace of events today means that subjects that we\nconsidered just last year seem obsolete. Nevertheless, as we\nhave still not found solutions to the most pressing problems\nfacing the international community, it is logical to keep\nreturning to those that are of concern to every member of\nthat community and to the community as a whole, which\nnow finds itself in the midst of the most rapid process of\nchange in history.\nInevitably, therefore, we will again go over, for\nexample, human rights, the rule of law, free elections, the\nwar on drugs, corruption, disarmament, terrorism and other\ncompelling issues that crop up constantly among our\nconcerns and in our work nowadays.\nI must place on record the fact that the Government of\nVenezuela has taken measures on all these issues to ensure\nincreased respect for human rights, to wage war on drugs\nand to promote further disarmament and assist in the fight\nagainst corruption. Naturally, it is not easy for any country\nto show a clean record. A Government\u2019s good intentions as\nregards human rights will always immediately come up\nagainst recurring internal violence and still untamed unruly\nelements, as in the example constantly presented by the\naudiovisual media in developed countries. But the will\nexists and an effort is being made to make Government\nagencies increasingly aware of our resolve to protect\nguarantee human rights.\nI wish to highlight the work done by the first United\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Ecuador, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ayala-\nLasso, and welcome the new High Commissioner, the\nformer President of Ireland, Mrs. Mary Robinson, to\nwhom my country wishes every success in the stimulating\nbut difficult task ahead of her.\nWith regard to corruption, terrorism and\ndisarmament, my country, which proposed and was able\nto gain approval for the Inter-American Convention \u2014\nthe first of its kind in the world \u2014 in March 1996,\nremains steadfast in its efforts to ensure that every\ncountry is aware of the need to punish wrongdoing in\ngovernment, wrongdoing that has tended to be treated\nwith great indulgence. It may not be possible to eradicate\ncorruption, but timely punishment \u2014 by ending\nimpunity \u2014 will make such action risky.\nWe have been enthusiastic supporters of all\ninitiatives aimed at limiting the arms trade, in addition to\nbeing aware that there are free markets often beyond\nGovernment control, we are concerned that the\nindustrialized countries, by lifting embargoes in this field,\nmay begin moving towards the opposite extreme and\npromote the sale of weapons everywhere, under pressure\nfrom the military industry, which has an extremely\npowerful lobby.\nMy country has resolutely backed the programme to\neliminate landmines, hundreds of millions of which have\nbeen irresponsibly and thoughtlessly scattered in\nterritories on every continent, daily taking their toll of\nmany innocent victims, particularly children, whose\nmutilation by landmines is a constant reminder that we\nneed to ensure justice for humankind.\nThe fact that Venezuela has a neighbour where\nillegal drugs continue to be planted, processed and sold\nplaces us in the unfortunate position of being part of the\nsupply route and within an area influenced by drug\nmoney. That is why the Government of Venezuela has\ntaken every precaution to keep this danger to a minimum.\nIt fights trafficking on land and sea and in the air, and\nhas intercepted large shipments of drugs. The official in\ncharge of all Government action against this powerful\nenemy of humankind has been given the rank of Minister.\nIt goes without saying that we look forward\nhopefully to the next special session of the General\nAssembly, on illegal drug trafficking, to be held at the\nrequest of Mexico. We hope that it will produce clear\nsolutions that will enable us to wage a more successful\nwar on this scourge and, above all, put an end to money\nlaundering, where Government efforts have so far been\nleast successful.\n11\n\n\nAs the threat of ever more pitiless and atrocious acts\nof terrorism has spread around the world and, to no small\nextent, here on our American continent, Venezuela has\ntaken an interest in ensuring that the international\ncommunity is made increasingly aware of its\nresponsibilities in joint efforts to approve a convention for\nthe suppression of terrorist bombings. That convention is\ncurrently being considered by the General Assembly, in a\nbody that should be completing its work shortly.\nWhen the Inter-American Convention against\nCorruption was approved, we voiced our hope that, given\nthat the disregard for of ethical standards that has fostered\nthis crime has been a worldwide and not a strictly\nAmerican phenomenon, the subject would one day be taken\nup by the United Nations in order to produce an\ninternational convention giving voice to the concern felt by\nall countries over this problem and harnessing the general\nwillingness to put an end to impunity. The day seems to\nhave come when the Member States of this Organization\nwill work together to do away with the tolerance\nencountered on all continents towards this canker afflicting\npolitics and administration; a canker whose breeding ground\nis not underdevelopment, but the moral decay of the State\nand society; a canker that seriously and increasingly hinders\nthe trade that is a necessary part of economic globalization.\nMy Government has welcomed the idea of changes not\nonly in the structure, but even in the philosophy of this 50-\nyear-old Organization. Since the lives of the peoples of this\nworld have undergone such profound changes, it would be\ninexcusable for the United Nations, which represents them\nall, to remain untouched.\nWe have considered the various plans for reforms and\nwatched the efforts made by the outgoing President of the\nGeneral Assembly over these past few months to achieve\nsome, at least, of the essential changes to the system during\nhis term in office. And, although we believe this issue to be\nboth timely and urgent, we do not feel that there is\nimminent consensus on the suggested changes which, above\nall, relate to membership on the Security Council. In any\ncase, it is only fair to recognize the serious efforts being\nmade to end the stagnation within this Organization and\nlaunch the debate that is just beginning.\nVenezuela supports an increase in the number of\npermanent Members on the Security Council, provided\nthere is no discrimination of any kind and that there is due\nregard for the interests of the international community,\nincluding fair representation of all geographical regions, in\nline with other new circumstances.\nWe feel that there are great expectations and high\nhopes that the Secretariat will become more efficient and\nthat the Organization\u2019s burden of projected expenditures\nmay be eased. It is also essential that Member States pay\ntheir contributions on time. None of us can refuse to\nhonour a freely accepted obligation, nor make payment\nconditional in a way that presents a threat to the equality\nof States and the dignity of the world forum of which we\nare a part.\nMy country\u2019s position, however, is not limited to\nthis alone. It goes beyond an analysis of the opportunities\nand rules of the veto to the elimination of the veto\naltogether. It has to do with the reform of the Secretariat\nitself and with economic and social issues, especially\nfunding for development, as envisaged in the relevant\ndocument. That is why we feel that consideration should\nbe given to the ideas recently expressed by both the\nGroup of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement as regards\nnot only this subject, but also consensus on the other\nreforms.\nVenezuela supports the convening of an international\nconference on financing for development, in cooperation\nwith international financial institutions, to propose\ninnovative and bold mechanisms in this area. Such\nmechanisms must include the mobilization of capital\nresources for investment in non-industrialized countries\nwhile at the same time, opening the door to the\nopportunities offered by the private sector.\nNon-governmental organizations \u2014 increasingly\nactive in today\u2019s world \u2014 could contribute even more\ntowards attainment of the aims of the Charter of United\nNations in this field of action. My country has launched\nan intensive round of consultations with these\norganizations in what it has called a \u201cDialogue between\nsenior Government and non-governmental organizations\u201d,\nso as to draw up a plan for the promotion, protection and\nobservance of human rights in Venezuela.\nWe welcomed the Convention on the Law of the\nNon-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses as\na well-conceived initiative. That is why Venezuela played\nan active role in the various stages of the drafting of the\ndocument, which required years of work, and led to the\nsuccessful conclusion of a document that includes\nvirtually all the provisions on this subject that exist in\ninternational law. My country signed the Convention\nyesterday and we call upon other countries to do the\nsame.\n12\n\n\nAs Venezuela has always been in favour of the\nestablishment of an international criminal court, we wish to\ndraw attention to what the international community has\ndone to deal with and punish international crimes against\npeace and security, first with the creation of ad hoc courts\nand then with the creation of a permanent body such as that\ncourt. By thus institutionalizing and centralizing the\npolitical will of States, we will help prevent the possibility\nof the winners in a conflict from being tempted to become\nthe judges of the defeated.\nThis seems the appropriate time and place to mention\nthe Ibero-American community of which Venezuela is a\npart and the five hundredth anniversary of Christopher\nColumbus\u2019s only landing on continental America in his\nvoyages.\nSince 1991, 500 years after the discovery of America,\nthanks to an initiative of the King of Spain, the 21\ncountries that proudly share the honour of being members\nof the Ibero-American community have met once a year, in\na different city each time. I say \u201cproudly\u201d because in their\ncolonial endeavours both Spain and Portugal took a\nmissionary approach. While imposing their political power\nand territorial government, they also disseminated\nChristianity and passed on with conviction their European\ncivilization and culture. Thus in Spanish and Portuguese\nAmerica, the mixing of blood and cultures took root,\nmaking our world a different one, a world characterized by\nsocial egalitarianism, religious tolerance and a strong and\ndeeply rooted freedom. The effects of this situation, which\ndefines and unites American existence from north to south,\nmakes this community stand out. It does not set it apart\nfrom others, but, in this era of globalization, it affirms the\nvery particular features of Ibero-American identity.\nThis idea has evolved well, beginning in Guadalajara,\nthen continuing in Madrid, Salvador de Bahia, Cartagena,\nBariloche and Santiago. The seventh summit meeting will\nbe held on Margarita Island in my country.\nAs the host country suggests the key topic for\ndiscussion at each meeting, the President of Venezuela,\nMr. Rafael Caldera, has proposed the general heading of\n\u201cEthical values of democracy\u201d, a suggestion that has been\naccepted with great enthusiasm.\nThe Governments of Venezuela and the other 20\ncountries of Ibero-America insist that it is not enough to\nhave formal democracy if corruption is rampant, if\ninefficiency persists, if justice is not effective, or if the\naction taken by the democratic sectors is neither\nsatisfactory nor transparent.\nThus, this general topic encompasses other very\nspecific issues having to do with social justice, human\nrights, electoral transparency elections, the sincerity of\npolitical parties and, unavoidably, truth in information.\nThat is the nucleus of the agenda for the meeting to be\nheld on 8 and 9 November on Margarita Island.\nIt is not out of place to explain to this Assembly that\nthere are good reasons for this agenda. The economic\nchanges and the political upheavals of our world have\nwreaked havoc on the set of values that was, until\nrecently, the foundation on which people\u2019s lives rested.\nThe weakness of social justice is pathetic. In more\nthan a few countries, unavoidable macroeconomic\nadjustments have affected vast numbers of people who are\nvictims of injustice and who are unable, both mentally\nand physically, of coping with these changes, leaving\nthem even worse off than they were before. Something\nmust be done to improve the lot of these multitudes\nduring a transition that, although necessary, is still\npainful.\nThe subject of human rights, which I mentioned\nbriefly at the beginning of my statement, is vitally\nimportant, and it would not be surprising if some day it\nwere to replace \u201cdemocracy\u201d as a term and as a concept.\nCertain statements on this subject may have been\nexaggerated in the heat of the moment. But the truth is\nthat we must march firmly forward towards a time when\nevery human being, without exception, feels for his fellow\nman the same respect that he asks for himself. This is a\nmatter of education, training and will on the part of\nGovernments, so that the bad examples from the more\ndeveloped countries that are passed on by the media do\nnot lead the developing countries to continue violating\nthese rights.\nDespite the fact that democracy has taken root in\nvirtually all the countries in our region \u2014 seemingly the\ndesideratum of our times \u2014 it now faces a variety of\ndangers, such as elections rigged by international\norganized crime. The most specific and dangerous case\nhas to do with the influential role that drug trafficking\nand money laundering now play in elections, allowing\ncrime to become closely entwined with political power.\nMy country\u2019s position in this regard is to warn\npolitical parties to make sure their electoral campaigns are\n13\n\n\ntransparent by keeping these campaigns short and to the\npoint so as to avoid any improper financial influence.\nDemocracy is, by its very nature, a system of political\nparties. There is no democratic system without political\nparties. Yet it is obvious that the downfall of democracy is\noften due to carelessness on the part of the political parties\non which it is based, when, setting aside the ethics of\nservice, ideology and efficiency, they are tempted to take\nadvantage of the resources of the State using the pretext of\nlengthy, complex and costly election campaigns. It would\nseem that the time has come to return to the old political\nideas or to invent new means of expression in order to heal\nand revitalize democracy.\nMany people reacted by voicing doubts and fears\nwhen the subject of the people\u2019s right to truthful\ninformation was raised. Media groups have even claimed\nthat this proposal is full of hidden dangers. Nevertheless,\nthe straightforward intent of this proposal is to strengthen\nthe influence of the media at a time when they are virtually\nthe first estate. We consider this right to be the counterpart\nto the media\u2019s right to carry out their activities in absolute\nfreedom, given the fact that society legitimately aspires, in\nturn, to be properly, accurately and truthfully informed.\nIn an era in which the media have the most amazing\ntechnologies at their disposal \u2014 such as those providing\ninstantaneous communication \u2014 there can be no\nexplanation for information that distorts, embellishes or\ntampers with the truth. All the power that we give the\nmedia, essential for the values of democracy, would be lost\nif the media were to step outside their role and begin\nvoicing opinions instead of reporting or made themselves\npart of the day-to-day debate of ideas.\nWhat Venezuela hopes to achieve by this debate is to\nmake clear the responsibilities that each actor must play in\na democracy, and the media are very important actors. That\nis the reason for this initiative: to warn and caution them,\nnot by suggesting rules, but by appealing to a sense of\nresponsibility, prompted by their own conscience, with\nregard to the worthy part that information must play in\nbuilding a safe and trusting society.\nFollowing on from comments I made at this year\u2019s\nIbero-American Summit in Venezuela, I wish to mention\nthe five-hundredth anniversary of the day when Christopher\nColumbus set foot on continental America, in August 1498,\nat the Paria Peninsula in Venezuela. Until then the feats of\nexploration by the discoverer of the New World had been\nlimited to the islands of the Caribbean. He was not\nabsolutely sure that he was actually standing on\ncontinental soil when in 1498 he reached Macuro, a small\nvillage on the eastern coast of Venezuela, but he certainly\nwondered as he witnessed the thrust of a strong current\nthat overcame the gentle waves and gave proof of the\npresence of a great river, the Orinoco. This was an\nextremely important event for my country, which we plan\nto commemorate properly. It was the only time the great\nadmiral stood on terra firma, which he called \u201cLand of\nGrace\u201d. In making this announcement, we hope the global\ncommunity will join us in our celebration.\nIn closing, I wish to express Venezuela\u2019s faith in the\nability of the Organization to act as a permanent arbitrator\nfor peace and development. There is a greater need every\nday for the United Nations to act as the voice and\nconscience of humanity, but never as the spokesperson or\ntool of any group, region or interest other than the\ncommunity which created it and of which it is the core.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nLiechtenstein Government, I should like to congratulate the\nPresident on his election to preside over the fifty-second\nsession of the General Assembly. I wish also to express my\nthanks and recognition to the Permanent Representative of\nMalaysia, Ambassador Razali Ismail, for the dynamic way\nin which he conducted the work of the fifty-first session.\nFurther, I should like to pay tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan, our\nnew Secretary-General. In the first nine months of his\ntenure, and at a particularly decisive time for the United\nNations, he has shown great leadership qualities. I wish to\nassure him of our full support and cooperation.\nWe live in a world that is more interdependent than\never before. Globalization implies that Governments and\nsocieties can best meet such global challenges as\ndemocracy, the eradication of poverty, the promotion and\nprotection of human rights, sustainable development,\nhumanitarian emergencies and refugee problems if they take\naction together. International problems require international\nsolutions, and the world community must work together to\ndeal with them on the basis of international law, through a\nconstructive dialogue of the international community as a\nwhole.\nThis leads me to our Organization, which is a unique\n\u2014 indeed, the only \u2014 forum for such cooperation, and to\nthe deep and far-reaching reform proposals which the\nSecretary-General, after a first reform package submitted in\nMarch, presented in his report (A/51/950) of 14 July 1997.\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has taken on the challenging\ntask of reform with the necessary combination of energy\nand circumspection. I wish first of all to state that we\nwelcome the report and will lend our full support to\nachieving its objectives. I hope that the reform process will\nlead to concrete results before the end of this year. We\nshare the opinion of those countries that have stressed that\nreform must not be a cost-cutting exercise but a matter of\nstrengthening the role of the Organization as an active and\neffective world forum.\nWe welcome and support the Secretary-General\u2019s\nproposal to establish the post of a Deputy Secretary-General\nwho will have a particular role in ensuring the success of\nactivities and programmes that cross functional sectors and\nSecretariat units. We particularly support the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s suggestion to fill that post with a qualified\nwoman. We also welcome the proposal to replace the\nDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs with an Office of the\nEmergency Relief Coordinator, and we hope that this\nmeasure will bring about the necessary changes to ensure\na more efficient coordination of United Nations activities\nin this very important field.\nThe Secretary-General has also suggested integrating\nhuman rights into all the principal activities of the United\nNations, and we are fully supportive of this approach\nbecause it reflects the comprehensive and cross-cutting\nnature of human rights. We are gratified to see Mrs. Mary\nRobinson in her new post as United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights. We wish her success in\nher challenging tasks and pledge to her our full support.\nWe are confident that her appointment will give\nadditional momentum to the promotion and protection of\nhuman rights worldwide and that the consolidation of her\nOffice with the Centre for Human Rights will provide her\nwith a solid institutional basis from which to take on her\nprincipal responsibility for United Nations human rights\nactivities. That will be possible, however, only if the\nunderfunding of human rights programmes that we have\nwitnessed for so long finally comes to an end. Human\nrights are the legitimate concern of the international\ncommunity, and this should be reflected in the\nappropriation of sufficient funds from the regular budget.\nWe also continue to be very concerned about the\nprecarious overall financial situation of the Organization,\nwhich is obviously linked to the failure of some Member\nStates to fulfil their obligations regarding the prompt and\nfull payment of their assessed financial contributions. It\nis important to note that the best reform efforts will be\nseriously hampered unless the Organization\u2019s finances are\nput in order.\nSince we last met in New York for the general\ndebate at the fifty-first session of the General Assembly,\nmajor \u2014 indeed, crucial \u2014 efforts have been undertaken\nto eliminate anti-personnel landmines. This matter has\nbecome a truly global cause, promoted by individuals and\nnon-governmental organizations worldwide and propelled\nby Governments, which have committed themselves to the\nOttawa process to achieve a global ban on landmines.\nThis is of exemplary value. Liechtenstein remains\ncommitted to the elimination of anti-personnel landmines,\nand we therefore wholeheartedly support the results of the\nnegotiations that were concluded recently at Oslo. We are\nparticularly pleased that it was possible to agree on a final\ntext which is simple, with no exceptions, no reservations\nand no loopholes. We are of the opinion that only such a\ntreaty can bring us closer to the goal of the total\nelimination of anti-personnel landmines, and I would like\nto take this opportunity to thank all those who have made\noutstanding efforts in the course of the Ottawa process,\n20\n\n\nparticularly the Governments of Canada, Austria, Belgium\nand Norway, as well as the International Committee of the\nRed Cross.\nWhile the adoption of the treaty will constitute a\nmilestone in the history of both disarmament and\ninternational humanitarian law, further steps will be needed,\nand the participation of as many States as possible in the\nmeeting which will bring the process back to Ottawa in\nDecember will be a crucial element in those efforts.\nLiechtenstein plans to sign the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer\nof Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction and is\ncommitted to its ratification at the earliest possible date.\nThe establishment of an international criminal court is\nanother area in which we have been able to make\nsignificant progress over the past year, and we are\napproaching the date of the diplomatic conference at which\nthe statute of the court will be adopted. We wholeheartedly\nsupport the establishment of the international criminal court,\nwhich will constitute a milestone in the history of\ninternational law, and we continue to believe that that court\nhas to be strong and independent if it is to make an\neffective contribution to the protection of human rights and\nthe observance of international humanitarian law. It is of\ncrucial importance that the General Assembly agree at this\nsession on the precise dates for the diplomatic conference\nand that that decision allow for the fullest possible\nparticipation by small States, which have a particular\ninterest in this matter.\nTwo years ago, we adopted the Declaration and\nPlatform of Action at the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen in Beijing. Initiatives and actions have been taken\ntowards the implementation of these commitments. The\nLiechtenstein Government has since taken a number of\nappropriate measures, while a comprehensive package\ncontaining detailed further action is presently being\nprepared.\nThe role of women in preventive diplomacy and in\npeacekeeping and the persistent absence of women from\npeace negotiations are of particular concern to my\ndelegation. The more active participation of women in\nconflict resolution should be promoted, since women bring\ndifferent perspectives and innovative approaches to\npreventive diplomacy as well as to peacekeeping. The equal\naccess and full participation of women in decision-making\nat all levels and in power structures, including challenging\nassignments, such as serving as special representatives of\nthe Secretary-General, are also important in the area of\nthe promotion and maintenance of peace and security.\nSpecial attention should be given to the situation of\nwomen in armed conflicts, including refugee women.\nWomen are particularly vulnerable to discrimination and\nhuman rights violations, both before they flee and as\nrefugees. In the Beijing Platform of Action, the need to\nprovide protection, assistance and training to refugee\nwomen and displaced women is clearly recognized.\nLiechtenstein first introduced in 1991 an initiative on\nthe right of self-determination, the ultimate goal of which\nis to enable States facing internal problems \u2014 be they\nbetween the central Government and communities or\nbetween communities within States \u2014 to cope with these\nproblems in a peaceful and flexible manner on the basis\nof international law and through constructive dialogue.\nEver since, we have consolidated and further developed\nour ideas, and we would like to thank all those who have\ngiven us active support in this endeavour.\nAt the end of October, the Liechtenstein Research\nProgram in Self-Determination at the Woodrow Wilson\nSchool of Princeton University will continue its series of\nconferences devoted to issues of self-government and self-\nadministration. I would like to renew to all here our\ninvitation to attend the next conference, which will take\nplace from 31 October to 1 November. We hope that this\nconference will provide a deeper understanding of the\ncomplex issues underlying the concept of self-\ndetermination, which has played such an outstanding role\nin the history of our Organization. We hope that this\ninitiative can be a positive contribution to the future work\nof the United Nations.\nThe capacity of the United Nations to deal with the\nchallenges of the future, however, will depend on our\ndecisions on the reform of the Organization, decisions\nwhich we have to take now. Today, I wish to renew\nLiechtenstein\u2019s commitment to the principles and\npurposes of the United Nations. We are willing to\ncontribute to the extent possible so that this chance to\nrenew the United Nations will not pass us by.\n\n\n\n"

Subsequently, as members know, the Republic of\nArmenia resorted to armed aggression against the\nAzerbaijani Republic, occupying a considerable part of\nAzerbaijan and leaving about a million people without\nshelter.\nTheir later invention, the so-called Republic of\nNagorny Karabakh, is nothing but a tactical trick in the\nstrategy of Armenian politicians, which is to attach the\nNagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic to\nthe Republic of Armenia. The international community\nrejected this policy through Security Council resolutions\n822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993),\nwhich reaffirmed that the Nagorny Karabakh region is a\npart of Azerbaijan.\nThe 1996 Lisbon summit of the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) put forward\nthree principles for the settlement of the Armenia-\nAzerbaijan conflict. These were: the territorial integrity of\nthe Republic of Armenia and of the Azerbaijani Republic;\ndefinition of the legal status of Nagorny Karabakh\nthrough an agreement based on self-determination and\nconferring on Nagorny Karabakh the highest degree of\nself-rule within Azerbaijan; and guaranteed security for\nNagorny Karabakh and its entire population, including\nmutual obligations to ensure compliance by all the parties\nwith the provisions of the settlement.\nArmenia was the only country out of 54 OSCE\nmember States that rejected those principles. While\n7\n\n\nspeaking in favour of a peaceful settlement of the conflict\nat the earliest possible date, the Republic of Armenia\nreceived, during the period 1993 to 1996, a vast amount of\nRussian weaponry, far exceeding its requirements, including\ntanks, armoured vehicles and SCUD missiles, worth $1\nbillion. This clearly demonstrates that that country has not\nyet given up its aggressive plans.\nIn an address to permanent representatives of United\nNations Member States during a visit to United Nations\nHeadquarters last August, the President of Azerbaijan, Mr.\nHeydar Aliyev, stated that Azerbaijan had been and would\ncontinue to be in favour of a peaceful resolution of the\nconflict. Azerbaijan is ready to provide the Armenian\npopulation of the Nagorny Karabakh region with the\nbroadest possible autonomy, in accordance with world\nstandards, but it will never submit to seizure of part of its\nterritory or allow a second Armenian State to be created at\nthe expense of its own land.\nAzerbaijan supported proposals submitted in\nSeptember by the Co-Chairmen of the OSCE Minsk\nConference, the United States, Russia and France. The\nelaboration of a draft agreement on cessation of the armed\nconflict on the basis of those proposals would create a solid\nfoundation for achieving a breakthrough in the process of\nfinding a settlement to the Armenia-Azerbaijan armed\nconflict.\nThe reform package for the United Nations proposed\nby the Secretary-General is a serious and fundamental\ndocument. Azerbaijan welcomes his report (A/51/950) as a\nreal basis for conducting reforms in order to adapt the\nUnited Nations to today\u2019s rapidly changing demands and\nmake it better prepared to meet the challenges of the\ntwenty-first century. Azerbaijan is prepared to cooperate\nwith all Member States and with the Secretary-General and\nhis reform team in order to achieve the goal that has been\nset.\nWe support the Secretary-General\u2019s realistic\nassessment that the main aim of the present reform is to\nnarrow the gap between the aspirations and achievements\nof the United Nations. We think that establishing the\nposition of Deputy Secretary-General, setting up a Senior\nManagement Group, creating a Strategic Planning Unit and\nstrengthening the executive committees of the sectoral\ngroups, together with a number of other suggestions,\nconstitute an interesting and comprehensive approach that\nwill ensure the harmonious management and functioning of\nthis Organization as it tackles the new and complex tasks\nof the twenty-first century.\nWe are of the view that, given the numerous\npressing problems, the maintenance of peace and security\nthroughout the world must continue to be the main\nmission of our Organization. In this regard, Azerbaijan\nwelcomes and supports the Secretary-General\u2019s ideas on\nstrengthening the potential of the United Nations in post-\nconflict peace-building, with the Department of Political\nAffairs as the focal point for this.\nThis matter is integrally linked to the issue of\nadvancing the disarmament agenda. Accordingly, the idea\nof establishing a Department for Disarmament and Arms\nRegulation, which would address the reduction and\nregulation of armaments and weapons of mass\ndestruction, deserves every support.\nWith regard to disarmament as a whole, I would like\nto dwell on the urgent problem of the proliferation of\nconventional arms. The lack of norms regulating\nconventional arms causes serious concern. One cannot but\nagree with the Secretary-General when he says that such\na situation creates a vicious circle, in that Member States\nseek assistance in the settlement of armed conflicts, while\nthere is tough competition over arms exports, including\nexports to conflict areas where the United Nations is\nseeking to restore peace. All of this leads to the further\nescalation and prolongation of conflicts.\nThe expansion of the Security Council is a pressing,\nacute and complex issue. We believe that any increase in\nthe number of permanent members of the Security\nCouncil must be confined to countries with the capacity\nand will to assume global responsibility, including\nfinancial responsibility, for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, and for sustainable\ndevelopment and stability. In this context, Azerbaijan has\non several occasions spoken in favour of the candidatures\nof Germany and Japan, which in our view meet those\nrequirements.\nAn increase in the number of non-permanent\nmembers of the Security Council should restore the\nprinciple of equitable geographic allocation of seats for all\nregional groups. In this connection, Azerbaijan supports\nan increase in the number of non-permanent members of\nthe Security Council from the Group of Eastern European\nStates, given that membership of the Group has doubled\nin the past five years. We believe that one non-permanent\nseat for our Group in the Security Council does not\nreflect the current state of affairs and is not\ncommensurate with the role played by the members of the\n8\n\n\nGroup in the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity.\nAzerbaijan also supports the approach taken to the\nquestion of equitable representation of Asian, African, Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean States in the Council. The issue of\nthe total number of permanent and non-permanent members\nof the Security Council should first be addressed from the\nperspective of maintaining and upgrading the efficiency of\nthe Council.\nWe fully support the Secretary-General\u2019s idea that one\nof the main directions for United Nations reform must be\nto strengthen United Nations activities in the area of\ncoordination of international cooperation for development.\nWe are convinced that at a time when the question of\nmore rational use of United Nations resources, including\nfinancial resources, has become a priority, the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s decision to focus on the activities that the United\nNations can best carry out, from the standpoint both of\nusing existing intellectual potential and of meeting the\nrequirements of a large group of members of the\ninternational community, is very wise.\nThe Azerbaijani Republic greatly appreciates the\nnature and results of its cooperation with the United\nNations system in the area of socio-economic development.\nSince our country joined the United Nations, dozens of\nlarge-scale development projects have been implemented in\nAzerbaijan with help from United Nations specialized\nagencies. These projects have had a positive impact on the\nall-round transformation of Azerbaijani society. I would like\nto make particular mention of the establishment of a free\neconomic zone in the third largest city of Azerbaijan,\nSumgait, and the programme to rehabilitate the territories\nof Azerbaijan liberated from Armenian occupation.\nWe welcome the idea of establishing a United Nations\nDevelopment Group, and we believe that strengthening\ncoordination in the activities of the various agencies will\nadd to the efficiency of the operational development\nactivities of the Organization. Among the factors that could\nhelp us achieve this goal are the elaboration of a\ncomprehensive strategy for the activities of specialized\nagencies vis-\u00e0-vis the recipient countries, the elimination of\noverlap in functions and programmes, a renewed\nconcentration on priorities, and the improvement of\npartnership mechanisms with State institutions and non-\ngovernmental organizations of Member States.\nBut all these good wishes and hopes may prove to\nbe simply an unattainable dream if they are not\naccompanied by a relevant resource base. In this respect,\nMr. Kofi Annan\u2019s idea of creating a new system for\nmobilizing core resources for development purposes,\nthrough voluntary contributions and negotiated pledges\nthat would be made available in multi-year tranches, is to\nbe commended and supported. We are convinced that it\nis necessary to provide the broadest possible mandate for\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s proposed Office for Development\nFinancing.\nWe welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal to\ndeepen and expand the partnership between the United\nNations and the Bretton Woods institutions with a view\nto strengthening cooperation and increasing the\nrationalization and coordination of activities. In recent\nyears Azerbaijan has accumulated considerable experience\nthrough fruitful cooperation with the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF). Thanks to this\ncooperation it has been possible to improve the overall\neconomic situation in the Republic, to curb rampant\ninflation and restore economic growth.\nReforming the structure of the Secretariat\ndepartments dealing with social and economic matters and\nconferring new functions on the Economic and Social\nCouncil are, in our view, logical elements of the\ncomprehensive reform programme proposed by the\nSecretary-General.\nAt the same time, it is obvious that reform will not\nproduce the best results if the finances of the\nOrganization are not put into good order. Given this fact,\nwe understand the proposal for the establishment, as a\ntemporary measure until the Organization\u2019s financial\nsituation is on a solid basis, of a Revolving Credit Fund\nwith initial capital of up to $1 billion financed from\nvoluntary contributions or other means that Member\nStates may wish to suggest. In this connection we also\nfully support the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal to open a\ndevelopment account.\nWe are also firmly convinced that reforming the\npersonnel policy of the United Nations should be an\ninseparable part of the reform. We are deeply concerned\nby the fact that even today Azerbaijan is still not\nrepresented in the Secretariat.\nIn recent years the world has been overwhelmed by\na wave of extraordinary situations resulting from armed\nconflict, natural disasters and economic crises. As a\n9\n\n\nconsequence of these situations millions of people have lost\ntheir homes, been deprived of food and basic living\nconditions and have become refugees and displaced\npersons. This issue is of particular relevance to Azerbaijan,\nas refugees and displaced persons in the Republic are in\ndire need of emergency humanitarian assistance. Recently,\nseveral regions of Azerbaijan suffered flooding as a result\nof continuous rainfall, which inflicted serious damage on\nthe economy and the people. Azerbaijan greatly appreciates\nthe humanitarian activities of the United Nations aimed at\nprotecting and saving the victims of armed conflict and\nnatural disasters.\nWe fully endorse the idea contained in the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s report that humanitarian actions today extend\nbeyond the mere provision of relief and also entail early\nwarning, prevention, advocacy and rehabilitation as well as\nassistance for transition to long-term development. At the\nsame time we hope that structural changes \u2014 such as the\ncreation of the Office of the Emergency Relief Coordinator\nto replace the Department of Humanitarian Affairs and the\nmobilizing of its efforts to deal more effectively with\ncomplex emergencies \u2014 will not result in a decrease in\nhumanitarian assistance for single recipient countries that\nare faced with the consequences of armed conflicts, foreign\naggression and occupation and that have hundreds of\nthousands \u2014 even millions \u2014 of refugees and displaced\npersons.\nThis also applies to the suggested reforms of the\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), of whose\nExecutive Board Azerbaijan is a member. We believe it\nnecessary to maintain the independence of UNICEF in the\nareas of fund-raising and contacts with donors to ensure\ncontributions for funding the programmes of the\norganization and accountability to donors with regard to\nhow the funds are spent. We consider it important that the\nspecialized agencies continue to have specific goals and\nmechanisms to achieve those goals. At the same time we\nsupport the proposals regarding a common starting point,\nclose coordination and interaction, and the adoption of\nmeasures to avoid overlap and the dissipation of resources.\nUNICEF\u2019s mandate includes not only the development\nof children, but their protection and survival. The United\nNations Children\u2019s Fund, together with such entities as the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees and the World Food Programme, becomes\nactively involved in saving the lives of children in\nemergencies. There is an effective mechanism for\ninteraction between UNICEF and humanitarian\norganizations, donors, Governments and local and\ninternational non-governmental organizations. We hope\nthat the establishment of the United Nations Development\nGroup will not weaken but, on the contrary, strengthen\nthis function of UNICEF.\nWe support the idea of common premises for United\nNations missions at the country level, to be called \u201cUN\nHouse\u201d. This would certainly encourage closer and more\neffective interaction between specialized agencies and\nUnited Nations programmes. As for Resident\nCoordinators, we believe it would be expedient to select\nthem from representatives of all interested organizations.\nA mechanism such as rotation should be worked out for\nthis. We also support the idea of convening joint\ncommittees and consecutive meetings of relevant\nexecutive boards.\nOn the eve of the twenty-first century, it is high time\nto consolidate the efforts of all countries for a resolute\nattack on crime, drug abuse and terrorism. Organized\nunderworld groups that enjoy access to sophisticated\ntechnologies and weaponry are challenging law and order\nas well as economic, political and other institutions, not\nonly in individual countries but in entire regions and\nthroughout the world. The United Nations must be at the\nforefront of the battle to curtail the activities of such\ngroups. At the same time, we need to ensure that the\nefforts of the international community are centralized if\nwe are to succeed in crushing crime and drug abuse. In\nthis context we support the idea of uniting the United\nNations International Drug Control Programme with a\nnew Centre for International Crime Prevention to create\na new Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, to\nbe located in Vienna.\nEnsuring human rights remains one of the most\nimportant of the Organization\u2019s fields of activity. It is\nespecially urgent today when the issue of human rights\npermeates all aspects of public life and is equally relevant\nto all countries and all regions of the world. Human rights\nare closely connected with political, economic, social and\nother processes. The events of recent years have\ndemonstrated that expansionist actions on the part of\nsome States, aggressive separatism and economic\ndifficulties deprive States of their ability adequately to\ndefend and ensure the human rights of their citizens. That\nis why the United Nations will have to strengthen its\nactivities, exposing and neutralizing the factors that lead\nto human rights abuse. We approve in particular of the\nmeasures recommended by the Secretary-General with\nregard to existing or potential conflicts or post-conflict\nsituations affecting human rights.\n10\n\n\nWe believe it right to suggest that the issue of human\nrights must be considered to an equal degree in all four\nsubstantive fields of the Secretariat\u2019s work programme:\npeace and security, economic and social affairs,\ndevelopment cooperation and humanitarian affairs. In the\ncontext of enhancing the work of the Organization\u2019s\ndivisions in the field of human rights, we commend the\nconsolidation of the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for Human\nRights into a single Office of the High Commissioner. This\nwill strengthen that entity and lay the groundwork for more\nefficient use of available human and financial resources.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s report \u201cRenewing the United\nNations: A Programme for Reform\u201d (A/51/950) is a\ncomprehensive and far-reaching set of changes aimed at\noverhauling the Organization. The quintessential idea of the\nreport that reform should constitute a continuous and steady\nprocess, not a quick fix, is of particular significance.\nIn conclusion, I would like to point out that the\nsuggested measures and recommendations are aimed both\nat creating new structures of leadership and management\nand at harmonizing the activities of all bodies of the United\nNations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffBefore I begin my speech,\nmay I associate myself with the final appeal made by\nPrince Albert of Monaco, who preceded me at this rostrum.\nPerhaps this Organization can be instrumental in achieving\nan Olympic truce for the Olympic Games of 2000 and for\nthose of 2004, which we will host in Athens. I think that\nthis is an initiative that the Organization should take\nseriously.\nAllow me to warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection. Your qualities and skills augur well for the\nprogress of this session. Moreover, I am especially pleased\nto salute in your person a representative of the Ukraine, a\ncountry with which Greece maintains long-standing friendly\nrelations. I wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor,\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, for the effective manner in\nwhich he performed his functions.\nThe Greek Government is impressed with the way the\nnew Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has been\ndischarging his duties. His great experience warrants the\nhope that his ongoing endeavours aiming at the reform of\nthis Organization will be crowned with success.\nOn this occasion, I would like to express my\nappreciation to the United Nations membership at large\nfor electing Greece to one of the positions of Vice-\nPresident of the General Assembly.\nEarlier this week, the Foreign Minister of\nLuxembourg, in his capacity as President of the Council\nof the European Union, delivered a statement to which\nmy Government fully subscribes; we subscribe as well as\nto the Union\u2019s memorandum, which has been submitted\nto the Assembly. I would like, however, to elaborate\nfurther on some issues of particular interest to my\ncountry.\nAs the millennium draws to a close, Greece, located\nat a crossroads of countries and civilizations, is striving\nto free the twenty-first century from the scourges of the\npast, thus offering to our region prospects of progress and\nprosperity. We are the only member of both the European\nUnion and of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO) in our region, and we thus we function as the\nlatter\u2019s link to Europe, guided by our firm belief that\nconflicts and prejudices have to be overcome through\nrespect for international law and the principles of the\nUnited Nations.\nIn this context, we believe that Greece is able to\nplay an important role in the Security Council and are\ntherefore seeking election to that body, to one of the two\nnon-permanent seats allocated to the Group of Western\nEuropean and Other States for the biennium 1999-2000.\nDeeply dedicated to the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter, we are ready to take our share of\nresponsibility for international peace and security. Indeed,\nGreece has been actively participating in several\npeacekeeping operations as a troop-contributing country.\nThis year, we became a member of the Special\nCommittee on Peacekeeping Operations. We have\nadvocated the Committee\u2019s expansion as a positive step\nforward, and we support any effort aimed at improving\nthe peacekeeping capabilities of the United Nations.\nFurthermore, Greece has confirmed its willingness to\nparticipate in the stand-by arrangements system and has\njoined other Member States in the continued efforts to\n4\n\n\nenable the Organization to react more quickly and more\nefficiently to future peacekeeping requirements. As I\nreaffirm our palpable commitment to peacekeeping, I wish\nalso to express my country\u2019s deep appreciation for the\ncourage and dedication shown by peacekeeping personnel\nin confronting challenges to peace and security.\nComprehensive reform and restructuring of the United\nNations system, including the size and working methods of\nthe Security Council, must be attained with a view to\nmeeting the changing needs of the world community as it\nmoves into the next millennium. The reform package\npresented by the Secretary-General in July is a response to\nthis necessity and constitutes a welcome step towards\nmodernizing and strengthening the United Nations. Greece\nwill contribute in a constructive and positive way to the\nsuccess of the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General\nthrough his proposals.\nWe live in a world characterized by globalization and\nthe introduction of new technologies; hence, the United\nNations is called upon to pursue a broader set of objectives\nfocusing on democratic development, sustainable\ndevelopment and higher living standards for all citizens of\nthe world. The political commitment of its Member States\nand their contribution of adequate resources constitute the\ntwo fundamental prerequisites for the success of the United\nNations. In this context, we welcome the determination of\nall Member States, in particular those that play a major role\nin the Organization\u2019s decision-making process, to fulfil their\nfinancial obligations on time and in full.\nGreece, a State Member of the United Nations since\n1945, will continue to honour its obligations to the United\nNations, gradually increasing its annual contribution to the\npeacekeeping operations budget, moving from group C to\ngroup B on its own initiative.\nThe nineteenth special session of the General\nAssembly, on the overall review and appraisal of the\nimplementation of Agenda 21, held last June, gave us the\nopportunity five years after the United Nations Conference\non Environment and Development, the Rio Conference, to\nrenew and reinforce our commitment to sustainable\ndevelopment. Greece, with one third of the coastline of the\nentire Mediterranean basin and almost 3,000 islands, has a\nspecific interest in promoting the management of coastal\nzones, sustainable tourism, sustainable water management\nand policies to combat desertification and deforestation.\nWe have been uninterruptedly implementing a long-\nterm strategy for the protection of the environment while\nsharing with the international community the belief that\nAgenda 21 can be implemented only through a sense of\ncommon responsibility. However, the major\nenvironmental problems of our planet cannot be\nsuccessfully tackled if socio-economic ills such as poverty\nare not combatted and eradicated.\nSince the last session of the General Assembly, the\nprospect of a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus\nproblem has, regrettably, remained elusive. For 23 years\nnow Turkey has maintained more than 35,000 occupation\ntroops on the island, blatantly defying international law.\nAt the same time, the Turkish Cypriot population, for the\nprotection of which the invasion was allegedly\nundertaken, has dwindled dramatically since 1974, due to\npolitical oppression coupled with the massive influx of\nsettlers from mainland Turkey.\nThe Government of Greece aims at a reunited\nCyprus, a common home to all of its inhabitants. We\nmaintain that a settlement on the basis of the resolutions\nof the United Nations and the high- level agreements of\n1977 and 1979 can bring peace and reconciliation to the\nisland. Such a settlement should provide for a bizonal and\nbicommunal federation with a single sovereignty and\ninternational personality and with its independence and\nterritorial integrity safeguarded through effective\ninternational guarantees. There is no doubt that a\nfunctional solution of the Cyprus problem would\neliminate a source of instability in the region and\ncontribute to the improvement of Turkish-Greek relations.\nThe main obstacle, however, remains Turkey\u2019s aim\nof legitimizing the status quo. Ankara\u2019s negative stance\nand lack of political will were once again displayed\nduring the direct talks recently held under the auspices of\nthe Secretary-General at Glion-sur-Montreux. As the\nPresident of the Security Council pointed out in an\ninformed briefing to the press,\n\u201csubstantive progress at this time was impeded by\nthe attempt to bring preconditions to the table by the\nother party, and here of course I mean the Turkish\nCypriots.\u201d\nOn the other hand, the constructive stance of the Cypriot\nPresident, Mr. Clerides, at the talks was praised by the\nPresident of the Council in the same statement. His\nproposal for the demilitarization of Cyprus must retain\nour thorough attention.\n5\n\n\nGreece unwaveringly supports the process of Cyprus\u2019s\naccession to the European Union, which will commence at\nthe near future. We believe that its accession will benefit all\nthe island\u2019s inhabitants. It could also act as a catalyst for\nthe solution of the political problem. We sincerely hope that\nTurkey will eventually realize the benefits of the accession\nof Cyprus to the European Union, especially for the Turkish\nCypriot population, and will change its present stance.\nOur relations with Turkey have taken an additional\ndownturn since 1996, when our neighbour added direct\nterritorial claims to the existing policy of demands, threats\nof war and constant pressure, in an attempt to subvert the\nterritorial status quo established more than 70 years ago by\ninternational law and treaties. Its attempt to back these\nclaims by military means in January 1996 resulted in a\ncrisis that just fell short of war.\nGreece, while determined to protect, by all legitimate\nmeans, its sovereign rights stemming from international\nlaw, sincerely agrees that there is a need to establish normal\ngood neighbourly relations, based on the principles of\ninternational law and respect for international treaties \u2014\nsomething which Turkey seems determined to ignore.\nIt has been a consistent policy of our Government that\nGreek-Turkish relations should be addressed in a context of\nrespect for international law and treaties. Greece has made\nit its policy to channel such relations through accepted rules\nof behaviour and the principles recognized in international\nlife. The Madrid Joint Statement, signed by Turkey's\nPresident, Mr. Demirel, and the Greek Prime Minister,\nMr. Simitis, provides a welcome initiative which might\ncontribute to a gradual improvement.\nThe problems that really exist must be dealt with by\nlegal means provided for by international law, and\nspecifically through the International Court of Justice. Such\na step would open possibilities for a gradual build-up of\ngood-neighbourly relations and the establishment of\nconfidence and cooperation in every field. In this sense, we\nare waiting for a move by the new Turkish Government to\nwork in this direction \u2014 away from statements and acts\nwhich confuse the issue and relate to a past that we must\ntranscend by means of those principles of international law\nthat are enshrined in the United Nations Charter, and that\nour gathering here pledges to serve.\nIn the Balkan Peninsula, the area where Greece itself\nis located, the situation is gradually improving. My county\nhas played an active role within the framework of various\ninternational activities designed to promote peace,\nstability, good neighbourliness and development in the area.\nGreece values its historical relations with Albania. It\nis committed to continuing to work for the strengthening\nof cooperation between the two countries in all fields and\nto extending assistance for the rehabilitation of the\ncountry, in particular after the recent crisis. Our\ncontribution to Operation Alba and the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) presence has\nbeen essential and prompt.\nThe Greek minority in Albania will remain an\nimportant factor of friendship between the two peoples,\nactively contributing to the progress of their country.\nGreece fully supports the process initiated with the\nDayton Agreement. Maintaining excellent relations with\nall actors in the Yugoslav drama, we contribute\nsubstantially in keeping the peace. We have sent out\nmassive humanitarian aid from governmental and non-\ngovernmental sources alike; we have deployed our\nsoldiers with the Stabilization Force (SFOR); we have\nsent observers both on the European Community Monitor\nMission and OSCE teams; and we are actively engaged in\nreconstruction work in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I am\nproud to report that we are among the few not only to put\nforward the money pledged at the 1996 Donors'\nConference, but actually to have brought to completion\nthe programmes we undertook to fulfil. Furthermore, we\nare increasing our contribution for 1997, by 35 per cent.\nAll this, I must note, took place while we were massively\nengaged in stemming both the Albanian crisis and the\ndeterioration of the financial situation in Bulgaria.\nPersistence in implementing the Dayton Agreement,\nencouraging democratization and opening up to the\nmarket economy and to the international community will\nprovide guidance for all on ways to overcome present\ndifficulties and will enable all actors to normalize their\nrelations with each other, the United Nations and the\ninternational community in general.\nHonouring the Interim Accord with the former\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), we continue\ntalks under the auspices of the Special Envoy of the\nUnited Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Vance, about the\nfinal name of that country. We hope that the Skopje\nGovernment will realize the need for an early solution to\nthis issue.\nIn the multilateral field, we have persistently\npromoted the process of cooperation and good\n6\n\n\nneighbourliness in southeastern Europe, actively\nparticipating in such regional schemes as Royaumont, the\nSoutheast European Cooperative Initiative (SECI), Balkan\nCooperation, and Black Sea Economic Cooperation. The\nDeclaration adopted in Thessaloniki on 10 June 1997 by the\nMinisters of Foreign Affairs of countries of southeastern\nEurope has given a substantial impetus to this process.\nIn the same spirit, in early November Greece will host\nin Crete a summit of countries of southeastern Europe.\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to concern\nus. In fact, recent terrorist actions like those in Jerusalem,\nas well as the tragic situation in the West Bank and Gaza,\nconstitute the tangible consequences of the stagnation of the\npeace process. Revival of both the peace process and the\npeace hope requires adherence to and full implementation\nof the relevant United Nations resolutions and international\nagreements. The parties have to live up to their\ncommitments. Real peace is a just and global one \u2014 in\nIsrael as well as in Lebanon, where the need to implement\nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978) continues to be\npainfully felt. Greece supports any efforts which could have\npositive results, and hence we encourage those undertaken\nby the European Union's Special Envoy in the Middle East.\nMoreover, our country is willing to offer any assistance\naimed at the strengthening of peace and stability, security,\nand economic and social progress, as well as the\nestablishment of confidence among all parties to the Middle\nEast problem, in favour of the peoples of the area.\nGreece is following with particular interest the recent\ndevelopments in Africa, auspicious or ominous as they\nappear. Indeed, an increasing number of African countries\nare adopting pluralism as a form of Government and open-\nmarket principles for their economy. It is Greece's belief\nthat on the eve of the twenty-first century the international\ncommunity must encourage and assist African countries to\npromote pluralism, respect for human rights and a free-\nmarket economy. Important developments will take place\nduring this century in Africa.\nLatin America, with which Greece has traditional ties\nof friendship, is consolidating the pace of development of\nrecent years. Also, through successful regional integration,\nthe countries of the region are assuming a stature on a\nworldwide scale that truly reflects the importance of the\nprogress the region has achieved.\nLast June's Bucharest Meeting between the Black Sea\nEconomic Cooperation Council and the Southern Cone\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR) is a telling example.\nGreece, both bilaterally and as a member of the European\nUnion, is looking forward to an increasing,\ncomprehensive and substantial dialogue with the Latin\nAmerican countries, to the benefit of international\ncooperation, trade liberalization, and stability.\nThe United Nations remains mankind's best hope for\njointly solving the problems that collectively beset the\nworld community. We therefore fully support the call for\nthe reform of the United Nations. However, we strongly\nbelieve that any decision regarding the future form and\nfunction of our Organization should be taken by\nconsensus and should reflect the needs and aspirations of\nall Member States \u2014 big and small, rich and poor\nalike \u2014 in whose hands and political will the destiny of\nthe United Nations lies. Greece is prepared to shoulder its\nshare of responsibility in this ongoing reform process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I begin by\ncongratulating the President on his election to preside\nover the fifty-second session of General Assembly and\npledging to him the full support of my delegation.\nThe new Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has\nalready put his mark on the United Nations, after less\nthan nine months in office. He has led efforts to reform\nour Organization in an effective, fair and balanced\nmanner. I congratulate him and pledge the unwavering\nsupport of my Government for his important mission.\nIncreasingly, as we approach the new millennium,\nwe have come to appreciate the value of international\ncooperation, as most clearly demonstrated by the historic\nfirst meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO)/Russia Permanent Joint Council in a ministerial\nsession that took place here in this building today.\nThe information revolution is advancing, and a new\nsense of global neighbourhood and the gradual abolition\nof trade barriers are raising the level of economic well-\nbeing in different parts of the world. At the same time,\n25\n\n\nthe world community is faced with challenges of a new\norder of magnitude, making it necessary for Governments\nto pool their resources and work together.\nGlobal forces are in many ways eroding the traditional\nboundaries between nation States. The trend calls for the\nstrengthening of international organizations competent to\ntackle issues that no single State or groups of States can\ndeal with in isolation. Consequently, it is crucial that we\nstrengthen the United Nations. Without a reinvigorated\nUnited Nations, the international community will not be in\na position to address the foremost challenges confronting\nthe twenty-first century.\nSadly, our Organization has not been endowed to meet\nthose challenges. Demands on the United Nations are\ngreater than ever, and the limited resources at the\nOrganization\u2019s disposal are grossly disproportionate to the\ntasks in hand. The question inevitably arises: Do we wish\nto give the United Nations a clear and focused mandate and\nempower it to carry that mandate out? In my opinion our\nanswer should be the same as the one Winston Churchill\nonce gave:\n\u201cGive us the tools and we will finish the job\u201d.\nOnce more we must urge all Member States to pay\ntheir contributions to the Organization fully and on time.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s reform initiative is the most\ncomprehensive attempt to date at fashioning the United\nNations of tomorrow into an instrument capable of serving\nthe common interests of all peoples, guided by the enduring\ntenets of peace, human rights, the rule of law and social\nprogress, enshrined in the Charter more than half a century\nago. Coming at the end of a thorough and useful debate,\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s report is in large part a distillation\nof views expressed by individual Governments.\nInevitably, the report represents a compromise,\nunlikely to accommodate all the wishes of a single State or\ngroup of States. But, taken as a whole, it represents the best\neffort to obtain what is realistically feasible under the\ncircumstances. The reform package should, in our opinion,\nbe accepted as an integral whole.\nA focused discussion on the Secretary-General\u2019s report\nshould give a boost to the ongoing debate among Member\nStates on an increase in the membership of the Security\nCouncil, as well as a more equitable representation on the\nCouncil. The Nordic countries have jointly presented their\nideas on this issue. Iceland welcomes the paper submitted\nby the Chairman of the Security Council Working Group,\nwhich is largely in line with the suggestions of the Nordic\ncountries, and hopes that efforts to resolve this\nfundamental aspect of the entire reform process may be\nbrought to a successful conclusion during the current\nsession.\nAlthough the reform of our Organization and its\nlong-term credibility must have a high priority, regional\nconflicts continually demand our attention.\nIn the Middle East, the situation has rarely been\nmore uncertain since the signing of the Oslo accords. The\nparties to the accords must not be distracted from\npursuing the path of peace. They should refrain from\ncreating unnecessary hurdles in the path of peace by\nprovocative undertakings likely to cause hostility,\nsuspicion and fear. There should be a clear and\nunambiguous recognition that terrorism against innocent\ncivilians is wholly incompatible with the pursuit of peace.\nBoth parties have to ensure that international norms in the\nfield of human rights and humanitarian law are respected.\nA troubled African continent remains at the top of\nthe United Nations agenda. In sub-Saharan Africa,\nparticularly the Great Lakes region, the situation is\nworrying. The United Nations, in cooperation with\nregional leaders and organizations, must spare no effort to\nprevent the peoples of this region from further suffering.\nBy contrast, encouraging developments have taken\nplace in Western Sahara, where direct talks, held under\nthe auspices of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-\nGeneral, have greatly improved prospects for a\nreferendum on the future of the region.\nArms control and disarmament will continue to\noccupy an important place in the activities of our\nOrganization. Our most immediate goal should be in the\narea of conventional arms: to work for a comprehensive\nban on that most terrible destroyer of the lives and limbs\nof innocent people, the anti-personnel landmine. The\nrecently concluded Oslo conference on this menace has\nprovided a welcome impetus to work towards a binding\ntreaty. Iceland strongly urges all States to banish this\ninhumane weapon from their arsenals.\nHuman rights, which are of intrinsic value in\nthemselves, are also a vital part of efforts to secure peace\nand stability in areas torn by wars and internal conflict.\nNext year marks the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. My\nGovernment applauds the Secretary-General\u2019s proposed\n26\n\n\nstreamlining of the work of the United Nations in the field\nof human rights, bearing witness to a strong emphasis on\nthis crucially important aspect of our work.\nUnfortunately, the human rights of women continue to\nbe disregarded. As the Secretary-General observed in this\nforum earlier this week, violence against women has\nbecome the most pervasive human rights violation. The\ninternational community must work harder to correct this\nsituation and to improve the lot of women everywhere, not\nleast through the creation of better education and\nemployment opportunities.\nTrafficking in drugs is a peril that recognizes no\nnational boundaries. To a greater or lesser degree, we are\nall affected by it. In addition to the cost in human lives and\nsuffering, we are witness to calamities that follow in the\nwake of drug abuse, the spread of AIDS, prostitution and\ncrime. Iceland welcomes United Nations efforts in the area\nof drug prevention and looks forward to the special session\nof the General Assembly on the problem of drugs next\nJune.\nNext year has been declared the International Year of\nthe Ocean by the United Nations. The world\u2019s oceans are\na crucial part of the earth\u2019s biosphere, in addition to being\nthe single largest source of protein for mankind. This vital\nresource is now threatened in some regions of the world.\nTherefore, it is important that the Year of the Ocean be\nused to raise public awareness and to reinforce efforts to\nprotect the marine ecosystem. A global, legally binding\nagreement should be concluded to limit the emission of\npersistent organic pollutants.\nProblems afflicting the marine ecosystem call for\ngreater coordination at the global level, and also in the\nsustainable use, conservation and management of living\nmarine resources. At the same time, we must recognize that\nthe primary responsibility for harvesting marine resources\nin a sustainable manner rests with the States that depend on\nsuch resources for survival. Also, while Governments must\nwork with non-governmental organizations, there is a need\nto resist the indiscriminate pressure of unaccountable\nprotectionist groups that wish to sever the vital link\nbetween environmental protection and economic self-\ninterest.\nAlthough not yet in force, the Agreement for the\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982\nrelating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling\nFish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, which\nprovides a framework for regional cooperation in the\nconservation and management of these stocks, has already\nhad a positive impact. In the North Atlantic, for instance,\nfisheries-management conventions are under review in\norder, inter alia, to adjust them to the provisions of this\nAgreement. Iceland urges Member States to ratify the\nAgreement.\nAs a new member of the Economic and Social\nCouncil, Iceland welcomed the thorough discussion on\nfostering an enabling environment for development during\nthis year\u2019s substantive session. It is of grave concern that\nthe gap between the rich and the poor has continued to\nwiden. At a time of vastly expanded trade and investment\nin the world, the least developed countries have seen their\nshare of world trade drop by half in two decades. Many\nof them are threatened with exclusion from world markets\nand economic marginalization.\nThe key elements for attaining sustainable economic\ndevelopment are a sound policy framework that\nencourages stable growth, a vigorous private sector, the\nstrengthening of institutional and legal foundations and,\nlast but not least, good-governance and anti-corruption\nmeasures. At the same time, we need to focus on human-\ndevelopment strategies. The strengthening of education\nand school systems and health and social services must be\nan integral part of any sound strategy for development.\nWe must mobilize the dynamic private sector,\ntogether with bilateral and multilateral official\ndevelopment assistance to secure sustainable growth and\npoverty reduction in developing countries.\nAs the chairman of the Nordic and the Baltic\nconstituency of the World Bank\u2019s Development\nCommittee, I emphasize the important role of the World\nBank Group in development cooperation. I would like to\nreiterate what I stated in Hong Kong earlier this week:\nthat the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative\nmust result in a permanent solution to the unsustainable\ndebt burden of the countries in question.\n27\n\n\nFinally, this is a time of extraordinary challenges for\nthe United Nations and its Member States. This is why we\nneed a vigorous, strong and confident Organization, capable\nof leading the way into the next century. For such an\nOrganization to become a reality we must now focus on\neffective and meaningful reform. We should use the\nmomentum and not fritter away our time in long-winded\nand familiar debates. Now we have an opportunity we may\nnot have again any time soon."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am very pleased to see the\nForeign Minister of neighbouring Ukraine assume the\n12\n\n\nprestigious post of President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-second session. In fulfilling your challenging tasks you\nmay rest assured of the support and cooperation of the\ndelegation of Hungary.\nOur tribute and thanks are also due to your\npredecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, who\nserved us with distinction and innovative spirit.\nIn the post-cold-war era, international organizations\nare undergoing a profound adaptation process. Here, in the\nUnited Nations, we are only at the beginning of a bumpy\nroad. Whether the United Nations can find its place in the\nnew international political environment of the twenty-first\ncentury depends on our foresight, realism and\ndetermination. If our decisions are underpinned by a\nstrongly shared joint commitment to tackle the global\nagenda, we can make the United Nations relevant for the\nnext millennium.\nThe reform proposals presented by Secretary-General\nKofi Annan are guided by the urgency of the task, sober\nrealism and healthy idealism as well as personal\ncommitment to change. We welcome the intention of the\nSecretary-General to proceed to the early implementation of\nconcrete organizational measures within his own areas of\ncompetence.\nThe package of proposals which require action by the\nMember States themselves truly captures those areas of\nUnited Nations activities where agreements are necessary at\nthis stage. The suggestions to ensure the desired coherence\nof United Nations efforts in development cooperation, to\nbolster its institutional capacity to combat international\ncrime, drug-trafficking and terrorism, or to integrate human\nrights concerns into all principal United Nations activities\nand programmes deserve our full support and need swift\nand concrete action. Let me add the voice of my delegation\nto all those who have called for approval at this session of\nthe package as a whole, which will have to be followed by\npractical steps in order to translate it into meaningful\naction.\nIn its foreign policy Hungary continues to serve\ninternational peace and stability, with special regard to its\nown region. The tragic events in former Yugoslavia, the\ncrises and convulsions on the territory of the former Soviet\nUnion and elsewhere, the emergence of aggressive\nnationalism as well as populism in Central and Eastern\nEurope, as an appealing \u201cremedy\u201d for political problems,\neconomic difficulties and social tensions, are vivid\nreminders of the critical, sometimes lethal, nature of these\nchallenges. They underscore how important it is that the\ninternational community act with appropriate means and\nin a timely manner.\nHungary supports the efforts of the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and of other\nmultilateral regional organizations to help prevent new\nconflicts, to initiate, where needed, peacekeeping and\npeace-building activities, to solidify the rule of law and to\npromote cooperation in the OSCE area. My country is\nseeking to consolidate genuine good-neighbourly relations\nwith all the countries of its region, especially with\ncountries bordering it, and to launch regional initiatives\nand enhance regional cooperation to better respond to the\nnew challenges threatening regional stability. It is in this\nspirit that we have been active in the creation of, and\nhave sought to expand, various forms of regional\ncooperation, such as the Central European Initiative, the\nCentral European Free Trade Agreement and the South-\nEast European Cooperative Initiative, involving a large\nnumber of countries in the region, or have moved ahead\nwith trilateral, more tailor-made, cooperative schemes\nwith a number of our immediate neighbours. Regional\nand cross-border cooperation is a valuable asset for\nregional stability and security, and has to be utilized to its\nfull potential.\nAs we look forward, from the invitation we received\nfrom the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit in\nMadrid to the winding up of the accession talks with the\nAlliance, and in the expectation of the commencement of\nnegotiations on our entry into the European Union next\nJanuary, we wish to develop further such regional\nactivities of dialogue and wide-ranging cooperation in\norder to prevent the emergence of new dividing lines and\nto assist all the countries of the region in their drive to\njoin the mainstream European developments. We are also\nconfident that Hungary, through the structures of Euro-\nAtlantic integration, will become an even more active\npartner and supporter of the United Nations.\nThe post-cold-war era has brought to the forefront\nurgent questions. These include issues related to the\nfuture operation of the United Nations conflict-\nmanagement capacity. The debate unfolding on these\nproblems has political, legal and, quite often, emotional\ndimensions as well. We welcome the proposals of the\nSecretary-General geared towards enhancing the rapid\nreaction capabilities of the United Nations.\n13\n\n\nIt is in this context that in recent years Hungary has\nincreased its participation in United Nations mandated\npeacekeeping operations in a variety of ways, including\nboth infrastructural and logistical support and the\ndeployment of military and police personnel, an example of\nwhich is the Hungarian contribution to the Implementation\nForce and the Stabilization Force and the considerable\nincrease in the number of Hungarian peacekeepers serving\nin the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus. We\nare pleased that the performance and professional skill of\nmy compatriots engaged in various such operations all\nacross the globe are considered positively.\nThe issue of the functioning and the size of the\nSecurity Council has been extensively dealt with at several\nUnited Nations forums. Legitimacy and efficiency are both\nimportant premises for any pattern of Security Council\nreform. The general view is that, once the Security Council\nis enlarged, its size and composition should be not an\nimpediment, but, rather, an asset for effective decision-\nmaking and action, enjoying the widest possible support\nand cooperation of the membership at large. Agreement on\nSecurity Council enlargement is a fundamental pillar of the\nUnited Nations reform process. We have to make sure that\nwith a future Security Council comprising Germany, Japan\nand countries each from Africa, Asia and Latin America\nand the Caribbean as permanent members, and also\nadditional non-permanent members, we preserve and\nenhance the purpose-oriented character of this important\nbody.\nThe financial reform of our Organization is an\nindispensable prerequisite to ensure its viability and\nrelevance. Payment of assessed contributions is an\nobligation under the United Nations Charter. Hungary has\nmade serious efforts to meet all its outstanding financial\nassessments, and now we belong to the yet small, but,\nhopefully, growing group of Member States which pay all\ntheir contributions to the regular as well as peacekeeping\nbudgets in full and without conditions.\nTo solve the financial crisis, we must find a way that\nis acceptable to Member States and is good for the\nOrganization. The delegation of Hungary stands ready to\njoin in further constructive efforts along the lines of the\nproposal presented by the European Union with a view to\narriving at a comprehensive compromise solution.\nAfter the demise of the political structures of the cold\nwar, international protection of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms can no longer be relegated to some\ndistant corner of United Nations activities. As a legitimate\nconcern of the international community, human rights\nissues should be given their due weight in all United\nNations activities, in a well coordinated manner. This\nmust be reflected in the provision of adequate funding.\nToday, human rights are violated on a massive scale\nworldwide, and we all must stand up in their defence and\nhold violators accountable wherever abuses occur. We are\naware that there exist regional, cultural and other\nspecificities in the field of human rights. We believe,\nhowever, that these should not stand in the way of\nconsistency in promoting universal respect for human\nrights and should not allow complacency to surface in\nattitudes towards human rights violations.\nWe are pleased with the Secretary-General\u2019s\nexcellent choice of Mrs. Mary Robinson to serve as the\nnext High Commissioner for Human Rights. We will lend\nher assistance to make the United Nations more effective\nin responding to human rights challenges, including those\nstemming from ethnic discrimination. As recent\ndevelopments have shown, these represent a threat to\nregional and international stability and security.\nDevelopment and environment are questions of the\nutmost importance for the future, and even the survival,\nof humankind. United Nations activities in this sphere\nshould lead to the elaboration of a comprehensive\nprogramme for sustainable development acceptable to all\nnations. We wish to voice our concern about the\ninsufficient progress achieved in this domain. We lend\nour full support to efforts aimed at seeking solutions to\nthe burning questions of underdevelopment and at\nstopping the processes of degradation of the ecological\nhabitat of our planet.\nArmed conflicts continue to take their toll,\nsometimes decades after the cessation of hostilities, due\nto the presence of anti-personnel landmines. The plight of\ntens of thousands of innocent victims has been a growing\nsource of international concern in no small part as a result\nof effective advocacy by human rights groups and\nhumanitarian organizations. Hungary stands for the total\nban of these devices. My Government has supported the\nOttawa process from its very inception; it welcomes the\nsuccess of the Diplomatic Conference held on this issue\nat Oslo and intends to become one of the first signatories\nof the new Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel\nMines and on Their Destruction. This is an important\nmilestone in the development of international\nhumanitarian law and in the endeavour to put an end to\n14\n\n\nthe immense human suffering caused by the proliferation\nand indiscriminate use of these weapons. At the same time,\nin our view, the remarkable achievements of the Oslo\nConference do not diminish the role that other forums,\nincluding the Conference on Disarmament, can play in\npromoting the objectives of the new Convention.\nThe horrible atrocities and genocidal acts committed\nduring recent conflicts have speeded up negotiations on\nestablishing international criminal jurisdiction on war\ncrimes and crimes against humanity. By establishing the ad\nhoc tribunals on former Yugoslavia and on Rwanda, the\ninternational community reaffirmed an important principle:\nall those having committed war crimes or crimes against\nhumanity are to be held personally responsible and\naccountable. It is our legitimate expectation that all persons\nindicted by the tribunals will be brought to justice and\nmoreover that failing to cooperate fully with the tribunals\nwill not remain without consequences.\nThe experience gained from the functioning of these\ntwo ad hoc tribunals has paved the way for the wider\nacceptance of the idea of an international criminal court,\nthus creating a firm legal basis at the universal level for the\nestablishment of individual criminal responsibility with\nregard to war crimes and crimes against humanity. We are\ncommitted to pursuing vigorously the negotiations at this\nsession to enable the finalization of the statute of the court\nat the diplomatic conference to be held next year.\nAt this session, we have to focus our efforts on\npreparing the ground for practical steps to make the United\nNations a viable and dynamic body. We must maintain the\nmomentum for change if we want to ensure a decent future\nfor the human experiment.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is my honour to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election and to assure you\nof the fullest cooperation of the delegation of San Marino.\nMay I thank the outgoing President, His Excellency\nMr. Razali Ismail, for his excellent work, and reiterate to\nthe Secretary-General the best wishes of the Government\nand the people of San Marino for a successful fulfilment\nof his mandate. The goals that the United Nations is\ncalled upon to achieve are important and demanding, but\nalso stimulating.\nThese are times of great expectations for the United\nNations, and the Republic of San Marino is determined to\ndo everything within its power to help translate these\nexpectations into concrete and effective actions. We must\nrecognize that the United Nations has constantly inspired,\npromoted and instilled a greater respect for human rights.\nIt has been building a new law of nations.\nThe United Nations has made it clear that peace\ncannot be achieved and maintained unless serious\nimbalances are redressed and all human beings, by virtue\nof their fundamental right to dignity, are respected and\nnot discriminated against because of their diversity.\nEqually essential are access to progress and development\nfor all; the equitable utilization of our planet\u2019s resources;\nand the avoidance of mere exploitation and abuse, which\nwould jeopardize our future beyond repair.\nAlthough in recent decades conflicts no longer break\nout on a worldwide scale and in some cases take place\nwithin national boundaries, they nonetheless continue to\n5\n\n\nclaim innocent victims, cause incalculable damage and\nundermine economies, especially those of the less\ndeveloped countries. Indeed, the instruments of war have\nchanged. They have become increasingly sophisticated and\ndestructive and more easily produced and spread. Just think\nof anti-personnel landmines; it has been estimated that\nmillions of them have been placed throughout the world\nand that for each cleared mine, 50 new ones are laid.\nIn this connection, I stress the urgent need for all\nStates to accede to the recently drafted Convention on the\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer\nof Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction.\nAs regards the fight against terrorism, San Marino is\nfollowing with great attention the work of the Ad Hoc\nCommittee charged with drafting an International\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. The\nproliferation of violence and crime, which have become\ntransnational, demands an adequate response by the\ninternational community.\nWith reference to drug trafficking, San Marino is\nparticularly active in the field of prevention. This year, our\nGovernment launched the \u201cYouth Project\u201d, which consists\nof a series of initiatives organized by, and dedicated to,\nyoung people, with the purpose of stimulating them to\nexploit their creativity and potential in a constructive way.\nIn this regard, San Marino supports the Secretary-General\u2019s\nproposal to convene a special session of the General\nAssembly in June 1998 on the traffic in illicit narcotic\ndrugs.\nSan Marino acknowledges that the Rio Conference\nindeed constituted a milestone in the history of our planet\nand revealed the magnitude of environmental degradation\non Earth. Yet San Marino has observed with bitterness that\nconcrete initiatives have fallen short of expectations. This\nwas confirmed by the recent special session of the General\nAssembly on the review of Agenda 21.\nWorthy of praise is the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal\nto revitalize the Trusteeship Council by entrusting it with a\nmandate of collective environmental safeguard. The\nenvironment is a priority concern for the Republic of San\nMarino. At the local level, a project is being undertaken for\nthe monitoring of the territory which involves students of\nvarious school grades under the coordination and\nsupervision of teachers. This project aims to enhance our\ncitizens\u2019 awareness of the fact that environmental protection\nis the responsibility of each and every individual.\nIn the field of the prevention and suppression of\nchild abuse, San Marino signed the Convention on the\nRights of the Child and believes that the adoption of\ndecisions aimed at defending children against any form of\naggression, including sexual abuse, is of paramount\nimportance.\nSan Marino continues to support the fight against\ncapital punishment, in keeping with the fact that it was\nthe first European country to abolish it in the mid-\nnineteenth century, and it urges other Member States to\nadopt concrete measures to eliminate the use of the death\npenalty.\nAnd we must not forget the exodus of the many\nrefugees who are fleeing their countries because of war,\nhunger or in the pursuit of the better future to which they\nare entitled.\nSan Marino, which boasts a tradition of great\nhospitality towards refuge-seekers, is deeply concerned\nabout the situation observed in refugee camps and their\nimpact on local populations. We are grateful to the High\nCommissioner for Refugees, who daily fulfils this\ndemanding task with efficiency.\nThe United Nations is adjusting to the process of\nchange by establishing the conditions for a concrete\nresponse. Its structure, organization and functioning must\nbe on exactly the same wavelength as the new reality, and\nmust be strong enough to face the challenges of the\npresent \u2014 and those, even more demanding, of the\ncoming third millennium. For this reason we appreciate\nthe work already done by the Secretary-General and urge\nhim to continue this essential process of renewal of the\nOrganization.\nThe United Nations reform package proposed by the\nSecretary-General is a good basis for a realistic and\neffective response with a view to reaching the lofty goals\nof the Organization: peace, social and economic progress,\nand safeguard of the rights of both individuals and\npeoples. Member States will be able to focus better on\nthese goals by solving, first of all, the United Nations\nfinancial crisis. To do this, a new and more equitable\nscale of assessments is necessary, along with cost-cutting,\nthe elimination or reduction of bodies and services where\nappropriate, and, most important, the avoidance of overlap\nwith other organizations, including at the regional level.\nSmall countries are particularly aware of this issue, since\nit is increasingly difficult for them to guarantee their\n6\n\n\nparticipation and contribution \u2014 and not only in financial\nterms.\nSan Marino has given great attention to all proposals\nfor the reform of the Security Council put forward by\nnumerous countries during the debate. All of them are\nequally important and constitute an essential basis for the\nformulation of well-considered, comprehensive solutions.\nHowever, it is essential that participation in the conception\nand implementation of this restructuring not be confined to\nlarger States. The future configuration of the United\nNations should reflect a community of 185 countries, each\nand every one of them independent and sovereign according\nto the principles of universality and equality. Those are\namong the reasons that have led San Marino to support an\nincrease in the number of non-permanent seats on the\nSecurity Council \u2014 though, and I stress this point once\nmore, this is not the only issue.\nThe reform of the United Nations does not consist of\nbeing present in major or minor bodies, but rather of\nshaping the future together through the understanding,\nparticipation, awareness, involvement and support of all.\nWe shall shape a future where universal peace is\nguaranteed and safeguarded by the United Nations.\nSan Marino is convinced that the United Nations must\nfulfil both a monitoring and a protecting mandate, on the\none hand in favour of individuals whose rights and\nfreedoms are limited or denied by their own States, and on\nthe other in favour of those countries, especially smaller\nones, whose development could be hampered or influenced.\nIn this regard I wish to underline how all countries\nand the United Nations itself could benefit from the role\nplayed by small States, which can make a significant\ncontribution to major issues as well, since they have no\nmilitary, political or economic interests but rather a heritage\nof ideals, culture and traditions to safeguard.\nMay these objectives be fully attained as the United\nNations approaches the third millennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I am certain that the\nsuccessful conduct of the work of this session will justify\nthe confidence we all have in his outstanding qualities as a\nstatesman.\nI wish also to pay tribute to his predecessor,\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, whose ability and intelligence\nwon the high regard of us all.\nLet me pay tribute also to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his dedication to the cause of\ninternational peace and security and for his in-depth\nknowledge of the issues on which the future of world\npeace depends.\nI want to emphasize my country\u2019s commitment to\nthe Charter ideals of peace, security, democracy, human\nrights and development. It is for the triumph of those\nideals that we have struggled. The Democratic Republic\nof the Congo is among the few countries that from time\nimmemorial, owing to its geostrategic placement and its\nvast human and natural resources, has borne the burden\nof a sombre history of suffering and outrageous violations\nof human rights and the rights of peoples.\nIn 1885, when Africa was being colonized, my\ncountry was set up as a State that was the personal\nproperty of the King of the Belgians; it endured violence\nand blatant violations of human rights connected inter\nalia with the exploitation of red rubber and other kinds of\nforced labour. It became a Belgian colony in 1908, and\nwas later to experience a decolonization process that was\nnot merely botched, but was disastrous because my\ncountry became part of the global stakes in the East-West\nstrategic rivalry.\nAfter my country acceded to independence in June\n1960, at the height of the cold war, the symbol of our\nsovereignty, Prime Minister Patrice Emergy Lumumba,\nwas martyred to that sovereignty.\nUnder the complaisant eyes of the international\ncommunity, a bloody and reactionary dictatorship was\nformed in the very heart of Africa, in the strategic\ninterests of the dominating West, with the mission of\ndestabilizing neighbouring countries. Thirty years later,\nthanks to the political changes that took place in the\nworld in 1989, the international community saw\nregretfully the disastrous results of the support it had\ngiven to a regime that was a State in name only.\nThe disasters caused by these years of bloody and\nignoble dictatorship are so well known that there is no\nneed to recount them. The World Bank, the International\nMonetary Fund and all the bodies of the United Nations\nsystem have studies, evaluations and gripping and moving\n15\n\n\ntestimony of what the Mobutu regime represented at the\nend of the twentieth century.\nThe opening of this fifty-second session of the General\nAssembly coincides happily with the emergence in Africa\nof a new generation of leaders who are totally dedicated to\nthe cause of African renaissance and who are inspired by\nthe decisive will to take in hand the destiny of the continent\nand to play their role in the community of nations.\nAmong these individuals is Mr. Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila,\nwhose struggle for the restoration of the Republic dates\nback to 14 September 1960, the day when the first\nCongolese democratic experience was interrupted.\nThe triumph of the Congolese revolution on 17 May\n1997 is, after the defeat of apartheid in South Africa, the\nhistoric event of greatest political importance in modern\nAfrica. It represents the triumph of the return to pan-\nAfricanism, the only road to salvation for Africa in the\ncircumstances of today\u2019s world.\nThe massive and spontaneous adherence of the\nCongolese to this armed struggle and the support received\nfrom friendly countries and from the entire world is enough\nto underline the positive nature of this liberation struggle.\nThe Congolese people are grateful to all for their\nsupport of the coming to Kinshasa of a progressive new\npower concerned with a state of law and improving of the\nwell-being of the people. The victory of the Alliance of\nDemocratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo over the\nMobutu dictatorship is indeed a victory of progressive and\npan-African Africa over obscurantism, pessimism,\nmorbidness and defeatism, which for such a long time were\npretexts for certain Powers to keep political and strategic\ncontrol of the continent. In that country in which the State\nand the Republic were moribund, the Government of public\nsecurity, led by President Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila, is working\ntirelessly and incessantly to restore the State and to rebuild\nthe Republic.\nThe efforts at domestic stabilization through\nreorganization of the State and the reconciliation of\nopinions and the return to work of the civilian population\nare accompanied by other efforts aimed at achieving peace\nand regional stability in order to create economic and\npolitical conditions conducive to productive national and\nforeign investment.\nOur African policy is designed to improve bilateral\nrelations with all the States of the region, help them adapt\nbetter to the new geopolitical context and strengthen\ncooperation and regional integration. Along with the\nobjective of promoting economic development, we are\nalso working to achieve the prevention, management and\nresolution by Africa of the regional conflicts and crises\nthat are paralysing our continent.\nThis desire to change our foreign policy is based on\nour domestic policy, which is designed to rely primarily\non our own efforts and to give greater importance to\nregional and South-South cooperation in our trade\nactivities. Here, emphasis will be placed on trade\npromoting productive commerce and investments leading\nto the transfer of new and appropriate technology.\nWe intend, moreover, to pursue efforts designed to\nimprove our bilateral and multilateral relations with all\nour partners to ensure greater understanding for and\ncommitment to our programme of national reconstruction.\nThis programme essentially addresses urgent actions and\nsteps for rehabilitation, and their highly humanitarian\nnature deserves the unconditional support of the\ninternational community.\nThis Government programme comprises the\nfollowing priorities: infrastructure for transportation and\ncommunication, agriculture, health and social services,\nnational education, job creation and the elimination of\nunemployment, safety and protection of individuals and\nproperty and, in addition, peace and national and regional\nstability.\nIn the four months in which we have been leading\nthe State, we have been able to achieve encouraging\nresults, in particular at the political and diplomatic levels.\nThese include ensuring the safety of the population\nthrough the restoration of justice; guaranteeing the right\nof ownership; efforts to eradicate corruption, which had\nbecome institutionalized in our country; the reintegration\nof the military personnel of the former armed forces of\nZaire and the establishment of a national republican army;\nthe establishment of good regional relations, in particular\nthrough the holding in Kinshasa of a summit of Heads of\nState designed to work on strengthening regional\ncooperation; the working visits to Kinshasa by the\nPresidents of Uganda, Rwanda, Eritrea and Tanzania, as\nwell as the visits of the Congolese Head of State to\nAngola, South Africa, Rwanda, Namibia and Zambia.\nFurthermore, our Government has participated in meetings\nheld in the subregion on specific regional issues. We\nshould also note that President Kabila has been consulted\nby the actors in the current crisis in Brazzaville.\n16\n\n\nEconomic steps include overcoming inflation and the\nrevaluation of the local currency, the decline in food prices,\nthe provision of essentials to urban centres, a monetary\nreform project now under way and the restructuring of the\ncentral bank.\nSocial and cultural steps include a resumption of\ncultural and artistic life, a resumption of primary and\nsecondary education despite a difficult situation for parents\nwho work for the State, providing drinking water for the\ncapital and electrification and public road projects.\nIn the debate at this session on proposals for\nreforming the United Nations, I would like, at the outset, to\nstate that the strategic objective of all of the reforms\nenvisaged must be to provide better conditions for the\nproper functioning of the Organization so that it can fulfil\nits founders\u2019 dream of a lasting, democratic, responsible\nand credible Organization.\nThe first stage of the effort must be to assess the\nimpact of the cold war on the original system of collective\nsecurity. Since the cold war paralysed the system set out in\nthe Charter, the end of the cold war should create\nconditions favourable to the triumph of the collective\nsecurity regime provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter.\nThe second stage will be to analyse why the continual\nprogress of preventive diplomacy is accompanied by\ninefficiencies at the operational level in peacekeeping and\npeace-building. Furthermore, we must also consider the\npolitical powers of the main agent of preventive diplomacy\nto ensure that they conform to institutional limits.\nOur position with regard to the administrative reforms\nof the United Nations and the enlargement of the Security\nCouncil is that of Africa as a whole, as set out and\ndefended by the Secretary-General of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity. We are opposed to cosmetic reforms and to\nhaving members of the Security Council acting as mere\nfigureheads.\nOur interest in reform should not make us forget the\nnumerous conflict situations and threats to peace and\ninternational security throughout the world. Today Africa\ncontinues to occupy centre stage with regard to armed\nconflicts. Central Africa in particular has become a powder\nkeg as a result of uncontrolled armed bands crossing almost\nall our borders, bands who, in the guise of refugees, are\ndestabilizing the entire region.\nThat is why we urgently appeal to the United Nations\nto do everything it can to end its present policy of burying\nits head in the sand, which can only result in weakening\nand destabilizing those, such as the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo, that have a role to play in the subregion.\nIt is now clear that the crisis in Brazzaville, for\nexample, is increasingly escaping the control of the\nparties to the conflict, and requires an urgent Security\nCouncil meeting. This crisis is unacceptable to the\nCongolese in both Brazzaville and Kinshasa. The\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, which has been\nsubjected to deliberate shelling from neighbouring\nBrazzaville, which has been receiving refugees fleeing\nthat country and which, since 29 and 30 September 1997\nhas suffered loss of human life, without being a party to\nthe conflict, believes that the conflict has reached the\nlimit of what can be tolerated, given the damage to its\npeople and the threat it represents to regional and\ninternational peace and security. Just this morning we\nlearned that more shells had fallen on Kinshasa, and this\nis unacceptable to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nThe Central African Republic, which was badly\nbattered by the rebellions in the Kasayi camp, must\nbenefit from special cooperation from the United Nations\nto strengthen the Inter-African Mission to Monitor the\nImplementation of the Bangui Agreements, which is\nalready operational on the ground.\nWe firmly support the Lusaka Protocol, which is\ndesigned to re-establish peace and stability in Angola, a\ncountry with which we share a frontier of 2,600\nkilometres. We therefore demand that the Protocol be\nstrictly respected, and we condemn the repeated violations\nof its terms by UNITA.\nWith regard to Burundi, we support the Arusha\nprocess, and adhere to the principle of democracy and\nsecurity for all.\nIn Sierra Leone, we hope to see a return to legality\nand the democratic exercise of power.\nWe welcome the return of peace to Liberia, and the\nelectoral victory of President Charles Taylor, and we hope\nthat this experience will become a landmark and a point\nof reference for neighbouring States. The march towards\ndemocratization in Africa is inevitable and irreversible,\nbut the road is one which only the Africans can set out on\nand walk down.\nI should like to hail here the American initiative to\nhold a ministerial-level meeting of the Security Council\n17\n\n\nto strengthen the capacity of African States to build peace\nthrough conflict prevention and management and by the\nimprovement of good governance.\nThe situation in the Middle East remains worrying.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo urges all parties\nstrictly to respect the Madrid and Oslo agreements, and in\nall cases to give priority to genuine dialogue. The prize of\npeace is won through tolerance.\nIn the Far East, the reunification of Korea is a\npeaceful process that the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nfully supports. We hope for a positive outcome to the\nnegotiations under way.\nGlobal peace is also threatened by environmental\nproblems and by the continuation of the debt crisis of the\nleast developed countries. The Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, which has significant global forest reserves, appeals\nto the international community for assistance in preserving\nits forest heritage.\nMy country, whose foreign debt amounts to $14\nbillion, calls upon the major donors to demonstrate greater\nsolidarity and adopt a more responsible and consistent\napproach to possible solutions. In the specific case of the\nCongo, which has been devastated, we wonder what good\nthose billions of dollars did, as the country is in a state of\ntotal ruin \u2014 without roads, bridges, schools or hospitals. It\nis public knowledge that these funds never reached the\nCongo, and were for the most part deposited in American,\nEuropean and Asian banks. That is why we call for the\npure and simple cancellation of this debt; if necessary, we\nwill request the cooperation of the United Nations for the\nrestoration to the Congo of the $14 billion, now circulating\nin the world.\nWe should like here solemnly to express our gratitude\nto the Governments of the Republic of South Africa, the\nKingdom of Belgium, the Swiss Confederation and the\nUnited States for their cooperation in this matter, and hope\nthat everything possible will be done for a positive outcome\nto the processes under way.\nIn any case, the insolvency of my country and of other\nAfrican countries is a global problem that requires\nconsistent global treatment. It is therefore unfortunate that\ninternational cooperation in this area is only serving to\nintensify it and, furthermore, that any new contribution to\nnational reconstruction is conditional on the payment of\narrears.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo supports all\nthe initiatives and recommendations relating to the\nrestoration of cultural property confiscated in the past by\ncolonial Powers. In the same spirit, we support the\nestablishment of an international criminal court, which\nwould have competence over political economic, social,\ncultural and humanitarian crimes.\nDisarmament issues and their relationship with\ndevelopment are also on our foreign policy agenda. While\nwelcoming the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative to establish\na new department for disarmament, the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo would have liked to have been\napprised of how matters stood regarding the Conference\non Disarmament in Geneva to avoid duplication of\nefforts.\nWe hope that the United Nations will continue its\nefforts to guarantee a world free from nuclear weapons\nand that efforts aimed at general and complete\ndisarmament in regard to conventional weapons bear fruit.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is a party to\nthe Ottawa process on anti-personnel landmines. It\ncondemns both manufacturers and users and hopes that\ncondemnation of these weapons will go hand in hand with\na genuine will to find international settlements for civil\nwars and to prosecute individuals responsible for those\nwars for crimes against humanity.\nI could not conclude my remarks without mentioning\nthe general situation in the Great Lakes region,\nparticularly the Rwandan refugees and the United Nations\ncommission of inquiry on the allegations of massacres in\nthe east of our country.\nThe world campaign for human and humanitarian\nrights orchestrated against the Alliance of Democratic\nForces for the Liberation of Congo and against the\nGovernment of His Excellency the President,\nMr. Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila, in some ways recalls the\ndeplorable and unfortunate United Nations intervention in\nthe Congo in 1960.\nOur position is that the problem of refugees, whether\nthey be Hutus or not, must remain a humanitarian issue\nand can in no way become a political issue. Therefore,\nany attempt to politicize it should be condemned because\nit goes against the spirit and letter of the Charter of our\nOrganization.\n18\n\n\nWith particular regard to the question of the alleged\nRwandan refugees and the allegations that they were\nmassacred, the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues\nto repeat, for anyone who wants to listen, that it has\nnothing to hide. Moreover, we have never concealed our\nmoral concern regarding the Rwandan women and children\nwho were taken hostage and fell victim to Rwandan\nextremists bent on genocide. What we do dispute in this\nmatter is the fact that the former Rwandan armed forces\nand the militia, the INTERAHAMWE, are classed as\nrefugees, which totally disregards the provisions of the\nGeneva Conventions and the relevant convention of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU).\nHere, I should like to call to witness the Security\nCouncil, some of whose members rightly refused to\nsubscribe to the idea of an international intervention force\nled by Canada for the simple reason that the real Rwandan\nrefugees had returned to Rwanda. The armed bands who\nwent from Kibu as far as Congo (Brazzaville), the Central\nAfrican Republic and regions of Angola controlled by the\nUni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola\n(UNITA) are not refugees. They are hostage-takers and no\none has the right to ignore that.\nIn two and a half years, the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and all kinds of\nhumanitarian agencies could not repatriate more than 100\nrefugees to Rwanda. While they spent more than $1 billion,\nto the tune of $1.2 million per day, the Alliance of\nDemocratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo was able to\nassist in the voluntary repatriation, in conditions of full\nsecurity and dignity, of over 700,000 Rwandan refugees in\nfour days. In the same way, the Alliance of Democratic\nForces for the Liberation of Congo had called more than\nthree ceasefires for humanitarian reasons. That same\nmovement had opened humanitarian corridors \u2014 road, rail\nand air \u2014 to allow for and assist the repatriation of\nRwandan refugees. That same movement had fed and cared\nfor the so-called refugees, whom today it is accused of\nhaving massacred, in the equatorial forest.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is a place of\nrefuge and anyone who is being persecuted anywhere in the\nworld will find asylum there in accordance with the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1951 Geneva\nConvention relating to the Status of Refugees and the\nrelevant OAU convention. Thus, the Congolese from\nBrazzaville were welcomed shortly after the Rwandans\nwere repatriated but, paradoxically,\n(spoke in English)\nthese refugees did not receive the same attention from the\ninternational community as the Rwandan refugees. They\nhappen to be second-class refugees.\n(spoke in French)\nCan people at least realize what kind of and how\ngreat a toll the presence of Rwandan refugees, particularly\nof members of the former Rwandan armed forces and\nINTERAHAMWE, in the Congo will have taken? Has\nanyone taken the trouble to assess the impact of the\nactivities of these phoney refugees on the territory of the\nCongo?\nAnd since we could not speak of refugees without\nmentioning the United Nations commission of inquiry, I\nwould like to make the most of this opportunity to draw\nthe attention of this Assembly to the clearly humanitarian\nnature of the mission of the commission. In no way\nshould it turn itself into a political mission, as it has been\ntrying to do so far. It should be understood that its\ndeployment in the field must not violate our independence\nand sovereignty. Our confidence in the international\nOrganization is neither a sign of weakness nor a failure to\nsee, in this particular case, that there are plans afoot to\nuse these structures to undermine certain forces.\nThe Government of the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo has accepted, and I repeat,\n(spoke in English)\nwe have accepted that the team can do its work and we\nare expecting it to go ahead and do the work. Our\nGovernment will do anything in its power to make sure\nthat the team does its work. However, the team will then\nhave to answer a certain number of questions, especially\nin the eastern part of our country. Mainly, who did what,\nwhen, why, with whose help? The team will have to tell\nus why the refugees were armed. The team will have to\ntell us who armed them. Why were they not disarmed?\nThe team will have to tell us how many amongst the\nrefugees were really refugees and how many were\npseudo-refugees. The team will say how many Congolese\npeople were butchered by these people who have been\ncalled refugees, but more importantly, the team will tell\nus if there was any continuation of Rwandese genocide on\nCongolese soil because, as the Assembly knows, the same\npeople who committed genocide in Rwanda crossed the\nborder with their arms, with their machetes, with their\nideology, and they continued their work in our country.\nAnd, more importantly, the team will establish the\n19\n\n\nresponsibility of everybody in that matter. But let me repeat\nagain, our Government is willing to help the team, to give\nfull access to the team, so that the team can go ahead and\ndo its work.\n(spoke in French)\nI should like to conclude my statement today with a\nmessage from Mr. Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila, President of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, which reads:\n\u201cMy country has lost a great deal of time\nbecause of the injustices of the cold war. My people\nask only one thing: to build the well-being and\nprosperity they need, in full sovereignty and with\nrespect for the sovereignty of others. We thank all\nthose countries that are willing to assist us in our\nrecovery.\n\u201cWe have no other ambition. We are only\nconvinced that the world opinion that will satisfy us\ncan come only from ourselves. What we ask of the\nother nations of the world is that they assist us in\nseeing that those who are not in agreement with our\nview of things cannot thwart us.\u201d\nWorld peace is one and indivisible, and the principle\nof collective responsibility obliges all of us to take that into\naccount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish\nto congratulate you, Mr. President, on your unanimous\nelection. I am confident that under your leadership this\nsession of the General Assembly is well placed to address\nthe important issues on its agenda.\nCommendation is due His Excellency Mr. Razali\nIsmail for the balanced and effective guidance he provided\nduring the just concluded session.\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to offer heartfelt\ncongratulations to our new Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, on his assumption of such a high and noble office.\nHe will no doubt bring fresh insights to bear on the\nHerculean tasks and problems confronting the United\nNations. We wish to indicate our support for his initiatives\nfor reforming the United Nations.\nIn spite of the many achievements of the United\nNations, much remains to be done. The world is still\nplagued by poverty, all manner of diseases \u2014 some even\ndefying medical science \u2014 terrorism, regional conflict\nand the menace of drugs. There can be no real peace or\nsecurity if millions of people go to bed hungry. There can\nbe no comfort if the rich man turns his back on the poor\nman and treats him as a statistic. It seems as if the moral\nobligation to help the disadvantaged has been totally\nabandoned in some quarters.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines remains a very\npeaceful country, with its cherished democratic\ninstitutions intact. Recently our judicial system, which is\nknown historically for its integrity, was put under\nmicroscopic examination with a view to discrediting it.\nThe test results reveal a clean bill of health. This painful\nperiod in our history has taught us many lessons. We\nknow now that there are friends who will smile with us\nwhile plotting our execution. Today it is true to say that\nmight is not right and that a small nation like ours can\nhave the fortitude to withstand attacks even from those\nwho may have the strength of Samson.\nOur banana pains continue to intensify. The\nprognosis appears to be very bleak. The recent World\nTrade Organization (WTO) ruling has left us dazed and\nhelpless. The concept of every man being his brother\u2019s\nkeeper has been shattered.Can we survive? Will our cries\nfor help go unheeded? What about our neighbours? Are\nthey deaf or uncaring? I know it now. Money and greed\nhave been elevated to the status of a religion, and care\nand concern are now regarded as a vice. Our future is\nnow on a life-support system. However, I am confident\nthat our resourcefulness and faith will see us through.\nMy delegation welcomes the idea of the\nestablishment of a zone of peace in the Middle East. We\ncall on all parties to take urgent and practical steps\ntowards the establishment of such a zone in accordance\nwith the relevant General Assembly resolutions adopted\nby consensus. We also call for a halt to the distribution\nand production of conventional weapons, which have\ncaused immense suffering, especially in this century.\nRecent acts of terrorism have given cause for great\nconcern. Why should innocent people continue to perish?\nThe United Nations Charter provides for the peaceful\nsettlement of disputes. Both sides have rights which must\nbe respected. Violence can never be a solution. Let us put\nreason before bloodshed.\n12\n\n\nWe should not rush to write the obituary for the\nMiddle East peace process. The wounds inflicted are not\nfatal; the haemorrhaging can be stopped and the process\nrevived.\nI look forward to the day when peace will break out\nin that ancient region, when men shall beat their swords\ninto ploughshares and into pruning hooks their spears.\nOur own hemisphere is not without problems. Our\nregion believes in neighbourly love, and any attempt to\ninflict pain and unjustified hardship on any of us affects all\nof us. Those who exert pressure, be it economic or legal,\nwill find no comfort in our bosom. The strategy of\ndiplomatic isolation has failed. It is clear that in the new\nmillennium, we cannot do business as usual. In hemispheric\nmatters, muscular diplomacy should give way to moral\nsuasion.\nDuring this year both Suriname and Haiti have become\nfull members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).\nWe take this opportunity to welcome them once again. We\nalso note the progress made since the reestablishment of\ndemocracy in Haiti, and we urge the international\ncommunity to continue to offer technical, material and\nfinancial help. That will enable the people of that country\nto deepen the process of democracy and to promote the\ncountry\u2019s sustained economic and social development. I\nwould like to take this opportunity to express my sympathy\nto the Government of Haiti in regard to the recent tragedy\nat sea.\nIn our region, nature has manifested its mighty force,\nand the people in Montserrat are now fleeing from an angry\nvolcano that erupts periodically. Our hearts are with the\npeople there, and we have done whatever we can to assist.\nEfforts to help are continuing at home even as I speak. Let\nus hope that the full extent of the plight of the people of\nMontserrat is realized by those who are in a position to\nmake a substantial contribution. Now is the time to stand\nup and be counted.\nMy delegation welcomes the convening in 1998 of a\nspecial session of the United Nations General Assembly\ndedicated to the fight against the illicit production, sale,\ndemand for and distribution of illicit drugs and psychotropic\nsubstances. Those who traffic in this trade can properly be\nregarded as merchants of death. International cooperation is\nthe only way to combat this menace.\nI wish at this time to pay tribute to a woman who has\ndied recently and whose name evokes mystic reverence.\nHer legacy is one of compassion. I speak of Mother\nTeresa. She embraced the poor, the sick and the suffering,\nthe favoured and the dispossessed. Her life shows that\neven in this cruel world there are still people who are\nwilling to put others before themselves in unrewarded\nservice. She lived her religion to the fullest. May she rest\nin peace.\nIt is our hope that the issue regarding Taiwan can be\nresolved peacefully. We urge those on both sides of the\nTaiwan Strait to hold discussions and negotiate a peaceful\nsolution in the reunification process to which both sides\nare committed. We of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\nare very grateful for the assistance we have received from\nTaiwan, and we would hope that the international\ncommunity would respect its contribution to development\nand that it may find its place in the international\ncommunity.\nMy delegation will continue to support the\nfundamental rights of all peoples to self-determination.\nWe are heartened to see the emergence into sovereign\nstatehood and independence of peoples once under\ncolonial domination or foreign occupation. We reaffirm\nthe inalienable right of peoples of Non-Self-Governing\nTerritories to self-determination.\nThe reform and expansion of the Security Council is\nof paramount importance as we approach the dawn of a\nnew millennium. My delegation wishes to emphasize that\nthe ongoing discussions on the reform and expansion of\nthe Security Council must take into account the principle\nof sovereign equality of States and equitable geographical\ndistribution. There is also the need for transparency,\naccountability and democratization.\nMy delegation has no objection to the inclusion of\nadditional developed countries on the Council as\npermanent members, but we fully support the proposal\nthat all regions be represented in a permanent capacity,\nincluding Latin America and the Caribbean. The reform\ncannot be handled piecemeal. We will not support any\nchange that does not include Latin America and the\nCaribbean Community.\nExpansion of the Council must not and cannot be\nlimited to permanent seats. It is necessary to increase the\nnumber of non-permanent seats to give more countries an\nopportunity to serve on the Council within a relatively\nshorter time-frame. In addition, we recommend that the\nregional non-permanent seats be rotated among the\ncountries that are desirous of serving on the Council.\n13\n\n\nIn this process we must remember and be guided by\nthe word \u201cdemocracy\u201d. If this body is to have the moral\nauthority to restore or encourage democracy in some\nMember States, it must first become fully democratic.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines remains a loyal and\ndedicated member of the United Nations committed to\nupholding the noble principles of the Charter. Now more\nthan ever before we must reaffirm our collective respect for\nthe fundamental principles of the Charter. The small nations\nof the world must receive constant reassurances from the\nlarger nations that their interests will be safeguarded, their\nsovereignty respected.\nWhen we speak of the United Nations, we must\nproject our vision beyond this building. In the end it is our\ndeeds that will count. Yes, it is what we do to the least of\nour brethren. Promises and statements have no meaning\nunless they can be translated into action. This body must\nnever be perceived as a gathering of word merchants but,\nrather, as one of action-oriented men and women.\nOur planet\u2019s resources are finite, and even the most\neconomically developed States cannot pursue unilateral\npolicies in isolation from the rest of the world.\nWe stand firm in the belief that the United Nations is\nstill the best hope for the world. This hope must be\ngrounded in action, in a firm resolve to act decisively in the\nbest interests of this great institution \u2014 indeed in the\ninterest of all humanity and untainted by the narrow\nnational interests that have dogged our path during the last\nfive decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the States members\nof the Organization of African Unity (OAU), of which I am\nthe current Chairman, and of my country, Zimbabwe, I\nextend our warmest congratulations to you, Mr. Udovenko,\non your unanimous election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-second session. Your election\nto that high office is a fitting and eloquent tribute to your\npersonal diplomatic qualities and to the valuable role that\nyour country, Ukraine, is playing in international affairs.\nWe are confident that, under your wise stewardship, the\ndeliberations of this session will achieve significant results.\nWe commend Ambassador Razali, the President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session, for having\nbrought his experience and wisdom to bear upon the\nvarious special sessions and working groups of the\nGeneral Assembly that he presided over during the past\nyear, particularly in the area of United Nations reform.\nMay I also pay tribute to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his vision and for his exemplary\nleadership of the United Nations. I wish to commend him\nparticularly for his tireless efforts to assist Member States\nin transforming the United Nations into a more dynamic,\nrelevant and effective instrument for meeting the\nchallenges that confront us as we approach the end of this\nmillennium.\nAfrica has consistently underlined the need for\nreform of the United Nations and other multilateral\nbodies, to promote the democratization and effectiveness\nof the international decision-making process. Indeed, we\nhave maintained that such international bodies should\ntruly serve the collective interests of the peoples of the\nworld. It is in this context that we welcome the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s bold package of proposals, contained in the\nreport entitled \u201cRenewing the United Nations: a\nProgramme for Reform\u201d (A/51/950), which has been\npresented to the Assembly. These proposals merit our\nserious consideration. We have taken note of those\nproposals that the Secretary-General has implemented or\nintends to implement, as they fall within the purview of\nhis powers as chief administrator of the Organization. We\nhave also taken note of the proposals that he is placing\nbefore Member States for their consideration.\n\n\nWe stand ready to work closely with the Secretary-\nGeneral and other delegations to ensure that the reform\nprocess is speeded up on the basis of consensus and\ndemocratic participation. What is crucial to us is that\nreforms go to the heart of the matter \u2014 namely, the\nremoval of anachronistic and undemocratic arrangements\nintroduced over 50 years ago.\nThe reform and expansion of the United Nations\nSecurity Council is not only desirable but also imperative\nif the Council is to ensure the successful implementation of\nits global mandate to maintain international peace and\nsecurity on behalf of all States. The fact that major\ngeographical and political groupings representing the\noverwhelming majority of the peoples of the world remain\nunder-represented and without permanent seats on the\nSecurity Council is the greatest anomaly of our times.\nEqually anomalous is a situation in which in this\nenlightened age the wishes of the overwhelming majority in\nthe General Assembly will continue to be subjected to the\nwhims and dictates of the privileged few by virtue of their\nwielding the power of the veto.\nWhy should a small minority of States continue to\nwield so much power over the destiny of the majority\nwithout the latter\u2019s consent? Why, indeed, are there\nfrequent and persistent attempts by few States to undermine\nand circumvent the most democratic and representative\nbody of the United Nations \u2014 the General Assembly \u2014 on\nmatters of crucial concern to the entire international\ncommunity? What are we to make of this? Are we meant\nto conclude that democracy and good governance at the\ninternational level should only be at the pleasure and behest\nof the mighty and powerful? Surely this state of affairs\ncannot continue, as it makes a mockery of the lofty and\nhallowed democratic principles we profess to cherish dearly\nat the national level.\nThe thirty-third ordinary summit of the Organization\nof African Unity (OAU), held in Harare in June this year,\nunderscored the pressing need for democratizing the United\nNations Security Council and stressed that the process\nshould take full account of the position of Africa as the\nlargest continental grouping at the United Nations as far as\nthe allocation of permanent and non-permanent seats in the\nreformed Council is concerned. The summit concurred with\nthe position of the Non-Aligned Movement that use of the\npower of the veto should be restricted if it is not abolished.\nHowever, for as long as it exists, the new permanent\nmembers of the Council should be granted the same\nprerogatives and powers as the current members.\nAnother area of fundamental importance to Africa\npertains to the reforms in the economic and social fields\nof the United Nations. Africa is of the view that for\nreforms in this sphere to be meaningful and credible they\nshould seek to reinforce the pivotal role of the United\nNations in development and, conversely, the centrality of\ndevelopment to the United Nations agenda. We firmly\nbelieve in the role of free enterprise as the motive force\nin economic development. But any attempts to re-fashion\nan exclusively political mandate for the United Nations\nwill marginalize its role in development, while giving free\nplay to blind market forces and finance capital. This is\nclearly contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and\nshould be resisted.\nThe United Nations needs adequate financial\nresources if it is to continue to fulfil its mandate\neffectively, particularly in the light of the ever-expanding\nburden of responsibilities that it has to shoulder. It is\ntherefore imperative for Member States to ensure that\nthey pay their dues and pay them in a timely fashion.\nUnilateral actions to adjust the Organization\u2019s scale of\nassessment or to withhold funds from certain United\nNations programmes undermine the very foundation of\nthe Organization and therefore should not be condoned.\nIn the area of disarmament, we welcome the\nadoption at the recently concluded Oslo Conference of the\ndraft treaty on the global ban on anti-personnel mines.\nThe overwhelming support that the treaty received is\neloquent testimony to the determination of the\ninternational community to rid itself of these deadly\nweapons, which have killed or maimed millions of\ninnocent people the world over. Africa, which has one of\nthe largest concentrations of anti-personnel mines and\nperhaps the highest number of victims of these weapons,\nis happy to join this international consensus. It is our\nhope that those who remain outside the Ottawa process\nwill reconsider their position and decide to sign the treaty\nwhen it is opened for signature in December of this year.\nThe past few years have witnessed the African\ncontinent undergoing a dual process of economic and\npolitical reforms. These reforms have in many countries\nresulted in greater democratization, as well as in higher\neconomic growth rates. In the political sphere, democracy\nand good governance have taken root on our continent. In\nthe past few years, we have witnessed the end of the\ndictatorships and military governments in many parts of\nAfrica, and their replacement by governments committed\nto the political empowerment of their people. In the\neconomic sphere, economic structural adjustment\n2\n\n\nprogrammes not only have stimulated high growth rates of\nbetween 5 and 10 per cent per annum, but have also created\nan environment that is increasingly receptive to foreign\ndirect investment and greater participation of the private\nsector in our economies. Most countries have also entered\ninto multilateral and bilateral investment treaties with both\ndeveloped and developing countries.\nAt the subregional and continental levels, Africa has\ntaken unprecedented steps to assume greater control of its\nfuture through economic integration. The historic convening\nin Harare in June this year of the inaugural session of the\nAssembly of Heads of Government of the African\nEconomic Community was an important landmark in\nAfrica\u2019s efforts to build a stable and prosperous future for\nits people. The session resolved to strengthen the African\nEconomic Community through the conclusion of protocols\nwith subregional organizations, such as the Southern\nAfrican Development Community (SADC), the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and the\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa\n(COMESA), among others, which are essential building\nblocks for a viable economic community at a continental\nlevel.\nFor these efforts to succeed, however, it is vital that\nAfrica receive the prerequisite support and cooperation of\nits development partners and, indeed, that of the\ninternational community at large. We should never\nunderestimate the enormous obstacles that the African\neconomies are confronted with. Africa\u2019s external debt\nproblem and the heavy burden of debt repayments continue\nto drain many of our economies of the much-needed capital\nfor development. More resources in the form of debt\nrepayments than those coming in the form of aid are\nleaving the continent. There is a need, therefore, for\ninternational financial institutions to adopt a unified and\ncoordinated approach to Africa\u2019s debt problem that will\nhelp to redress the situation. There can be no better time\nthan now for the international community to augment our\nown efforts to bring the much-awaited peace dividend to\nour people.\nForeign direct investment to Africa should continue to\nbe augmented by official development assistance. The\nsteady fall of this assistance from 0.34 per cent in 1992 to\n0.25 per cent in 1996 is therefore a matter of serious\nconcern to us. We commend those countries which have\nsurpassed the target of allocating 0.7 per cent of gross\ndomestic product to official development assistance and\nurge others to do likewise. We welcome new initiatives on\nAfrica that have recently been announced in the area of\ntrade, investment and infrastructure development. These\nare, indeed, a result of the recognition that Africa risks\nbeing marginalized unless innovative ways are found to\nsupport its development efforts.\nAfrica in terms of conflict situations still suffers\nfrom a number of setbacks. The situation in Sierra Leone,\nwhere a military junta overthrew the democratically\nelected Government of that country in May this year, is\na matter of serious concern to us. The Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU), meeting in Harare for its thirty-\nthird summit, unequivocally condemned the coup and\ncalled for the immediate and unconditional restoration of\nthe constitutional Government of Sierra Leone. Africa\u2019s\nmessage is loud and clear. The days of military\ndictatorships are over. Africa cannot and will not give\nlegitimacy to regimes that willy-nilly flout the rule of law\nand the popular aspirations of their people. We appeal to\nthe international community not to give solace to these\nmilitary juntas in the name of humanitarian aid, but to\nstand solidly with Africa in denying them recognition.\nOf equal concern to Africa are the crises in the\nRepublic of Congo (Brazzaville), Somalia, the Sudan,\nWestern Sahara, Burundi and the Comoros. In this respect\nwe take note of, and reaffirm our support for, the United\nNations initiative through the Secretary-General\u2019s envoy,\nMr. James Baker, which seeks to find a lasting solution\nto the problem of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic.\nThe OAU is working tirelessly through the\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\nResolution in search of African solutions to these African\nproblems. We call on the United Nations and the\ninternational community at large to support Africa\u2019s\ninitiatives to resolve these conflicts and to strengthen the\nOAU\u2019s capacity for preventive diplomacy and conflict\nresolution.\nWe are encouraged by the continued engagement of\nthe United Nations in Angola and welcome the adoption\nby the Security Council last month of resolution 1127\n(1997), calling on the Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a\nIndepend\u00eancia Total de Angola (UNITA) to abide by the\nLusaka Protocol. Africa and the entire international\ncommunity welcomed the successful holding of elections\nin Liberia, and we congratulate the Economic Community\nof West African States (ECOWAS) on the important role\nit played in helping to bring that conflict to an end.\nWe salute the people of the Democratic Republic of\nCongo on the positive developments that have taken place\n3\n\n\nin their country and welcome the commitment of their\nGovernment to restore and uphold democracy and\ndemocratic principles. Obviously, after so many decades of\ndictatorship and plunder, the task of rehabilitation and\nreconstruction in that country is not going to be an easy\none. The people of the Democratic Republic of Congo need\nour support in their endeavours to restore peace and\nstability in their country.\nIndeed, basic necessities such as food and shelter,\ntogether with peace, security and stability, are the foremost\nhuman rights that the people of the Democratic Republic of\nCongo ask of the international community in this, their hour\nof greatest need. While inquiry into alleged massacres in\nthe Congo may be important, the lofty principles of peace,\ndemocracy and good governance which we all cherish so\ndearly, will be realized in that country only if immediate\nsupport is provided by the international community.\nIn respect of the dispute between the Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya and both the United States and Britain\nconcerning the Lockerbie issue, the OAU summit expressed\nthe hope that the Security Council would consider ways and\nmeans to ensure a rapid resolution of this dispute.\nThe peace process in the Middle East is in serious\njeopardy as a result of Israel\u2019s refusal to freeze the building\nof settlements in the occupied territories. There is a real\nrisk of reversal of important gains that have been achieved\nso far in that part of the world. We call on the parties to\nthe peace process to show good faith and give peace a\nchance.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate that we believe the\nUnited Nations reform process has reached a crucial stage.\nWe have always believed that the United Nations, as a\nliving organism, needs to respond to its changing\nenvironment. It is our sincere hope, therefore, that we can\nmake progress expeditiously. We in Africa aspire, in these\nreforms, for a United Nations which upholds universal\nvalues and interests, attends to the urgent needs of the least-\ndeveloped regions of the world, and remains at the service\nof humanity.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to congratulate Mr. Udovenko,\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, on his election\nto the post of President of the General Assembly. His\nelection signifies recognition of Ukraine s great prestige in\nthe world, respect for and confidence in the country s\nforeign policy, and the personal and professional qualities\nof the new President.\nWe are sincerely grateful to Ambassador Razali Ismail\nfor his remarkable diplomatic talent and efficient\nperformance of the President s functions during the\nprevious session of the General Assembly.\nFirst of all, allow me to express our satisfaction with\nthe report presented by the Secretary-General. It is an\ninnovative and specific document devoid of many of the\nweaknesses typical of similar documents in the past.\nTurkmenistan supports the Secretary-General s programme\nto reform the entire United Nations system and the\nfunctioning of its bodies \u2014 in particular the Secretariat \u2014\nand to tailor the financial resources of the Organization to\nits planned activities.\nWe share the conclusion in the report that the reform\nof the United Nations should be radical and not gradual.\nHowever, we believe that the reforms should not be carried\nout as a revolutionary overhaul, especially when it comes,\nfor example, to the Security Council, which after it\nbecomes more representative should still remain an\neffectively functioning body that should not supplant the\nGeneral Assembly.\nIn our view, a rational increase in the number of\npermanent members of the Security Council primarily\ncalls for the inclusion of such States as Japan and\nGermany \u2014 vested with all corresponding rights and\npowers \u2014 because they can make a constructive input\nand have greater political objectiveness with respect to the\nwork of the Security Council.\nThere is an issue of special interest and concern for\nTurkmenistan, as well as for all the countries of the\nregion: the question of Afghanistan. We are glad to note\nthat this question finds an increasingly prominent place in\nthe agenda of the United Nations and in the activities of\nits agencies, ad hoc bodies and the Security Council. We\nfeel special gratitude for the Secretary-General for his\ncontinuing efforts to give a new impetus to the intra-\nAfghan settlement. In this context, we attach particular\nsignificance to the efforts of the Secretary-General s\nspecial envoys Mr. Norbert Hall and Mr. Lakhdar\nBrahimi. Turkmenistan was involved in the\nimplementation of peacemaking programmes in the region\nby hosting a series of inter-Tajik talks and by organizing,\ntogether with the United Nations, a major international\nconference on humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.\nTurkmenistan resolutely supports and will support to the\nutmost the earliest possible convening of an international\nconference on Afghanistan with the participation of all its\nimmediate neighbours and, in the future, the holding of\nconference with the participation of the Powers vested\nwith special international authority and capable of making\na practical contribution towards the settlement. The\nPresident of Turkmenistan, Mr. Saparmurat Niyazov,\nmaintains constant contact regarding this matter with Mr.\nKofi Annan, the Secretary-General, and with the leaders\nof the neighbouring States of Iran, Pakistan, Uzbekistan\nand Tajikistan. Turkmenistan pins great hopes on the\nforthcoming summit meeting of the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference (OIC), to be held in Tehran in\nDecember this year, which will give the Muslim world an\nopportunity to determine at the highest level the\nguidelines for the resolution of the prolonged Afghan\ncrisis, which has today become a bleeding wound for the\nAfghan people and an obstacle preventing the region from\nimplementing major economic programmes. Turkmenistan\nhas always believed, and still believes, that conflict\nsituations emerging in the OIC s geographical area\nshould be resolved through its joint efforts with the\nUnited Nations.\nWe are happy to be witnessing today a greater\ndisplay of restraint with regard to simplistic attempts\naimed at associating extremism and other negative\n23\n\n\nphenomena with the world of Islam. The Muslim world like\nany other \u2014 for example, Christianity \u2014 is multifaceted\nand diverse. It confronts a whole complex of universal\nproblems of development, and it is being mobilized to\novercome conflicts and combat manifestations of uncivil\nsocial behaviour. The need for this was emphasized by the\nSecretary- General in his report to the current session of the\nGeneral Assembly. While it is a secular and democratic\nState in Asia, Turkmenistan also considers itself a\ntraditional oriental society that, by virtue of its geopolitical\ndestiny, finds itself at the juncture of two regions, involving\nit simultaneously in Asian and European international\naffairs. Against the backdrop of the global energy potential\nof our State, this factor forms the basis of the United\nNations-supported strategy of Turkmenistan s neutrality,\nwhich today acquires practical significance for the\nOrganization.\nAll our political efforts today are aimed at creating a\nfavourable atmosphere for economic development, both of\nthe entire region and of every country in particular. At its\nsummit meeting held last May in Ashgabat, the regional\nEconomic Cooperation Organization, which today\ncomprises 10 nations, formulated a strategic programme for\nthe development of transport, energy, pipeline and\ntelecommunication infrastructures. Its implementation not\nonly corresponds to the interests of the participating States\nbut also creates opportunities for the delivery of energy\ncarriers, oil, gas and oil products to international markets in\nEurope and Asia from the enormously rich deposits in the\nCaspian Sea basin and the entire Central Asian area.\nTurkmenistan believes that, in the intensification of\ninternational cooperation, the resolution of crises in Central\nAsia and the use of preventive measures aimed at\nprecluding their recurrence because of conflicting claims of\nStates to ownership rights over natural resources, it is\nnecessary to take into account the global challenges of the\ntwenty-first century, which call for the early development\nof additional and alternative means for the rational\ndistribution of energy-producing raw materials on world\nmarkets. Turkmenistan possesses the world s third largest\ngas deposits, and it has huge oil reserves and other mineral\nresources. It is ready to take part in open and broad-based\ninternational cooperation in this endeavour. This approach\nhas been confirmed by the recently issued international\ntender for the development and exploration of oil and gas\ndeposits in the Turkmen zone of the Caspian Sea. We\ncannot but express our satisfaction at the lifting of artificial\nbarriers to the gas pipeline from Turkmenistan through Iran\nto Turkey and Europe. We consider this a good sign from\nthe United States, a sign that it is ready to support our\nefforts to strengthen our sovereignty and independent\nnational economy.\nIn this context, allow me also to express our\nsatisfaction at the fact that the Secretary-General s report\nand other recent documents of the Organization have at\nlast more clearly defined the notion of Central Asia,\nwhich includes many more States as compared with the\nold central Asian part of the former Soviet Union. During\nthe past several years Turkmenistan has maintained a\nconsistent and principled approach to this issue,\nemphasizing that the disappearance of the southern\nborders of the former Soviet State gave rise to the\nformation of a new region unified by the common\npurpose of accelerating economic development and\nstrengthening its political and State structures. Today it is\ninconceivable that Turkmenistan should exist without\nequally close ties within this region \u2014 with Iran, Turkey,\nPakistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan\nand other neighbours. We are firmly convinced that the\nformer Soviet \u201cCentral Asian 5\u201d have quite logically been\ntransformed into the \u201cCentral Asian 10\u201d and that the\nUnited Nations and its different agencies should bear in\nmind this objective reality when formulating their\napproaches to the region.\nI believe it is highly important to draw the\nAssembly s attention to Turkmenistan s sincere\ncommitment to the efforts of the international community\nto bring about the complete banning of the production and\nproliferation of all types of weapons of mass destruction.\nTurkmenistan fully subscribes to the Ottawa process for\nthe elimination of anti-personnel landmines. In 1996 and\n1997, together with Canada, Turkmenistan actively\nparticipated in international forums in Vienna, Bonn,\nOslo, Brussels and Ashgabat, which have been major\nmilestones on the road towards the signing of the treaty\nbanning anti-personnel landmines, which is to be signed\nin December this year in Ottawa. Coming from a region\nthat has suffered the horrors of this so-called\nindiscriminate type of weapon, Turkmenistan is convinced\nthat it is a timely and highly relevant treaty.\nAt the end of the twentieth century international\nrelations are characterized by one specific feature: the\nright of choice that is enjoyed today by an\nunprecedentedly large number of independent nations and\nStates. This right is becoming an increasingly stable trend\nstrengthened by greater tolerance and patience in\ninternational relations. Participation or non-participation\nin one or another political or economic grouping is no\nlonger considered, nor can it be considered, through the\n24\n\n\nprism of the formula \u201cIf you are not with us, you are\nagainst us\u201d. Turkmenistan does not object to the idea of the\nexistence of the great Powers regional interests. This is\nthe right of every State. However, we, like our partners in\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, unequivocally object to the\nexistence of zones of unilateral domination. We stand for\nthe principle of open land as well as that of open skies.\nWhile building its relations with all States on the basis of\nthe principles of equality and mutual respect, neutral\nTurkmenistan does not divide its partners into categories of\nclose or remote, big or small, because that runs counter to\nthe political logic of our times.\nToday, during my meeting with Mr. Kofi Annan, the\nSecretary- General of the United Nations, I delivered to him\na personal message from the President of Turkmenistan,\nMr. Saparmurat Niyazov which, in particular, states, first,\nthat our political philosophy and all our actions are free of\nany self-serving interests and are primarily aimed at\nstrengthening peace and raising the economic well-being\nand cultural and educational level of its peoples; secondly,\nthat the United Nations can be fully convinced that\nTurkmenistan is prepared to give the Organization its\nmaximum possible assistance; and, finally, that the United\nNations can count on Turkmenistan in all its initiatives and\nendeavours in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, I should like to extend my warmest\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-second\n8\n\n\nsession. As an architect of stability, you have played a\nsubstantial role in securing the recent conclusion of a\nnumber of major agreements with Ukraine\u2019s neighbouring\ncountries. I am certain that both that experience and the\nexperience you have acquired in the field of international\nrelations and at the United Nations will be decisive factors\nin leading this session to a successful outcome. I should\nlike to assure you, Sir, of our full support.\nI should also like to thank your predecessor,\nAmbassador Razali, for the skill and commitment with\nwhich he led our work at the last session of the General\nAssembly. I also wish to express my appreciation to our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the splendid work\nhe has performed since taking office and, in particular, for\nhis wide-ranging proposals for the reform of the United\nNations, which he presented last 16 July.\nIt is an honour for me to address this Assembly today\non behalf of the European Union, which, like the United\nNations, is seeking to change and renew itself in order to\nface more effectively the challenges of the new millennium.\nGlobalization, with its emphasis on growing\ninterdependence between nations and their economies, is\nbringing profound changes in international relations. A\nparticular feature of this globalization is the genuine\nrevolution in the field of information and communications\ntechnologies, which banishes any notion of geographical\ndistance. Globalization, characterized by the acceleration of\ntrade and financial flows and by increased market\nintegration, is a source for both progress and fresh\nopportunities. However, it also raises some serious\nquestions, even among the industrialized countries, which\nare experiencing a worrying rise in unemployment. We note\nat the same time that these developments are passing by\nmany developing countries, which remain in great poverty.\nMore than 1.5 billion people still live in absolute poverty.\nWe cannot remain indifferent to this situation.\nWe are particularly concerned by the growing\ninequality both within countries and between countries of\nthe North and of the South, which is a dangerous source of\nfurther conflict and tension.\nFree of the threat of confrontation in a polarized\nworld, we are faced today with a series of global problems\nboth old and new: underdevelopment, population growth,\nincreasingly large-scale migration, damage to the\nenvironment, the proliferation of weapons of all kinds,\nterrorism, ethnic conflict, drug trafficking, violence \u2014 the\nblind, hateful violence against innocent people that we\nwitness nearly every day, for example in Algeria \u2014 and\ncrime, often in forms never before encountered.\nIn order to deal successfully with all these problems,\nit is essential that we continue to promote justice and\nsolidarity between all countries and individuals as well as\ntolerance \u2014 I lay particular stress on \u201ctolerance\u201d \u2014 and\nrespect for others and, above all, to strengthen\ncooperation between States on both the regional and the\nworld levels.\nProgressive integration that respects national identity\nis a hallmark of the policy of the States members of the\nEuropean Union. In scarcely more than 50 years, we have\nsucceeded in developing in Europe a stability and a\nprosperity that the continent has never before experienced.\nThe European Union is based on democracy as its\npolitical system and on a social market economy as its\neconomic system. Our market economy is not a free-for-\nall; it is mitigated by considerations of social welfare.\nStates retain full responsibility in the fields of health,\neducation and social justice. Although this system requires\nconstant adjustment, its principles are sacrosanct.\nThe European Union, wishing to respond to the\nchallenges of the post-cold-war world, proposes to take\nup three major challenges over the years ahead: the\nestablishment of an economic and monetary union; the\nstrengthening of its institutional base through the\nimplementation of the Amsterdam Treaty; and preparation\nfor further enlargement towards the eastern and southern\nEurope.\nEconomic and monetary union is probably the most\nimportant and most ambitious economic and political\nproject to be implemented by Europe since the beginning\nof the integration process. The Euro, as the single\ncurrency is to be known, will come into existence on 1\nJanuary 1999. Its introduction is the culmination of the\nlengthy process of implementation of the single market.\nThe Euro is the logical consequence of the venture\nembarked upon with the European Community\u2019s\nfoundation in 1957.\nIn order to prepare for the single currency, the States\nmembers of the European Union have successfully\ncommitted themselves to strengthening the coordination\nof their economic policies and the pursuit of healthier,\nmore stable macroeconomic and budgetary policies.\nThe creation of the Euro will help to achieve greater\nstability and a more balanced international monetary\n9\n\n\nsystem. It will help to reduce monetary uncertainty and will\ngive a boost to the development of trade, investment and,\nhence, growth and employment both at the European and\nthe world levels.\nThe Heads of State or Government of the European\nUnion reached political agreement on 17 June this year on\na new treaty for Europe, the Amsterdam Treaty. This\nTreaty will be submitted for signature by plenipotentiaries\nin two weeks\u2019 time. The Amsterdam Treaty marks a further\nstep in the building of Europe and opens the way for the\nlaunching of the enlargement process. It provides for\ngreater consistency in the external action of the Union, and\nwill enable it to anticipate crises more effectively and to\nprovide a more efficient protection of its economic\ninterests. It emphasizes the defence and security dimension\nof the European Union, and clarifies in particular the\nUnion\u2019s role in respect of peacekeeping or peacemaking\nmissions and humanitarian action.\nThe new Treaty also provides for the creation of an\narea of freedom, security and justice, which will enable the\nUnion to take more effective and coordinated action to\ncombat terrorism, major crime and illegal immigration.\nFinally, a number of provisions underline the importance\nthat the Union attaches to the promotion and to the\nprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nThis coming December, the Union will take major\ndecisions on future enlargement. Negotiations on accession\nshould begin as early as possible next year. The\ninternational repercussions of the enlargement of the Union\nwill far transcend the new frontiers of an enlarged Europe;\nthis enlargement will add to Europe\u2019s influence in the\nworld, will provide the European Union with new\nneighbours and will make Europe a peaceful, more united\nand more stable area.\nIn taking up these three challenges, the European\nUnion member States seek to unite further in order to form\na common front against the problem of unemployment and\nto take more effective action to combat organized crime,\nterrorism and the proliferation of weapons of every kind, to\nact more effectively to prevent major environmental\ndamage and to ensure lasting growth while making the best\npossible use of the world\u2019s resources.\nAt the same time, the European Union is seeking to\nincrease its influence over world affairs, promote values\nsuch as peace and security, democracy and human rights in\na more effective manner, defend its conception of the social\nmodel and assert its presence on international markets.\nIt is in that spirit, and in order to strengthen\ncooperation in the political, economic and financial fields,\nthat the European Union is developing relations of\npartnership with all the countries of the world.\nA larger and more united European Union will also\nmake a greater contribution towards development\ncooperation with the most disadvantaged countries. The\ndevelopment assistance of the European Union is part of\na policy designed to roll back poverty and inequality in\nthe world and to foster a sustainable development.\nThe Union is already the largest contributor to the\nregular budget of the United Nations and to the budget\nfor United Nations peacekeeping operations. It is also the\nlargest international aid donor. The European Community\nand its member States provide over half the humanitarian\naid dispensed worldwide and fund 50 per cent of\ninternational development aid. We provide 40 per cent of\nassistance for the reconstruction process in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, nearly 60 per cent of international aid to\nRussia and to the republics of the former Soviet Union,\nhalf of the aid for the Palestinian territories and one third\nof the total aid for the Middle East.\nAs in the past, the European Union describes its\nrelations with third countries, together with its positions\non and action in respect of areas of conflict throughout\nthe world, in a memorandum that is circulated as an\nintegral part of this address. I should like, however, to\nhighlight a number of issues which continue to hold our\nfull attention.\nThe European Union continues to make a major\ncontribution towards the consolidation of peace in all the\ncountries of the former Yugoslavia. It wishes to develop\nits relations and to strengthen its cooperation with those\ncountries to the extent that their respective Governments\npursue a policy which respects the peace agreements\nconcluded and which enables them to progress towards\ndemocracy, the rule of law, tolerance and respect for\nhuman rights and minorities.\nThe European Union is concerned at the tardiness in\nimplementing the peace agreements in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. It emphasizes that the responsibility for\nsuch implementation rests with the parties themselves.\nWe fully support the efforts of the High\nRepresentative, Mr. Carlos Westendorp. We pay a tribute\nto his deputy, Ambassador Gerd Wagner, to Mr. David\n10\n\n\nKrishkovich and to their colleagues who have given their\nlives in their commitment to peace.\nThe European Union is determined to insist on the\nstrict and full application of the peace agreements in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina and of the conclusions of the Sintra\nministerial meeting. It is on the basis of such application\nthat the European Union is willing to continue to contribute\nto the international reconstruction effort. It continues to\nattach great importance to the return of refugees and\ndisplaced persons and to demand the full cooperation of all\nparties with the International Criminal Tribunal as a\nnecessary condition for a lasting reconciliation and a just\npeace.\nWithout minimizing the difficulties in the Muslim\nCroat Federation, the European Union observes with\nconcern the political crisis which has erupted in the\nRepublika Srpska. It calls on all parties to respect the\nconstitutional functioning of that entity and to take vigorous\naction to reform the police and to establish freedom of the\npress. We believe the holding of legislative elections under\nthe supervision of the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) constitutes the appropriate\nand democratic means for resolving the present political\ndeadlock.\nThe European Union welcomes the recent holding of\nmunicipal elections, on 13 and 14 September, with the\nparticipation of all the parties. These elections mark an\nimportant step in the process of democratization in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina. We appeal to the parties to respect the\nresults as certified by the OSCE.\nThe European Union also remains concerned by the\nsituation in Kosovo, in particular by the lack of respect for\nhuman rights and the principles of the rule of law.\nConcerning Cyprus, the European Union regrets that\nthe intercommunal talks under the aegis of the United\nNations have failed to register progress. We call on the\nleaders of both communities to resume the talks, as\nproposed by Mr. Cordovez. We urge them and all parties\nconcerned to work constructively and in good faith to\npromote the success of these talks. We reject any link\nbetween the talks and the membership negotiations with\nCyprus. The latter will be initiated in accordance with the\ndecisions taken by the European Council and will contribute\npositively towards the search for a political solution. The\nEuropean Union recalled that Cypriot membership should\nbenefit both communities and should help to bring about\ncivil peace and reconciliation.\nIn the Middle East, the peace process is at a\nworrisome standstill. The European Union calls on the\npeoples and Governments of the region to renew the spirit\nof mutual confidence which, at Madrid in 1991 and in\nOslo in 1993, gave rise to the hope of a just, lasting and\ncomprehensive peace. We call upon the Israeli and\nPalestinian leaders to continue the negotiations to further\nthe implementation of the Interim Agreement and the\nHebron agreement, and to resume talks on permanent\nstatus. We ask them once more to abstain from any\nunilateral action which may prejudice the issues relating\nto permanent status.\nThe European Union firmly condemns the recent\nterrorist attacks in Jerusalem. We call on each side to\nshow absolute determination in combating terrorism. We\nhope that cooperation in the field of security between\nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority will be re-established\nand reinforced. To that end, we propose the setting up of\na permanent security committee with the participation of\nthe parties involved and, possibly, with that of the United\nStates and the European Union.\nWe urge both parties not to yield to blackmail by\nextremists bent on sabotaging the peace process. We ask\nthat Israel discontinue certain measures taken with regard\nto the Palestinians which we consider to be counter-\nproductive. In particular, we ask that Israel transfer all of\nthe tax revenue owed to the Palestinian Authority. It is\nnot in the interests of peace to weaken the Palestinian\neconomy, administration and leadership and to feed the\nfeelings of frustration and humiliation of an entire people.\nIn the opinion of the European Union, peace remains the\nonly strategic choice and the only lasting guarantee for\nthe security and prosperity of both sides.\nThe European Union will continue, through the\nefforts of its Special Envoy for the Middle East Peace\nProcess, Ambassador Moratinos, as well as through its\ndiplomatic relations, its economic commitment and its\nrelations of friendship and trust with the various parties,\nto work with the parties concerned both within and\noutside the region, and especially with the United States,\nto relaunch the peace process.\nIn Africa, major developments have occurred in\nrecent months, notably in the Great Lakes region, which\ncontinues to experience serious problems. The European\nUnion fully supports the efforts undertaken there, as\nelsewhere, by the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\nin close cooperation with the United Nations. It welcomes\nthe action taken by both its special representative,\n11\n\n\nMr. Ajello, and the Special Representative of the\nSecretaries-General of the United Nations and the OAU,\nMr. Sahnoun. The international community must thus aim\nat establishing peace, at consolidating the process of\nnational reconciliation in the countries concerned, at\ncreating a climate conducive to the voluntary return of\nrefugees and of facilitating the establishment of normal\ndemocratic life. We support the introduction of the rule of\nlaw, which should put an end to the climate of impunity\nprevailing in the region and encourage its economic and\nsocial recovery.\nThe accession of the new authorities in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo signals a very important change for\nthe Congo and the whole of Africa. The European Union is\naware of the scale of requirements for reconstruction in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and is willing to\ncontribute its support for reconstruction. It confirms its\nreadiness to resume cooperation with that Government on\na gradual basis. The resumption of cooperation will depend,\naccording to the conclusions of the European Council of\nAmsterdam, on the progress observed in the fields of\nhuman rights, democratization and the establishment of the\nrule of law.\nThe European Union emphasizes the need for the\nGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to\ncooperate fully with the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees in order to ensure the safe\nreturn of refugees, particularly to Rwanda. We also urge the\nGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to\ncooperate fully with the United Nations in order that the\nmission investigating the allegations of massacres and other\nhuman rights violations can take place without impediment\nor delay.\nThe European Union remains seriously worried by the\nsituation in the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville) and is\nconcerned that the parties to the conflict have so far failed\nto overcome their differences. We urge all the parties\ninvolved to cease hostilities and to work together to achieve\nnational reconciliation and restore a peaceful society. We\nreiterate the Union\u2019s full support for the mediation efforts\nundertaken by President Bongo of Gabon.\nThe European Union condemns all violence in\nBurundi. It encourages the authorities of that country to\naccelerate the dismantling of the reassembly camps. We\nearnestly appeal to all parties in Burundi to embark\ndefinitively on the road towards negotiation and national\nreconciliation.\nThe European Union is also concerned by the\nworsening insecurity in Rwanda\u2019s north-western\nprovinces, which affects all populations, without\nexception.\nThe European Union welcomes the success of the\nmonitoring mission in the Central African Republic,\nestablished under the Bangui Agreements.\nThe European Union also continues to be concerned\nby the situation in Cambodia, which is likely to\njeopardize the whole democratization process and the\nmajor efforts by the international community in support\nof that country\u2019s reconstruction. We renew our support\nfor the mediation efforts by the Association of South-East\nAsian Nations and welcome the constructive constitutional\nrole played by His Majesty King Sihanouk in the search\nfor a solution to this crisis.\nWe appeal for an immediate end to all violence in\nCambodia and reiterate the importance we attach to the\nholding of free pluralist elections in 1998.\nI would like now to take up several thematic\nquestions.\nThe tragic consequences of the indiscriminate spread\nand use of anti-personnel landmines have aroused genuine\nemotion in world public opinion in recent years. In\nOctober 1996 the Union, for its part, adopted a decision\non joint action on anti-personnel landmines in which it\nexpresses its determination to achieve the aim of totally\neliminating such mines and of actively working towards\nthe earliest possible conclusion of an effective\ninternational agreement on a worldwide ban on these\nweapons.\nWe welcome the work done at the recent Oslo\nDiplomatic Conference, which resulted in the adoption of\nan international Convention. We shall also be pursuing\nthe achievement of our aims at the Conference on\nDisarmament.\nNext 10 December will see the start of celebrations\non the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. That Declaration,\nadopted on 10 December 1948, and the two international\npacts and other legal instruments on the subject that were\nsubsequently adopted, are still fully relevant today. We\nreaffirm our deep commitment to the universality of\nhuman rights and to their protection and promotion. The\nyear 1988 will provide an opportunity for all members of\n12\n\n\nthe international community to step up their actions to\nensure better implementation of the universal principles of\nthe Declaration through the instruments and machinery of\nthe United Nations.\nThe year 1998 will also be an opportunity to review\nthe implementation of the Declaration and Programme of\nAction adopted at the World Conference on Human Rights\nheld in Vienna in 1993.\nWe welcome the appointment of Mrs Mary Robinson\nas United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nShe will have our full support. We wish to underline the\nimportance of her mission, not least in the context of the\nfiftieth anniversary.\nRegarding the environment and development, the\nGeneral Assembly will be asked to endorse at this session\nthe results of the special session on the follow-up to\nAgenda 21 and of the Rio Conference. The European Union\nconsiders it essential that the implementation of Agenda 21\nreceive fresh political impetus. We believe it is imperative\nthat we come to a substantial conclusion of the negotiations\non climate change to be held in Kyoto in December. We\nurge all States to work towards that end.\nWe have proposed clear objectives for the reduction of\ngreenhouse-gas emissions, and we hope that other States\nwill very soon be making their own detailed proposals in\norder to speed up the progress that is vitally needed if the\nKyoto session of the Conference is to be a success.\nTwo years ago the Heads of State and Government\nmeeting in this Hall on the occasion of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations observed that, in a\nrapidly changing world, the objectives set out in the Charter\nhad lost none of their relevance.\nIn many regions of the planet, we still have to face up\nto serious threats to international peace and security. More\nthan ever, we need to promote economic and social\ndevelopment. It is vital that the ideals upon which our\nOrganization is founded \u2014 human rights, good governance\nand democracy \u2014 come to be reflected more and more in\nthe behaviour of public authorities and in people\u2019s everyday\nlives. The primacy of the rule of law must be reaffirmed.\nWe realize that if our Organization is to respond\nadequately to the profound changes in its external\nenvironment it must adapt its structures to the new realities\nof the modern world.\nLast July we heard the Secretary-General\u2019s ambitious\nproposals, and we welcomed them. It is not, of course, a\nquestion of rewriting the mandates of the United Nations,\nto which we remain deeply committed, but of\ntransforming the Organization into a productive and\nefficient instrument at the service of all the peoples of the\nworld.\nIn examining these proposals, at its fifty-second\nsession, the General Assembly is embarking on a period\nof debate and decision-making that promises to be one of\nthe most significant in the history of the United Nations.\nWe need an Organization that fulfils its mandate to\npreserve peace and international security more rapidly and\neffectively by building better capacities for action in the\nfields of preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and\npeacemaking, and by having more effective capacities for\naction in the areas of recovery and reconstruction after a\nconflict.\nWe need an Organization that responds better to one\nof its fundamental objectives, which consists of promoting\neconomic and social progress, eradicating poverty and\nensuring the widest possible participation in an expanding\nworld economy.\nWe need United Nations funds and programmes that\ncan translate the objectives of the Organization in the\nfield of sustainable development. They must offer the\ncountries and the peoples of the world both material\nsupport and a frame of reference that will enable them to\ngenerate their own development in the most efficient\nmanner and in a way suited to their specific needs.\nWe need a United Nations system that provides a\ncredible response to the complex problems of\nhumanitarian assistance and emergency situations,\nproblems which include conflict prevention, peacekeeping,\nrehabilitation and transition towards development.\nFinally, we need an Organization that integrates in\nall its activities the fundamental concept of respect for\nhuman rights, which is an integral part of the quest for\npeace and security, economic prosperity and social justice.\nTo attain those objectives, our Organization must be\nable to rely not only on the commitment of the Secretary-\nGeneral and the cooperation of Member States, but on the\nsupport of every sector of international society, and in\nparticular on the non-governmental organizations, whose\nefforts inspire and complement our own.\n13\n\n\nThe programme of reforms put forward by the\nSecretary-General has two parts. The first concerns the\nresponsibility of the Secretary-General himself. It\nsupplements the series of proposals he put forward in\nMarch this year. It is designed to rationalize the operations\nof Secretariat services and United Nations agencies and to\nimprove their coordination. The proposals are intended to\nmould those services into a more coherent structure. There\nis a need to establish a community of ideas, a coherence of\neffort and greater flexibility in implementing action. We\nurge the Secretary-General to implement those proposals as\nquickly as possible. The European Union considers that\nmodalities could be worked out to see that the savings\nrealized are reinvested in the field of development.\nThe second part of the programme deals with\nimproving the operation of the United Nations system and\nstrengthening its intergovernmental machinery. It requires\nthe approval of Member States. Here, too, the European\nUnion believes that the method used and the choices made\nby the Secretary-General should open the way to effective\nand far-reaching reform of the United Nations. This applies\nparticularly to the promotion of economic and social\ndevelopment, which must remain one of the priority\nobjectives of our Organization.\nIn this sector, the reform should improve the\nOrganization\u2019s capacity for action at the intergovernmental\nas well as the structural and managerial levels. In the view\nof the European Union, the reform of the United Nations,\nas an instrument in the service of development, cannot be\nconceived as a cost-cutting exercise; on the contrary, it\nmust be designed to strengthen and revitalize the\nOrganization so that it can respond to the challenges of the\nfuture in the most effective way possible. Only a reformed\nand revitalized United Nations can create the foundation for\na global partnership between developing countries,\ndeveloped countries and multilateral organizations, with the\nprime objective of achieving sustained and sustainable\ndevelopment.\nThe European Union believes that, taken as a whole,\nthe programme of reforms proposed by the Secretary-\nGeneral represents a balanced package. It attempts to take\ninto account the various interests in play and, once\nimplemented, will enable the Organization to fulfil its\nmandate more adequately and to carry out its tasks in the\nservice of the international community more effectively.\nWe therefore consider that, if we want to achieve the\nrenewal of the United Nations, it is of overriding\nimportance that the Secretary-General\u2019s proposals be\nexamined by the General Assembly in an integrated\nmanner and as a package. It is also important to abide, so\nfar as possible, by the timetable that the Secretary-\nGeneral has suggested, so that the reform measures can\nstart to be implemented at the beginning of 1998.\nThe reform programme before us affords us a unique\nopportunity to reform the Organization from top to\nbottom. It is for us, the Member States, to demonstrate\nthe necessary ambition, courage and clarity of vision to\nshow that we are equal to this challenge.\nThe European Union is well aware that the proposals\nbefore us necessarily represent a compromise between the\nsometimes divergent interests of Member States, and that\nthey cannot, therefore, fully reflect either its own views\nor those of other schools of thought within the General\nAssembly.\nBecause we believe that the programme of reforms,\ntaken as a whole, represents significant progress for our\nOrganization, the Union does not intend to press for the\nfine points of its own positions to be taken into account\nwith regard to each of the proposals or recommendations\nbefore us. It is our hope that other delegations will\napproach this exercise in a similar spirit and that they can\nagree to put the general positive thrust of the package of\nproposals before the satisfaction of their individual\ndemands.\nOver the coming weeks the European Union intends\nto play an active part in the Assembly\u2019s work. Our task\nis to reach general agreement on a feasible, constructive\nand coherent response to the Secretary-General\u2019s\nproposals, one that respects his responsibilities and his\nauthority.\nNecessary as it is, the reform exercise on which we\nhave embarked will not bear fruit until the United Nations\nhas the financial resources it needs to fulfil its mandates.\nFor several years now, the United Nations has been\nembroiled in a financial crisis, which began as a cash-\nflow problem, but which has now become structural. That\ncrisis is undermining the necessary sense of partnership\nbetween Member States and compromising\nimplementation of the Organization\u2019s programmes in\nmany areas. The European Union has often stated that the\ncrisis cannot be resolved until all Member States have\nagreed to meet their obligations under the United Nations\nCharter in full by settling their arrears and by paying on\ntime and without conditions the full amount of their\n14\n\n\nmandatory contributions to the Organization\u2019s regular\nbudget and to the budget of peacekeeping operations.\nThe States members of the European Union, whose\ncontributions represent 35 per cent of the regular budget\nand 38 per cent of the peacekeeping budget, have always\nhonoured their financial obligations promptly, fully and\nunconditionally.\nThe European Union has put forward a package of\ncoherent proposals designed to put the Organization on a\nsound and predictable financial footing. They relate to\nmeasures to speed up the payment of arrears, to tighten up\nthe system for paying contributions, to monitor United\nNations spending more closely and to reform the scale of\nassessment so as to better reflect the principle of ability to\npay.\nIt is important that together, at this fifty-second\nsession of the General Assembly, we find a constructive\nand viable solution to these questions, which are\nfundamental if we wish to ensure that our Organization has\nthe capacity to fulfil its mandate at the dawn of the twenty-\nfirst century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am pleased to\nconvey the congratulations of the Zambian delegation to\nHis Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on his election\nas President of the fifty-second session of the United\nNations General Assembly. This session is especially\nimportant in that it is meant to give impetus to the\nongoing negotiations on the future structure of the United\nNations through the reform process. We are confident that\n19\n\n\nwith his proven diplomatic skills he will steer the\ndeliberations of this session to a successful conclusion.\nFor his predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail of\nMalaysia, my delegation has only words of admiration and\ngratitude for the exemplary work he did during the past\nsession of the General Assembly.\nI wish to express my delegation\u2019s satisfaction with the\nskilful manner in which the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, has managed the affairs of the Organization since\nhis election last year. Zambia is confident that, given his\ntested managerial and diplomatic skills, he will effectively\nmanage this Organization as it deals with critical issues\nconfronting the international community today.\nAt the fiftieth session, world leaders gathered here to\ncelebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the\nUnited Nations. In celebrating the occasion, we took time\nto assess the contribution of the United Nations to world\npeace, economic and social development, and the\nobservance of fundamental human rights, and we reaffirmed\nour faith in the Organization and agreed to vigorously live\nup to the objectives of the Charter by strengthening and\nrevitalizing the United Nations system.\nIt is against this background that my delegation\nbelieves that the current session of the General Assembly\nshould seize the opportunity to advance the reform process\nfurther. In this regard, it is Zambia\u2019s conviction that a\ncomprehensive approach to United Nations reform would,\napart from improving efficiency and effectiveness, ensure\nthe implementation of the programmes of action of the\nglobal conferences of the 1990s \u2014 from Rio to Cairo;\nCopenhagen to Beijing and Istanbul \u2014 which underscored\nthe importance of sustainable development and made it a\ncentral theme and a priority. These conferences provided a\nstarting point for a global effort in advancing sustainable\ndevelopment, set goals and defined broad plans of action\nthat provided the basis on which national and international\nactions could proceed.\nWhile we have agreed on the necessity of reforming\nour Organization, it is important to ask ourselves what we\nwant to achieve through these reforms. In principle, Zambia\nwelcomes and has carefully studied the Secretary-General\u2019s\nproposals and measures on the negotiations for reform of\nthe United Nations. My delegation expects that the reform\nprocess would not only result in a more democratic,\nefficient, effective and financially stable United Nations, but\nalso have a significant impact on economic and social\ndevelopment. Zambia would like to see the development\nmandate of the United Nations given priority and\nprominence in these reforms.\nRelated to this reform process is the pressing issue\nof the critical financial situation of the United Nations. It\nis our view that this state of affairs is the major limiting\nfactor undermining the ability of the United Nations to\ndeal adequately with its mandates in many areas. We\nwould therefore like to see arrears owed to the\nOrganization paid in full, on time and without\npreconditions.\nOne of the key components of the reforms of the\nUnited Nations is the reform of the Security Council. We\ndemand that the expansion of the Security Council make\nit more representative and more democratic. This\nexpansion should be at both permanent and non-\npermanent levels of membership. In this regard, my\ndelegation wishes to state categorically its support for the\nposition adopted by the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) and the Non-Aligned Movement that the expanded\nSecurity Council should have 26 members.\nZambia further supports the demand that the regions\nof Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean\nnow deserve seats as permanent members on an expanded\nSecurity Council. Africa, commanding nearly 30 per cent\nof the membership of the United Nations, certainly\ndeserves to have two permanent and three non-permanent\nseats on the Security Council.\nMy delegation reaffirms its commitment to general\nand complete disarmament. In this spirit, we would also\nlike to welcome the recent agreement reached in Oslo.\nNorway, to ban anti-personnel landmines. We hope that\nall countries of the world will be able to sign the\nagreement in December this year in Ottawa.\nInternational peace and security also continues to be\nthreatened by conflicts around the globe. Africa, in\nparticular, has witnessed many civil wars whose\nconsequences have been devastating.\nZambia continues to be concerned about the conflicts\nin the Great Lakes region of Central Africa, the Republic\nof Congo, Sudan and elsewhere on the continent. We\nwould like to appeal to the parties to these conflicts to\ncommit themselves to the principle of negotiated and\npeaceful settlement of disputes. We call upon the\ninternational community to provide all necessary\nassistance for resolving these conflicts at an early stage.\n20\n\n\nIn Angola, the civil war has caused some of the worst\nhuman suffering. As host to the talks that led to the signing\nof the Lusaka Protocol, Zambia has a firm desire to ensure\nthat there is lasting peace and security in Angola. However,\nZambia is disappointed at the failure of the Uni\u00e3o Nacional\npara a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola (UNITA) to comply\nwith its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol and the\nprovisions of relevant Security Council resolutions. Zambia\nwould like to record its displeasure at UNITA\u2019s\nintransigence.\nZambia, together with the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC) and other countries, will\ncontinue its efforts to promote conditions leading to the\nestablishment of lasting peace and security in Angola. We\nbelieve that peace in Angola will enlarge the parameters of\npeace in southern Africa, which will enable the countries of\nthe region to concentrate their efforts on social and\neconomic development in an environment of democracy.\nZambia reaffirms the position of the OAU with regard\nto the situation in Sierra Leone. In this regard, we appeal\nto the international community to continue to deny\nrecognition to the military junta in Sierra Leone. We\ndemand that the junta hand power back to the\ndemocratically elected Government of Sierra Leone.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo has just\nemerged from a seven-month civil war. We are delighted\nthat the country has now begun to turn its attention to the\nchallenges of reconstruction and development. We thus\nappeal to the international community to unconditionally\nassist the new administration in that country in facilitating\nrehabilitation of infrastructure and capacity-building to\nconsolidate the political and economic stability of the\ncountry.\nWe congratulate the people of Liberia on finding\npeace through the democratic process and also take this\nopportunity to pay tribute to the Economic Community of\nWest African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) for the\ncommendable role it has played in resolving the Liberian\nconflict.\nRegarding peacekeeping in Africa, we believe that\nAfrica has the primary responsibility for resolving the\nconflicts on our continent. It is precisely for this reason that\nthe Organization of African Unity established the\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\nResolution, which we hope the international community\nwill fully support.\nOn the economic front, Zambia is gratified to note\nthat sub-Saharan Africa has begun to record positive\ngrowth rates, which averaged 5 per cent in 1996, the\nhighest level in 20 years. Much of this success is\nattributable to the social and economic reforms\nundertaken by many African countries. However, this\npositive achievement can be sustained only if poverty,\ndeprivation and marginalization are effectively addressed.\nAnother factor that continues to constrain efforts for\nsustainable development in many African countries,\nincluding my own, is the heavy external debt burden.\nZambia welcomes the steps taken by the International\nMonetary Fund and the World Bank to implement the\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. We are,\nhowever, gravely concerned about the uncertainties\nsurrounding the funding for the Initiative. We also remain\nconcerned about the proliferation of conditions, in\nparticular the use of non-economic factors in determining\naccess to the Initiative.\nZambia believes that the United Nations has a duty\nto provide leadership in forging international consensus\non the crippling external debt problem of developing\ncountries and assisting in the mobilization of new\nresources for development financing. It is also our\nexpectation that the United Nations will provide\nleadership in redressing the widening development\ndisparities existing among nations, and addressing the\nincreasing trends towards unfair trading practices and\nprotectionism in international trade, which have had the\neffect of marginalizing some regions, notably Africa.\nZambia is very concerned about the continued\ndecline in official development assistance at a time when\nthe United Nations is dealing with follow-up to recent\ninternational conferences on development. There is also\nincreasing evidence of lack of enthusiasm for honouring\nagreements freely entered into at international\nconferences. A case in point is the failure by\nGovernments to implement the agreements, commitments\nand recommendations made at the 1992 United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development.\nThe special session of the General Assembly held\nthis past June to review progress in implementation of the\nRio agreements found that the rate of implementation of\nthe programme of action has been extremely slow, mainly\ndue to lack of resources. It was also evident that there\nwas a marked lack of political will to ensure the\nfulfilment of the agreements of the Rio consensus on\nenvironment and development. Zambia would therefore\n21\n\n\nlike to see, during this session of the General Assembly,\nprogress on the proposal to convene an international\nconference on the financing of development. As we all are\naware, there has been little progress on this proposal since\nthe forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, when it\nemerged.\nOn the domestic front, we in Zambia have adopted\nnational programmes of action in pursuit of the goals and\nobjectives of the Copenhagen World Summit on Social\nDevelopment, the Cairo Conference on Population and\nDevelopment and the Beijing Declaration. In implementing\nthese programmes of action, my Government has targeted\nthe most vulnerable members of our society to enhance the\ncapacity of their involvement in the country\u2019s economic and\nsocial life, with a view to raising their standards of living.\nIn this regard, the Government has taken steps to ensure\nthat there is equitable access to quality education by all\nZambians by providing universal basic education within the\nshortest realistic time-frame. A comprehensive programme\nof health reforms is also under way, and this should also\nresult in the improvement of the health status of our people.\nThe measures and programmes that the Government has\nundertaken are not, however, sufficient to fully attain the\nobjectives of these programmes of action, mainly due to\nlimited financial resources.\nWe wish to conclude by underscoring the continuing\nrelevance of the United Nations. The case for reform has\nbeen made. We owe it to ourselves and to future\ngenerations to ensure that we apply ourselves to the task of\nreform, knowing well that the world needs a United Nations\nthat can be relied upon to act effectively in ensuring peace\nand security, and in achieving international cooperation in\nthe economic, social, cultural and humanitarian fields, as\nenvisaged in the Charter of the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset to congratulate the\nPresident wholeheartedly on his election to the presidency\nof the fifty-second session of the General Assembly of the\nUnited Nations. I am especially pleased at the election of\na distinguished representative of Ukraine, a country which\nis a neighbour and friend of the Republic of Moldova, to\nthis important post. After declaring their independence six\nyears ago, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine worked to\ncreate prosperous and democratic societies. I am convinced\nthat the President, with his great skills and with the support\nof all the Member States, will be able to discharge with\ndistinction this lofty mission which has been entrusted to\nhim during this crucial period for the United Nations.\nI would also like to express my appreciation for the\ncontribution made by Mr. Razali Ismail in his capacity as\nPresident during the previous session. I wish also to express\nour gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\nhis efforts to reform this global Organization.\nIt is my honour and privilege to address the General\nAssembly for the first time, and I would like to convey a\nmessage of friendship and solidarity from the people of the\nRepublic of Moldova.\nMy country, which is very much devoted to the ideals\nof the Charter of the United Nations, strongly supports the\nreform process of the United Nations. That is why we have\ntaken note with interest of the reform programme proposed\nby the Secretary-General. This package of proposals is\ndesigned to achieve a reform in order to deal better with\nthe challenges of the coming millennium. We have\nwelcomed such initiatives and we support them.\nIt is clear that the reform of the United Nations can\nmove forward only if the financial crisis of the\nOrganization is settled. There is no doubt that Member\nStates must fulfil their financial obligations on time and in\nfull. At the same time, it is indeed necessary to reform the\nsystem for the payment of contributions in order to achieve\na fair assessment, one that better takes into account the\nprinciple of capacity to pay of each country. For our part,\nwe will spare no effort to honour our financial obligations.\nThe Republic of Moldova fully supports the efforts of\nthe United Nations to maintain international peace and\nsecurity. In the five years since our country was admitted\nto membership in the United Nations, we have co-\nsponsored several resolutions in this important field of\nactivity.\nIn the field of disarmament, last year the delegation\nof the Republic of Moldova likewise voted in favour of\nthe adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty. Consequently, I am pleased to report that on 24\nSeptember I signed this important Treaty on the complete\nban on nuclear testing. We are convinced that the\nimplementation of this Treaty can enhance international\nsecurity.\nThe Republic of Moldova also supports the efforts\nof the international community to limit the use of and\nultimately to eliminate certain conventional weapons\nwhich have injurious and indiscriminate effects, including\nanti-personnel landmines. We are ready to contribute to\nthe efforts being made to obtain these objectives.\nThe positive developments which have characterized\nthe activity of the Organization in recent years have\nbrought about certain concepts and the diversification of\nmechanisms for action in the field of international peace\nand security. Some of these mechanisms could be\nimplemented soon. Perhaps I need not stress here the\nusefulness and benefits of the United Nations standby\nforces, which all Member States welcome. Yet, I wish to\nemphasize that the Republic of Moldova would like to\ncontribute to this system and that last year our\nGovernment expressed its readiness to take part in the\nUnited Nations standby forces. That is why my country\nintends to provide to the United Nations Secretariat as\nsoon as possible information concerning contingents and\nequipment which are available for this purpose.\nMoreover, the Republic of Moldova is considering\nthe possibility of taking part in United Nations\npeacekeeping operations. We believe that our country has\nalready accumulated a certain amount of experience in\nthis field through its participation in a variety of\ninternational manoeuvres.\nMilitant separatism has become one of the main\nthreats to international peace and security after the cold\nwar period. Totalitarian regimes have engendered ethnic\nconflicts and frictions in certain countries of Central and\nEastern Europe. Some conflicts are rooted in age-old\nanimosities. Others, as is the case in the conflict involving\nthe Republic of Moldova which broke out five years ago,\nare inspired by and supported from the outside, in order\nto recreate a form of by-gone domination.\nThis is the reason why I would like to emphasize the\nfact that the recent separatist trends which have appeared\nin the newly independent States who are Members of the\n29\n\n\nUnited Nations have nothing in common with the legitimate\naspiration of peoples to achieve self-determination. In our\nview, attempts to construe the right to self-determination as\nthe right of an ethnic or national community to establish its\nown government and to splinter off are real dangers to\ninternational and regional security. Moreover, the right to\nself-determination is treated in the Charter of the United\nNations as a principle which cannot serve to justify the\nviolation of the principle of the independence and territorial\nintegrity of a State. Nevertheless, it is imperative to define\nthis principle of self-determination more precisely in order\nto avoid any subjective interpretations.\nIt is quite clear that the stability of small and large\nStates hinges on a number of factors, such as the rule of\nlaw, respect for human rights, democracy and economic\ndevelopment. Our Government is therefore striving to\nestablish an equitable social system based on the respect for\nthe dignity of the human person. And yet, the process of\neconomic reform, with all its inherent problems, is retarding\nthe achievement of these objectives.\nThe high social costs of transition are felt throughout\nsociety. Despite all of these difficulties, we are nevertheless\ndetermined to continue the process of economic reform. We\nrely on the support of developed countries, the United\nNations and other international agencies and organizations\nduring this decisive moment in the reform of our country.\nI take this opportunity to express the gratitude of the people\nand Government of my country to those States and\ninternational institutions which have supported the\nstrengthening of democracy and market-economy\nmechanisms in our Republic. Furthermore, I note with\nsatisfaction that my country has made progress in building\nits civil society and in establishing democratic institutions.\nNevertheless, it is a paradox that under such\nfavourable conditions we have not succeeded in achieving\na final settlement of the conflict which broke out in the\nsummer of 1992. Yet, the authorities of the Republic of\nMoldova endeavour to find pragmatic solutions in order to\nmaintain the integrity of the country.\nFollowing negotiations with the leaders of the\nseparatist region, and with the mediation of the Russian\nFederation, Ukraine and the mission of the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, an agreement was\nreached between the parties involved with regard to the\ngeneral principles of the settlement of the dispute. A\nmemorandum was likewise signed on the normalization of\nrelations between the authorities of the Republic of\nMoldova and the Transdnestrian region.\nAt the same time, the Presidents of Ukraine and the\nRussian Federation and the Chairman-in-Office of the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE) signed a joint Declaration emphasizing the\nimportance of the parties' commitment in the\nmemorandum to conduct their relations in the context of\nthe existing borders of the country by granting special\nstatus to the eastern region of the Republic of Moldova.\nIn view of the provisions of the memorandum, an ad\nhoc commission was established to negotiate the legal\nstatus of the Transdniester region. To our regret,\nnegotiations in the Commission are deadlocked because\nof the intransigent and highly politicized position taken by\nthe Transdniester side. Therefore, no mutually acceptable\nsolution has been found on the key elements for resolving\nthe dispute, namely, the legal definition of the status of\nTransdniester and the powers of the parties during the\ntransitional period. In opposing the provisions of the\naccord, the Transdniester side insists on a settlement\nwhich runs counter to the Constitution of the Republic of\nMoldova and is prejudicial to the principle of sovereignty\nover the territory of the country. Despite the commitments\nthey assumed by signing the memorandum, the separatist\nleaders have, exceeding their power, enacted certain\nunconstitutional laws establishing a so-called customs\nborder in Transdniester and a \u201ccommission for the\ndelimitation of the State border in the region\u201d. In\naddition, a series of unlawful acts have been committed\nin the area controlled by the peacekeeping forces.\nI must therefore emphasize that it is vital to ensure\nmore active mediation by the Russian Federation, Ukraine\nand the OSCE mission, as well as stronger action by the\ninternational community, led by the United Nations. I\nshould like to say the conflict in Transdniester could\ndestabilize the political and military situation, and\nthreatens subregional and regional peace and security. We\nknow that the separatist regime in Transdniester is\nsupported by a powerful paramilitary force having the\nmost modern weapons, obtained from the equipment\navailable to forces of the Russian Federation illegally\nstationed on our territory. At the same time, the leaders\nof those opposed to constitutional authority are trying to\nobtain weapons belonging to the Russian military forces,\nwhile opposing the complete withdrawal of the troops of\nthe Russian Federation and their weapons. It must\ntherefore be pointed out that disarming and breaking up\nthe Transdniester paramilitary groups is as important as\nthe withdrawal of Russian troops.\nBoth those processes must be monitored by\ninternational observers. We have reached the conclusion\nthat an immediate and effective solution to this conflict\n30\n\n\nrequires more active involvement by international bodies as\nwell as the countries of the region and even the major\nPowers. We are awaiting such involvement, for our recent\nexperience demonstrates that all attempts made by the\nauthorities of the Republic of Moldova to settle the conflict\nin the Transdniester region through dialogue and\nnegotiations have failed. The interests of the separatist\nleaders are subordinate to other interests, entirely political,\ngoing beyond our national context.\nThere is a danger that the conflict will continue\nindefinitely. We believe that the problem of the eastern\nregion of the Republic of Moldova could already have been\nresolved by peaceful means and in a civilized fashion if the\nseparatist regime did not receive strong support from\noutside. More often than not such support has been given\ndeliberately, for reasons of geopolitical interests, but\nsometimes the separatists in the eastern region of the\nRepublic of Moldova have received unintentional, indirect\nsupport through the unlawful trade activities of companies\nand firms in developed countries. We hope that the\nGovernments of countries where certain undertakings are\ngiving political and technical support to the separatist\nregime in Transdniester will put an end to such activity.\nThese actions can no longer be tolerated for they constitute\nipso facto direct interference in the internal affairs of the\nRepublic of Moldova.\nThe illegal stationing of military contingents of the\nRussian Federation on the territory of my country\ncontinues. The deadline set by the 1994 Moldovan-Russian\nAgreement on the withdrawal of Russian troops from the\nterritory is 21 October 1997. The fact that for three years\nthe State Duma, unlike our Parliament, has failed to ratify\nthe Agreement cannot be excused or explained. We have\nbeen assured on several occasions, at the highest level, that\nthe question of the withdrawal of troops will be settled, and\nit is regrettable that this problem remains unresolved.\nWe understand, of course, that the failure to ratify the\n1994 Accord by the State Duma entails legal complications\nfor the Russian Government. However, we believe that the\ntime has come to find a solution to the question of troop\nwithdrawal. In accordance with the principles of\ninternational law, no foreign army can be stationed on the\nterritory of another State without its free consent. In\naddition, international organizations, particularly the OSCE,\nstrongly support the unconditional, immediate, orderly and\ncomplete withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of\nthe Republic of Moldova. Finally, Russia's admission to the\nCouncil of Europe as a fully fledged member, was\nconditional on the timely withdrawal of its troops from the\nterritory of the Republic of Moldova.\nWe believe that the political forces in the State\nDuma opposing troop withdrawal will also be sensitive to\nthe legal commitments of the Russian Federation. We\nhope that the removal of armaments and the withdrawal\nof troops from the territory of the Republic of Moldova\nwill be speeded up and completed as soon as possible.\nThis course would certainly serve the interests of both\ncountries and would properly reflect the high level\nreached in the development of relations between the\nRepublic of Moldova and the Russian Federation.\nIn conclusion, I express the fervent hope that the\nwork of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly\nwill take place in a climate of solidarity, with a realistic\nand constructive approach to the complex problems facing\nthe world at the end of this century. My delegation, like\nthose of other Member States, is ready to make its\ncontribution to achieve the purposes of the United\nNations."

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me impart at the\noutset the sad news I received early today of the aerial\nbombardment by the Taliban of the city of Mazar-i-\nSharif, the sixteenth consecutive bombardment in just two\ndays. These bombardments have taken as many as 150\nlives among the civilian population of the city, mostly\nwomen and children. I express outrage and condemnation\nat this cowardly act of terror, which typifies the Taliban\u2019s\ngross violation of international humanitarian law and their\nrelentless belligerence against every norm recognized by\nthe world today.\nI stand before the Assembly and the world\ncommunity in the tradition of past Afghan\nrepresentatives \u2014 with the exception of those during the\nyears of occupation \u2014 representing an independent,\nsovereign and non-aligned Afghanistan.\nOne year ago, our Foreign Minister, the late Abdul\nRahim Ghafoorzai, stood on this podium to explain the\ndark and ominous movement known as the Taliban,\nwhich \u2014 backed by foreign forces \u2014 had invaded\nAfghanistan. Tragically, Mr. Ghafoorzai died in the\n19\n\n\nservice of his nation. So today it is my duty to stand before\nthe Assembly to explain the struggle the Afghan people\nhave waged against these mercenaries.\nWhen the Taliban entered Kabul on 27 September\n1996 their first act was to storm the United Nations\ncomplex. The past 12 months have seen a seemingly\nendless series of edicts issued by the Taliban in areas of\nAfghanistan that they claim to control. Under those edicts,\nthey have in fact imprisoned every woman and terrorized\nevery man.\nTheir latest ignominious act has been to arrest Emma\nBonino, the European Union Commissioner for\nHumanitarian Affairs, her aides and a group of visiting\ninternational journalists, including CNN\u2019s Christiane\nAmanpour. Outraged by the Taliban\u2019s act, the German\nForeign Minister, Mr. Klaus Kinkel, said that he considered\nit a slap in the face and an act of \u201ccynical disregard for the\nentire European Union\u201d. The group was eventually released,\nbut not before at least two of its members were beaten with\nthe butt of a Kalashnikov rifle. Ms. Bonino told Reuters\nthat the experience had given her a taste of what Afghans\ngo through every day under the Taliban.\n\u201cThis is an example of what people here go\nthrough every day: in a situation of random terror.\u201d\n[Reuters News Wire, \u201cEC commissioner released by\nTaleban,\u201d 29 September 1997]\nAn Afghan quoted in The New York Times of 24\nSeptember 1997 stated,\n\u201cMost days I wake up thinking we\u2019d all be better off\ndead than under these fanatics.\u201d\nThese are just a couple of facts to open a small window\nonto the gloom and despair facing our people.\nAs this terror continues in Afghanistan, we are here\ntoday to discuss the Afghan question, which is now an\ninternational issue.\nAs the crisis in Afghanistan continues to unfold, we\nmust ask \u2014 and answer \u2014 important questions, questions\nto be answered particularly by those who, under the guise\nof neutrality, equate the aggressors with the victims of\naggression. Those questions are: Who is following the rules\nof the civilized world? Whose actions warrant recognition?\nWho deserves to participate in civilized discussion at a\nglobal level?\nOn the battlefield, we continue, of course, to defend\nourselves and our nation. In this imposed war, we are\ntaking what we consider to be the moral high ground of\nnegotiation and dialogue.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan \u2014 like many\nothers in the world, including some prominent Pakistani\npoliticians and commentators \u2014 still identifies Pakistani\nintervention and interference in the internal affairs of\nAfghanistan as the root cause of the prolonged conflict\nand the subsequent suffering of our people.\nPakistan constantly alleges that the Taliban control\ntwo thirds of Afghanistan, including Kabul, where peace\nprevails. Mr. William Maley, the renowned Australian\nexpert on Afghanistan, stated earlier in the year that the\nTaliban brought peace to Kabul in the same sense that\nHitler brought peace to Warsaw.\nOn 7 August 1997, Mr. Gohar Ayub Khan, the\nForeign Minister of Pakistan, said:\n\u201cIn Afghanistan ... the majority in the country is\nPakhtoons, who are 60 per cent. The other groups,\nincluding Uzbeks, Tajiks, Hazaras and Ismailis\ncollectively, constitute about 40 per cent.\u201d\nThe Pakistani Foreign Minister is blatantly inventing\nfraudulent statistics to fuel the flames of ethnic hatred and\nconflict in Afghanistan and to justify Pakistani objectives.\nNo valid statistics could claim that any ethnic group in\nAfghanistan \u2014 Pakhtoon, Tajik, Uzbek or other \u2014\nconstituted more than 37 per cent of the population. If\nPakistan continues its irresponsible policy of perpetrating\nethnic hatred in Afghanistan, a consequential escalation of\n\u201cethnic cleansing\u201d will threaten the national unity of our\ncountry.\nPakistan maintains that it has no favourites in\nAfghanistan. The reality is that the Pakistani\nestablishment has designated one group of Afghans to be\nthe natural rulers over all the rest and conceivably to turn\nAfghanistan into a subservient protectorate State.\nThe reality was best expressed by Fred Halliday, an\ninternational affairs specialist at the London School of\nEconomics, who wrote last November:\n\u201cThe capture by Taliban guerrillas of the\nAfghan capital, Kabul, however short- or long-lived,\nhas come after two years of one of the most\nobnoxious interventions by one State in the affairs of\n20\n\n\nanother in many years. Reported in the West as an\nindigenous struggle, in fact Pakistan set up the Taliban\nas a semi-regular fighting force in 1994 ... providing\nthem with ... guns, money, fuel and technical support\n... Since its creation in 1947, Pakistan has harboured\nthe goal of dominating its northern neighbour.\u201d [The\nNation, \u201cKabul\u2019s Patriarchy with Guns\u201d, 11 November\n1996, p. 19]\nAnd, finally, the Pakistani Government, by proposing\nthe dubious \u201cvacant-seat\u201d formula for Afghanistan, strives\nto expel from the United Nations a country that has been a\nmember of this global body since before the birth of\nPakistan.\nMy delegation is grateful to the Secretary-General, Mr.\nKofi Annan, for having summarized the tragic situation in\nAfghanistan in his address to the fifty-second session of the\nGeneral Assembly on 22 September 1997.\nAccording to General Assembly resolution 51/195 B,\nwhich was adopted unanimously on 17 December 1996, and\nfully supported by the Islamic State of Afghanistan, the\nAssembly is\n\u201cStrongly committed to the sovereignty,\nindependence, territorial integrity and national unity of\nAfghanistan\u201d. [resolution 51/195 B, seventh\npreambular paragraph]\nThe General Assembly also stressed\n\u201cthe importance of non-intervention and non-\ninterference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan\u201d.\n[ibid., sixteenth preambular paragraph]\nUnfortunately, since last year the supply of weapons and\nammunition from abroad has massively increased and\nconstitutes a very important programme of action by the\npowerful Pakistani intelligence service, Inter-Service\nIntelligence (ISI).\nThe situation has also worsened with regard to what\nthe resolution called\n\u201cactions undermining the security of State frontiers,\nincluding the growing illicit traffic in arms and\nnarcotics by criminal elements and groups from\n[Taliban occupied] areas of Afghanistan and ... the use\nof [occupied] Afghan territory for the training and\nharbouring of terrorists\u201d. [ibid., eighteenth preambular\nparagraph]\nIt is amazing that some of the countries that consider\nterrorism a threat to peace should nonetheless \u2014 while\nclaiming impartiality \u2014 favour the rejectionist Taliban by\nequating them with the Government of the Islamic State\nof Afghanistan, which shares the mounting concerns of\nthe General Assembly in this matter.\nWith regard to the peace process, we share the view\nthat\n\u201cthe main responsibility for finding a political\nsolution to the conflict lies with the Afghan parties\u201d.\n[ibid., paragraph 2]\nThe Taliban, however, favoured, encouraged and assisted\nby the cross-border political and military support,\nconsider their only responsibility to be the waging of an\naggressive war aimed at conquering the whole of Afghan\nterritory by crushing all resistance movements.\nThe Taliban\u2019s intransigence and disregard for United\nNations General Assembly and Security Council\nresolutions calling for a peaceful settlement of the Afghan\nproblem are a fact well known to the international\ncommunity. The report of the Secretary-General dated 16\nMarch 1997 indicates that:\n\u201cThe Taliban, judging both from their words and\nfrom their activities on the ground, appear\ndetermined to gain military and political control of\nthe whole of Afghanistan and to establish their\nvision of an Islamic State\u201d. [A/51/838, paragraph 7]\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s report (A/51/929) of\n16 June 1997 equally illustrates Taliban\u2019s choice of the\nmilitary option and its intention to overrun the country by\nforce. This utterly bellicose position of the Taliban, while\nprolonging the suffering of the Afghan people is\naggravating the concerns of the countries in the region,\nwhich views it as a serious threat to the region\u2019s peace\nand security. It is worth mentioning that the Taliban\u2019s\naggressive attitude is encouraged by military intelligence\nservices of neighbouring Pakistan, which still hopes to\ninstall a puppet regime in Kabul, subservient to its\nexpansionist and hegemonic desires. The dull-minded\ninterventionists should read the history of Afghanistan\nonce again and learn from the defeat of previous\naggressors in this homeland of dauntless and courageous\npeople.\nWe are fully aware\n21\n\n\n\u201cthat a cessation of armed hostilities ... and political\nstability are indispensable if reconstruction measures\nare to have a lasting effect\u201d. (Resolution 51/195 A,\neighth preambular paragraph)\nThe Taliban have expressed no interest in the urgently\nneeded reconstruction of the country. In fact, starvation by\nblockade is their favourite weapon against Afghans.\nWe express our full\n\u201csupport for the continuing efforts of the United\nNations Special Mission to Afghanistan\u201d (Resolution\n51/195 B, thirteenth preambular paragraph)\nled by Mr. Norbert Holl, and the special assignment on\n30 July 1997 of Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi as Special\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General to assess the situation and\nthe role of the United Nations in Afghanistan.\nWe reaffirm the full support of our Government for\nthe\n\u201cactivities of the United Nations Special Mission to\nAfghanistan, in facilitating ... in cooperation with\n[neighbouring and] interested States and international\norganizations, the political process towards the goals\nof national reconciliation and a lasting political\nsettlement with the participation of all parties to the\nconflict\u201d. (ibid., paragraph 5)\nBecause of the shortage of time, I am omitting some\nparagraphs from my prepared text.\nThe Taliban have refused to negotiate any political\nsettlement and have insisted on a unilateral military\nsolution.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan honours\n\u201cits commitments regarding the safety and full\nfreedom of movement of United Nations personnel, in\nparticular the personnel of the United Nations Special\nMission, as well as the security of their premises in\nAfghanistan.\u201d (ibid., paragraph 7)\nRecently, however, as a result of the disturbances\nbrought about on 14 September 1997 by Taliban\ninfiltration, the premises belonging to international aid\nagencies and non-governmental organizations in the city of\nMazar-i-Sharif were plundered. This city was previously a\nhaven of peace and security. The Islamic State of\nAfghanistan remains committed to the safety of the\nUnited Nations personnel and the personnel of other aid\nagencies in Afghanistan.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan, in the light of the\nmounting needs of the Afghan people, appeals to all\ndonor agencies not to abandon Afghanistan, particularly\nin the face of the upcoming harsh winter.\nSecurity Council document S/1997/588 of\n25 July 1997 explains the Islamic State of Afghanistan\u2019s\nagreement to a Declaration of the United National and\nIslamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan, the\nfoundation for an enlarged body representing all ethnic\ngroups from all over Afghanistan. The Declaration\naddresses an appeal in favour of the peace process to the\nTaliban and the Pakistani Government.\nWe favour\n\u201cAn immediate and durable ceasefire among the\nAfghan parties, to be supervised by a commission\ncomposed of representatives of all the warring\nparties, facilitated by the United Nations\u201d. (ibid.,\nparagraph 8)\nOne of the most important elements in the General\nAssembly and Security Council resolutions on\nAfghanistan is the call for\n\u201cdemilitarization of Kabul, with adequate safeguards\nto ensure security and public order\u201d. (ibid.)\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan considers this point to\nbe very important. It could constitute a credible precedent\nthat could be applied in the future in other parts of the\ncountry.\nThe\n\u201cestablishment of a broad-based and fully\nrepresentative authoritative council\u201d (ibid.)\nas required by the General Assembly resolution, will be\nfeasible if the appeal of the United Front inviting the\nTaliban to join the Front is heard. The Islamic State of\nAfghanistan, in this regard, extends its full cooperation to\nthe United Nations. It is imperative to secure the\nagreement of the Taliban with the United Nations and to\nensure its full cooperation with such a broad-based\nauthoritative council.\n22\n\n\nWe are ready to cooperate for the creation of\n\u201ca national security force to provide for security\nthroughout the country and oversee the demobilization\nof all the warring parties through the collection and\nsafeguarding of all heavy weapons in the country, and\nto stop the flow of arms and of equipment related to\narms production to the parties\u201d. (ibid.)\nWe are grateful to the leaders and Governments of the\ncentral Asian republics of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and\nTurkmenistan for their respective proposed peace initiatives,\nas well as to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Apart from\nsupplementing each other, these initiatives may be\ncoordinated so as to lead to the convening of useful\nnegotiations with a specific agenda under the auspices of\nthe United Nations. The proposals, however, thus far have\nnot been accepted by the Taliban.\nThe General Assembly deplored\n\u201cthe civilian casualties inflicted by the indiscriminate\nuse of landmines.\u201d (ibid., paragraph 11)\nThe Taliban have recently spread landmines in and around\nthe northern city of Kunduz. This is only one example of\nTaliban mass use of landmines.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan shares the General\nAssembly\u2019s deep concern over and denunciation of\n\u201cthe discrimination against women and girls and other\nrecurring abuses of human rights in Afghanistan ...\nemphasizing the importance of democracy and of the\nrealization of human rights in any future political\nprocess in Afghanistan\u201d. (ibid., ninth preambular\nparagraph)\nMr. Lloyd Axworthy, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of\nCanada, said in his statement of 25 September in this\nAssembly:\n\u201cCanadian women, appalled at the treatment of their\nsisters in Afghanistan, have started a letter-writing\ncampaign. I will be delivering some 5,000 letters\ntoday to the Secretary-General, which call on him to\ntake the lead in exposing the gross human rights\nviolations of women in Afghanistan as unacceptable in\nthe eyes of the world\u2019s citizens.\u201d [See Official\nRecords of the General Assembly, Fifty-second\nSession, Plenary Meetings, 12th meeting]\nWe draw the attention of the General Assembly to\nthe recent document (A/52/384) containing the\nDeclaration of Principles made by the United Islamic and\nNational Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan, adopted\non 20 September 1997 by the Islamic State of\nAfghanistan. The Declaration, systematizing a political\nframework for the country, contains the following\nprinciples: first, the principle of Islam; secondly, the\nprinciple of independence and international cooperation;\nthirdly, the principles of democracy and pluralism;\nfourthly, the principles of election and delegation of\nauthority to local administration; and, fifthly, the principle\nof human rights.\nThe General Assembly last year called on\n\u201call States strictly to refrain from any outside\ninterference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan,\nincluding the involvement of foreign military\npersonnel\u201d. (Resolution 51/195 B, paragraph 15)\nRegarding the involvement of Pakistani military personnel\nin Afghanistan, the Government of the Islamic State of\nAfghanistan has transmitted amply documented\ninformation to the United Nations.\nThe book, entitled The Not-So-Hidden Hand \u2014\nproduced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the\nIslamic State of Afghanistan \u2014 has been distributed to\nthe members of the Security Council, some other\ninterested countries and the Secretariat of the United\nNations. This book \u2014 I will not go through it; it is a big\nbook \u2014 documents directly and proves the physical\npresence of Pakistani paramilitary and military personnel\ninside Afghanistan, fighting alongside the Taliban against\nthe Islamic State of Afghanistan.\nThe book includes, first, identification photos of\neach Pakistani captive, prisoner registration forms with\ndetailed descriptions, fingerprints and other data\npertaining to each; secondly, identification cards taken\nfrom some prisoners that illustrate their membership in\nextremist Pakistani organizations responsible for terrorist\nacts in South Asia, such as Anjuman-i-Sipah-e-Sahaba\nPakistan; and thirdly, correspondence from most of the\nprisoners to their families in Pakistan, written mostly in\nUrdu \u2014 the official Pakistani language, which is not\nspoken in Afghanistan.\nI should like to remind the Assembly that on 3 July\n1997 Mr. Francis Okelo, the Deputy Head of the United\nNations Special Mission to Afghanistan, together with a\n23\n\n\nUnited Nations military adviser, paid a visit to Maimana\nprison in northern Afghanistan and verified the physical\npresence of Pakistani military prisoners in the prison. And\nThe News of 6 September 1997 \u2014 printed in Islamabad \u2014\ncontains an article entitled \u201cPakistanis in Masood\u2019s captivity\nplead for release\u201d.\nThe General Assembly called upon all States\nimmediately to end the supply of arms, ammunition,\nmilitary equipment, training or any other military support\nto all parties to the conflict in Afghanistan. Furthermore,\ndocument A/52/403, dated 29 September 1997, confirms the\nrecent dispatch of some 600 additional military personnel\nand that shipments of arms from Pakistan to Afghanistan\nhave significantly increased.\nThe General Assembly has reiterated that the\ncontinuation of the conflict in Afghanistan provides a fertile\nground for terrorism and drug trafficking, which destabilize\nthe region and beyond. The United Nations Information\nService reported on 11 September 1997 a rise in opium-\npoppy production in Afghanistan to 2,800 metric tons in\n1997, an estimated 25 per cent increase over 1996.\nMr. Derek Fatchett, a Minister in Britain\u2019s Foreign Office,\npointed out in The Guardian of 25 June 1997 that the\nTaliban war chest is financed by drug money. Furthermore,\n96.4 per cent of Afghanistan\u2019s total opium production\noriginates in provinces currently under Taliban control,\naccording to the United Nations Information Service report.\nAfghanistan, as a State party to the Convention for the\nProtection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage of\n23 November 1972, has recognized its primary duty to\nensure the identification, protection, conservation,\npreservation and transmission to future generations of, inter\nalia, the cultural heritage situated in the country. The\nGeneral Assembly has called upon all Afghan parties to\ntake appropriate steps to prohibit, prevent and, if necessary,\nput a stop to any form of theft, pillage or misappropriation\nof and any acts of vandalism directed against, cultural\nproperty of the Afghan nation. The Taliban, however, on 17\nApril 1997, out of fanaticism expressed its intention to\ndemolish the two largest statues of Buddha in the world. In\nspite of great concern by the Secretary-General and\nMr. Federico Mayor, Director of the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n(UNESCO), and many Buddhist leaders throughout the\nworld, the Taliban did not exhibit any change of attitude.\nFortunately, its military push was repulsed and the colossal\nstatues remain intact.\nIn this context, reference should be made to the\nancient artifacts plundered from the rich Kabul National\nMuseum. According to Pakistani press reports, the\nartifacts have been added to the personal collections of\nthe former Pakistani Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto, and\nthe former Minister of the Interior, Nasirullah Babar. On\nbehalf of the people of Afghanistan, I call upon the\nPakistanis to return these irreplaceable Afghan artifacts,\nwhich are also part of the world\u2019s cultural heritage. I urge\nUNESCO to investigate the matter.\nI should like to announce that the delegation of the\nIslamic State of Afghanistan, together with some other\ncountries of the third world, will co-sponsor the draft\nresolution entitled \u201cTowards a culture of peace,\u201d\nsubmitted under agenda item 156. My delegation also\nsupports the resolution of the Economic and Social\nCouncil adopted in Geneva entitled \u201cProclamation of the\nYear 2000 as the International Year for the Culture of\nPeace\u201d.\nWe want to establish the best fraternal relations with\nPakistan and other neighbouring countries. Afghanistan\u2019s\npivotal location places it, as always, at the crossroads of\ndifferent corners of Asia. Naturally, no regional economic\ncooperation \u2014 in the context of the transit of goods,\npetroleum and natural gas \u2014 can succeed without a\npeaceful Afghanistan enjoying administrative unity.\nAfghanistan must cease to exist as a country of\nconfrontation, discord and clashes. Rather, it must turn\ninto a land of interrelation, association, joint action and\ncooperation. This is the genuine desire of all patriotic\nAfghans and of the true friends of Afghanistan.\nFifty-two years ago, the United Nations was founded\non the paramount ideals of a safer world and on\nparameters of global peace and collective security. The\nForeign Minister of Italy, His Excellency Mr. Lamberto\nDini, said in his speech last week before the General\nAssembly:\n\u201cWe no longer live in a world of purely\nnational interests. More and more, policy-making is\ninformed by global concerns such as human rights,\nsolidarity and social justice. At the threshold of the\ntwenty-first century, let us pledge to settle religious\nand ethnic conflicts through dialogue, tolerance and\ncultural exchange, and to find collective answers to\ninternational terrorism, organized crime, drug\ntrafficking and the degradation of the environment.\u201d\n\nLet me from this rostrum remind all of us here, as the\ngeneral debate draws to a close, that we must ask ourselves\nabout the level of our commitment to the implementation of\nthe ideals I have mentioned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The important\nsupport that the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\ncountries, within their limited possibilities, have given to\nMontserrat to help alleviate the pain merits recognition and\nis worth following. I therefore seize this opportunity to\nappeal to other countries to fulfil their moral obligations to\nour brothers and sisters in need.\nWithin the context of an increasingly integrated and\ncomplex global economic system of production and\ndistribution, trade liberalization and globalization of\nfinancial markets, the major thrust of the development\nstrategy of the Government of the Republic of Suriname\nlies in the revitalization and strengthening of production and\nexport capacity as the main engines of growth while\nmaintaining financial and monetary stability.\nIn response to the need to diversify the export base of\nthe economy, a good deal of impetus was given this year to\nthe expansion of the mining sector by the recent opening of\nan oil refinery that will enable my country to meet\ndomestic demands for heavy oil, by new gold-mining\noperations and by the commercial exploitation of other\nmineral deposits. Furthermore, we have initiated the\nconstruction of two important bridges. Together with the\nrehabilitation of vital infrastructure, including access roads\nin the coastal area and to the interior of the country and the\noperation of a ferry service with our neighbouring country,\nthe cooperative Republic of Guyana, these bridges will\noffer new opportunities for trade, house construction,\ntransport, tourism and employment in Suriname.\nIt is often said that progress in building lasting\ndemocracies and stronger market economies is\nincreasingly threatened by slow growth, weak institutions,\npoverty and wealth inequality. Persistent economic\nhardships for the majority of the people can likewise\ndamage the credibility of democratic Governments. The\nstruggle against poverty and social injustice is therefore\nthe greatest challenge to the Government of Suriname.\nIn our ceaseless struggle as a small nation to achieve\npeople-centred development goals, the present\nGovernment, within the international constraints of\nsustainable development and environmental protection,\nwill continue its endeavours to increase domestic\nefficiency and international competitiveness in agriculture,\nproduction, manufacturing and export, as well as to\nstrengthen the institutions of local entrepreneurship, with\na view to ensuring political stability and fostering\nequitable economic growth.\nBearing in mind that which has been referred to as\nthe dark side of the globalization process, and with a view\nto avoiding marginalization and creating outsiders to the\nglobal economy, it is imperative that we continue to\nrecognize the small, fragile and vulnerable economies of\nthe Caribbean, including Suriname, and of other regions\nin the world. This should guarantee that they will be\ngiven special treatment during a transitional period in\nwhich they will still require exceptions, waivers and other\ntransitional arrangements in the broader context of\ninternational trade liberalization and economic integration.\nHence the Surinamese Government attaches special\nsignificance to the May 1997 Bridgetown Declaration of\nPrinciples on Caribbean Community-United States\ncooperation in responding to the challenges that the new\nmillennium poses for our region, and it is looking forward\nto an expeditious implementation of the Plan of Action\nappended thereto. We also attach great importance to the\ntimely implementation of the Programme of Action for\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates and are looking forward to the 1998 review session\nof the Commission on Sustainable Development on\noutstanding chapters and issues of the Programme of\nAction.\nThe Government of Suriname welcomes the call of\nthe United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs for a\n6\n\n\nrenewed and concerted international commitment to a\nforward-looking drug strategy for the twenty-first century\nand, to that end, the convocation of a special session of the\nGeneral Assembly in June 1998. That session will prepare\na global drug-control strategy and new ways to promote\ninternational and regional cooperation in the fight against\nthe worldwide drug problem that undermines in particular\nthe economic and social prospects of many small\ndeveloping nations.\nWhile Suriname cannot be considered a drug-\nproducing country, it is afflicted by this scourge through\nproducers from outside the country who misuse its territory\nas a transit point for drugs bound for other countries, where\nthe availability and extensive use of drugs is creating a\nhuge, profitable market that threatens the well-being of so\nmany and feeds the greed of but a few.\nTo demonstrate our resolve to eradicate this evil from\nour territory, we will join with neighbouring countries to\ncoordinate our strategies and efforts. For that purpose\nSuriname will convene, at the beginning of 1998 and in\nconcert with Guyana, Brazil, France and Venezuela, an\ninternational conference on defining strategies and actions\nagainst the misuse and illicit trafficking of drugs. We\nappeal to those who are also committed to this struggle to\nassist us in this endeavour.\nReflecting on our special session on the\nimplementation of Agenda 21, the Government of Suriname\napplauds the adoption in July of this year of the Programme\nfor the Further Implementation of Agenda 21, including the\nstatement of commitment by Member countries. We expect\nthe next comprehensive review of its implementation in the\nyear 2002 to demonstrate greater measurable progress in\nachieving sustainable development.\nThe Government of Suriname feels concern about the\nissue of finance for sustainable development. Since Rio\n1992, only four developed States have fulfilled their\nAgenda 21 commitment towards the target of providing 0.7\nper cent of their gross national product as official\ndevelopment assistance. As it was agreed that for most\ndeveloping countries official development assistance is still\na main source of external development financing and cannot\ngenerally be replaced by private capital inflows, I should\nlike to urge the donor community to intensify efforts to\nreverse the declining trend in official development\nassistance as we experience it today.\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to pose a\ngreat threat to international peace and security. The Oslo\nagreement of 1993, signed by the two parties, embodies\nthe hope that a lasting solution to this conflict is within\nreach, since it establishes the basis for a lasting peace in\nthe Middle East. We feel that the peace process must be\ncarried on urgently, with a well-defined timetable. We\ntherefore support the co-sponsors of the peace process in\ntheir effort to bring the parties back to the negotiating\ntable with a view to securing durable peace in the Middle\nEast.\nAllow me to make a few remarks on the important\nissues of the reform and strengthening of the United\nNations and of more equitable representation in the\nSecurity Council. Since its birth, our Organization has\ngrown from 5 to 185 Member States, but the Security\nCouncil still reflects the world as it was in 1945. The\nGovernment of Suriname therefore underscores the need\nfor an expansion of, and a more equitable representation\nin, the membership of the Security Council.\nThe reform of the Security Council should not only\nmake the Council\u2019s membership more representative and\nmore legitimate but should also enhance its transparency\nand openness towards other Member States and non-\nmembers in order to convey its important messages in an\namplified and more effective manner. Hence we welcome\nthe recent measures taken by the Council to enhance its\ntransparency.\nThe present Government of Suriname takes the\nposition that the countries of the Caribbean and Latin\nAmerica should be included in any agreed expansion of\nthe Council, within the context of the principles of\nequitable geographic distribution and the sovereign\nequality of States. The reform should not result in\ndiscriminatory treatment between the developed and the\ndeveloping countries. We furthermore consider as integral\nparts of Security Council reform its expansion, the reform\nof its working methods and the issue of the veto. The\nveto should preferably be restricted to issues falling under\nChapter VII of our Charter.\nIncreased globalization and the emergence of new\nchallenges and threats require closer cooperation between\nStates at a global level. Within this context, it is of\nutmost importance to reaffirm and maintain the role of the\nUnited Nations as a major actor in cooperation between\nStates, especially development cooperation. In this light,\nmy Government welcomes the initiative of the Secretary-\nGeneral to propose a comprehensive reform programme\nto the General Assembly which is geared towards\nstrengthening the efficiency of the Secretariat and fixing\n7\n\n\na stronger focus on economic and social development\nissues.\nThe Government of Suriname supports in general the\nreform proposals of the Secretary-General and their key\nelements. These reform proposals as a whole represent a\ntimely and welcome initiative, given the fact that in today\u2019s\nworld the need has progressively increased for global\ncommon action on a number of pressing problems, such as\nthe eradication of poverty, humanitarian emergencies,\nrefugee problems, climate change and desertification,\ndiminishing official development assistance funding, drugs,\nnuclear disarmament, the implementation of Agenda 21,\ndemocracy and the maintenance of peace and security in\nvarious regions of the world.\nAll this calls for a stronger United Nations to promote\na renewed multilateral cooperation based on common\ninterests and shared responsibility. We must empower the\nUnited Nations now so that it can confront the global\nchallenges of the twenty-first century.\nOne of the best ways to re-establish trust in the United\nNations is to enhance the impact of United Nations\ndevelopment activities at the country level. In this regard\nthe Surinamese Government endorses the proposal to\nestablish a \u201cUnited Nations House\u201d.\nIn closing, I wish to reiterate that the Government of\nthe Republic of Suriname is committed to contributing to\nthe ongoing process of reform of our Organization.\nWe see the reform proposals of the Secretary-General\nas a first step in the right direction, although much more is\nleft to be done. We feel that the United Nations system\nshould be made stronger, more effective and more efficient\nin order to meet the priorities set by all its Members \u2014 not\njust the priorities of the economically strong and the\nmilitarily powerful but, especially, the priorities of the weak\nand vulnerable States, which should be prevented from\nbecoming outsiders in the global economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe tragedy of the millions of human beings who are\nsuffering the ravages of poverty affects Panama very\ndeeply. This is a deplorable scourge which has reached\nintolerable levels. Those of us present here are facing the\nshameful paradox of having produced the highest level of\nwealth ever known to mankind while at the same time\nhaving the highest level of unemployment in our\neconomies in history.\nPoverty and exclusion are the battlefronts that call\nfor political and moral will. From this standpoint, Panama\nis concerned that the tenor of this debate on the financial\nor military attributes of the many aspirants to membership\nof the Security Council may make us forget why the\nOrganization was created.\nPanama, a founding Member of the United Nations,\nsigned the Charter of the United Nations to give a voice\nto those who had been silenced by colonialism and to\nthose who clamoured for justice, freedom and\n18\n\n\ndevelopment; to restore dignity to peoples such as mine that\nhad been deprived of their sovereign rights; and to give\nthose who had been discriminated against and persecuted\nthe right to dream about a better world in which no one\nwould be hated for the color of his skin or his beliefs, or\nfor being part of a given ethnic group, or of one gender or\nthe other.\nPanama signed that beautiful document, a tribute to\nthe humble of the Earth, in order to give democratic\ninstitutions, civil and political rights and multilateral forums\nto all those people \u2014 men and women of good will \u2014 who\ndid not want war to return, destroying their homes, legacies,\ncities and towns and plots of land. They also did not want\nto see war rub out entire generations by sacrificing them to\nobsession, fanaticism and extremism.\nLike many others here, Panama signed the San\nFrancisco Charter so that the poor of the world and those\nsuffering from disease and malnutrition would have two of\nthe simplest and most moving of human attributes: faith\nand hope.\nThe more than 50 years that have passed since then\nhave brought about considerable advances that have\nchanged the face of the world. Many of them would not\nhave been possible, however, if cooperation had not\nimprinted a new meaning and purpose on our Organization.\nIn fact, few vestiges of colonialism remain to be solved;\nethnic groups and nationalities, prohibited cultures and the\nprosecuted now work together in pride to design a\npolychromatic world that calls for equality in difference and\ntolerance towards diversity.\nThe number of nations which are Members of the\nUnited Nations has increased three-fold, and its agenda\nreflects their pain, suffering, struggles and aspirations. Its\norientation and contents have changed, and everyone has\nbeen given a forum in which to express his opinions and\nfind support and understanding.\nIf a planning board had tried to identify, as is now\nproposed, which problem had priority and deserved\nattention, financing and debate, the Security Council would\nnever have met in my country, Panama, nor would that\nevent have changed so decisively the course of negotiations\nwhen Panama attempted to regain its sovereignty and its\nCanal.\nThere are important achievements in the daily life of\nthe United Nations. However, none of them would have\nbeen possible if the United Nations had not attained the\nquality, the representative nature and the legitimacy that\nit has achieved through universality. It must be recognized\nthat there remain unacceptably acute differences and\ndeficiencies, which are becoming more serious and are\nconstantly and forcibly knocking at the very doors of our\nhomes.\nAt the same time, thousands of people are dying\nbefore our very eyes because of hunger, intolerance,\nhatred, terrorism, fratricidal warfare, authoritarianism and\nviolence; thousands of children are looking at us through\ntelevision screens with languid and sad eyes, only to\nbecome mere statistics at the end of the programme.\nThere are still those who peddle illusions, who would\nhave us believe that conflicts reside at the end of a rifle\nand that they can be resolved by having more powerful\nrifles. The figures on what the world spends on weapons\nare so disproportionate when compared to expenditures\nfor development that only mentioning them makes us\nashamed.\nWe should have already learned the lesson that when\npeople are motivated, for whatever reason, there is no\nbullet or defence system, no matter how sophisticated,\nthat can eliminate the causes of conflict; that the\ninstruments of force can lower the fever but they cannot\neliminate the turmoil which causes it; and that there is no\nmilitary solution to social and political problems. History,\nlife's teacher, shows us that violence usually is the result,\nnot the cause, of conflict; that war is more often than not\nthe symptom rather than the cause of the ills; and that the\nonly way to resolve conflicts and the violence that goes\nalong with them is to act on their true, underlying causes:\nhunger, malnutrition and extreme poverty and the lack of\nmeans to overcome them; ethnic, gender and cultural\ndiscrimination; intolerance and authoritarianism;\nfundamentalism and political and religious persecution;\nunemployment, slave labour and immoral salaries;\nhumiliation and national oppression. The majority of us\nwho came here over 50 years ago, as well as the many\nwho arrived later, did so in order to find solidarity and to\ntake refuge in the realm of law, not to shield ourselves in\na new military alliance or to take shelter in the shadow of\na cannon. Circumstances then forced us to live under an\nominous nuclear balance which made the interrelations of\nmilitary forces the determining factor in international\nrelations.\n19\n\n\nToday \u2014 under a completely different setting in which\nthe balance of power is measured in terms of the potential\nand economic strength of markets \u2014 nothing compels us to\ncontinue to live under the model of the cold war.\nThe greatest impending threat to international peace\nand security is poverty, whose reach is as extensive as that\nof the most pervasive of plagues. Which current or future\nSecurity Council member's army will be able to put an end\nto the threat if it is the mother of all illnesses and\nresentments and harvests more human lives than any\nbacteria, virus or ancient or modern plague?\nIf what we are contemplating is a resurgence of the\nold and festering conflicts which were frozen by the cold\nwar, would we not be substituting the ancient balance of\nbipolar nuclear terror for a new and expanded military\nalliance to resolve those conflicts under the umbrella of the\nUnited Nations?\nPanama certainly does not believe that force is not\nnecessary as a deterrent, nor are we unaware that such a\ntool in responsible hands is useful, particularly when it is\nlegitimated by world-wide consensus, as the Charter\nproposes.\nWhat concerns us is that most of the discussion in the\nworld about the reform of the United Nations\ndisproportionately stresses the use of force and disregards\nwhat is important, and indeed imperative \u2014 that is to say,\ncooperation for development.\nHence, to assert that the most important function of\nthe United Nations is to have a big force to maintain\ninternational peace and security, while at the same time\nproposing the reduction, streamlining and elimination of the\nOrganization's social and humanitarian components, raises\nimportant questions about the final nature of our reform and\nmodernization exercise.\nTo maintain that financial and material contributions\nto peacekeeping operations should be decisive in\ndetermining who can and who cannot sit on the Council,\nwhile at the same time stating that social and humanitarian\ntasks, development programmes and environmental\nprotection programmes should be placed in other kinds of\nmanagement and organization categories, greatly concerns\nus. This compendium of proposals must be rebalanced and\ngiven its proper dimension.\nIf what we are going to discuss is the package, then\nthe only one we should talk about is the package of the\nfundamental principles of the United Nations already\nenshrined in the Charter.\nFrom that integral perspective, the purpose of\npolitically and financially strengthening the Organization,\nand the Security Council in particular, is to ensure that it\ncan fully discharge its major mission: the promotion of\nsocial and economic and human development as the most\neffective way to prevent conflicts.\nThe profound developments in the last 50 years have\nchanged the international community. The deepest change\nhas occurred in the parameters of, and the language used\nto define, relations among countries. The Powers of the\npast no longer exist, and new Powers are emerging \u2014\neven though there are obvious military weaknesses.\nIt is no longer war that marks the trend towards\ncontemporary development or the course or content of\ninternational life. Why organize the United Nations on the\nbasis of what no longer exists? Now it is peace, trade, the\nsharing of the fruits of knowledge and technology, and\nthe deep changes designed to ensure higher levels of\ntolerance and open-mindedness that are features of\ninternational coexistence. It is not military tools to prevent\nwar that have to be strengthened but, rather, the tools to\nbuild peace, to achieve international cooperation, as is\nstated in the Charter, in solving international problems of\nan economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character,\nand in promoting and encouraging respect for human\nrights and for fundamental freedoms for all (Article 3).\nInternational peace is not guaranteed by rifles or cannons,\nor by one or several allied Powers. This has been proved\nby recent, and not so recent but no less painful,\nexperiences.\nThe small and brave country Uruguay, which makes\nthe highest per capita contribution for peace-keeping, has\ntaught us such a good lesson in this respect.\nIf it is true that the greatest restriction on creativity,\nthought and intelligence is dialectically established by\nlanguage itself, then we have to cast aside once and for\nall the language and the thinking process left over from\nthe cold war. We must design something that more\nappropriately represents what we wish to do.\nPanama does not feel that its juridical status has\nbeen diminished when it acknowledges that some\ncountries have special attributes or can better discharge\nthe tasks of the Security Council. On the one hand, the\nproblem is to define these tasks, to determine whether\n20\n\n\nwhat we want is a guardian or a promoter of development\nand cooperation. On the other hand, the problem relates to\nthe degree of responsibility a member of the Council has\nvis-a-vis the rest of us. For, if its membership of the\nCouncil is based solely on its individual attributes \u2014\nrejecting any kind of representation of us \u2014 then it can sit\nin that seat in the Council until someone simply wrests the\nseat from it by violence.\nEverything indicates that we should define these tasks\nin a coherent manner in keeping with the whole set of\npurposes of the United Nations. From this standpoint, each\nregion has to determine the degree of representativity and\nresponsibility that its members should have, as well as who\ncan occupy those seats. It is difficult to think that after the\nMembers of the United Nations have acquired such long\nand productive experience of working in regional groups\nand organizations, everything would be discarded in order\nto vote for a country on an individual basis. We would like\nto know what benefit there would be in reigning in a\nvacuum.\nFurthermore, neither ideological nor military blocs\nappear any longer on the map of the world, nor should\ngeographical distribution alone. These have been nothing\nbut obsolete instruments which have served to draw\nsimplistic and arbitrary borders and, hence, to face us at\ntimes with tragedies.\nThis new international reality must be fully\nrecognized. The new borders that are now forming are\ntrade, ethnic, religious, and cultural borders, and it is\nprecisely because they were disregarded during the cold\nwar that we are still faced today with all these upheavals.\nIt is those upheavals that seduce even the most conservative\namong us into being guided by one of the left-over thoughts\nof the bipolar world \u2014 vis pacem para bellum.\nOn the other hand, if we really feel comfortable with\none-third of the membership not rotating and two-thirds of\nthe membership rotating, then it would be sane and\njudicious for any expansion to maintain those proportions,\nwhich practice has shown to be efficient and which have\nbeen agreed to.\nWhy, then, should we go on using language that draws\na distinction between the regular budget and the\npeacekeeping budget? This accounting dichotomy became\na policy and crudely revealed how individual interests could\nseparate the package from the founding principles, to such\nan extent that they would be truly contradictory. There are\nthose who say that it is shameful for the regular budget to\nhave to be financed out of the peacekeeping budget. I\nwould say that it is even more shameful that the\ndisproportion in amounts, both in payments and in\nvoluntary contributions, is so overwhelming that the social\nand humanitarian functions are now secondary to the\nsecurity functions, as if, in the final analysis, civic-action\nprogrammes are dependent upon military operations. This\nreflects the unstated reversal of focus between the\nsecondary: the operations for the maintenance of security,\nand the primary: the human-development programmes.\nA single budget, which conforms to a periodically\nagreed-upon political strategy, should respond in each\ncase to the changing challenges of the new international\ndynamism. In our view, it is not compatible with the new\nspirit of democratization in our Organization or with the\nnew international realities for one or a few countries to\nsubsidize the entire budget in a disproportionate way, for\nthis can lead to the danger of concentrating the decision-\nmaking power and thereby affecting the Organization's\nfunctioning.\nIn the final analysis \u2014 and we do not want to give\nlessons to anyone \u2014 we feel that what is necessary is a\ngood arsenal of general and flexible criteria, the key to\nthe search for consensus \u2014 that is, representativity,\nlegitimacy, non-discrimination, equity and legal equality.\nWe must move from the particular and discuss individual\naspirations, in order to design a compendium of criteria\nthat would be applicable to all, whether or not their seats\non the Security Council rotated.\nFrom that standpoint, we think that we should not\ndiscuss the veto in the abstract, as a privilege or as a\ncategory in and of itself. With the passage of time, there\nhas been a distortion in the original spirit of the Charter,\nunder which the members of the Security Council were to\nrepresent in the Security Council the general interests of\nthe international community, not act in accordance with\ntheir exclusive military or political strategic interests.\nIn that context, part of the reform should be the\nnegotiation of an agreement restricting the use of the veto\nto what is stipulated in Chapter VII and to what was\nagreed in the gentlemen's agreement in London 1948.\nFrom that standpoint, we need a formula that can\nprevent a single country from standing in the way of the\ngeneral interest. One such formula would be allowing\nvetoes to be overridden by a two-thirds majority. The\noptimal solution, of course, would be to get rid of the\nveto.\n21\n\n\nLet me here and now thank the public and private\nsectors of the international community for the support and\nsolidarity given to my country during the Universal\nCongress on the Panama Canal.\nThis is a good opportunity to report that Panama is\ncontinuing to take the necessary legislative and\nadministrative steps to turn this international public service\nover to an agency that would be constitutionally\nautonomous \u2014 administratively, politically and financially.\nPanama is certain that scrupulous observance of this\nautonomous status will make the interocean waterway more\ncompetitive and more efficient and will also allow the\nagency to take advantage of the many opportunities that\nwill be created by the Canal\u2019s upcoming incorporation into\nthe Panamanian economy.\nWe must remember that until now military needs for\nthe Canal have always been dominant, and this has made it\nimpossible to exploit the Canal\u2019s many competitive\nadvantages for trade and international civil-maritime\nactivities. From this standpoint, Panama\u2019s greatest strategic\nconcern during the transition process has been to gain\ncomplete control of the Canal so as to undertake a vast,\nmultimillion-dollar programme to modernize and widen it.\nThis programme includes widening the Gaillard Cut \u2014 a\ncritical area for ships crossing from the waters of Lake\nGatun \u2014 as well as the systematic studies undertaken in\ncooperation with the United States, Japan and the European\nUnion in order to construct the third system of locks, which\nwill allow passage of ships weighing up to 150,000 dead-\nweight tons.\nGiven the international importance of the Panamanian\ninteroceanic waterway, we intend to announce formally to\nthis General Assembly session that, in order to ensure\nrespect for the neutrality of the Panama Canal, Panama will\nconduct its external relations in such a way as to reduce\ninternational tension and conflict and not to get embroiled\nin issues that would require us to take sides for or against\nmembers of the international community with which we\nhave friendly relations, or for or against the community as\na whole. We are convinced that this new policy is the most\nimportant contribution Panama can make to international\npeace and security.\nFrom this standpoint, we will concentrate our efforts\non contributing to understanding, cooperation and friendly\nrelations among peoples and governments. The Panama\nCanal, as an international public service, must be open to\nall users, public and private, regardless of the flag they fly\nor the economic system they represent.\nIn this regard, we are pleased by our admission to\nthe pro tem secretariat of the Rio Group as of 1998, and\nwe are committed from now on to undertaking intensive\ndiplomatic efforts to strengthen the Group\u2019s role as a\nleading forum for interregional and intra-regional\ndiscussion and political understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me first of all, Mr. President, to congratulate you\non your election to preside over this new session of the\nGeneral Assembly. We are sure that the experience you\nhave gained in your years of activity in the Organization,\ntogether with your personal qualities and technical skills,\nwill, under your mandate, contribute to the strengthening\nof this most important body of the Organization.\nAllow me also to express our congratulations to the\noutgoing President, Ambassador Razali, for the work he\nperformed, which certainly contributed to the\nstrengthening both of the presidency and of the role the\nGeneral Assembly is called on to play in the United\nNations.\nUndoubtedly, the central focus of our attention will\ncontinue to be the issue of the reform of the Organization,\nthe essence of which is now contained in the document\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General.\nMy country fully supports and has every confidence\nin the appointment and endeavours of the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan. We have thus paid the greatest\nattention to the package of reforms he has submitted, and\nwe are prepared to promote deliberations on them so that\nthey can be concluded as soon as possible.\n4\n\n\nWe understand that the document is aimed at the\nobjective of equipping the Organization with an\nadministrative structure that will permit more flexible\nmanagement, prevent duplication of functions and secure\ncoordination among its organs and programmes, all of\nwhich will result in an improvement in terms of both\neconomy and management.\nWithin the overall issue of reform, the specific topic\nof the Security Council is one of the most important\nbecause of the political significance that organ has had and\nwill continue to have within the structure of the United\nNations. Uruguay endorses an enlargement of the Council\nbecause it believes that its structure should be adapted to\nthe new realities in the world, which differ substantially\nfrom those that existed when the Organization was\nestablished, since at that time account was taken of the\npower structure resulting from the Second World War.\nIn this regard, we support an increase in the number\nof both permanent and non-permanent Members of the\nCouncil, to a total of not more than 25, so that efficiency\nis not impaired. Our country particularly supports an\nincreased presence of developing countries to ensure a\nbetter balance in the membership of this singular organ of\nour Organization. We believe that the newly created seats\nshould be occupied on the basis of real equality of\nopportunity for all States.\nHowever, my country believes that the reform of the\nCouncil should not be confined to the topic of its\nmembership. Equally important is ensuring that its activities\nare transparent and that information provided to and\ncommunication with the States that are not members of the\nCouncil flow freely and are up to date.\nThe Eastern Republic of Uruguay has expressed strong\nsupport for progressively limiting the right of veto, and to\nthat end we have submitted a proposal to the effect that on\ncertain subjects, the right of veto could be suspended by the\nGeneral Assembly by a majority to be determined. That\nmechanism, essentially democratic in nature, would thus\nhelp reduce the absolute power of the right of veto as\ncurrently provided for in the Charter, while at the same\ntime it would strengthen the competence of the General\nAssembly.\nNonetheless, our country will be ready to analyse any\nother proposal that might be submitted aimed at limiting the\nabsolute individual veto.\nWhile the reform of the Security Council and the\npossible revision of the scale of assessments have recently\nbeen, and continue to be, the focus of political attention,\nwe should also study the question of strengthening the\nGeneral Assembly. A calm and dispassionate analysis of\nthe organizational structure and respective areas of\nresponsibility of our Organization shows that the forum\nwhere the principle of juridical equality of States reigns\nsupreme is undoubtedly the General Assembly.\nThere has been and still is much discussion\nregarding the composition of the Security Council and the\nexercise of the right of veto, in the context of the new\nparameters of international realities. That is all well and\ngood, but at the same time, we need to find practical\nways of revitalizing and invigorating the activity of the\nAssembly.\nThe General Assembly is a unique body in\ninternational institutional machinery. In it, representativity\nis practically universal. States participate on an equal\nfooting without regard for their size or power, and the\nideal of international democracy attains its clearest\nexpression, at least in formal terms. The decisions of this\nbody have great moral and political force and accordingly,\nit is essential to formulate them better and make them\nmore timely.\nFor these reasons, the General Assembly not only\nneeds to function more flexibly and utilize its resources\nmore rationally, but also, and essentially, requires greater\nsubstance. Only thus will we be able to give its\nresolutions greater operative force.\nConsequently, we should take a new approach and\nopen a new chapter in the reform process, not confining\nour reflections and aspirations to reforms of the Security\nCouncil or to reforms of a financial nature, but extending\nthem to the organ that brings together the international\ncommunity as a whole, namely, the General Assembly.\nAfter 52 years of the Organization's existence, the\nmaintenance of international peace and security continues\nto be one of its essential functions. Peacekeeping\noperations, to which my country is proud to have been a\ncontributor from the outset, must be fully maintained\nwhile adapting to new kinds of conflicts.\nUruguay is prepared for this, and, accordingly, we\nreaffirm here once again our commitment not only to\ncontinue to make our traditional contribution but also to\n5\n\n\ndiversify it in order to adapt it fundamentally to peace-\nbuilding.\nIn this connection, we welcome the signing, with the\nUnder-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, of\na memorandum of understanding regarding our\ncontributions to the United Nations standby arrangements\nsystem. This will contribute to facilitating the planning of\nfuture peacekeeping missions in the shortest possible time.\nThe General Assembly's recent adoption of the\nresolution putting an end to the use of \u201cgratis personnel\nprovided by Governments and other entities\u201d fulfils one of\nmy country's long-standing aspirations and does justice to\nthe principles of equitable geographical representation and\nthe equality of Member States, both enshrined in the\nCharter.\nSimilarly, the recent General Assembly resolution\nadopting uniform and standardized rates for payment of\nawards in cases of death or disability sustained by troops in\nthe service of the United Nations peacekeeping operations\nseems to us an important step that puts an end to an unjust\nsituation.\nWe fully support the Middle East peace process\ninitiated at Madrid in October 1991 and continued at\nWashington, and the Government of the Eastern Republic\nof Uruguay continues to encourage the necessary holding of\ndirect talks between Israel and the Palestinian National\nAuthority. It is essential for both parties to respect in good\nfaith the commitments entered into in the Madrid and\nWashington declarations.\nOur Latin American continent does not want an arms\nrace; it wants, on the contrary, to be free of nuclear\nweapons and of other sophisticated weapons of mass\ndestruction that can create instability. We want to work in\npeace, allocating the largest possible amount of resources\nto our economic and social development.\nHowever, this should not be an obstacle to limited\npurchases of arms by our armed forces solely for the\npurpose of replacing their obsolete equipment, thereby fully\ndischarging their constitutional mandates.\nWe must work to ensure a continuation of the mutual\nconfidence and security that prevails in the region today,\nwithout third countries weakening and taking advantage of\nour continent through the sale of sophisticated weapons.\nUruguay will continue to support with firm\nconviction all disarmament processes, and, accordingly,\nwe recently signed in Oslo the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\nTransfer of Anti-Personnel Mines, those lethal weapons\nthat have caused not only death and serious injury to\nsoldiers but also the loss of thousands of innocent lives.\nProtection of human rights has been and will\ncontinue to be one of the priority objectives of both our\ndomestic and international policies. Without full exercise\nof human rights, there can be neither peace nor security,\nneither economic prosperity nor social equity, and the\nexistence of a democratic system of government will\ntherefore also be impossible.\nIn addition, there can be no full exercise of human\nrights without a minimum economic, social and\neducational base, and my country will be prepared to\ncontribute to ensuring the existence of such a base.\nIn this connection, we fully support the restructuring\nproposed by the Secretary-General while at the same time\nendorsing the philosophy on which it is based, embodied\nin his idea that the question of human rights should be\npart of all the substantive spheres of the Secretariat's\nprogramme of work: peace and security, economic and\nsocial affairs, development cooperation and humanitarian\naffairs.\nThe financial crisis the Organization is experiencing,\nwhich has no counterpart in its history, stems primarily\nfrom the failure to pay assessed contributions. While not\nintending to justify any delay in payment, Uruguay\nbelieves that the current scale of assessments requires\nadjustments to make it fairer, more transparent and better\nbased on the capacity of States to pay. That should not,\nhowever, mean that developing countries would assume\nnew and additional commitments today; that would, in our\nview, be unjust and unacceptable. The system of\ncontributions should be based on objective criteria of\nfinancial responsibility. We agree that there is a need to\ncorrect and manage the budgets of the Organization in\norder to reduce expenditures and increase efficiency, thus\nstriking a balance between expenditure on peace and\nsecurity and expenditure on development, each of which\nis a cornerstone of the other, without weakening operating\nand information activities.\nWe cannot but express our public satisfaction at\nseeing the importance the Secretary-General attaches to\ndevelopment, which he regards as one of the priorities\n6\n\n\nand essential functions of the Organization. There can be no\npeace without development.\nOn the threshold of a century that is already taking\nshape and that, unfortunately, seems to be marked by\ngrowth without equity, uncertainty in employment and a\nproliferation of crises and conflicts, good management of\ndevelopment assistance is today more necessary than ever\nbefore. At a time when human concerns seem to be alien to\nus, it is essential, in Uruguay's view, to support an\nOrganization that holds that people must be placed at the\nvery heart of the development process if we want growth to\nbe compatible with the human condition and development\nto be conducted by and for people.\nIn this context, we consider it very important to\nmaintain unconditionally the principle of universality and\nthe right of all developing countries, without exception, to\nbenefit from international cooperation and to receive\ntechnical assistance with a view to achieving sustainable\nhuman development.\nUruguay considers international technical cooperation\nessential for consolidating the processes of development and\nintegration in the various regions. It is a fundamental tool\nfor attaining greater economic growth.\nWe support the development of South-South\ncooperation as an important tool for promoting the\nimproved development of nations. We believe that a new\nconcept of technical cooperation will have to respond to\ntraditional demands, such as humanitarian affairs, as well\nas others associated directly with the process of integration\ninto the international economy, such as, for example, the\nredefinition of the role of the State, its modernization and\nits decentralization.\nWe believe that a positive contribution to political and\ndemocratic stability and to economic growth is made by\nprocesses of regional and subregional integration. In our\ncase, the Southern Cone Common Market \u2014 composed of\nArgentina, Brazil, Paraguay and our country \u2014 is a clear\nexample of democratic stability and expansion of trade,\nwithin and outside the region, compatible with the rules of\nthe World Trade Organization.\nUruguay continues to assign to international law a\nprimordial role as a regulator of relations among States.\nRespect for and compliance with international law are\nessential for peaceful coexistence. For this reason, we\nsupport the holding of an international conference to discuss\na draft convention establishing an international criminal\ncourt for autonomous and independent hearings on certain\ncrimes, such as genocide and others which, because of\ntheir seriousness, are roundly condemned by the\ninternational community. We also support the work of the\nAd Hoc Committee on the elaboration of a convention for\nthe suppression of terrorist bombings.\nIn times of change, which we all see as appropriate\nand inevitable in order to revitalize the Organization, we\nnevertheless identify more than ever before with the\nessential purposes and principles established 52 years ago.\nThese bind the Organization together and, despite the time\nthat has elapsed and the important changes that have since\ntaken place in the world, continue to constitute and must\ncontinue to constitute, today as yesterday, the goal and\nobjective of all the changes the United Nations will have\nto face at the dawn of the twenty-first century.\nPeople, simple people, call for us to be effective and\nefficient in our activities and bold in our decisions in\npreventing conflicts, and to act on their behalf in\nrebuilding civil societies. The citizens of every nation, of\nevery country of the world, call on us today to be firm in\nour commitment to the Charter and to adapt our new\nactivities to the changing times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe unanimous election of the President of the\nfifty-second session of the General Assembly of the\nUnited Nations was a tribute not only to his outstanding\ndiplomatic qualities, but also to his country, Ukraine \u2014\nwith which the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros\nfully intends to have good relations of friendship and\ncooperation. I would like to associate myself with the\nprevious speakers in extending to him, on behalf of my\ndelegation, our warm congratulations and to wish him all\nsuccess in carrying out his noble task.\nAllow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to his\npredecessor, Mr. Razali Ismail, for the dedication and\nskill with which he guided the work and shouldered the\ntask of President of the fifty-first session of our General\nAssembly.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to extend\nmy sincere congratulations to our new Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, on his outstanding election. I would like\nto express our deep gratitude to this illustrious advocate\nof the ideals of peace, solidarity and justice for his\nunswerving dedication to the service of our institution.\nHis experience in international affairs, together with his\npersonal qualities, clearly guarantees that the United\nNations will be given new impetus as it faces the new\nchallenges confronting it.\n7\n\n\nAt a time when we are meeting in the General\nAssembly to assess \u2014 as is our custom \u2014 the work carried\nout by our Organization in the areas of peacekeeping, the\nstrengthening of international cooperation, the development\nof reforms required if the United Nations is to adapt to the\nneeds of our time, we are obliged to note that the world\ncontinues to fall prey to numerous types of threats, tensions\nand ills of all sorts.\nThus, it is obvious that our Organization must play a\nvery critical and primary role. However, in this period of\nglobalization \u2014 of the obvious and irrevocable\ninterdependence of nations, democracy, good governance\nand transparency in the management of public affairs \u2014\nour Organization remains the target of those who wish to\nminimize and limit its role by preventing it from paying\nstill greater attention to the problems of poor and\ndisadvantaged countries. It goes without saying that this\nconcept is not conducive to promoting the atmosphere of\ndetente in international relations that has been awaited for\nso long.\nBearing in mind the noble tasks for which the\nOrganization was founded, in particular the building of a\njust, peaceful and better integrated world society, it would\nbe wise and reasonable for the major concerns of our\nOrganization, since the end of the cold war, to be\nmobilization for disarmament and the search for solutions\nthat can encourage the development policies of States,\ncooperation and international solidarity.\nThe trials and tribulations of history have once again\nplaced my country, the Islamic Federal Republic of the\nComoros, on the first page of international news. The tragic\nevents of the last few months are the result of an\nunprecedented social and economic crisis which is battering\nmy country. Indeed, counted among the least developed\ncountries, over the last few years the Comoran State has\nwitnessed a deterioration of the markets for its export\nproducts \u2014 vanilla, cloves, perfume oils, and so forth \u2014\ndue to strong international competition.\nThe poor sales of these products, which are the major\nsources of revenue for the State, and therefore for a\nmajority of the inhabitants of the Comoros, have been\ncompounded by the devaluation of our currency, without\nappropriate accompanying measures. This economic state of\naffairs has only served to exacerbate the already poor and\nvulnerable condition of a considerable sector of the\npopulation of the Comoros. Here I have in mind the\ngalloping unemployment and the rising curve of poverty.\nIn this situation, which is of concern in many ways,\nthe authorities of the Comoros, together with the Bretton\nWoods institutions, decided on a number of measures\naimed at balancing State revenues and expenditures.\nThese include a reduction in gross salaries; the\nprivatization of State firms; a reduction of the operational\nState budget; and the launching of projects to generate\nrevenue and permanent jobs.\nThese new guidelines were put forth on the eve of\nthe free and democratic elections organized under the\naegis of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the\nEuropean Union and the United Nations. On 16 March\n1996, these elections carried President Mohamed Taki\nAbdoulkarim to the highest post in my country.\nIndeed, the catastrophic situation inherited by the\nnewly elected President required the swiftest possible start\nof political, economic and social reforms capable of\nmeeting the numerous challenges impeding the building\nof a democratic, prosperous and united society.\nAmong the efforts made along these lines by the\nnew political authorities of the Comoros, we could\nmention the regular payment since 1997 of State officials'\nsalaries.\nHowever, despite this new impetus, the discontent\nspawned by a series of crises and tragedies in my\ncountry's recent history finally caught up with the harsh\nsocio-economic facts of life of the Comorian people.\nExpressed in different ways, in line with the\nsusceptibilities on all sides, the rumblings of this\ndiscontent got out of bounds on the Comorian island of\nAnjouan. Indeed, since March 1997, various\nmovements \u2014 both trade union and political \u2014 coalesced\ninto an organization whose activism threatens the very\nheart of the Comorian State.\nFrom the illegal occupation of public buildings to\nthe trampling underfoot of the national flag, these factions\nsowing terror on the island of Anjouan used all kinds of\nmethods to provoke the central power.\nThese outrageous actions, which have been\nunanimously condemned by the international community,\nwere exacerbated by the proclamation of a pseudo-\nindependence of the island of Anjouan.\nDespite all these acts of provocation, the President\nof the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros,\n8\n\n\ndetermined to preserve peace and national unity, opted for\nthe path of dialogue and agreed action. Within this\nframework, the Government of the Comoros requested the\nmediation of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) with\na view to achieving a peaceful settlement of this domestic\ncrisis.\nAs a result of the discussions initiated by the OAU\nmission, certain decisions, accepted by all sides, were taken\ndesigned to facilitate a return to normalcy \u2014 in particular,\nthe withdrawal of military reinforcements, the provision to\nthe island of vitally necessary foodstuffs, the organization\nof examinations at the end of the school year, and so on.\nThe response to this spirit of reconciliation by the\nseparatists was the continuation of one act of escalation\nafter another; they occupied the presidential residence at\nHombo, in Anjouan and levied direct and indirect taxes on\nthe island, having emptied the coffers of the State.\nFaced with such an exacerbation of the situation,\nwhich was a violation of the authority of the State, the\nGovernment was obliged to send a military mission to\nAnjouan to re-establish public and Republican order.\nThis mission, which began on the morning of 2\nSeptember, had nearly achieved its goal by 4 September,\nwithout bloodshed. But the subsequent turn of events led\nthe President of the Republic, still determined to preserve\ncivil order, to take the necessary emergency measures under\narticle 20 of the Constitution of the Islamic Federal\nRepublic of the Comoros, dealing with full powers.\nThis is why, acting under this Article, a State\ntransition commission was appointed and given the\nprerogatives normally given members of the Government:\nto carry on the conduct of current affairs of State; to\ncontinue the indispensable negotiations begun with the\nOAU, the United Nations, the League of Arab States and\nall other bodies involved in the search for a solution to the\ncrisis afflicting the country; to implement and give concrete\nform to solutions agreed on, in consultation with the World\nBank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF); to\nprepare for signature the programme of adjustment with the\nBretton Woods institutions; and to prepare the final\nprocedures for ultimate signature of the eighth European\nDevelopment Fund, in collaboration with the European\nUnion and the countries of the Asian, Caribbean and Pacific\nregion.\nDuring this transitional stage it should be possible to\nrestructure institutions with a view to giving the islands of\nthe Republic broad management autonomy and more\nactive participation in the process of development in the\nislands of the Comoros as a whole.\nAt a time when my country's territorial integrity\nremains threatened, at a time when arbitrary separatist\nactions are again battering my country, I should like from\nthis rostrum to launch a heartfelt appeal to the entire\ninternational community to assist the Islamic Federal\nRepublic of the Comoros to eradicate the ills which are\ndestroying it, namely underdevelopment and\ndestabilization.\nWhile it is true that we must first and foremost\ncount on our own strengths, the Islamic Federal Republic\nof the Comoros also knows that it can count on the\nUnited Nations, our Organization, with its specialized\nagencies, including the United Nations Development\nProgramme, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the\nWorld Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization.\nThe Comoros also knows it can count on OAU, the\nLeague of Arab States, the Organization of the Islamic\nConference, and the European Union.\nWe can only reiterate here our full confidence in,\nand deep gratitude for, the tireless and determined efforts\nthey have unceasingly made to ensure the economic\ndevelopment of, and peace and security for, the Islamic\nFederal Republic of the Comoros.\nAfter this broad overview of the terrible events\nwhich my country is enduring, we are obliged to note\nthat, today, more than ever before, the question of\nunderdevelopment remains the major source of threats to\npeace and international security.\nWhile we recognize that on the threshold of the third\nmillennium our Organization remains the guarantor of the\nemancipation of peoples and the progressive elimination\nof poverty, it is also incontestable that the daily struggle\nwith hunger, malnutrition and illiteracy and the problem\nof ensuring good health for everyone are challenges to\nour collective conscience.\nWhat can more significantly illustrate the will of our\ninstitution to eradicate these scourges than the series of\nconferences which have been held throughout the past\ndecade? I have in mind the New York World Summit for\nChildren, the Rio Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, the Vienna World Conference on Human\n9\n\n\nRights, the Cairo International Conference on Population\nand Development, the Copenhagen World Summit for\nSocial Development, the Beijing Fourth World Conference\non Women, the Istanbul Conference on Human Settlements,\nand the Rome World Food Summit. All these conferences\naroused great hopes in all of mankind but their effects are\nstill in an embryonic stage, particularly for the developing,\nleast developed and island countries.\nThe hopes born of these international meetings are like\na distant horizon that seems to recede as one gets nearer to\nit.\nThe Government of the Islamic Federal Republic of\nthe Comoros reaffirms its support for the reforms\nrecommended for our Organization, in particular those\nrelating to the enlargement of the Security Council, since\nour evolving world has taken on new contours. These\ninclude new forms of violence, and our current means of\ndealing with them seems increasingly inadequate and\nunsuitable. The strengthening and maintenance of peace\nwithin States is today a new concern of our Organization,\nconfronted as it is by civil wars, genocide, ethnic cleansing,\nterrorism, mercenaries and all forms of transnational crime.\nThe new international political landscape is, to be sure,\na result of the new forms of tension, which tend to\novershadow some of the conflicts well known to our\nOrganization.\nSince horrors know no limits, the Comoros\nGovernment is still concerned by the resurgence of violence\nin the Middle East, which has had a negative effect on the\ndynamism that had been set in motion by the signing of the\nOslo agreements between the Palestinians and the Israelis.\nThus the provocations by the new Israeli authorities,\nthe continuation of the settlement policy, the closing off of\nPalestinian territories, the demolition of houses, and the\narbitrary arrests all furnish eloquent proof of the\nimpediments to the peace process.\nThe new conflagration in that part of the world\nrequires the international community to redouble its\nvigilance so as to ensure the peoples of the subregion the\nright to peaceful coexistence, for which one of the\nprerequisites is respect for the right of the Palestinians to a\nfree and independent State.\nAlong the same lines, the occupation of part of\nLebanese national territory by foreign troops is a serious\nthreat that every day delays the national reconciliation of\na long-suffering people that continues to seek stability.\nFrom East to West, from North to South, other\nconflicts with various motivations continue to rage and\npose serious threats to international peace and security.\nWhile it is true that it has been possible to find the\nbeginnings of solutions thanks to the perseverance of our\nOrganization, it remains no less true that other solutions\nwhich have been advocated have proved of limited value.\nThe pictures of desolation, exposing the sufferings\nendured by countries subject to economic embargoes, lead\nus to question the effectiveness of a solution that first and\nforemost punishes vulnerable and innocent populations.\nAfrica unfortunately has not been spared the cycle of\nviolence, despite the resolution of certain conflicts that\nhad long plunged this continent into fratricidal wars.\nOther hotbeds of tension remain, and Africa therefore\ncontinues to be at the forefront of the international\ncommunity\u2019s concerns. In the Great Lakes region, the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan and Somalia\ncontinue to be theatres for bloody and tragic events.\nFaced with all these situations of crisis and conflict,\nmy Government unreservedly supports the initiatives\nunderway to achieve negotiated settlements.\nAs for Sierra Leone, the Comorian Republic most\nfirmly condemns the violent coup against the leaders of\nSierra Leone, whom the people of that country \u2014\nwishing to break with the practices of a bygone age \u2014\nlegally and democratically chose.\nAs two sides of the same coin, at the international\nlevel, political and economic situations remain closely\nlinked. Thus this gloomy view of the international\npolitical landscape is made even darker by the\ndisheartening international economic environment.\nDespite the priorities and objectives set forth by the\nnew development strategies, we are obliged to note that\nthe results are less than expected. But we venture to hope\nthat the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on\nAfrica, which recently became a supplement to the New\nAgenda, will provide the impetus to speed up Africa\u2019s\nintegration into the international system of trade. Under\nthis system, small States continue to experience reduced\nprices for their raw materials, and their burden of debt is\nbecoming ever more unbearable.\n10\n\n\nThe Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, a small\nisland State and one of the least developed States, shares\nthe plight of those who are excluded from the international\nmarket. For, in addition to limited natural resources and the\nhigh cost of international transportation, it suffers from\nother political and structural restraints, which are slowing\ndown its socio-economic development.\nGiven the virtually chronic instability that has\ncharacterized the recent history of the Comoros, the\nComorian people are obliged to ask whether they have the\nright to peace and the right to life.\nThe Comorian people remain convinced that the search\nfor a just and lasting solution enabling it to embark on a\npath of harmonious socio-economic development\nnecessarily hinges on a final settlement to the question of\nthe Comorian island of Mayotte, which is under French\nadministration. I reserve the right to speak on this subject\nduring the debate. For there can be no doubt that the\npresent events in my country are a corollary to the\nincomplete decolonization and to the socio-economic crisis\nfrom which the Comorian people have suffered.\nIn conclusion, I associate myself with previous\nspeakers in extending to the brotherly and friendly\nGovernment and people of Indonesia condolences on the\ncrash of the aircraft that claimed so many lives, as well as\nour profound grief at the disaster that their country has\nsuffered as a result of the fires that are devastating their\nforests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a great pleasure for me to\ncongratulate Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on his election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly. I am confident\nthat under his able leadership, the work of the fifty-\nsecond session of the General Assembly will be a\nsuccess. I should also like to express our appreciation to\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia for the way in\nwhich he presided over the General Assembly during its\nprevious session. I also express my warm congratulations\nto His Excellency Kofi Annan on his election to the post\nof Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nThe relative euphoria created by the end of the cold\nwar is being replaced by a sense of realism. Although the\npossibility of a global confrontation has been considerably\nreduced, ensuring security and preserving stability\ncontinue to be a major concern for the international\ncommunity. We are witnessing the eruption of conflicts\nand serious tensions of a regional character as well as\nwithin individual States.\nCritical disparities in economic and social conditions\nexist around the globe. Large segments of the world\u2019s\npopulation live in conditions of dire poverty. Achieving\nsustainable development remains a great challenge for the\nworld community. On the other hand, the contemporary\nvalues we share, such as democracy, pluralism, tolerance,\nhuman rights and gender equality, require constant\nattention and effort.\n14\n\n\nAgainst this backdrop, international and regional\norganizations and, in particular, the United Nations, are in\nthe process of redefining their role and functions in order\nto cope with new realities and challenges. The discussions\nand recent efforts to reform the United Nations have\nproduced creative recommendations. Here, I wish to\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for his comprehensive\nreport. The far-reaching and substantive reform programme\nproposed therein satisfies our expectations. We strongly\nsupport the reform programme. On the other hand, we also\nshare the serious concerns of the Secretary-General with\nregard to the need to put the Organization on a sound\nfinancial basis.\nWe commend the Secretary-General for attaching the\nhighest priority to the goals of alleviating poverty and\nenhancing development. This is indispensable for the\nachievement and maintenance of peace and security, both\nwithin and among nations. In this context, we appreciate the\napproach taken by the Secretary-General that the envisaged\ncoordination of the Development Group must be done so as\nnot to weaken in any way the authority and independence\nof the institutions in question, the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) in particular.\nMaking human rights an integral part of all relevant\nUnited Nations operations is also a commendable goal. We\nare pleased to see an eminent personality at the head of\nUnited Nations activities in the human rights field. The\nfiftieth anniversary, in 1998, of the adoption by the General\nAssembly of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nwill provide the opportunity to reiterate our commitment to\npromote human rights all over the world.\nElevating the standard of human rights to its highest\nlevel is the foremost duty and obligation of each State\ntowards its own people. I should like to draw attention to\nthe human rights problems and to the discrimination faced\nin particular by migrant workers and their families in some\ndeveloped countries. The protection and promotion of their\nhuman, economic, social, cultural and political rights are\nmatters of major concern in the human rights field.\nIn this respect, Turkey supports the idea of a world\nconference on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and\nrelated intolerance. It would be a milestone in the decades-\nlong struggle waged by the United Nations against racism\nand racial discrimination.\nTurkey also supports the efforts envisaged in the\nreform programme to enhance the capabilities of the United\nNations to deal with transnational organized crime,\nnarcotics and terrorism. One of the most important threats\nour world faces today is problems related to drug abuse.\nThe special session of the United Nations to be held next\nyear will enable us to chart the way for the new measures\nthat must be taken in view of the threat posed by drug\ntrafficking.\nThe scourge of our age, no doubt, is terrorism. It is\na threat to human rights and democratic institutions. It\nviolates the most fundamental of all human rights: the\nright to life. It does not recognize boundaries.\nInternational cooperation is imperative in the fight against\nterrorism, and countries that refrain from participating in\nthis cooperation must be condemned by the international\ncommunity. We believe that the time has come to draft a\nglobal treaty on combating terrorism. In the same vein,\nwe think that terrorist crimes should be included within\nthe competence of the international criminal court that is\nto be established.\nThe Secretary-General has proposed significant\nmeasures that bring the arms-control agenda to the\nforefront of multilateral cooperation. Renewed emphasis\nshould be placed on the work of the Conference on\nDisarmament in Geneva, with a view to ending\nproduction of fissile material for weapons purposes.\nThe United Nations Register of Conventional Arms\nshould become an effective tool for monitoring arms\ntransfers. Likewise, the international community should\nexert vigorous efforts to end illicit arms trafficking as a\nkey element in the international struggle against terrorism.\nPeacekeeping stands out as one of the most\nsignificant undertakings of the United Nations. The\ndevelopment of the peacekeeping capability of the United\nNations remains a pressing need, and one that Turkey\nsupports wholeheartedly. Turkey has taken part, and\ncontinues to participate, in several peacekeeping\noperations.\nThe ongoing work aimed at improving the\nrepresentative character of the Security Council,\nincreasing the Council\u2019s effectiveness and efficiency and\nadapting it to current realities of the international\ncommunity is of particular importance. Reform of the\nSecurity Council constitutes the most serious attempt in\nyears to enhance the role and moral authority not only of\nthe Council, but also of the United Nations as a world\norganization.\n15\n\n\nWe have to ensure that the envisaged enlargement and\nfuture composition of the Security Council will correspond\nto the expectations of the largest possible segment of the\nUnited Nations membership. The reform process has to take\ninto consideration the fundamental changes which have\ntaken place on the international scene and recognize the\nability and readiness of a group of States to assume a\ngreater and more effective role. These States should be\ngiven the opportunity to serve on the Security Council more\nfrequently and on a more regular basis. Security Council\nreform is too important to be tied to the settlement of other\nissues; it must satisfy the general membership and enhance\nthe role and authority of the Organization.\nLocated at the crossroads of three continents and\nseveral regions, including the Balkans, the Middle East, the\nCaucasus, the Mediterranean and Central Asia, Turkey\nstands ready to play an even greater role in the maintenance\nof peace, security and stability in its wider region. Today,\nthe historical and cultural attributes of this vast geography,\nmore than ever, find expression in Turkey\u2019s foreign policy\nin terms of hopes and opportunities.\nA return to normalcy in Iraq and its reintegration with\nthe international community are of vital importance for all\ncountries of the region. Turkey supports the preservation of\nthe independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of\nIraq. Turkey has been fully complying with the United\nNations sanctions regime imposed on Iraq. On the other\nhand, it is a fact that the sanctions have also produced\ntotally unforeseen and negative effects on the economies of\nthird countries as well as on the economy of Iraq. Turkey\nstands at the forefront of those countries which have been\ndirectly and most adversely affected by the sanctions\nregime. This unacceptable situation reminds us of the very\npertinent remark of the former Secretary-General that\n\u201cSanctions are a measure taken collectively by the\nUnited Nations to maintain or restore international\npeace and security. The costs involved ... should be\nborne ... by all Member States and not exclusively by\nthe few who have the misfortune to be neighbours or\nmajor economic partners of the target country.\u201d\n[A/50/60, para. 73]\nWe expect the Security Council to expeditiously consider\nTurkey\u2019s application to the sanctions committee, and to take\nappropriate action.\nThe Middle East peace process has been the single\nmost important positive development in that fragile region\nin the recent past. However, events have recently taken,\nrather unexpectedly, an unfortunate and dangerous turn.\nIsraeli settlement activities in the occupied territories,\ncarried out despite the relevant Security Council and\nGeneral Assembly resolutions and despite the provisions\nof the peace accords, and abhorrent terrorist activities by\nthe enemies of peace have placed the peace process under\na very severe strain. We urge the parties to do their\nutmost to establish mutual trust, without which it will be\nimpossible to attain the objectives of the peace process.\nAfghanistan is another conflict area where the\ninternational community has so far been unable to help\nbring about a just and lasting solution. At present, even\nthe national unity of the Afghan people is at stake. It is\nmost unfortunate that the warring factions have been\nfervently pursuing the military option. Regrettably, one of\nthe major obstacles to convincing the factions that a\nmilitary solution is unattainable is the continuing supply\nof weapons, equipment and ammunition, along with\nmilitary involvement from outside.\nMy country has close historical ties with Afghanistan\nand the Afghan people. We feel very strongly about the\nindependence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and\nnational unity of Afghanistan. Taking this opportunity, I\nwish to reiterate Turkey\u2019s readiness to host, in\ncooperation with the United Nations, an intra-Afghan\nmeeting if and when all the parties are ready to\nparticipate.\nTurkey attaches particular importance to bringing its\nhistorical, close relations of friendship and cooperation\nwith Balkan countries to the highest level. We support the\nmultilateral initiatives aimed at securing peace, stability\nand cooperation in South-East Europe. Bosnia and\nHerzegovina continues to be a focus of the international\ncommunity. The preservation of the independence,\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is a continuing responsibility undertaken by\nthe United Nations. The full implementation of the\nDayton Peace Agreement has not yet been secured. While\nthe Federation has been working hard to implement the\nPeace Agreement, other quarters have been obstructing\nthe whole process. The successful effort in July on the\npart of the Stabilization Force (SFOR) to apprehend and\nbring before the Tribunal war crimes suspects who remain\nat large was a commendable move. In order to achieve\nreconciliation and ensure peace and security in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, it is essential to prove that crimes\ncommitted will not go unpunished. The return of refugees\nand displaced persons to their homes constitutes another\n16\n\n\nessential element for achieving lasting peace and stability\nin the country.\nSFOR, to which my country is a troop contributor, has\nplayed a significant role in Bosnia for the maintenance of\npeace and order since the signing of the Peace Agreement.\nWe believe that the continued presence of an international\nforce in the area is crucial for durable peace.\nAlbania and its people have passed through very\ndifficult times. Ensuring internal peace and stability in\nAlbania was a prerequisite for the preservation of peace and\nstability in the whole region. The multinational protection\nforce, in which, again, my country took part, succeeded in\nrestoring stability and order in the country. It was thus\npossible for the Albanian people to hold the parliamentary\nelections that paved the way for the resolution of the crisis.\nHowever, Albania still faces a difficult road on the\nway to full administrative, social and economic recovery.\nThe need for concerted international support remains.\nSharing close historical and cultural ties with the Albanian\npeople, Turkey will continue to be of support to Albania.\nIn our relations with Greece, our principal objective is\nto promptly tackle, through a substantive and result-oriented\ndialogue, the issues, mostly related to the Aegean, that still\nstand between our two countries. To this end, we have\nmade several appeals to Greece to agree to a dialogue and\nto begin a process with a view to settling our differences.\nWe do not rule out any agreed method of peaceful\nsettlement of our differences. Furthermore, we have\nunilaterally implemented a number of confidence-building\nmeasures in the hope that they would be reciprocated. We\nexpect that the group of \u201cWisemen\u201d, consisting of two non-\ngovernmental personalities from Turkey and Greece,\nrespectively, will be able to finally meet without further\ndelay. This group has the task of preparing a report to be\nsubmitted to both Governments with non-binding\nrecommendations for dealing with the issues.\nWe also eagerly await the translation into concrete\ndeeds, to promote better relations between our two\ncountries, of the understanding reached during the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit in Madrid\nlast July. Delaying this process by linking it to pre-\nconditions or artificial issues will not serve the interests of\neither country.\nIt is evident that our bilateral problems cannot be\nresolved by the effort of Turkey alone, and that mutual\ncommitment and the display of goodwill by both parties\nare imperative.\nThe Caucasus, as a gateway between East and West,\nattracts world-wide attention politically and economically.\nWe attach the highest significance to peace and stability,\nas well as to the preservation and consolidation of the\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the\ncountries of that neighbouring region. In this context, it is\nvitally important to bring about a just and lasting solution\nto the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia on the\nbasis of international law. The Nagorny-Karabakh dispute\nstill stands out as the principal obstacle to peace, security\nand enhanced bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the\nregion, since more than one fifth of Azeri territory\nremains under occupation. We urge that the Minsk\nprocess and the decisions reached in that process will be\ntaken seriously by all parties and that they will be\nimplemented.\nThe efforts made within this context by the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE)/Minsk Group should be carefully considered by\nall parties concerned. As a member of the Group, Turkey\nwill continue to contribute to these efforts.\nWe welcome the recent August meeting in Tbilisi\nbetween the parties to the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict\nand the signing of a statement by the leaders on the\npeaceful and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict.\nIn this regard, I would like to stress that Turkey is\ncommitted to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of\nGeorgia within its internationally recognized borders as\nstated in the Lisbon document of the OSCE.\nThe Cyprus question has been on the agenda of the\nSecurity Council for almost 34 years. This roughly\ncorresponds to the presence of the United Nations Peace-\nkeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) in the island. It may\nbe high time to find a real answer to why a solution has\neluded us all this time in spite of the dramatic changes\nthat have occurred both on the international scene and in\nCyprus, and despite all the commendable efforts of\nsuccessive United Nations Secretaries-General.\nAfter so many years it would be wrong, I believe, to\ncontinue to link a 34-year-old failure to the lack of\npolitical will or to the intransigence of one side or the\nother. We should ask ourselves where we failed, why the\nmistrust is still so deep in the island and whether we have\nmade the right diagnosis of this problem.\n17\n\n\nThere are two distinct peoples, two separate\nadministrations and two democracies on the island. Along\nwith these realities, bicommunality, bizonality and the\nmaintenance of the 1960 system of guarantees should be\nconsidered as incontestable foundations for a settlement. It\nis obvious that reluctance to recognize the realities in the\nisland, and the tendency to apply pressure to one side alone,\nhave not led us to a negotiated solution. The last two\nrounds of talks, in Troutbeck and in Glion, have solidified\nthis perception. We do believe that the lessons of the past\nand current developments on the international scene should\ncompel us to adopt a realistic approach to the Cypriot issue.\nThe establishment of an equilibrium between the legal and\npolitical status of the two sides to the dispute could be a\nstarting point for a rethinking process.\nTime is of the essence in initiating such a process\nsince one can foresee that in early 1998 a chain of events\nmight hinder efforts to find a negotiated settlement, and\nfurther increase the tension both on the island and in the\nregion. As witnessed in the recent face-to-face talks, the\npursuit of European Union membership by the Greek\nCypriot side has become the main impediment to progress,\nrendering the negotiating process increasingly meaningless\nand an agreed settlement even more elusive. Turkey and the\nTurkish Cypriot side firmly believe that efforts to carry\nforward this process will cast a shadow on the talks and\nmight destroy the very foundation of the negotiation\nprocess.\nOn various occasions, we have made our position clear\non the issue of European Union membership of Cyprus.\nThe 1959 and 1960 Treaties on Cyprus established an\ninternal institutional balance between the two communities\nof Cyprus and, simultaneously, an external balance of\ninterests between Turkey and Greece in their relationship\nwith Cyprus. These Treaties unequivocally preclude the\nmembership of Cyprus in any international organization, or\npolitical or economic union in which both Turkey and\nGreece are not members. Therefore, from a legal point of\nview, Cyprus can join the European Union only after a\nsolution and simultaneously with Turkey. From a political\npoint of view, this also appears to be the only viable\noutcome. We continue to entertain the hope that those who\nare concerned will act with an awareness of their historical\nresponsibility, as the time approaches toward a decision on\nan issue which will have a determining effect on the future\ncourse of events in Cyprus.\nThe deployment of S-300 missiles to southern Cyprus\nis another gloomy prospect. Coupled with ambitious\nrearmament efforts that the Greek Cypriot side has\nembarked upon, the purchase of highly sophisticated\nmissiles aims at jeopardizing the security of the Turkish\nCypriot people and of Turkey. We sincerely hope that in\nthe end wisdom will prevail and this project, which may\nseriously affect peace and stability in the entire region,\nwill be discontinued.\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece, in his\nstatement earlier this afternoon, referred in a misleading\nway to my country and to the Cyprus issue. My\ndelegation will speak in exercise of its right of reply at a\nlater stage in response to the allegations contained in that\nstatement.\nThe challenges of building and preserving peace and\nof achieving development are closely linked. The United\nNations, having successfully ended the first 50 years of\nits existence, is today well poised to take up these tasks.\nIt is up to each Member State to make the best effort to\ncontribute to this process. Turkey is determined to do its\nshare. We sincerely hope that this session of the General\nAssembly will mark one more important step towards the\nrealization of regional and global peace, stability, security,\ncooperation, solidarity and prosperity on the eve of a new\nmillennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Dominican Republic and\nits President Mr. Leonel Fernandez Reyna, I wish to\nconvey to our President our warmest congratulations on\nhis well deserved election to preside over this fifty-second\nsession of the General Assembly, at a time when the\nOrganization is taking important steps forward in its re-\nstructuring and modernization in order to meet the\nchallenges of peace and economic and social development\nfor our nations.\nOur delegation pays tribute to the outgoing\nPresident, His Excellency Mr. Razali Ismail, for his\noutstanding conduct of the deliberations during the last\nsession of the General Assembly.\n23\n\n\nWe take this opportunity to express our gratitude to\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his assiduity,\ndedication and hard work in guiding the Organization down\na road of reform and modernization that will make it\nstronger for the new millennium.\nWhile remaining faithful to the purposes and principles\nset forth in the Charter \u2014 the maintenance of international\npeace and security, cooperation for economic, social and\ncultural development, defence of human rights, and\nhumanitarian assistance \u2014 the United Nations should also\npromote and pursue a reform process which takes into\naccount the many changes that have taken place in a\ncomplex international scene. That scene is marked by the\nend of ideological confrontations and, at the same time, by\nincreasing levels of poverty and ethnic and religious\ntension, phenomena that pose a threat to our supreme\nobjectives of peace and development for our peoples.\nThe trend within the Organization in recent years to\nthe establishment of working groups, as well as the report\nof the Secretary-General entitled \u201cRenewing the United\nNations: A Programme for Reform\u201d, reflect the strong\nresolve of Member States to engage in a negotiation and\nconsultation process that could, once their distrust of the\npast is overcome, culminate in far-reaching changes in the\nvarious United Nations bodies. The Dominican Republic\nattaches special importance to the ongoing reform process,\ngiven that it is capable, while respecting the principles and\npurposes that gave birth to the Organization, of ensuring a\nmore democratic, transparent, representative and efficient\nsystem capable of facing the current challenges, especially\nthose of peace and the problems of poverty that affect the\npeoples of the world.\nIn this regard, the strengthening of the General\nAssembly, the main forum in which Member States are\nrepresented, cannot be postponed. It is imperative to\npromote a process of better coordination between the\nAssembly and the Security Council, so that the Assembly\ncan be properly informed, and hence make better\nrecommendations to the Security Council.\nAware of the need to strengthen the United Nations,\nthe Dominican Republic calls on this forum to adopt\nresolutions that can return to the Assembly its capacity as\nthe governing body of the Organization. In this regard, we\nwelcome the proposals of the Secretary-General designed to\nfocus the work of the Assembly on the highest-priority\nissues and to reduce the duration of its sessions as well as\nthe number of agenda items, so as to allow for their in-\ndepth study.\nThis reorientation should not interfere with the\nprinciple of sovereign equality, nor with the plural and\nuniversal character that the Organization has maintained\nover the more than half a century of its existence.\nReaffirmation of the democratic principles contained in\nthe Charter must constitute the basis for the current\nreform process.\nThe Dominican Republic proposes the establishment\nof mechanisms and working methods that would enable\nthe Assembly to allow reasonable time for making\nprogress on resolving certain conflicts. The problems of\npeace, security and development are multiple and\ncomplex. However, the commitment of the international\ncommunity expressed in the United Nations should go\nbeyond merely recalling them each year.\nThe aspect of the reform of the Organization that has\nraised the greatest debate is the one relating to the\nrestructuring and enlargement of the Security Council.\nOur country hopes that these reforms will promote greater\nparticipation by the membership as a whole. Thus, with\na more democratic base and a just and equitable selection\nprocess, the Council would be in a better position to meet\nits purposes and objectives. In this regard, the Dominican\nRepublic proposes the expansion of the Security Council\nfrom the current 15 to 25 members. This represents less\nthan 14 per cent of the total number of United Nations\nMember States, whereas in 1945 the figure was slightly\nabove 20 per cent.\nThe Dominican Republic, a founding member of the\nUnited Nations, has not yet been a member of the\nSecurity Council. In this new phase of its international\nrelations it has a strong interest in participating actively\nin bodies such as the Security Council and thus making\na direct contribution to the maintenance of peace, on\nwhich depends the very existence of nations.\nAn encouraging sign in the proposal of the\nSecretary-General is that the reforms are constantly\nrelated to the achievement of the founding principles of\nthe Organization, as expressed in the Charter. Thus, the\nresults of reform will be assessed primarily not on the\nbasis of the relationship of costs to benefits, but rather on\nhow they facilitate the realization of the Organization\u2019s\nobjectives.\nOur country supports the restructuring of the\nOrganization as long as it promotes more transparent,\nclearer and more coherent mandates and is directed\ntowards finding lasting solutions to the problems of\n24\n\n\nhunger, underdevelopment, extreme poverty and social\ninjustice, not forgetting the mandates related to\npeacekeeping.\nAllow me to refer to the issue of development. The\nincrease in global poverty and the gap between rich and\npoor countries is today the crucial problem for the\ninternational community. Poverty has a negative impact on\nprogress with regard to peace and security, human rights\nand the strengthening of democratic systems. We must\naddress forthwith the challenge posed by the tremendous\neconomic and social instability of a large number of\ncountries.\nThe Dominican delegation associates itself with the\ndeclarations of the Group of 77 adopted in July of this year,\nat the twenty-second meeting of the group coordinators,\nbecause we support strengthening the role of the United\nNations in promoting international cooperation for social\nand economic development. And we are in favour of\nmeasures that will promote the formulation and\ncoordination of policies and the provision of technical\nassistance to developing countries.\nOur country is making serious efforts to position itself\nfavourably in the world economy and to prepare for\nglobalization. For this purpose, it is currently conducting\nmajor economic, monetary, tariff and judicial reforms,\nwhile at the same time negotiating free-trade agreements\nwith countries of the region. Also, together with other\ncountries, it is formulating strategies to take advantage of\nfunds from multilateral sources.\nThe achievements of regional groups such as the\nCentral American Common Market, the Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM), the Andean Group and the\nSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), among\nothers, are indications of the strong willingness of the\nMember States to expand their capacities and reduce the\nnegative impact that the new rules of international trade\nhave on our economies and societies.\nAware of the commitment to promote at the regional\nlevel mechanisms for improving economic growth and\ncombating poverty, the Dominican Republic has in the past\nyear strengthened its relations with the countries of\nCARICOM and Central America, primarily through the\nparticipation of our President in the meetings of heads of\nState and Government. We are pleased to announce that our\ncountry will host the next summit meeting of Central\nAmerica, Belize and the Dominican Republic and that\nnegotiations for the establishment of a free-trade area\nbetween CARICOM and the Dominican Republic should\nbe concluded by the end of this year.\nAt this time allow me to welcome very\nenthusiastically the initiatives of the group of Central\nAmerican countries designed to strengthen Central\nAmerican unity. It is precisely these efforts that have\ngiven us faith and confidence in the future of our peoples.\nDuring this year, the Dominican Republic has\ndeveloped a programme for strengthening our links with\nour neighbouring country, Haiti. For the first time, bi-\nnational joint commissions are crossing the border to find,\nthrough dialogue, areas of mutual interest and solutions to\nsome of the problems common to both countries.\nRegarding our sister Republic of Haiti, we insist on\nthe need for the international community to discharge\neffectively the economic commitment it made in 1994\nwith regard to Haiti\u2019s economic recovery and\ndevelopment. The peacekeeping efforts in Haiti, which we\nhave promoted in the United Nations, will not be\nsufficient to achieve democratic stability unless they are\naccompanied by resources directed to alleviating the great\neconomic and social problems affecting that nation.\nWe must again emphasize how external debt is\nweighing down our economies. The onerous costs of\ndebt-servicing hinder our investing more in our peoples,\nthus deepening the levels of poverty. For the Dominican\nRepublic, the payment of outstanding debts and the\ninterest on them represents nearly 20 per cent of the\nnational budget. As a means of promoting development\nand social investment projects to combat poverty, we wish\nto propose to this Assembly that it take the necessary\nactions to reduce the burden of the external debt in those\ndeveloping countries that have demonstrated a high level\nof responsibility in handling their debt.\nWe reiterate the commitment of the United Nations\nto develop efficient measures for the struggle against\npoverty. Along with peacekeeping, development\ncooperation must constitute an overarching goal of the\nOrganization. No financing of activities for peacekeeping,\nthe defence of human rights or humanitarian actions will\nbe sufficient if we do not act responsibly in undertaking\nmultilateral cooperation for development.\nThe proposal to unify the various programmes of the\nUnited Nations devoted to development seems to us to be\na very important step towards the effective coordination\nof intersectoral policies, concentrating strategies and\n25\n\n\ndevelopment operations in a United Nations Development\nGroup. These initiatives must reorient resources toward\nareas of priority and achieve better coordination with\ninternational funding organizations.\nAllow me to express the position of my country\nregarding the evolution of the international situation. Peace\nis still among the highest aspiration of our peoples.\nDifferent points of the planet are currently involved in\nbloody conflicts which affect common citizens. Security is\ntoday not only a matter of the survival of political regimes,\nbut is linked to the very existence of human beings and\nnature.\nThe Dominican Republic expresses its solidarity with\nthe many conventions of the international community\ndevoted to eradicating corruption, terrorism, drug trafficking\nand money laundering. These evils disrupt the lives of our\npeoples, erode our institutions and prevent the strengthening\nof democracy.\nWe reiterate our conviction regarding the defence of\ndemocratic principles and institutionality. In this regard, my\ncountry is making tremendous efforts to reform and\nmodernize the State and the judicial system. Establishing\nmeans of promoting a transparent public administration,\ncontrolling all forms of administrative corruption, is among\nthe ongoing processes in our nation. Dialogue and the\nsearch for consensus among the branches of the State and\nbetween the executive branch and civil society have become\nthe polestar of public administration of the Dominican\nGovernment.\nThe Dominican Republic welcomes and associates\nitself with the measures taken by the United Nations to\nextend the presence of the peacekeeping forces in Haiti.\nTheir presence, we believe, strengthens the possibilities for\ndemocratic stability and will allow the people to take sure\nsteps on the road towards consolidating the country\u2019s\ndemocracy.\nWe stress the need for a definitive and peaceful\nsolution to the conflict in the Balkans, and we call upon the\ninternational community to strengthen its efforts to achieve\npeace in the Middle East. The crisis in that region, which\nhas deteriorated in recent months, demands special\nattention. We call for respect for all the agreements signed\nin recent years in order to restore peace in the region.\nWith regard to the Republic of China on Taiwan, the\nDominican Republic reiterates its position as presented by\nour President, Dr. Leonel Fernandez Reyna, regarding the\nneed for the international community to consider the\nimportance of that country, owing to its geographical\nlocation and given the fact that security and stability are\nof great significance for the peace and prosperity of the\nregion. We call for a constructive dialogue between the\ntwo sides of the Strait of Taiwan in search of mutual\nunderstanding and cooperation. We reiterate that parallel\nparticipation of both countries in the United Nations\nwould contribute to the maintenance of peace.\nOur country supports the efforts under way in\nvarious international conferences in Brussels, Oslo, and\nvery soon in Ottawa, regarding the process to achieve a\ntotal ban an anti-personnel landmines. The commitment\nto peace is a commitment to life. The international\ncommunity has an obligation to promote peace and to\ndefend life in all situations and circumstances.\nThe Dominican Republic, traditionally a peace-\noriented nation, does not produce or consume nuclear\nenergy for military purposes; it utilizes such energy for\npeaceful purposes. In this spirit, the Dominican President\nsigned the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\nduring his visit to the United Nations last year.\nVarious international conferences are currently\ndiscussing conventions on the use of nuclear energy. One\nof them is the convention to regulate the harm caused to\npersons and the environment by radioactive waste. The\nDominican Republic depends to a large extent on tourism,\na tourism of beaches and sun. The quality of our coastal\nwaters is vital for the sector\u2019s development, and any\ninternational radioactivity-related damage can mean the\ncollapse of this important sector of our economy. We\nappeal to the good judgement of the international\ncommunity to preserve our natural resources.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to the protection of the\nenvironment and natural resources. In this spirit, our\ncountry has acceded to the United Nations International\nConvention to Combat Desertification.\nThe Dominican Republic reiterates its commitment\nto defending and protecting human rights. In this\nconnection, it welcomes the efforts made by the United\nNations to concentrate the activities of the Office of the\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for\nHuman Rights. During this year we have had the\nsatisfaction of receiving two international missions on\nhuman rights, invited by our Government. A High-Level\nMission of the Inter-American Committee on Human\nRights (ICHR), of the Organization of American States,\n26\n\n\nvisited the country in June, and a mission of the Committee\nof the International Covenant on Economic, Social and\nCultural Rights of the United Nations, with headquarters in\nGeneva, is in the country at this very moment. These visits\nindicate the Government\u2019s interest in ensuring transparency\nof action to defend and protect human rights in the\nDominican Republic.\nAllow me to refer to the situation of the United\nNations International Research and Training Institute for the\nAdvancement of Women. Our country wishes to reiterate\nthe mandate given in Economic and Social Council\nresolution 1979/11 of 9 May 1979, in which it is clearly\nand explicitly stated that the headquarters of the Institute\nwould be established in the Dominican Republic, a\ndeveloping country.\nThe objectives that led to the creation of the Institute\nare still valid today. Research and training for the purpose\nof creating new ways for women to contribute to the\ndevelopment of their countries, in the light of women\u2019s\nneeds, are a priority. This concern was manifested at the\nBeijing Conference of 1995 and in the Platform for Action\nto follow up the agreements reached in that important\nforum.\nIn order to cooperate with the United Nations, the\nDominican Government not only donated the building\nhousing the Institute but also invested large amounts of\nmoney to renovate the building and adapt it to the\nInstitute\u2019s needs. This explains our surprise when, in 1993,\nthe United Nations Secretariat proposed the merger of the\nInstitute and the United Nations Development Fund for\nWomen (UNIFEM), without prior consultation with our\nGovernment and ignoring the headquarters agreement.\nHowever, in 1995 the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen, in its Beijing Platform for Action, confirmed the\nInstitute\u2019s mandate.\nWe hope that in the process of United Nations reform\nall the mandates approved by the Member States will be\nequally respected, since these States bear sole responsibility\nfor renewing or changing decisions adopted by the General\nAssembly.\nLastly, we welcome the summoning of Member States\nto reflect on and endorse these transformations in our world\nOrganization. The Assembly of the millennium proposed to\nus for the year 2000 would be an unprecedented forum for\nevaluating what we have done on the road to these reforms\nand for reiterating our tremendous faith and trust in the\nfuture of the generations of the twenty-first century.\nAt this fifty-second session of the General Assembly\nwe are faced with the historic responsibility of giving\ngreater reality to our hopes and expectations for a better\nfuture for humankind. The changes in those realities are\ntaking place faster than the changes in the structures we\nhave given ourselves for dealing with them. We have a\nunique opportunity to ensure that the reforms of the\nOrganization respond to the expectations of a United\nNations that is in line with the needs of the new age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish first of all to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your unanimous election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-second\nsession. There is no doubt that your election to this high\nposition is an acknowledgment of your personal competence\nand of the commitment of your country, Ukraine, to the\nUnited Nations and to the principles enshrined in its\nCharter.\nI also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor,\nAmbassador Razali, who discharged his responsibilities\nwith great wisdom and dedication.\nOur appreciation also goes to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for the great efforts he is making to\nensure the revitalization of the United Nations. In his\nreport (A/51/950) to the Assembly entitled \u201cRenewing the\nUnited Nations: A Programme for Reform\u201d, the\nSecretary-General has proposed measures that Member\nStates may take to democratize the United Nations and to\nenhance its effectiveness as an instrument with which to\ndeal with the challenges facing us as we enter the twenty-\nfirst century. I wish to assure the Secretary-General of\nEthiopia\u2019s full support for his initiative.\nEthiopia strongly believes that the reform and\nexpansion of the Security Council, which is long overdue,\nis at the heart of the United Nations reform process.\nBroad consensus has been established that the reform and\nexpansion of the Council must reflect the realities of the\nworld we live in today. The African position on the issue\nwas articulated at the thirty-third Summit of the Heads of\nState or Government of the member States of the\nOrganization of African Unity, held in Harare in June this\nyear. Ethiopia fully supports the African position.\nThis annual occasion affords us the opportunity to\nreiterate our commitment to the United Nations, to what\nit represents and to all efforts designed to address our\ncommon challenges.\nFor obvious reasons, some of the common dangers we\nhave faced have receded. The cold war, which by\ncommon consensus represented a threat to the very\nsurvival of humanity, is more or less behind us. There\nshould therefore be far greater opportunity today for\neffective international cooperation in many spheres, and\nespecially for real and tangible steps towards the\nrealization of genuine partnership in the fight against\npoverty and to enable those determined to remove the\nobstacles to their development to achieve their goals and\nfulfil the dreams and the hopes of their peoples.\nPeace and security can hardly be made durable and\nsustainable when conditions faced by the majority of\n12\n\n\npeoples in the developing countries generate hopelessness\nand when deprivations suffered today are made all the more\npainful because existing trends, instead of providing\nconsolation, promise more of the same, or worse. There is\nno more appropriate time than now, when we are preparing\nto celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, to renew our commitment\nand to rededicate ourselves to the realization of full respect\nof human rights in all their dimensions \u2014 civil, political,\neconomic and social rights, including the right to\ndevelopment and to be free from the shackles of poverty.\nFor Ethiopia, the eradication of poverty and the\npromotion of human rights are the cornerstones of the\ncountry\u2019s development strategies and democratic reforms.\nIn the immediate human rights programme, the Federal\nParliament plans to establish, as stipulated in the Ethiopian\nFederal Constitution, a national human rights commission\nand an ombudsman early next year.\nI wish to take this opportunity to bring to the attention\nof this Assembly the fact that leading members of the\nrepressive military regime that ruled Ethiopia in the 1970s\nand 1980s are being tried for war crimes and crimes against\nhumanity. These public trials are the biggest since\nNuremberg. However, Ethiopian courts have been denied\nthe opportunity to bring to justice all the perpetrators of\nthese crimes because many of those who should be tried in\nEthiopia are given safe haven in other countries, in\ncontravention of the provisions of the Convention on the\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. We\ncall on the States concerned to cooperate with Ethiopia and\nto take appropriate measures, in accordance with\ninternational humanitarian law, to ensure that those who are\nresponsible for crimes against humanity are brought to\njustice.\nInternational cooperation and the benefits that are\ndrawn from it, whether through bilateral or multilateral\nmeans, cannot be a substitute for what individual countries\nmust do to ensure that sustainable development is achieved\nand economic growth is realized. The responsibility to\nextricate our countries from the miseries of poverty, in the\ncase of those of us to whom this applies, lies with us. Aid\nalone, whatever its nature or quantity, would not do, even\nif it were to be made available.\nBut it is critically important that the international\neconomic environment evolve towards providing an even\nand level playing field, most particularly for those who, for\nvarious reasons \u2014 whether on account of their own\nmistakes or because of complex historical reasons, some of\nwhich are not of their own making \u2014 have stayed behind\nand have failed to put their countries on a track of\nsustainable development.\nIn this regard, we cannot but admit that not enough\nis being done, although much is said and promised. The\nold divisions might have been consigned irrevocably to\nthe past, but we cannot pretend that, though we continue\nto talk about our common humanity and the common\nvillage we occupy, the other divisions in the world are\nbeing addressed, let alone bridged. It would suffice just to\nlook at the situation of poverty in the world today and the\nlukewarm effort to combat and to eradicate it\ninternationally. The prediction that the level of poverty\nwill continue to grow in Africa is a challenge to the\ninternational community, as it is a reflection of the dire\ncondition of the continent.\nThe need to ensure food security for all should by\nno means be an impossible task to achieve for the world\nwe live in. Here as well, individual countries facing this\nproblem have to assume their responsibility in the first\ninstance, but the international community should also\nhave a role to play, including in the fight against\ncorruption \u2014 a disease which, as we all realize, has an\ninternational aspect in its grand dimension, and is\ntherefore not amenable to solutions taken at the national\nlevel alone. We in Ethiopia have made important progress\nover the last few years in building the basis for food\nsecurity for our peoples. But, as should be obvious, no\nguarantee can be secured on food security as long as\nproduction is totally dependent, as is the case in Ethiopia,\non rain-fed agriculture and when for a variety of reasons\nthe available water is not utilized for irrigation purposes.\nIt is in this connection that the equitable utilization\nof transboundary rivers becomes an issue that should be\naccorded the utmost urgency. Regional cooperation on\ninternational rivers will remain impossible if calculations\nbased on a zero-sum outcome favouring one side or\nanother govern the attitude of parties that could otherwise\nobjectively benefit from even-handed cooperation. With\nrespect to the question of the Nile waters, which affects\nEthiopia directly and regarding which there has been no\neffective cooperation among the riparians, we wish to call\non those involved to commit themselves to real and\ngenuine regional cooperation which is based on a win-win\nperspective, ensuring outcomes that are fair, equitable and\njust. A status quo which is unjust cannot endure; nor can\nit serve as a basis for building genuine cooperation.\n13\n\n\nWe are fully aware that at the level of the United\nNations, there have been a number of initiatives designed\nto help address the economic and social problems faced by\ndeveloping countries and to mitigate the effects of poverty\nand the impact of those conditions hindering the realization\nof sustainable economic development. However, despite\ngood intentions, their practical implementation has always\nbeen half-hearted and, at best, less than satisfactory and\ntherefore a source of disappointment. This applies to the\nUnited Nations Programme of Action for the Least\nDeveloped Countries for the 1990s, to the United Nations\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\n(UN-NADAF) and to other initiatives. It is our hope that\nthe United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on Africa\nwill not meet a similar fate.\nThis should not be regarded as criticism aimed at the\nUnited Nations. The Organization has no life and no\nactivity of its own independent of Member States. It is we\nMember States that have not sufficiently seized the\nopportunity opened up by the end of the cold-war division\nof the world and the international tension engendered by\nthat state of affairs.\nNot only within the United Nations but in general,\nboth in the bilateral and the multilateral areas, the\ninternational cooperation being made available to the\ndeveloping world today is not commensurate with the\nchallenges faced by those countries, nor does it do justice\nto the tremendous effort made by those countries, including\nmany in Africa, to make their economies business-friendly.\nA growing number of countries on our continent,\nincluding my own country, Ethiopia, have taken decisive\nmeasures to liberalize their economies, to cut Government\nspending, to institute sound macroeconomic policies and to\nenhance the role of the private sector and civil society.\nBecause of these serious efforts at belt-tightening and\nmonetary and fiscal discipline, there have been some\nencouraging developments over the past four years with\nregard to economic growth in a number of African\ncountries, including Ethiopia. In my own country, for the\nfirst time in more than two decades, the economy has\nbegun to grow, with a growth rate of over 10 per cent in\ngross domestic product having been achieved in 1996. The\naverage rate of growth over the past five years has been\nover 7 per cent.\nIn the area of governance and democratization, there\nis little doubt that, despite some setbacks, we in Africa\nseem to have made substantial progress over the past seven\nor so years. These gains need to be consolidated and\nenriched at a pace that can realistically be sustained, in\nconformity with the principles of indigenous ownership.\nOn the other hand, it would be stating the obvious to\nsay that our economies have been slated to go on\noperating in an international economic environment that\nis hardly friendly to growth and sustainable development.\nThe obstacles are diverse, and they are the same ones as\nwe have been reiterating in gatherings such as this and\nwhenever other opportunities have presented themselves.\nThe challenges we face involve market opportunities for\nour commodities, and they are also related to\nprotectionism, unfavourable terms of trade and the\ndifficulty associated with attracting a sufficient level of\nforeign direct investment. But most of all the challenges\nwe face involve issues related to the debt overhang and to\ndebt-servicing obligations. If there is one major\nimpediment to the development of countries such as\nEthiopia, that impediment must be identified as the debt\noverhang, which continues to necessitate the diversion of\nso many resources from productive activities that could\notherwise have accelerated growth and development.\nWe cannot, of course, be oblivious to the many\nproposals for debt relief and to the number of positive,\nalbeit inadequate, steps that have been taken in this\nregard. We recognize and appreciate the efforts made by\nthe Group of 7, the latest being the steps taken and the\npromises made at the Lyon Summit and since most\nparticularly the promise made in connection with debt-\nrelief measures for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\nDebt.\nBut even then, we cannot ignore the irony and the\nparadox we encounter with respect to debt relief. More\noften than not, to qualify for some of these debt-relief\nmeasures countries are expected to fulfil and meet\nconditions that are not absorbable even by economies that\nare far more advanced.\nThere is little doubt that one of the key prerequisites\nfor sustainable economic development is ownership of\none\u2019s economic programme. However, the conditionalities\nthat accompany debt- relief measures have been\nundermining ownership, thereby causing the loss of\npossibilities of adopting policies based on a realistic and\nappropriate assessment of local and specific conditions.\nThus, those condemned to a huge debt overhang which\nhas become unbearable are faced with a Hobson\u2019s choice:\ndebt relief with renunciation of ownership, or ownership\nwith no relief.\n14\n\n\nWhat we need in this day and age are genuine\npartnership and international cooperation based at least on\ncommitments to a level playing field and to conditions that\ndo not require those in the developing world to face\nimpossible choices. We are indeed hopeful that some of the\nlatest initiatives that countries are in the process of taking\nbilaterally and the emerging trends encouraging renewed\nfocus on Africa, such as the ministerial-level meeting of the\nSecurity Council convened last week, will help to increase\nthe international community\u2019s sensitivity to the development\nchallenges of Africa.\nGenuine partnership is required to make sustainable\ndevelopment a reality in Africa. We hope that the\nSecretary-General next his report to the Security Council\nand the General Assembly next February, will forward\nconcrete recommendations that would spare us a repetition\nof past disappointments.\nIt may not always be appropriate to see an immediate\ncausal link between poverty and lack of economic\ndevelopment, on the one hand, and conflict and lack of\nsecurity, including terrorism, on the other. But there is little\ndoubt that the despair, hopelessness and malaise engendered\nby poverty and economic and social difficulties provide the\nfuel for ensuring the degeneration into all-out fratricidal\nwar of political frictions, whatever their sources, with\nconsequent social breakdown and the implosion of societies.\nWe have seen too many times that once societies have\nimploded and State institutions have disintegrated, picking\nup the pieces becomes extremely difficult and a nearly\nimpossible task. Look at Somalia.\nBut even so, Africa has made some progress. The\nnightmare in Liberia is over, thanks to the immense\nsacrifices made by the members of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS). New hope\nis also generated by the demise of the Mobutu regime and\nby the entry onto the scene of the Democratic Republic of\nCongo, whose Government and people need the support and\nthe solidarity of the international community and of the\nUnited Nations. Despite some setbacks in Burundi, the\ncountries of the region and the facilitator, Mwalimu Julius\nNyerere, continue to persevere in their efforts to help bring\nabout a resolution of the conflict in that country.\nWe are pleased and encouraged that the effort being\nmade by Mr. James Baker in Western Sahara is showing\nsome important progress, and we are hopeful that the day\nmay not be too far off when it will be possible to hold a\nfree and fair referendum in Western Sahara. I wish to\nassociate myself with the Secretary- General in\ncongratulating the parties to the conflict on the positive\nresults they have achieved so far towards finding a\ndurable solution to the conflict. In the same spirit, I\nwould like to call on them to continue direct dialogue and\nto speed up the implementation of their agreements.\nWith respect to the situation in the Middle East, we\nare profoundly disappointed with the increasing\ncomplications that the peace process has encountered. It\nis our ardent hope that the confidence which had emerged\nearlier will be rekindled and that the troubled region will\nfind durable peace on the basis of justice for those to\nwhom it has been denied and security for all.\nApart from the conflict in southern Sudan, regarding\nwhich the member States of the Intergovernmental\nAuthority on Development (IGAD) have continued to\nprovide their assistance for the peaceful resolution of the\nproblem and the reversals of the gains in Sierra Leone\nand the Comoros, the major conflict in Africa which has\nremained intractable is the one the people of Somalia are\nfacing. Here too, important progress has been made and\nthe opportunities for making a real breakthrough have\nbeen created which the Somalis can ill afford to squander.\nThe framework for such a breakthrough has been made\npossible by the creation of the National Salvation Council,\nwhich is now preparing to hold a national reconciliation\nconference soon.\nWe all recall how many resources were spent by the\nUnited Nations for peace in Somalia. Now, with a small\nfraction of the resources and the efforts deployed earlier\nby the United Nations, the international community can\nposition itself to assist the realization of national\nreconciliation and peace in that war-torn country. The\nprocess of peacemaking in Somalia is at a very critical\njuncture. The international community and the United\nNations should not keep their distance from the effort for\npeace in Somalia.\nThe IGAD countries are determined to see to it that\nthis process succeeds. The support of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity and of our partners has been indispensable\nin this exercise, particularly in connection with the effort\nto ensure that those like Mr. Hussein Aideed are brought\non board the peace process. It is our firm view that no\none should be allowed to preempt and scuttle this process,\nand the unequivocal support of the United Nations for the\nongoing peace process spearheaded by IGAD is indeed\ncritical at this stage.\n15\n\n\nWe all recall how the proliferation of initiatives for\npeace in Somalia created complications in the past and\nhow, as a result, it was difficult for the international\ncommunity to speak with one voice for peace in that\ncountry. There is today a much improved situation which,\nhowever, needs to be maintained and consolidated, for\nwhich close coordination between the United Nations, OAU\nand the IGAD countries is an absolute necessity.\nSince the countries of the region have been made by\nproximity to see no luxury in the continuing lack of central\nauthority in that country, they have chosen to work on the\nbasis of the maxim that a less than good Government is\nbetter than none at all in Somalia. The consequence of the\nabsence of central authority in Somalia has been the growth\nof forces, including from outside the region, bent on\nensuring that chaos is continued and even expanded in the\ncountry and in the region \u2014 all the more reason, therefore,\nfor the United Nations and the international community to\ndo more to help the countries of the region and IGAD\nsucceed in the effort they are making for peace and national\nreconciliation in Somalia.\nIn this regard, I wish to pay tribute to Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan for the steps he has taken to revitalize\nthe United Nations role in Somalia and for the initiative he\nhas taken to find ways of maximizing the support of the\ninternational community and of the United Nations for the\nongoing peace process in Somalia. It is our hope that the\nsteps that will be taken on the basis of the\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General\u2019s Envoy will\nensure greater support of the international community for\nthe IGAD peace initiative and bring about a more effective\ncoordination between the external actors. We strongly\nbelieve that the Secretary-General\u2019s proposed trust fund for\nSomalia will go a long way towards providing support to\nthe peace process.\nIn this connection, I wish also to mention the\nOAU/IGAD joint mission to Somalia scheduled to take\nplace this month. The explicit aim of this joint mission is\nto make the Bossaso Reconciliation Conference\ncomprehensive and all-inclusive by encouraging all parties\nto participate and to convey a clear and unequivocal\nmessage that no group has the veto power over peace in\nSomalia.\nOur subregion, the Horn of Africa, has been one of\nthe regions of the world most affected by the consequences\nof war. The damage inflicted has been immense. Our region\nneeds a respite and a peaceful period to make up for the\nlost time. Because it is a region in which deadly and\nprolonged wars were conducted, weapons are easily\navailable and landmines strewn all over the place. In\nEthiopia alone, it is estimated that there are over 1.5\nmillion anti-personnel landmines, which continue to kill\nand maim innocent people, including women and\nchildren. In this connection, we attach great importance to\nthe adoption by the recent Oslo Conference of the draft\ntreaty on the ban on anti-personnel landmines. We appeal\nto those who remain outside the Ottawa process to sign\nthe draft convention in December this year, so that it can\nbe an effective instrument for getting rid of these deadly\nweapons.\nAs a founding Member of the United Nations,\nEthiopia has always been unreserved in fulfilling its\ncommitment to the Organization and in upholding the\nprinciples of its Charter. My country has also been a\nbeneficiary of various programmes of the United Nations\nsystem. Accordingly, the increasing effectiveness of the\nOrganization in all areas and the realization of universal\npeace and security are goals we cherish deeply.\nI wish to conclude by expressing the hope that the\nUnited Nations and the international community will not\nmiss the opportunities that have been created since the\nbeginning of this decade for fostering effective\ninternational cooperation, eradicating poverty and\nrealizing sustainable development in those regions of the\nworld that have not yet achieved it.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Brazilian\ndelegation, I would like to congratulate you, my dear\ncolleague, Hennadiy Udovenko, the Foreign Minister of\nUkraine, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-second session. Brazil has a significant\nand active community of Ukrainian origin. We Brazilians\nare thus very glad to see this session headed by a\ndistinguished son of the Ukraine, a country that is close to\nus.\nI want to express my recognition to the Permanent\nRepresentative of Malaysia, Ambassador Razali Ismail, for\nthe way he conducted the work of the fifty-first session.\nAmbassador Razali's dynamic presidency paved the way,\nthrough extensive consultation, for an imaginative and\ncomprehensive proposal to advance Security Council\nreform.\nI also pay tribute to our new Secretary-General, Mr.\nKofi Annan, chosen to oversee the political and\nadministrative challenges of modernization. He has been the\nfocus of justifiable expectation on the part of the\ninternational community at a difficult moment in the life of\nour Organization.\nWe welcome the Secretary-General's proposals for\nreform and institutional strengthening as a sign of renewed\nvitality within the United Nations. These proposals and\nAmbassador Razali's contribution will certainly warrant\nclose attention in the General Assembly and in parallel\nconsultation. We will help to consolidate a new spirit that\nshould inspire our Organization. This new spirit is called\nleadership - that driving force of history altering the\ncourse of events within countries and in the international\nscenario, opening new horizons, giving hope to the peoples\nof the world, seeing movement where some can only\nstand still.\nAmbassador Razali and Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan have, in a way, revived the leadership of the\ncreators of the United Nations. They have shown the\nsame idealism in establishing goals and pragmatism in\ncarrying them out. It was also the leadership of men such\nas Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld and Brazilian statesman Oswaldo\nAranha, twice President of this Assembly, that often led\nthe United Nations to a decisive role as a factor of change\nin international relations.\nThis kind of leadership has given the world a forum\nwithout parallel in history, a stage for negotiation and a\npolitical force in favour of international peace and\nsecurity. Although the United Nations has not always\nbeen able to prevent or to deter conflict, it has certainly\nreduced its occurrence and avoided some of its more\nserious consequences. For this reason, the United Nations\nhas been a mandatory reference, a sign of hope and a\nmoral force for world public opinion.\nWe are witnessing today the rebirth of this\nleadership, feeling its effects through a remarkable change\nin the heart and soul of our Organization. There is greater\noptimism. There is greater motivation among delegates\nand staff. There is greater expectation on the part of many\nGovernments. A new atmosphere of hope embraces the\nUnited Nations. This is something we must nurture and\npromote - something we must filter to the public in\norder to renew the trust of the international community in\nour Organization.\nThe agenda of the fifty-second session is vast and\nreveals the continuing complexity and the numerous\nconflicts of interests that animate international relations in\nour times. A new international dynamic combines three\npositive impulses: first, modernization and political and\neconomic opening in most countries; secondly, economic\nintegration in regional contexts, with multiple political\nand security benefits; and thirdly, the internationalization\nof the economy on a global scale.\nThese impulses tend to generate, foster and\nconsolidate international peace and security. They are\nbased on confidence and understanding and should allow\nus to prosper and achieve the desired material and\nspiritual results. Economic integration is increasingly the\ngreat bulwark of international peace and cooperation. It\nmust be given emphasis and further promoted.\n4\n\n\nPrecisely because of its many political and economic\nbenefits, integration is a defining trait of South America's\nreality, a direct consequence of democracy and economic\nfreedom. The Southern Cone Common Market\n(MERCOSUR), a new and powerful impetus for\ndevelopment in the region, is an example of the importance\nof integration. With democracy firmly rooted and a\ndynamic process of integration, South America has a\nreduced potential for conflict. It has the lowest rates of\nmilitary spending in the world and is following an\neconomic course based on strict government budget\ncontrols. Our priorities are stability and development. Arms\npurchases are compatible with the defense needs of Latin\nAmerican countries. They are aimed at replacing obsolete\nor exhausted equipment. Recently announced measures in\nthe strategic-military domain will not affect these\nfundamental parameters.\nThe concrete interests that bring together the countries\nof South America - trade, investment and the\nreinforcement of our international standing through\nMERCOSUR - are an unyielding factor of unity and\ncohesion. There is no threat of military destabilization in\nLatin America. There is no danger of an arms race in the\nabsence of political, economic and strategic conditions for\nsuch. A regional initiative towards self-imposed limitations\non conventional arms purchases is therefore unjustified. It\nwould be tantamount to disarming those already disarmed.\nOur preoccupation, on the other hand, should be the\nfight against the arms trade that sustains organized crime\nand drug trafficking. This is the real and grave problem\nperpetuating a major source of instability that has,\nunfortunately, also affected our region severely. Only\ndetermined and coordinated action on the part of the\ninternational community, especially through tighter controls\non the production and selling of weapons in private hands,\ncan curb or even suppress this trade; which feeds crime\ncartels and leads to violence, fear and desperation. Brazil\nstrongly urges all countries, and particularly those in the\nWestern Hemisphere, to intensify cooperation in the fight\nagainst arms trafficking.\nWe have taken great strides in areas of concern and\ngrowing visibility. Disarmament and, most specifically,\nefforts towards the elimination of anti-personnel landmines\nhave increasingly held the attention of the international\ncommunity. Today, we can speak of significant\naccomplishments, such as the signing of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the willingness of an\noverwhelming majority to make firm commitments,\nexpressed at the Oslo Conference on anti-personnel\nlandmines.\nIn these two instances, Brazil has sought to add its\nown efforts to those of the international community. This\nwas the main thrust of President Fernando Henrique\nCardoso's decision to submit the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to congressional\napproval. Brazil can and should make an additional\ncontribution to nuclear disarmament. We want to take a\nconstructive part in discussions within the framework\ncreated by the indefinite extension of the NPT, the most\nuniversal of disarmament treaties. This is also the\nguideline for our participation in the Oslo conference and\nin the Ottawa process. Brazil stands firmly behind the\ninterdiction of landmines in all types of conflict.\nThe international community should do everything\nin its power to help poor countries devastated by war.\nThey suffer the perverse and prolonged effects of\nlandmines irresponsibly planted in their territories. The\ninterdiction of anti-personnel landmines and their removal\nmust become an effective commitment on the part of the\ninternational community. This a question of ethics, a\nquestion of observing the most elementary principles of\nhumanitarian law. We hope that the international\nconvention agreed upon in Oslo and the important\ncommitments it enshrines find universal acceptance.\nThese positive tendencies might lead to the\nimpression that the United Nations is less in demand\ntoday than 10, 20 or 50 years ago. This is a false\nimpression. We are still subject to the effects of\ndisintegrating factors. Some are, unfortunately,\nby-products of new global trends, such as marginalization\nwithin and among nations, transnational crime and\nconflicts of interest that find expression through violence\nand the threat or use of force.\nThe persistent and overbearing nature of terrorism\ncontinues to be one of the most serious threats to\ninternational peace and development. It breeds despair and\nsuffering. In the Middle East, terrorism and intolerance\njeopardize a peace process that was once full of promise\nfor the peoples of the region. In other countries, some of\nthem in Latin America, terrorist acts reveal the existence\nof groups that still insist on employing tactics\nincompatible with the values of civilization and human\ndignity. We must not falter in condemning those who, in\ndisregard of all moral values, resort to cowardly violence\nin seeking to advance their own obscure purposes. Brazil\nis emphatic in repelling these practices and exhorts the\n5\n\n\ninternational community to spare no effort in the fight\nagainst terrorism, whatever its form or the alleged reasoning\nbehind it.\nIn addition, conflicts that had apparently been\nsurmounted by a spirit of understanding and constructive\naction on the part of the United Nations still show signs of\nresistance that demand a strong reaction from the\ninternational community. Angola is a case in point. Hope\nand promise cannot be constantly undermined by the factors\nthat have wrought so much destruction and suffering upon\na valiant people to whom we Brazilians feel so closely\nlinked. Angola is now a decisive test for the United\nNations. We cannot accept even the slightest possibility of\nregression. Brazil, currently holding the presidency of the\nCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, calls upon\nthe international community, and in particular the members\nof the Security Council, to exercise close scrutiny over the\nAngolan peace process. We must do everything to ensure\nthat the people of Angola once again find the road of\ndevelopment in a context of democracy and pluralism.\nThe United Nations has an irreplaceable role in a\nworld that still combines forces of integration and\ncooperation with forces of disintegration and aggression.\nBut we have allowed the United Nations to lose its strength\nas an instrument of universal peace and understanding and\nas a promoter of cooperation and development. We have\ndone this through inaction, through a lack of consensus,\nthrough obstructionism and through excessive politicization\nof issues. We must react to this situation. We must once\nagain find the cardinal notion of leadership.\nThe past few years have shown that reform of the\nUnited Nations can no longer be put off. We cannot lose\nsight of major institutional issues or waste further precious\nenergy. The report of the Secretary-General entitled\n\\\"Renewing the United Nations: A Programme for Reform\\\"\nis thus timely and opportune. The Brazilian Government\nwelcomes it with satisfaction and enthusiasm. The strength\nof our Organization derives from its universality and from\nthe all-encompassing nature of its mandate. The United\nNations must not be held to the performance of tasks better\nsuited to other international organizations or specialized\nagencies.\nWe cannot be made prisoners of inertia, nor must we\ncondemn our debates to irrelevancy. The General Assembly\nmust urgently move towards an agenda focused on what is\nessential to ensuring a relevant role for the United Nations\nin international affairs. For the United Nations to make a\ndifference and provide leadership in today's complex world,\nit must recover the original meaning of the Charter by\nconcentrating on its essential mission: maintaining\ninternational peace and security, promoting justice and\ninternational law, strengthening cooperation for\ndevelopment, protecting human rights and providing\nhumanitarian assistance.\nMember States must create political conditions for\neffective action by the United Nations and make the\ncommitment to setting priorities and eliminating the\nsuperfluous. Only then will our Organization as a\nwhole - not just the Secretariat - be able to devote\nitself to those fundamental tasks. The Secretary-General\nhas assumed a leadership role by putting forth ideas that\nmust be objectively discussed by all Member States.\nBrazil is committed to working constructively with Mr.\nKofi Annan on his proposals to strengthen our\nOrganization.\nBrazil has taken an active part in the debate on\nreform of the Security Council. We have adopted an\nopen-minded and constructive approach because we\nbelieve this to be a central element in the reform of the\nOrganization. Brazil has upheld a concept of reform that\nwould strengthen the Council and the United Nations as\na whole. It is not geared to the individual interests of any\none country. We want the Council to be representative of\ncontemporary international realities, as it was in its early\nyears.\nThe Council must be enlarged both in its permanent\nmembership, to take account of the industrialized and the\ndeveloping worlds, and in its non-permanent membership,\nto allow for more frequent participation by interested\nStates. We repudiate all discrimination in the conception\nor assignment of new seats. We must not create a third or\nfourth category of member. This would weaken and\ndepreciate the participation of the developing world, and\nof Latin America in particular, in the reform process and\nin an enlarged Council.\nWe have always said that in identifying new\npermanent members we must exercise realism and\npragmatism by means of a democratic selection process\nthat leads to universally recognized representation without\nrenouncing regional support. Brazil has expressed,\nthrough President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, its\nwillingness to accept the responsibilities of permanent\nmembership in the Security Council, if called upon by the\ninternational community to do so. In such a case, Brazil\nwould be determined to carry out the role of permanent\nmember as the representative of Latin America and the\n6\n\n\nCaribbean. We want our region to be present in the\nSecurity Council on a permanent basis and, through ample\ncoordination and consultation, to have an even stronger\ncollective voice.\nThe Brazilian Government notes with satisfaction that\nwe are moving, if not towards consensus, at least in the\ndirection of a significant majority in favour of certain basic\nnotions about how to reform the Security Council,\nparticularly enlargement of its permanent membership to\ntake account of the developing world. The proposal by\nAmbassador Razali, presently under discussion in the\nWorking Group, constitutes a firm basis for a negotiating\nprocess leading to a decision by the General Assembly.\nAmbassador Razali has helped us regain the ideal of\nCouncil reform as a means of strengthening the entire\nOrganization. Our priority is now to define the most\nsuitable format for an enlarged Security Council. This must\nbe the prime focus of attention.\nThe international community needs a strong, efficient\nand ever-present United Nations. We will continue to rely\non the political body with the universality and moral\nstrength that, in the history of humankind, only the United\nNations has been able to muster. We must display in this\nsession the determination to create the conditions for the\nUnited Nations to be an effective instrument for promoting\ninternational peace and security. The same spirit of\nleadership that we have seen in the Secretary-General and\nin Ambassador Razali has driven many delegations. A new\nwillingness to make a constructive contribution to the\nSecurity Council reform process and to other reforms is\nclearly felt by Member States. There is a new thrust to\nnegotiations. There is leadership, as well as carefully\ncrafted proposals. We must take advantage of this unique\nopportunity in the history of the United Nations. We must\nnot let the moment pass. Reform has become more than a\nkey concept; it has become the order of the day for the\nUnited Nations in 1997.\nLet us do it with that \\\"fierce urgency of now\\\" felt by\nMartin Luther King, a symbol of political leadership and of\nthe forces of change in our century. \\\"This is no time\\\", said\nKing in his most famous speech,\n\\\"to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the\ntranquillizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time...\\\".\nLet us do it, then.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, at the outset, to express to\nMr. Udovenko, on behalf of my country\u2019s delegation, our\n21\n\n\nwarm congratulations on his election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at this session. His election to that\nhigh post is a tribute of the international community to his\nfriendly country and a reflection of the confidence of the\nMembers of the United Nations in his ability to shoulder\nthis heavy responsibility.\nBy the same token, we express our great appreciation\nto his predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail, for the great\nefficiency with which he conducted the affairs and\ndeliberations of the Assembly at its previous session.\nFurthermore, I wish on this occasion to express my\ncountry\u2019s gratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the\nunrelenting efforts he has made since his assumption of his\npost to enhance the role, efficiency and effectiveness of the\nUnited Nations.\nSome people have thought that the end of the so-called\ncold war would be conducive to the creation of favourable\nconditions for equitable and healthy international relations\nbased on mutual respect and fruitful and constructive\ncooperation among human communities. However, what the\nSecretary-General has rightly described as a period of\n\u201cfrenzy\u201d has not taken long to lay such assumptions to rest\nand wreak havoc in several regions of the world. This\nfrenzy is the product of the new unipolar system in which\none country sits alone on the top. This singularity has\nemboldened that country to continue to spread its\nhegemony, expand the area and scope of its aggression and\nimpose its conditions, concerned only with its own interests\nand ignoring those of others. It has even fought against the\ninterests of its own allies. Those who have exposed these\ntrends and refused to pay homage and obeisance except to\nGod have been labelled outlaws.\nThe end of the so-called cold war deprived the world\nof that balance of power which had, in the past, provided\na protective umbrella for all small, poor and weak\ncountries. It has even protected other countries as well. The\nmost important need on the international scene today is to\nwork seriously to establish any kind of international balance\nto preserve the little that has remained of States\u2019\nindependence, freedom of thought and action, and then to\nreverse the negative effects of the period of frenzy, which\nis still with us, although it has somewhat receded.\nThe United Nations has been manipulated by the only\nsuper-Power, which sits alone at the top, against certain\npeoples, States and even regions that have joined this\nOrganization in search of protection, security, peace and\ncooperation. The United States of America has managed to\npush the Security Council into adopting resolutions outside\nits competence against whoever has said \u201cno\u201d to unilateral\nhegemony and tyranny or defended the independence of\ntheir countries and their ability to take free decisions and\nhave free choices. These resolutions adopted at the height\nof the period of frenzy at the beginning of this\ndecade were falsely described as being consistent with\ninternational legality, while in reality there was nothing\nlegal or international about them. They were adopted\nthrough diktat and by the use of threats directed at the\ncapitals of the States concerned in order to ensure their\ncontinued applicability.\nParagraphs 102 and 103 of the report of the\nSecretary-General on the reform process (A/51/950)\nclearly and unequivocally show that these resolutions not\nonly lack international legality but also that they should\nbe reviewed and rescinded.\nGlobalization which means only the imposition of\nthe interests, language, culture, values and customs of the\none and only Power at the top is not globalization. It is\nmerely a crowning of that Power as head of the entire\nworld. Proof of this can be found in the great\ncontradiction between words and deeds. Its leaders call\nfor the liberalization of international trade, then enact\nlegislation imposing one embargo after another on the\nmovement of goods and capital against those countries\nand peoples that want to remain independent and free in\ntheir decision-making. They punish, through their own\nlegislation, whoever in the world cooperates with it.\nWhat was published today in The New York Times\nregarding cooperation between a company located in a\nState which is an ally of the United States, and Iran is the\nclearest evidence of the truth of what we are stating.\nThey are the ones who dictate economic embargo\nresolutions against countries and peoples and then\nunilaterally follow up their implementation. Moreover, it\nis these same quarters that work to disarm countries and\nselectively destroy whatever weapons they have, while\nallowing only themselves and their allies, to the exclusion\nof everyone else, to manufacture, possess and acquire\narmaments. The same quarters provide money, men,\ntechnology, and know-how to a select group of countries\nin order that they may establish and develop a military\nindustry capable of producing all types of conventional\nweapons and even weapons of mass destruction, and if\nnecessary would send their armies and fleets to fight at\ntheir sides.\n22\n\n\nThey call for the protection of human rights while\nrefusing to acknowledge human rights for anybody but their\nown people. This is the case in the denial of the right of the\ntwo Libyan citizens to a fair and neutral trial.\nIt is the same country that calls for the combating of\nterrorism and then goes on to label self-defence, the\ndefence of honour and resistance against foreign occupiers,\nas terrorism. They call for democracy and then support and\nfinance those who oppose democracy, especially if those\nwho come to power are against the influence in their\ncountry of the only super-Power.\nThese examples of the contradiction between words\nand deeds, between propaganda and the executive policies\nand legislative positions of the very same Power, clearly\nshow that the call for globalization is not intended for the\ngood of the world. In reality the world reaps nothing but a\nname.\nThe African continent, which is considered the most\nunderdeveloped part of the world as we stand at the end of\nthe twentieth century, is not, in fact, responsible for its\nbackwardness. A brief review of Africa\u2019s history and a\ndiscerning look at its present state of affairs readily show\nthat all the problems, without exception, Africa faces \u2014\nwhether they be problems of political instability in some of\nits regions or economic underdevelopment in most, if not\nall, its countries \u2014 are caused by those who colonized and\ndrew the political borders of the African countries.\nNot one single African country has drawn its own\nborders with its neighbours. It was the colonial countries\nwhich did that, dividing tribes, clans and communities\namong different countries and thus sowing the seeds of the\ncurrent social tensions in many parts of the continent at an\nearly time. This was a deliberate act carried out under the\ninfamous policy of \u201cdivide and rule\u201d.\nNot only did they draw the borders, but they also\nlooted the natural resources, which they now monopolize.\nAny country that dares to free its resources is quickly\nsurrounded by embargoes. They use all the financial and\neconomic institutions, including the so-called international\ninstitutions, in a manner that deprives these countries of any\nchoice but to surrender to their conditions or face the\nconsequences of confronting them. The responsibility for\nwhat happened during the past epoch and for what\ncontinues to occur in our African continent should be\nshouldered by those who caused it in the first place.\nThe slogan \u201cAfrica should help itself\u201d, though\nseemingly innocent, is misleading, because it involves an\nattempt at avoiding the responsibility for the\nconsequences of the acts of those who sowed the seeds of\nall this in the not-so-distant past. This is still fresh in the\nmemory of current generations. Those who do care for\nAfrica do not impose conditions for assisting Africa.\nAfrica is ready to cooperate with those who are willing to\nhelp, but cannot accept dealing with those who dictate to\nit.\nMy country would like to endorse the position\noutlined here in the General Assembly and at the Security\nCouncil meeting devoted to Africa by President Robert\nMugabe, President of Zimbabwe and current Chairman of\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU). This is the\nposition of all Africa and all Africans. From this rostrum,\nmy country salutes President Mugabe. We confirm what\nhe said: Africa does not ask for charity from anybody.\nWe urge those who seek permanent membership in\nthe Security Council to remember Africa all the time, and\nnot only when they need the votes of its countries in the\nGeneral Assembly to help them take over posts and seats\nin various councils and committees. We urge them, and\nothers, to review the standards and criteria for their\nrelations with the African countries before it is too late.\nAllow me to recall what one of Africa\u2019s leaders said\n15 years ago. His country used to export one ton of cocoa\nin order to import one tractor. Now it has to export 12\ntons of cocoa in order to import one tractor. This\nastronomical increase in the price of manufactured goods\ncompared with the price of raw materials in the space of\n15 years is a sufficient reply to all the questions raised\nabout the relationships of others with Africa in various\nfields. This very example explains some of the causes of\nthe suffering in several African countries, at various\nlevels.\nWe would like to say here to both old and new\ncolonialists alike: Hands off Africa, then Africa will know\nhow to help itself.\nThe truth of what we have been saying all along\nconcerning the Palestinian question has been proved to\neverybody. Everyone here has seen and heard about the\npractices of the Israeli occupation authorities in Palestine\nand the other occupied Arab territories, from the Golan to\nsouthern Lebanon, or rather, all of Lebanon. The Security\nCouncil held meetings to consider the situation in these\nterritories, but those meetings were aborted by the\n23\n\n\nAmerican veto. The General Assembly held a special\nsession on the matter, and what was the result? Nothing.\nThis would explain what the region is facing these days,\nand what is in gestation now is even more dangerous than\nwhat is being witnessed today.\nThe Iraqi people are not only starving and dying; they\nare suffering from something more serious than hunger and\nmore dangerous than death. It is known that some Iraqi\nindividuals have been forced to sell body parts, such as\nkidneys, to feed their children for a little while. What kind\nof international legality can justify the continued application\nof sanctions that lead to such results? How can any claims\nbe accepted now from those who pay lip service to so-\ncalled human rights, yet do not apply them except to serve\ntheir political ends? How is it then possible to allow the\npartition of Iraq and the violation of the inviolability of its\nborders and its territory by foreigners and their armed\nforces? It is the United Nations which is responsible for\nthis situation, since it created the conditions that led to this\nsituation and has provided the cover for what is happening\nin Iraq. It is now the United Nations responsibility to\nredress this situation to which it has given rise.\nMy country overlooks the Mediterranean, with a coast\nthat extends for about 2,000 kilometres. That is why we are\nvery keen on making the Mediterranean a lake of peace and\ncooperation for its coastal States. However, this is made\nimpossible by the presence of foreign military bases and\nforeign fleets that undermine the region\u2019s stability and\nrepresent a permanent source of danger. This presence has\nbeen the cause of our continued concern, because we have\nsacrificed half our population for our freedom. Three times\na year, we celebrate the anniversaries of the evacuation of\nforeign troops from our country. Peace, stability and\ncooperation in the Mediterranean will be possible only\nwhen foreign military bases are eliminated, when foreign\nfleets are withdrawn from its waters.\nMy country, like the rest of the developing world,\nwelcomes the international conventions aimed at the\nprohibition and elimination of weapons of mass destruction.\nWe believe that this is in the interest of mankind as a\nwhole. However, the resumption of nuclear tests, under any\npretext, is a great source of disappointment because they\nare a violation of the international conventions concluded\nin this field. The possession by Tel Aviv of nuclear\nweapons has placed the entire eastern Arab region under a\ndirect threat, constant dangers and definite instability.\nWithout technical and financial support, without the\nexperts and scientists who are part and parcel of this\nsupport, such weapons would not have been produced in\nthe region. It is well known \u2014 indeed, it has been\ndeclared \u2014 that tests are now being conducted on long-\nrange missiles that could deliver these weapons of mass\ndestruction to their targets in Arab and Muslim lands\nalike. Tests are also being conducted on anti-missile\nmissiles, as part of the strategic cooperation between\nWashington and Tel Aviv.\nOn the other hand, all Iraqi weapons have been\ndestroyed. Preparations are being made to destroy all the\nweapons of the Arabs and Muslims, who are helpless and\nwhose territories are occupied. Alliances are being forged\nto surround the Arabs and Muslims so as to prevent them\nfrom ever becoming powerful and so as to secure for\nWashington their oil, their gas and their markets.\nThis is the truth, however bitter it may be for us\nArabs and Muslims to swallow. My country would like to\nalert the world to the real sources of danger, not the\nfictitious ones \u2014 that is, those being used to fabricate\ncauses and pretexts to justify the destruction and\nrecolonization of the rest of the world.\nIt is not Libya, nor Syria, nor Iraq, nor Iran nor the\nSudan which constitute any danger, by any measure, to\nthe security of the region or the security and peace of the\nworld. The real danger to international peace and security\nlies in Washington and Tel Aviv, and those who emulate\nthem. They both possess and manufacture weapons of\nmass destruction. Washington manufactures them and\nWashington exports them. This is while the countries to\nwhich I have referred do not manufacture weapons and,\nmoreover, have been prevented by America from\nimporting any such weapons. America has imposed an\ninternational arms embargo against those countries. It has\ndestroyed Iraqi weapons, and is now preparing to destroy\nthe conventional and even the obsolete weapons possessed\nby others.\nThis is the law of the United States against which\nthese countries have rebelled. Thus they were labelled\n\u201crogues\u201d. This is the new and old form of discrimination.\nThis is the newest form of anti-Semitism.\nWe call for emptying the region of the Arab East of\nweapons of mass destruction, which Tel Aviv owns. The\nplants that manufacture these weapons should be\nsubjected to international safeguards and controls. We\nalso call for investigating the financial and technical\nsupport that enabled Tel Aviv to produce these weapons.\nWe must criminalize this support and those who provide\n24\n\n\nit. The agreements of military strategic cooperation between\nWashington and Tel Aviv are hostile instruments, targeting\nthe region as a whole and its peoples. This provides\nevidence of the real intentions of the United States towards\nthe region and its peoples, voids its allegations and\nargumentations with respect to disarmament and reveals its\nintentions.\nWe highlight these issues to show the world the extent\nof the injustice to which we have been subjected and to\nwhat extent the United States of America is deceiving\neverybody.\nThe United States used to have five military bases in\nmy country. It had monopolized the production and export\nof Libyan oil and gas. The United Kingdom also had a\nnumber of military bases in Libya. Through its own\ncompany, British Petroleum, it also produced and exported\nour oil.\nWith the advent of the revolution of 1 September\n1969, Libya immediately evacuated the military bases of\nthose two countries and later liberated its oil wealth from\ntheir companies.\nHowever, under international conditions that the\nSecretary-General has rightly called a period of frenzy, the\ntwo countries thought that the time was ripe for a return to\nwhat they were forced to relinquish and to regain control of\nthe 2,000-kilometre-long Libyan coastline, adjacent to the\nthree old continents of Africa, Asia and Europe. They\nbelieved the time was ripe to regain control of my\ncountry\u2019s oil, gas and market, as well as neighbouring\nmarkets. Once finished with the Gulf War, they turned their\nattention to Libya. However, the two countries were unable\nto find a pretext to realize their ambition of a new return to\nLibya except by resorting to allegations, which came to be\nknown later as the Lockerbie case.\nWhat is the real truth about Lockerbie? In brief, and\nprecisely, it is as follows. First, both the United States of\nAmerica and the United Kingdom of Great Britain are\naware, more than anybody else, that Libya has nothing\nwhatever to do with this aeroplane and the tragic incident\nthat killed its passengers and crew.\nSecond, both the United States of America and the\nUnited Kingdom claim that two Libyans placed a time\nbomb in a bag on board a Maltese Airlines flight that took\noff from Malta, and that the bag was unaccompanied\nbaggage. They claim that this very bag, which was not\naccompanied by a passenger, was transferred in Frankfurt\nairport from the Maltese Airlines aeroplane to an\nAmerican aeroplane destined for London. Once again,\nthey say, this same bag was transferred in London airport\nfrom the aircraft originating in Frankfurt to Pan Am\nFlight 103, which later took off from London and\nexploded over Lockerbie, Scotland.\nCan the Assembly imagine how an unaccompanied\nbag can move by itself from one airplane to another and\nfrom one airport to another with such accuracy?\nThird, the Government of Malta investigated the\nmatter and found that there were no unaccompanied bags\non the flight in question. Malta announced the results of\nthe investigation at the time.\nFourth, the competent authorities in Germany, in\nturn, investigated the question and found nothing to\ncorroborate the story about the bag.\nFifth, in any case, my country, despite the known\nobjectives of the authors of the accusation, dealt seriously\nand pragmatically with the accusation. We informed all\nconcerned parties that we had begun implementation of\nthe provisions of the 1971 Montreal Convention for the\nSuppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil\nAviation. The legal authorities in Libya began exercising\ntheir legal jurisdiction in accordance with that\nConvention.\nSixth, my country asked the two countries concerned\nto hand over to Libyan judicial authorities the results of\ntheir investigations so they could be used in our\ninvestigation. This request was rejected.\nSeventh, my country then asked the two countries to\nsend investigators to Libya to participate in the\ninvestigation. Once again they refused.\nEighth, my country then offered to send its judicial\nofficials to meet with the competent authorities in both\nthe United States and the United Kingdom to peruse the\nfile on this question. This offer was turned down.\nNinth, Libya also offered to let a neutral party or\nparties to carry out the investigation. The two countries\nrefused that offer.\nTenth, once again, my country proposed that the\nUnited Nations should carry out the investigation. That\nproposal was rejected.\n25\n\n\nEleventh, in a letter addressed to the Foreign Minister\nof the United Kingdom and the United States Secretary of\nState by the Secretary of the General People\u2019s Committee\nfor Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation, my\ncountry requested that article 14 of the 1971 Montreal\nConvention be invoked. That request was refused.\nTwelfth, Libya proposed resorting to the International\nCourt of Justice to decide the case. That proposal was\nturned down by the other parties. And when my country\nunilaterally took the case to the International Court of\nJustice, the parties concerned quickly turned the whole\nissue from a legal to a political one, submitting it to the\nSecurity Council to prevent the International Court of\nJustice from deciding the case. Here we have the Security\nCouncil dealing with an issue pertaining to two citizens of\na country. The issue is now five years old. So the issue is\nbefore the Security Council precisely to prevent the\nInternational Court of Justice from deciding the case since\nthe matter was put before the Security Council, despite the\nfact that Libya, naturally, had resorted to the International\nCourt of Justice before the matter was even referred to the\nSecurity Council.\nThis is how this legal question was politicized. When\ndid that occur? This was done at the peak of the \u201cfrenzy\u201d\nperiod, on 21 January 1992. Nobody at the time could say\nno to the United States of America. As we all know, the\nSecurity Council, under well-known and frankly recognized\npressures, adopted resolution 731 (1992) which did not\nstipulate any surrender of the suspects, but requested a\nresponse to the demands of the countries concerned. I\nrepeat, it did not provide for surrendering the suspects.\nThirteenth, my country has fully responded to the\nprovisions of the resolution both in terms and content by\ncooperating with the United Kingdom on the question of\nthe Irish Republican Army, and with the French\ninvestigating judge in all the demands he made.\nFurthermore, we agreed to a trial for the two Libyan\nsuspects in a fair and neutral court.\nFourteenth, the aim of both the United States and the\nUnited Kingdom has not been to discover the real culprit in\nthis regrettable and tragic airplane incident. They already\nknow who the responsible party is. Their real objective has\nbeen to use the whole issue, including the human blood that\nwas shed, to achieve their own political objectives which I\nhave already elucidated. To achieve that end, they exploited\nthe Security Council once again, pushing it to adopt\nresolution 748 (1992) which imposes a near total embargo\non Libya and its dealings with the rest of the world. The\nCouncil also adopted resolution 883 (1993), which\ncomplemented the previous resolution.\nFifteenth, in the face of all this intransigence and\narrogance, when all efforts and mediation failed to\nconvince the two countries concerned to opt for dialogue\nand negotiations; since they had earlier unilaterally\nsevered their diplomatic relations with my country; and\nbecause my country has no extradition treaty with either\nof the two countries, we resorted to regional and\ninternational organizations. Today, we would like to put\non record, as always, our deepest appreciation to these\norganizations for their support and for their stand in\nfavour of what is right. Those organizations, let us recall,\nrepresent more than two thirds of the international\ncommunity.\nWe hasten to confirm that the other third is not\nagainst us; rather, its States are simply not members of\nthose organizations. The League of Arab States, the\nOrganization of African Unity, the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement have\nall supported my country and expressed their appreciation\nfor my country\u2019s flexibility in our handling of the issue,\nas well as for the positive initiatives we have proposed.\nSixteenth, the League of Arab States and the\nOrganization of African Unity, through the Harare\nsummit, under the chairmanship of President Robert\nMugabe, have proposed that the trial of the two suspects\nbe held in a neutral third country to be determined by the\nSecurity Council; that the two suspects be tried by\nScottish judges, under Scottish law, at the seat of the\nInternational Court of Justice in The Hague; or that a\nspecial criminal tribunal be established to try the two\nsuspects at the seat of the International Court of Justice in\nThe Hague.\nSeventeenth, both the Secretary-General of the Arab\nLeague and the Secretary-General of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity came to United Nations Headquarters with\nthe resolutions of their respective organizations in hand,\nresolutions that are supported by the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement.\nThey submitted these resolutions to the Secretary-General\nof the United Nations and to the President of the Security\nCouncil and its member States. What was the reaction of\nthe United States and the United Kingdom? Both rejected\nthe requests made by other members of the Council and\nused the Council\u2019s work mechanism \u2014 so-called\nconsensus \u2014 to reject all proposals submitted by their\nmajesties and excellencies, the kings and presidents of the\n26\n\n\ntwo organizations. Naturally, this was a shock to both\nregional organizations because they were fully and\narrogantly ignored.\nEighteenth, on 25 September of this year, during the\nSecurity Council\u2019s ministerial meeting on Africa, the entire\nmeeting became a forum for discussing the issue when it\nwas raised by His Excellency President Robert Mugabe,\nPresident of Zimbabwe and current Chairman of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), in his address to the\nCouncil. Again, in the name of my country, its leader and\npeople, I wish to express again our gratitude to President\nMugabe for his honourable defence of the concerns and the\ncauses of Africa as a whole, and in particular his defence\nof my country on this question.\nThe issue was also raised by His Excellency\nMr. Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary-General of OAU, and\nby most of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the\nCouncil\u2019s members. As we express our gratitude to all of\nthem, we wish to confirm that their support would have\nnever been so forthcoming had we been wrong.\nNineteenth, about a week ago, the Council of the\nLeague of Arab States decided to call on Arab States to\nmitigate some of the impacts of the sanctions imposed on\nmy country. We are grateful to the Council and to all our\nbrothers. We realize that this is a step in the right direction\nand that it is but a mild reaction to their being ignored last\nJuly.\nWe ask you for justice. Members of the Security\nCouncil are not against my country. They have expressed\nthat in all our meetings with them. They further add that\nour problem is with the United States and the United\nKingdom. Our dispute is with the judge. How can anyone\nexpect the Security Council to solve the problem when our\nadversaries are both permanent members of the Council and\npossess the veto power?\nOnce again, our problem is with the United States and\nthe United Kingdom. We have no problem whatever with\nthe Security Council, and the Security Council has no\nproblem with us. Had these two countries accepted the\nproposals of the regional and international organizations,\nhad they showed respect for the States members of these\norganizations and for their presidents and representatives,\nthe Security Council would not have hesitated for one\nmoment to accept them. This is what we were told by\nmembers of the Council. We are not just saying that.\nMy country calls on all of you to intervene so we\ncan reach a peaceful solution to this dispute, one that\nwould accelerate the holding of the trial for the two\nsuspects before a fair and just court, in an atmosphere\nfree from prior condemnation, in any place agreed upon,\nor decided upon by the Security Council.\nThe two suspects were advised by their American\nand Scottish lawyers against accepting a trial before any\ncourt in Scotland or the United States. This is because of\nintensive media coverage and statements by officials in\nthe two countries which have created a climate and public\nopinion that have convicted them in advance of any trial.\nThis does not accord with their human right to receive a\njust and fair trial. The fact that the United States\nGovernment has accorded Timothy McVeigh, accused in\nthe Oklahoma explosion, the right to change the venue of\nhis trial from Oklahoma, where the crime occurred, to\nanother state \u2014 namely Colorado \u2014 is evidence of\nrespect for one of the human rights \u2014 a respect which\nshould not be restricted only to the citizens of the United\nStates. This is because human rights should be enjoyed by\nall human beings, irrespective of their nationality. Human\nrights should not be accorded to some and denied to\nothers.\nMy country, at all levels of official responsibility,\nhas repeatedly condemned terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations. We have disassociated ourselves from all\nsuspected terrorist practices. We have also repeatedly\nasked the Secretary-General and the Security Council to\nsend a committee or envoys to ascertain on the ground\nthe validity of our claims.\nHowever, the refusal and objections of the United\nStates prevented the Secretariat and the Security Council\nfrom responding to our requests. This is one of the main\nreasons why we have such strong suspicions about the\ntrue intentions of the United States against my country.\nThis has also exposed its political objectives, for the\nattainment of which it did not hesitate to exploit human\nblood.\nWe call on the international community, as\nrepresented in this Assembly, to work towards reaching\na solution as soon as possible.\nThe United States refusal to allow this side issue \u2014\n\u201cthe question of terrorism\u201d \u2014 to be closed is aimed at\nserving the particular objectives of that country, objectives\nwe have already referred to. Everybody knows that it was\nthe United States which more than once committed\n27\n\n\nterrorist acts against my country, using its fleets and its\nbombers. The most heinous of these acts was the barbaric\nraid on the night of 15 April 1986 against the residence and\noffice of the Libyan brother leader, and against other\nresidential neighbourhoods in both Tripoli and Benghazi. In\nthis raid, tens of children, women and elderly were\nmartyred in their sleep. The United States cannot produce\none shred of evidence to prove the so-called Libyan\nterrorism, whereas Libya has dozens of proofs of the\nterrorism perpetrated by the United States against Libya.\nThe raid made on the night of 15 April 1986 is not a\nsuspected perpetration of an act, as is the case with our\ncitizens who are suspected by the United States. The raid\nof 15 April 1986 is an established fact whose consequences\ncan still be seen in the tombs of the martyrs in the famous\nEl-Hani Cemetery and in the remnants of buildings that still\nclearly show the marks of bombs and rockets. And if all of\nthis is far away in Tripoli and Benghazi, I am here before\nyou and I personally stand as a proof of the terrorism of the\nUnited States. These scars here on my face and on my\nhead, and on other parts of my body covered by my\nclothes, are the result of a bomb that an American aircraft\ndropped on my house, which was totally demolished that\nnight. My young son, who was less than 10 years old at the\ntime, was also injured.\nWe, who personally were victims of the American\nraid, resorted to the American judicial system here in the\nUnited States and brought a legal suit before an American\ncourt. Despite all the evidence, the American judicial\nsystem rejected our case. This negative experience with\nAmerican justice would surely discourage anyone from\naccepting to be tried by such a judiciary, especially if the\nopposing party was the American Government. I personally\ntried to institute a lawsuit and had American lawyers. My\nhouse is destroyed and erased from the Tripoli map. I have\nscars on my face, yet the case was rejected. And now we\nare to trust it and send our citizens before it? How?\nWe cannot forget that crime. We will always call for\nthose who decided, planned and implemented it to appear\nbefore competent Libyan courts for trial. The crime took\nplace in my country. They say that a crime took place in\nScotland? Fine. But another crime took place in Tripoli and\nBanghazi. Are their people citizens, and our people are not\ncitizens? We are also citizens of our own nation-State. They\nhave mere suspicions. We have facts not suspicions which\nwere actually shown on American television screens.\nWe believe that the reform of the United Nations is of\nthe utmost importance to us. However, optimum results of\nthis reform cannot be achieved unless the financial\nsituation of the Organization is put on the right track and,\nmost importantly, Member States must pay their assessed\ncontributions. The fact that the United States has reneged\non its contractual commitments to the United Nations by\nnot paying its assessed contribution to the budget is the\ncause of the financial crisis from which the Organization\nhas suffered for years. If the United Nations is to be\nreformed, that State must pay all of its arrears without\nconditions and promise to pay in future, on time and\nwithout pressures that aim to make the United Nations a\nhostage of the will and policies of that country.\nWe know that that State is now pressuring members\nof the General Assembly to make up for the lowering of\nits contribution by 5 per cent. We know that nothing has\nbeen decided yet regarding changes of assessment or\ncontributions. This is what we call sitting on top of this\nunipolar world. This is what we are warning the world of.\nWe would not have known that had we not been told by\nthose who are being pressured to pay the extra 5 per cent.\nThe fact that they told us \u2014 the Libyans \u2014 clearly shows\nthat they are dissatisfied and that they obviously are\nrefusing. They cannot say no. But we can say no.\nWithin the framework of the reform process, it is\nessential to have a complete review of the situation of the\nSecurity Council. By virtue of our experience with the\nSecurity Council \u2014 an experience I have just commented\non \u2014 we know and appreciate the importance and\nnecessity of reforming the Security Council and\nexpanding its membership. We believe that the reform\nshould focus first on improving the methods of work of\nthe Council \u2014 its mechanisms \u2014 thus making it\nimpossible for any one country to hamper the work of the\nCouncil or make it irrelevant.\nMy country, which a quarter of a century ago called\nfor the abrogation of the veto power, would like to\nemphasize now that any reform of the Security Council\nthat does not rescind the veto power would be\nmeaningless. There is no longer any historical or\nobjective reason for maintaining this power. It is not\njustifiable by any standard of righteousness, justice and\nequality, and even under the standards of democracy, to\nwhich certain countries pay lip service. At the same time,\nwe believe that the reform process will not be useful if it\ndoes not take into consideration the interests of all\ncountries and peoples.\nThat is why my country will support any initiative\nthat would do away with the present imbalance in the\n28\n\n\nmembership of the Security Council. In this respect, we\nshould like to underline the need to adhere to the proposals\nof the Non-Aligned Movement, which are based on full,\nsovereign equality among States; seek to apply the\nprinciple of equitable geographical distribution; and\nrespond to the demands of the developing countries,\nwhich represent the majority of the Members of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe General Assembly is the United Nations organ\nthat truly embodies the universal and democratic character\nof this international Organization. Since it is the only\nintergovernmental body with a mandate to discuss any\nquestion or matter under the Charter, including the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, Libya\nwould like to underline the wide-ranging and repeated\ncalls for the need to invigorate the General Assembly and\nenhance its powers so as to increase its effectiveness in\nconfronting the ever-changing challenges that face the\ninternational community.\nLastly, I wish to apologize for having taken up so\nmuch of the Assembly\u2019s time."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me\npleasure to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Udovenko,\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, on his unanimous\nelection to the presidency of the current session of the\nGeneral Assembly and to wish him success in the discharge\nof his important responsibilities and duties. May I also\nthank Mr. Razali, Permanent Representative of Malaysia,\nthe outgoing President, for his able stewardship and for the\ninitiatives he undertook during the past session.\nThe disintegration of the bipolar world structure and\nthe end of the cold war are creating favourable conditions\nfor realizing the goals and principles enshrined in the\nUnited Nations Charter. Globalization \u2014 vigorous\neconomic integration and interdependence \u2014 is becoming\na prevailing tendency throughout the world. The\nfundamental changes that international relations are\nundergoing, as well as the new challenges and global\nagendas, demand from the United Nations, its specialized\nagencies and the Member States new visions and collective\nefforts and actions commensurate to these realities. I wish\nto underline that the overwhelming majority of the\ninternational community recognizes these changes, is\nadjusting accordingly and is contributing to this process. It\nis hardly possible to visualize our common future if we do\nnot jointly solve the socio-economic problems and the\nquestions posed by underdevelopment, unemployment,\nhunger, poverty, disease, crime natural disasters.\nMongolia stands for making the United Nations an\neffective and efficient organization able to meet the\nchallenges of the new millennium \u2014 a political, economic\nand legal instrument capable of safeguarding the interests\nof all nations, especially the small ones, on the basis of\nequality and justice.\nUnited Nations reform has been a subject of\nsubstantive debate in recent years. It is therefore natural\nthat the reform agenda, in particular the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s report on a programme for reform, is at the\ncentre of attention at this session. Mongolia duly\ncommends the constructive efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral to reform the United Nations and overcome its\npresent financial crisis. It thus welcomes the reform\nprogramme he submitted to the General Assembly. We\nbelieve that thorough consideration should be given to the\nspecific proposals, such as a reasonable reduction of the\nstaff of the Secretariat, allocation of the resulting savings\nto acceleration of development, establishment of the post\nof Deputy Secretary-General and creation of a United\nNations Development Group so as to improve\ncoordination and management. It is clear that United\nNations reform is not an event, but rather a process. We\nshare the view that it is a continuous process, the end\nresult of which should be measured by the increase in the\nefficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations.\nMongolia supports the view that the expansion of the\nSecurity Council\u2019s permanent and non-permanent\nmembership should provide equal regional representation\nand that the Council\u2019s activities should be democratized\nand made more transparent. Despite the enlargement of\nthe Council membership, the overwhelming majority of\nMember States will still not be directly represented.\nTherefore, Mongolia\u2019s proposal to institutionalize the\nfuller participation of Member States in the Council\nproceedings, including its formal meetings, is finding\nincreasing support within the Organization.\nMongolia appreciates and supports the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s efforts to give priority to socio-economic\nquestions, to invigorate United Nations development\nactivities and enhance international cooperation for\ndevelopment. To this end it is vital that the United\nNations and its specialized agencies and international\ntrade and financial institutions intensify their activities in\nthis area and better coordinate their interactions.\nToday it is universally accepted that sustainable\ndevelopment could be attained if it were approached in a\ncomprehensive manner, and that sustained economic\ngrowth is closely linked with social development and\nenvironmental protection. It is gratifying to note that the\nAgenda for Development, adopted this year, has been\ndrawn up precisely in this spirit. We consider it an\n19\n\n\nimportant document that defines the strategy of international\ncooperation for development, and we believe that\nimplementation of its provisions is vitally important.\nThe special session of the General Assembly held last\nJune reviewed and assessed the implementation of the Rio\nsummit decisions and outlined future actions. Since Agenda\n21, adopted five years ago in Rio de Janeiro, has not been\nfully realized, the international community should accord\ngreater attention to its complete implementation.\nMongolia believes that implementing the important\ndecisions and recommendations of the summit conferences\nheld under United Nations auspices in the early 1990s is\ncrucial for consolidating the positive trends in world social\ndevelopment and redoubling international cooperation for\npoverty alleviation, human rights protection, food security,\nthe environment, advancement of women, protection of the\nrights of the child and sustainable human settlement.\nWhile fostering international cooperation for\ndevelopment, it is important to accord high priority to\naddressing the problems of the most disadvantaged\ndeveloping countries that have unfavourable locations,\nsevere climate and underdeveloped infrastructure.\nLandlocked developing countries, handicapped by their\ngeographical location and remoteness from world markets,\nface tremendous obstacles and hardships in their efforts for\ndevelopment and advancement. Reality shows that these\ncountries risk becoming marginalized from the ongoing\nglobalization process in the world economy and\ninternational trade. Therefore, it is imperative for the\ninternational community to increase its support of and\ncooperation with these countries, as envisaged in the\nAgenda for Development.\nIt is gratifying to note that landlocked developing\ncountries are taking concrete steps to develop transit\ntransport cooperation with their transit neighbours. My\nGovernment believes that the first-ever North-east Asia\nSubregional Consultative Meeting on Transit\nTransportation, held in Ulan Bator this year, has laid the\ngroundwork for the development of such regional\ncooperation.\nThe notion of and criteria for defining international\npeace and security are undergoing changes. With the\nimprovement of the international political climate, the\ndangers posed by nuclear war and the arms race are\nreceding, while prospects for taking concrete steps on\npractical disarmament are improving. The very concept of\nsecurity based primarily on the size of armed forces and\nmilitary alliances or associations has also been changing.\nIt now includes the level of development and progress,\nwealth and the well-being of peoples, as well as the\nextent to which human rights and fundamental freedoms\nare insured. All this must find due reflection in United\nNations activities.\nI am pleased to inform the General Assembly that\nlast July Mongolia ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty. Given the paramount significance of the\nTreaty, Mongolia believes that there is an urgent need to\nhave it enter into force as soon as possible, to implement\nits provisions strictly and to make operational its\ninternational verification system.\nThe international community must take specific\nmeasures designed to act on the advisory opinion of the\nInternational Court of Justice on the obligation to pursue\nand bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear\ndisarmament under strict and effective international\ncontrol.\nThe Government of Mongolia is pleased with the\nentry into force of the Convention on the Prohibition of\nthe Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of\nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. Its\nratification by the United States of America and a pledge\nby the Russian Federation \u2014 these being the two major\nPowers possessing substantial arsenals of these weapons\nof mass destruction \u2014 to ratify that Convention are\nimportant prerequisites for subsequent successful\nenforcement.\nIn the past few years the trend to establish nuclear-\nweapon-free zones has been gaining momentum.\nMongolia is pursuing a policy of maintaining the size of\nits armed forces and its defence expenditures at the lowest\npossible level and of ensuring its independence and\nnational security primarily by political and diplomatic\nmeans. In 1992 Mongolia declared its territory a nuclear-\nweapon-free zone, and it is now seeking to institutionalize\nthis status internationally. Within this framework, we\npresented to the last session of the United Nations\nDisarmament Commission a working paper on the basic\nprinciples and elements of the concept of the single-State\nnuclear-weapon-free zone. I take this opportunity to\nexpress our firm support for the proposal to establish\nnuclear-weapon-free zones in other regions, particularly\nin Central Asia, and our readiness to work actively for\nrealizing this.\n20\n\n\nIt is regrettable that sources of tension and conflict\npersist in some regions of the world. International peace\nand security would be strengthened if the parties concerned\nwere to display political will and utmost restraint in\nresolving their differences by negotiation and other peaceful\nmeans.\nBearing in mind the importance of strengthening the\nrule of law in international relations, the international\ncommunity declared the United Nations Decade of\nInternational Law and has taken a series of related\nmeasures. It is gratifying to note that on the initiative of\nMongolia, the current session is to consider the question of\ndrafting guiding principles for international negotiations.\nMongolia believes that the adoption of a document defining\nguiding principles for international negotiations would not\nonly meet the purposes and principles of the Decade but\nwould also promote the definition of international criteria\nfor conducting international negotiations on the basis of\njustice and the sovereign equality of States, irrespective of\ntheir actual power.\nMongolia continues to support the convening in 1998\nof a diplomatic conference on the establishment of the\ninternational criminal court. We believe that the jurisdiction\nof the court should cover, inter alia, crimes of aggression\nand grave environmental crimes.\nThe Government of Mongolia is consistently pursuing\na policy of democratization, embracing a market economy\nand opening up to the world. In the last year the new\nGovernment has undertaken a series of very important\nmeasures to accelerate political and economic reforms,\nstabilize the country\u2019s economy and ensure economic\ngrowth. To cite an example, we have introduced a zero\nper cent import tariff and accelerated the pace of\nprivatization. These are important steps to attract foreign\ndirect investment and expand trade with our major partners\nand the world at large.\nFull membership in the World Trade Organization\n(WTO) early this year greatly contributed to the forward-\nlooking development of Mongolia. We seek to cooperate\nconstructively with WTO as the main multilateral trade-\nrule-setting mechanism.\nAs part of our policy of actively joining global and\nregional economic integration, Mongolia is striving to\npursue a policy aimed at strengthening peace and security\nand developing cooperation in Asia and the Pacific. We are\nfocusing our attention on North-East Asia in particular and\nare committed to increasing our cooperation with the\ncountries of the region, both on a bilateral and a\nmultilateral basis.\nI should like to express our hope that Mongolia\u2019s\ninteraction with the United Nations, its agencies and other\ninternational organizations and our bilateral cooperation\nwith Member States will continue to play a valuable part\nin overcoming underdevelopment, in dealing with the\nhardships inherent in our transitional period and in\nmeeting pressing socio-economic challenges. In this\nconnection, I wish to express the gratitude of my\nGovernment to the donor countries, the United Nations\nand other international institutions for the support and\nassistance they have given my country.\nMongolia has always viewed the United Nations as\nan important instrument for safeguarding international\npeace and security and for promoting social and economic\ndevelopment, and has always supported it. We remain\ncommitted to strengthening the United Nations and\nenhancing its efficiency and effectiveness collectively\nwith all Member States.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, at the outset allow me to take this\nopportunity to congratulate you on your election to preside\nover the work of this, the fifty-second session of the\nGeneral Assembly. Your unanimous election reflects the\nactive role of your country, Ukraine, with which my\ncountry, the Sultanate of Oman, enjoys relations of\nfriendship and cooperation. We are fully confident that your\ndiplomatic capabilities and skills will stand you in good\nstead in managing the work of the Assembly at its present\nsession. My delegation assures you of its fullest cooperation\nin making this session a success and in achieving its\ndesired objectives.\nI would also like to pay special tribute to Ambassador\nRazali Ismail of friendly Malaysia for his successful and\nconstructive efforts in steering the work of the General\nAssembly at its previous session.\nBy the same token, I wish to stress our continued\nsupport for the genuine efforts of the Secretary-General of\nthe United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, in restructuring the\nUnited Nations and in revitalizing its role in all areas of\nendeavours.\nOwing to the arbitrary policy of the current Israeli\nGovernment since it came to power in late May of last\nyear, the peace process in the middle East is going\nthrough a difficult phase. The rigidity of the Israeli\nGovernment has manifested itself in the non-\nimplementation of what had been agreed upon with the\nPalestinian National Authority in Oslo and in its non-\nrecognition of the land-for-peace formula, a principle on\nwhich the whole of the Madrid Conference was built and\na measure which was accepted by all the parties as a\nfoundation for reaching a just and lasting peace.\nIsrael\u2019s failure to comply in good faith with its\ninternational commitments and its continuation of building\nsettlements in occupied Arab Jerusalem and other\noccupied Palestinian territories have resulted in the\ndisruption of the peace process. Therefore, we fully\nunderstand the awesome responsibility that falls on the\ntwo sponsors of the peace process. We are confident that\nthey, as well as other peace-supporting nations,\nparticularly those of the European Union, are capable of\nnarrowing the existing chasm between the Government of\nIsrael and the Government of the Palestinian National\nAuthority on the basis of justice and equity that will\nproduce substantial progress which will restore a climate\nof trust and cooperation between the Israeli and\nPalestinian Governments and that will renew hope once\nmore among the fraternal people of Palestine as well as\namong the people of Israel for life in peace and harmony.\n\n\nMy delegation wishes to recall that the status of\nJerusalem was one of those issues that were agreed to be\ndeferred to the final stage of negotiations. However, the\nmeasures being taken by the Israeli Government in\nJerusalem and its vicinity totally run counter to what was\nagreed upon in Madrid in 1991.\nWe therefore call upon the international community to\nexpress solidarity with the Government of the Palestinian\nNational Authority in resisting these Israeli policies which\nlead to more tension, violence and bloodshed.\nProceeding from its conviction of the importance of\nthe peace process in the Middle East and the need to\ncontribute to giving it impetus for further progress, my\ncountry, the Sultanate of Oman, has actively participated in\nsupporting that process. It continues to adhere to the goals\nof establishing peace in the Middle East in accordance with\nthe relevant resolutions and agreements which have been\nconcluded. Therefore, we demand that those agreements be\nimplemented, since peace is an imperative, and is in the\ninterests of all peoples in the region, ridding them of all\nforms of repression, terror, poverty, and hunger.\nThe Sultanate of Oman reaffirms its solidarity with the\nfraternal people of Palestine and supports the peaceful\nposition of the Government of the Palestinian National\nAuthority, which aims at Israeli withdrawal from the\nPalestinian territories occupied since 1967.\nWe call upon the international community to enhance\nthe peace process by providing its support to the\nGovernment of the Palestinian National Authority, both\nmaterially and psychologically, thus enabling it to establish\nthe foundations for stability and security in the Palestinian\nterritories and to build the necessary infrastructures for the\nPalestinian economy, which is an important factor that will\nsafeguard what has been achieved and what we hope will\nbe achieved in the future.\nWe also call upon the people of Israel and all political\nactors in that country to promote and defend the peace\nprocess. We also reject all forms of terror, repression and\nfear, which have had an adverse impact on the national\ninterests of all the peoples in the region, including Israel\nitself.\nWe reaffirm the desire of Syria to establish a just and\ncomprehensive peace, a desire it has always reiterated in all\ninternational forums. We support the Syrian position calling\nfor the resumption of the negotiations with the current\nIsraeli Government from where they ended with the\nprevious Israeli Government, based on full and complete\nIsraeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan to the\nboundaries prior to 4 June 1967, with the concomitant\nmutual obligations to guarantee the establishment of a just\nand comprehensive peace between Syria and Israel and in\nthe region at large.\nWe would also like to reaffirm the importance of\nIsraeli withdrawal from the occupied Lebanese territories\nto internationally recognized borders, in accordance with\nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978). The world has\nwitnessed the increased tension between Israel and\nLebanon over the past two years, which has inflicted\ntremendous financial losses on the Lebanese economy,\nnot to mention the killing of innocent civilians and the\nspread of terror and destruction, which is a natural result\nof the continuation of Israel\u2019s occupation of a part of\nLebanese territory.\nThe phenomena of violence and terrorism that target\nthe lives of innocents require strengthened international\nefforts and a firmer will to stand against these heinous\nacts. In this regard, I reiterate my country\u2019s condemnation\nof these phenomena and its absolute rejection of all forms\nof violence and terrorism. We call on the international\ncommunity to coordinate its efforts to put an end to these\nacts and to guarantee that those who commit or advocate\nsuch crimes be brought to justice.\nWith regard to the situation between the United\nNations and Iraq, we believe that the implementation of\nresolution 986 (1995) and its further extension are\nimportant steps that deserve the acknowledgement and the\ncommendation of the international community, for it will\nalleviate some of the sufferings endured by the brotherly\npeople of Iraq. My country has welcomed this and\nexpresses its satisfaction that the cooperation between Iraq\nand the Special Commission is being built on a\nfoundation of trust that will certainly enable its new\nChairman, Ambassador Richard Butler, to submit an\nappropriate final report on the future of the economic\nsanctions imposed on Iraq.\nDespite these encouraging indicators between the\nUnited Nations and Iraq, some fundamental issues remain\nthat have yet to register any progress, particularly the\nquestion of Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees of other\nnationalities, and the return of Kuwaiti properties. This\nquestion is of particular importance and we would\nreaffirm here the urgent need for the United Nations to\nmake greater efforts and to establish further contacts with\n2\n\n\nIraq with the aim of putting this issue to rest, since it is\nlargely related to humanitarian and social matters.\nMy country attaches primary importance to the peace\nand security of the Gulf region, cooperation and coexistence\namong its nations and peoples in accordance with the\nprinciples of international law, peaceful neighbourly\nrelations, mutual respect and non-interference in each\nother\u2019s internal affairs. On this understanding, we have\nbeen striving, in the context of the combined efforts of the\nGulf Cooperation Council, to solve all disputes and sources\nof tension, whatever they may be, between the countries of\nthe region through dialogue and peaceful means. Thus, the\nquestion of Lesser Tunb, Greater Tunb and Abu Musa\nislands constitutes a dispute that might jeopardize the peace\nand stability which we are seeking. In this regard, we\nsupport all efforts aimed at solving this question through\ndirect peaceful dialogue and legal means between the\nconcerned parties, the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran, in a manner that will safeguard\nneighbourly relations, stability, security and peace in the\nregion.\nWith regard to the situation in Somalia, my country\napplauds the efforts recently made by Egypt that led to the\nsigning of an agreement between the leaders of the Somali\nfactions. We call on those factions to pursue the peace\ndialogue among them in order to attain Somali national\nunity. We call upon the United Nations to render concrete\nsupport to Egypt\u2019s efforts to help the Somali factions to\nimplement their national programme.\nMy country has continuously supported international\nefforts aimed at strengthening international peace and\nsecurity. In this regard, my country\u2019s announcement at the\nprevious session of the General Assembly of its accession\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) emphasizes our policy, which was followed by other\nsteps represented by its deposit of the instrument of\nratification in early 1997 and its initiation of negotiations\nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency to finalize a\nsafeguards agreement, in accordance with our obligations as\nset down in the Treaty.\nThe Sultanate of Oman, while taking this historic step,\ncertainly hopes to bestow more strength and credibility on\nthe Treaty, which it considers to be the most important\nmultilateral disarmament treaty, by encouraging all\ncountries that have not yet joined the NPT to do so. In this\nregard, we call on Israel in particular to expedite its\naccession to the Treaty and to place all its nuclear facilities\nunder international supervision, which we believe will\ncreate an atmosphere of trust and confidence and limit the\nlevel of armament in the Middle East \u2014 a move that\nwould bring about just and permanent peace to the region.\nThe Chemical Weapon Convention is no doubt an\nimportant multilateral disarmament treaty prohibiting a\nwhole category of weapons of mass destruction amenable\nto verification measures. All of us have an obligation to\nuphold these measures for the benefit and welfare of\nhumanity at large. In order to avoid a similar fate for the\nNPT, we believe that all nations should accede to it.\nPreserving the universality and comprehensive nature of\nthis Treaty should constitute one of the highest goals on\nthe international community\u2019s list of priorities.\nAt a time when the international community is\npreparing to enter the twenty-first century, the African\ncontinent continues to suffer the blight of endless,\nsuccessive wars. These wars have taken the lives of\nhundreds of thousands of innocent civilians and created\nmore than 6 million refugees and about 12 million\ndisplaced persons in the continent.\nWe add our voice to those who have called on the\nAfrican nations within areas of conflict to exert every\npossible effort, including regular negotiations, to provide\nan environment conducive to national reconciliation\namong the warring factions and to enable the refugees to\nreturn securely to their lands through safe passages.\nMy country supports the United Nations role in\ncoordinating worldwide efforts \u2014 through international\ndonor agencies, the regional efforts represented by the\nwork of the Organization of African Unity, and countries\nthat border those areas of conflict \u2014 aimed at achieving\nprogress and development for the individual in Africa,\nwho has and continues to suffer from deprivation, despair,\npoverty, natural disasters and other man-made\ncatastrophes.\nThe environment is a gift from God, the Almighty,\nto man. Its preservation is a collective responsibility\nwhich is not limited by political boundaries. This fact has\nbeen proven repeatedly. Therefore, wherever man lives,\nhe should do his share to protect the environment and to\ntreat it with wisdom and logic, and be aware of the\ndiverse causes of pollution. We are called upon to commit\nourselves constantly to the implementation of Agenda 21\nand its principles declared at the Earth Summit. Such\nactions and principles constitute the foundation upon\nwhich a global partnership and a collective responsibility\nhave been erected. Their goal is to end poverty and\n3\n\n\nhunger and to prevent a decline in health standards and the\ndegradation of environmental systems. All of these are\nnecessary preconditions to obtaining sustainable\ndevelopment, which is the only option open to humanity\nthat guarantees the future of coming generations and offers\nprosperity and progress to the present ones.\nThe Sultanate of Oman has prepared a national\nstrategy to protect the environment that aims at achieving\nbalanced and sustainable development, a strategy that would\ntreat economic, social and environmental considerations on\nan equal footing. My country has also prepared a national\nplan to combat desertification in the Sultanate in due\nimplementation of the United Nations Convention to\nCombat Desertification. Furthermore, the Sultanate has\nestablished an integrated network of natural reserves\nthroughout the country that will accord with the objectives\nof the Convention on Biological Diversity. The Sultanate of\nOman has supported various environmental bodies,\nintroducing new legislation and updating old environmental\nlaws in order to meet the requirements of environmental\nprotection from the dangers of pollution resulting from\ndiverse development activities with a view to guaranteeing\nthe full implementation of regional and international\nenvironmental agreements. It has also declared every 8\nJanuary as Omani Day of the Environment.\nOn the regional level, the Sultanate of Oman, in its\nefforts to implement the recommendations that stem from\nthe Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by\nDumping Wastes and Other Matter from ships at sea, has\ndeclared its intention to build a bunkering port for ships on\nits shores in preparation for their adoption in other\ncountries of the Gulf region.\nOn the international level, the Sultan Qaboos Prize for\nEnvironmental Preservation, set up by UNESCO, is a true\ntestimony to the effort by the Sultanate of Oman and its\nleader to translate the concept of collective responsibility\nfor environmental protection into a practical reality.\nProtecting the environment and striking a balance between\nthe needs of development and the environment form a\ncornerstone of the declared policy of the Sultanate of\nOman. My country looks forward to complementing its\neffort with that of the international community in the areas\nof training, transfer of technology and exchange of\ninformation and to getting acquainted with the latest\nmodern techniques and scientific discoveries in the\nenvironmental field. In this regard, we call on the\ninternational community, in particular the developed\ncountries, to provide the necessary financial and technical\nresources to rescue our planet and its natural resources.\nSince the individual is the centre of development and\nthe moving force behind the renaissance of modern Oman\nand is the real support of all development operations, the\nSultanate of Oman, as of the inception of its modern\ndevelopment, has focused its attention on improving the\nwelfare of Omani citizens.\nIn the social domain, the national plans for the\ndevelopment of the family and of women have been\naccorded the highest priority. Our social development\nplans accord special attention to issues relating to the\nfamily and to projects that aim at providing the best care\nfor women and children. The efforts of the Government\nin this regard have culminated in the establishment of\nwomen\u2019s rehabilitation centres in different parts of the\nSultanate. These centres aim to develop women\u2019s\npotential and to promote their cultural and social standing.\nMoreover, the Government has played its part by\nintroducing new laws and legislation that are geared to\nachieve social security for the family in cases of old age,\ndisability and handicap, in order to allow those with\ndisabilities to be reintegrated in society and to rehabilitate\nthem for participation in society\u2019s development.\nThe Government has also established development\nplans for women and children with a view to their\npreparation for the future through setting up women\u2019s\norganizations based on volunteerism and through\nlaunching children\u2019s social services in remote and rural\nareas of the country.\nIn this regard, we are happy to note that international\nagencies such as the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund\n(UNICEF), have praised the efforts of the Government. In\nits report entitled The Progress of Nations 1997, UNICEF\nillustrated the accomplishments achieved by the Sultanate\nof Oman in child protection and the country\u2019s\ncommitment to ensuring the rights of the child through its\naccession in 1996 to the Convention on the Rights of the\nChild. The Sultanate of Oman is the number-one country\nin the world in terms of reducing infant under-five\nmortality by 74 per cent between 1980 and 1995. The\nreport notes:\n\u201cThe proportion of children who reach their\nfifth birthday is one of the most fundamental\nindicators of a country\u2019s concern for its people.\nChild survival statistics are a poignant indicator of\nthe priority given to the services that help a child to\nflourish: adequate supplies of nutritious food, the\navailability of high-quality health care and easy\naccess to safe water and sanitation facilities, as well\n4\n\n\nas the family\u2019s overall economic condition and the\nhealth and status of women in the community.\u201d [See\nThe Progress of Nations 1997, page 28]\nThe UNICEF report for the year 1994 also notes that,\nbased on the 1992 indicators, the Sultanate of Oman ranked\nas the number-two nation in the Middle East and North\nAfrica region in terms of girls\u2019 enrolment in primary\neducation.\nRecently, the achievement of modern development in\nthe Sultanate of Oman has culminated in the significant\nachievement of the introduction of the Basic Law of the\nState, which is considered a milestone in the Sultanate\u2019s\nmodern history. Other serious steps are also under way to\nstrengthen the participation of women in the legislature, the\nMajlis Al-Shura.\nOn the economic level, achieving balance and stability\nin macroeconomics and encouraging private enterprise in a\ncompetitive and free environment constitute the future\nvision that will guide the Omani economy for the next 25\nyears.\nWe believe that the reaffirmation of the previously\nmentioned Basic Law of the State and the adherence to\nthese principles will be the guiding factor in the country\u2019s\npolicy of openness that should engender confidence in our\neconomy and create the necessary conditions for\ninvestments.\nIn the area of diversifying the sources of its national\nrevenue, the Sultanate of Oman is in the process of\nimplementing several other major projects that are expected\nto capitalize on its natural gas discoveries and reserves. In\nthis respect, we would like to note in particular that the\nliquefied natural gas project should begin operation with the\nfirst shipment in the year 2000. Work has also begun on\nbuilding the container port in Rays\u00fat, in the south of the\nSultanate, with a view to its becoming a regional and\ninternational port. It is our hope that this port will serve as\na regional focal point for exporters and transitional trade.\nIn addition to these efforts, the Omani Government is\nin the process of implementing various privatization\nprojects through careful study. It is also updating its tax and\ninvestment laws in accordance with the new spirit of global\npartnership prevailing throughout the world.\nIn accord with this global partnership, the Sultanate of\nOman has adopted important measures to implement the\nnecessary requirements for its membership in the World\nTrade Organization (WTO). It is our fervent hope that these\nmeasures will be finalized in order to allow Oman to\nassume its rightful place in the organization in the near\nfuture. Here I would like to recall that, in compliance\nwith the guidelines of the WTO in the area of intellectual\nproperty, Oman has completed the formal procedures for\nbecoming a member of the World Intellectual Property\nOrganization (WIPO). In this vein, the Convention signed\nat Stockholm on 14 July 1967 has been in force in Oman\nas of 19 February 1997.\nOn the regional plane, the economic cooperation\namong the States members of the GCC is being\nstrengthened every day. Moreover, there is agreement\namong them with regard to international treaties and\norganizations. The member States of the GCC are\nseriously striving to join the WTO. Coordination between\nthe GCC and other regional and international economic\ngroupings is something that ought to be noted here as\nwell.\nThe Sultanate of Oman adheres to a free-market\neconomy and vigorously promotes foreign investments.\nAnd in this regard, it has introduced various incentives,\ncreated the appropriate environment and enacted flexible\nlegislation in order to eliminate all the barriers and\nimpediments that might stand in the way of attracting\nforeign investors and protecting their rights.\nBased on this conviction, given our national\neconomic strategies and in response to international\ndevelopments that attest to the importance of economic\ngroupings, the Sultanate of Oman participated in the first\nMinisterial Meeting for the formal launching of the Indian\nOcean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-\nARC) which was held in Mauritius in March 1997. As a\nresult of many years\u2019 work, in which my country had the\nhonour to initiate and take part in formative meetings, the\nIndian Ocean Rim Economic Association was officially\nestablished. This has paved the way for its members to\nwork together towards strengthening economic and trade\ncooperation between them in one of the important regions\nof the world in accordance with the goals and objectives\nenshrined in the Association\u2019s charter. These goals\ninclude increasing economic linkages, cooperation and\ninterdependence between the member States and their\npeoples. Besides working with the private and academic\nsector, members of the Indian Ocean Rim Economic\nAssociation are working towards establishing stronger ties\nin the areas of technical and scientific cooperation and\nalso promoting the exchange of investment opportunities\nand mutual economic benefits.\n5\n\n\nWe welcome the national-level initiatives to set up\nprogrammes to pay arrears to the United Nations. The\nadoption of such measures will revitalize the work of the\nOrganization in all areas, particularly in those areas relating\nto organization, administration and finance. This should\nstrengthen the performance of the Organization in the years\n1998 and 1999 in accordance with the practical framework\nestablished by the General Assembly. At the same time, we\nurge all States to refrain from setting conditions for the\nUnited Nations during the payment of their late dues. Such\nconditions ignore the will and interests of the international\ncommunity, and are characterized as focusing entirely on\nshort-term national interests of the States involved. Such\nconditions could lead to the further escalation of old and\nexisting tensions in the world, until appropriate solutions\nfor their radical elimination are found. Here we advocate\ncaution and deliberateness in connection with the\nelimination of some of the United Nations missions \u2014 such\nas the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization,\npresently stationed in Jerusalem, and the United Nations\nInterim Force in Lebanon. These cutbacks might have\nnegative political and legal implications.\nThrough the United Nations the international\ncommunity has proved its ability to renew its determination\nand muster the necessary political will for serious collective\nwork and cooperation in fostering international peace and\nsecurity. In this regard the Organization has shouldered\nhuge responsibilities and faced complex challenges in its\nefforts to restructure its system for the next millennium\nthrough the adoption of less costly and more effective\nmechanisms for attaining the desired goals.\nIn our view, after all the debates and deliberations in\nthe General Assembly, the time has now come to have a\nfinal vision of how to expand the Security Council and to\nrestructure it, that Council being the most important\npolitical body charged with the maintenance of international\npeace and security. While bearing in mind the global\neconomic and political realities, which cannot be ignored,\nthe reforms should be of a holistic nature, based on equality\namong nations and equitable geographic distribution. There\nis also the need to establish democracy in the work and\ndecision-making of the Security Council. The Council\u2019s\nwork also encompasses the development of an actual and\nprecise picture of the new international order, which should\nbe characterized by justice, security and peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I first say, Sir, how pleased my country is at your\nelection as President of the fifty-second session of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly. I should also like to say\nto the Secretary-General that France welcomes the action he\nhas already taken and assure him that he has our support\nand confidence.\nI shall begin my statement by expressing a conviction\non behalf of my country: the world needs the United\nNations more than ever. No, the United Nations did not\nlose its raison d'\u00eatre with the end of the cold war, the end\nof the arms race between the two blocs and the head-on\nclash of differing ideologies.\nOn the contrary, the need for a universal regulating\nbody has never been so apparent. The reasons are known to\nall. Without regret, we left the era of bipolar confrontation\nto enter, in 1991, a new, global, evolving world in which\n185 States cooperate, make alliances with one another or\ncompete in stable or, conversely, unstable combinations.\nIn this world, States are no longer the sole players. The\ngiant conglomerates, the financial markets, the media,\nopinion groups and non-governmental organizations all\nplay an increasing role. Because of this, there is an\noverriding need for clear, fair and predictable ground\nrules to establish a framework for settling conflicts or\nmere differences. For, nowadays, no serious problem can\nbe resolved by one country, even the most powerful,\nentirely on its own.\nUnless we take care, unless we manage to build a\nworld in which the rule of law prevails among all States,\na world in equilibrium between its major centres of\npower, other scenarios will ensue: the absence of a\ncounterweight will encourage the predominance of a\nsingle Power, and, inevitably, that Power will be tempted\nto engage in unilateralism; for want of organized regional\nentities, globalization will exacerbate the economic \u2014 and\nsometimes political \u2014 struggle of each against all; States\nwill find themselves further weakened, and some will\nimplode under the effects of aggressive nationalism,\nwhich is often contagious. Fierce competition will render\nvirtually impossible environmental conservation, however\nurgent, however vital in the true meaning of the word, as\nwell as the fight against drugs and crime; greater respect\nfor human rights will be compromised.\nOur common task must be to forestall such dangers\nand, at the same time, to consolidate, together, the\nachievements of recent years. For this, regional groupings\nare one of the best possible foundations. Europe, which\nhas been the crucible of so many wars, has been showing\nthe way for half a century. The growth rates achieved by\nmany countries in Asia, in Latin America and now in\nAfrica, announce the emergence of new centres of power\nand prosperity. Political and economic entities are being\norganized and institutionalized: South-East Asia meets in\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN);\nin Latin America, the Southern Cone Common Market\n(MERCOSUR) is developing, as are the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC) in southern Africa and\nthe Economic Community of West African States\n19\n\n\n(ECOWAS) in the west of that continent. To some extent,\none might also include cultural and political entities, such\nas the Commonwealth and la Francophonie. This is a\nsensible way to adapt to globalization.\nHowever, at the global level we need a coherent,\neffective United Nations with the resources necessary to\ncarry out its missions. It is the task of this body to facilitate\nthe smooth organization of international relations and to\ndetermine universally recognized rules of law. To be sure,\nother organizations exist in various sectors, and these have\ntheir own, very important areas of authority. But none of\nthem can take the place of the United Nations in giving the\nworld of tomorrow a set of comprehensive rules. True to its\ntradition, France will support all the Organization's efforts\nto that end.\nI come now to the main object of the session which is\nbeginning. To carry out the major role we expect of it, the\nUnited Nations must retain or reacquire the means to take\ndecisions and to act. For this, we must resolve two matters:\nUnited Nations reform and the financing of the\nOrganization. The ability of the United Nations to act in the\nyears ahead will depend on the solutions we find together.\nFrance approved of the move by the new Secretary-\nGeneral at the outset of his mandate to continue the study\ninitiated by his predecessor, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\nThe main lines Mr. Kofi Annan has proposed for the work\nand the impetus he has given to the process of revamping\nthe Organization have received France\u2019s full support, a\nsupport shared by France\u2019s partners in the European Union.\nThe remarks made from this rostrum by its current\nPresident, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg,\nillustrate this. I should like to comment more specifically\non three points: the Security Council, financial reform and\nrestructuring.\nThe current composition of the Security Council no\nlonger accurately reflects the political geography of today\u2019s\nworld. Clearly, it has to be reformed \u2014 that is to say,\nenlarged \u2014 to become more representative.\nIn this connection, we must take into account the\nSecurity Council\u2019s indispensable role in peacekeeping and\nthus elect countries able to contribute to this task, whether\nthey are from the North or the South.\nAccordingly, my country is in favour of the accession\nof Germany, Japan and three countries from the South to\npermanent seats and the establishment of new\nnon-permanent seats. For a Security Council composed\nsolely of the principal countries of the North would not\nbe representative. Nor should we forget that, once it is\nenlarged, and hence more representative, the Council will\nstill have to be effective. That is essential.\nThe proposals that have been submitted to us should\nmake it possible to move forward. However, we are all\naware that no consensus has yet been reached and that\ndebates on this matter will be difficult. National interests\nand the concerns of regional groups must be given due\nconsideration. In any event, I welcome President Razali\u2019s\nperseverance throughout the fifty-first session of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly, which made it possible\nto draft a solid working basis from which we must now\nproceed to work to find a solution.\nFurthermore, financial reform of the United Nations\nis a particularly complex issue. It is shocking that the\nUnited Nations should be in a precarious state and\ntherefore in a situation of financial and budgetary\ndependence with respect to its debtors. I believe that we\nwill be able to move towards a solution on the basis of\nthree principles: what is owed to the United Nations must\nbe paid in full, on time and without conditions. Finally,\nthe payment of contributions should not be a way of\nexerting pressure on the Secretary-General and the other\nMember States.\nWith these rudimentary principles as a basis, France\nis open to discussion on all aspects of the problem. We\nwill have to decide on the scale for apportioning\nassessments among all States. There is no perfect scale,\nbut some are not as bad as others. The concept of each\nState\u2019s ability to pay, which has enjoyed consensus since\nthe outset, still seems simple, logical and fair today. On\nthat basis, a solution can be found that takes account of\nthe needs and interests of each State. France will do its\nutmost to facilitate the settlement of the financial crisis.\nWe can be both imaginative and conciliatory \u2014 like the\nEuropean Union\u2019s plan. But our efforts will succeed only\nif there is respect for the rules I have just recalled, which\nreflect our Organization's impartiality and credibility. If\nthe United Nations were forced to comply with the\nunilateral demands of one among us, in regard both to its\nfinancing and its functioning, then how could it convince\nanyone in the future that it is impartial and faithful to the\nprinciple of the equality of all under the Charter, and\ngenerate respect for its decisions?\nI come now to restructuring. The Secretary-General\nhas undertaken to restructure and regroup the\nOrganization\u2019s institutions. France appreciates the logic of\n20\n\n\nthis approach. It therefore welcomes the establishment in\nVienna of a centre to deal specifically with combating new\ntransnational dangers such as organized crime, drug\ntrafficking and terrorism, problems that we must fight with\never-increased vigour. It is also very much in favour of\nintegrating the Office of the High Commissioner for Human\nRights and the Centre for Human Rights into a single entity\nin Geneva where the main humanitarian aid services are\nalready established. It also hopes that the main issues\ninvolving disarmament can continue to be addressed in\nGeneva.\nFrom this rostrum, I applaud the appointment of\nMrs. Mary Robinson to the post of High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights. Her very strong personality is\ncommensurate with the challenges her task entails. The\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, starting on 10 December this\nyear, will provide an opportunity to reaffirm, in the face of\npersistent violations and ever-recurring acts of barbarism,\nthe universality of these rights. But we will also have to ask\nourselves, in addition to making the usual declarations that\nare still necessary, what political and economic actions are\nneeded to make real headway, in specific situations,\ntowards respect for human rights, and how the emergence\nof democracies can be encouraged from outside.\nThe United Nations, while adapting, must remain the\npreferred instrument for taking action in the interests of\npeace. At this time, the United Nations is really the only\norganization that can try to bring order to an international\nsociety which is becoming fragmented and globalized at the\nsame time. The United Nations is faced with both a\nresurgence of every kind of micro-nationalism and the\nstrengthening of regional entities. Most conflicts are now\nnot between States but within them. Given these new\nchallenges, the United Nations has already demonstrated\nhow adaptable and flexible it is. But we must continue. To\nensure the lasting settlement of conflicts, consciences have\nto be assuaged and justice needs to be done to put an end\nto the endless cycle of revenge. The perpetrators of the\nmost serious crimes must be tried impartially, with respect\nfor the rights of the defence, and after an exemplary\ninvestigation which reveals the facts in full. This is why\nFrance supports the action of the international criminal\ntribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and hopes\nthat the forthcoming conference on an international criminal\ncourt will be a success.\nSince the beginning of the decade, the Organization\u2019s\nactions to promote peace and international stability have\nchanged radically. The time has passed when large-scale\npeacekeeping operations were mounted solely under the\nblue flag of the United Nations, in Cambodia and the\nformer Yugoslavia for example, in order to take on\nmassive challenges alone. Today, the United Nations\nintervenes more and more frequently in conjunction with\nother organizations or by authorizing the action of\nregional actors. In Europe, the United Nations is pooling\nits efforts with those of the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization in sensitive theatres of operation, and even\nwith those of the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe. In Africa, for the first time, the\nSecretaries-General of the United Nations and the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) have in the past\nyear appointed a joint special representative in the person\nof Ambassador Sahnoun, in the Great Lakes region. It is\ngood that these two organizations are working together.\nThis development must be encouraged. We must also help\nAfrican States and organizations to strengthen their own\npeacekeeping capabilities. To this end, countries outside\nthe African continent must pool their efforts and not\nmultiply the number of rival and sometimes redundant\ninitiatives. For instance, the Government of France, the\nUnited Kingdom and the United States recently agreed to\nact together with all those who wish to do so to\nstrengthen the peacekeeping capabilities of African\ncountries, under the auspices of the United Nations, of\ncourse, and in cooperation with the OAU.\nBut, in France's view, encouraging Africa to become\nmore involved in resolving crises certainly does not mean\nthat the international community should relinquish its\nother responsibilities with regard to the African continent.\nIt is therefore essential that the United Nations be ready,\nonce the declared conditions are met, to act in Congo-\nBrazzaville. By the same token, the many recent tragedies\nin the Great Lakes region make sustained international\ninvolvement indispensable. This United Nations\ncommitment to promote peace and development must also\nserve to further human rights. That is why it is important\nfor the humanitarian investigative task force in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo to be able to carry out\nits mission. I might add that by spending too much time\ntalking about crises in Africa, one might forget the\nessential point, namely that the African continent is taking\noff in quite an unprecedented way. My country believes\nin this.\nWe are all still mobilized by the situation in the\nMiddle East. The peace process, set in train on the\ninitiative of clear-sighted and courageous men on both\nsides, raised tremendous hopes. We can clearly see the\nincreasingly tragic consequences to which the current\n21\n\n\nstalemate would lead, were it to last. The peoples of this\nregion are once again stuck in an impasse, in a situation of\nhumiliation, resentment, and the fear of terrorism. New\nefforts are therefore necessary so that these two peoples,\nIsraeli and Palestinian, which are matched in terms of\ninsecurity and fear of the future, can together find justice\nand security. France gave its full support to the action by\nthe American Secretary of State, who recently went to the\nMiddle East. Indeed, the United States has a special\nresponsibility and special means to attempt to reinvigorate\nthe peace process and effectively combat the deadly acts of\nextremism. France and Europe are ready to take part in any\nconstructive move to this end.\nWhat can the United Nations do? It cannot take the\nplace of the parties concerned, which have the primary\nresponsibility. It is up to the Organization to state, or\nrestate, the law and to recall the principles which must be\nthe basis for any peace if we want it to last. I refer here to\nthe resolutions adopted by the Security Council on the\nconflict in the Middle East, not forgetting resolution 425\n(1978), which deals with the integrity of Lebanon in\nparticular.\nMany other crisis situations where the wounds have\nnot healed could be mentioned from this rostrum \u2014 so\ndiverse is the work of the United Nations. In particular, I\nam thinking of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nwhere security has been restored but where the construction\nof a State with viable democratic institutions remains\nuncertain; and of Albania, where the new stability, thanks\nto resolute European action authorized by the United\nNations, is giving rise to new hopes. I am also thinking of\nthe tenacious efforts of the United Nations to contain or\ndefuse the crises in Haiti, Cyprus, Georgia, Afghanistan,\nTajikistan and elsewhere.\nFinally, let us not forget, now or ever, much-needed\ndevelopment assistance.\nOf course, the insertion of emerging economies,\nincluding the former underdeveloped economies, into the\nglobal economy is an excellent thing; indeed, past efforts in\nthis regard have proved to be well founded. But this must\nnot be a selfish excuse for the rich countries to give up\ntheir effort to provide development assistance, which is\nequally necessary. In any event, this is very much an\nimperative for the leaders of the member States of the\nFrancophone community. The summit of these States in\nHanoi in November will attest to their interest in more\nbalanced development and also to their commitment to\nrespecting the multiplicity of cultures and languages.\nI will say no more, however \u2014 other than to draw\none single conclusion. While the world has changed so\nmuch over the past 50 years, and even more over the past\nsix years, its inhabitants still voice the same needs. The\nrule of law must be continually consolidated and the\ndemocratic ideal put into practice, faced as we are with\nthe temptations of oppression and the use of force, for\nwhich new pretexts are constantly being invoked. How\ncan we be sure that the factors that make for war and\nchaos are banned for ever from all continents, including\nEurope?\nAt this moment of our Organization's reform, let us\nnot forget the lessons of history. Only international\ndialogue, the common management of crises, beginning\nwith their prevention, and the wise conservation of the\nearth\u2019s resources make it possible for the voice of reason\nand peace to prevail and for confidence in progress to be\nrebuilt. The United Nations is the right and the only\nlegitimate forum for such international discussions, and\nthe only one where they are universal. Our Organization\nis an irreplaceable framework and a vital necessity for us\nall. In the past, it has often been able to deter, address,\nresolve and prevent. Let us reform it so as to make it\neven more useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay\nI first of all congratulate you, Mr. President, most sincerely\non your outstanding election to the presidency of the United\nNations General Assembly at its fifty-second session. I have\nno doubt that thanks to your eminent qualities and your rich\nexperience you will carry out remarkably well the mission\nentrusted to you. You may be assured of the complete\nsupport of the delegation of Mali.\nI also want to express our appreciation and thanks to\nyour predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail, for the\nimportant contribution he made to the last session as\nPresident of the General Assembly.\nTo the new Secretary-General of the Organization,\nMr. Kofi Annan, I would like to express my fraternal and\nwarmest congratulations. His election on 17 December\n1996 was a tribute to the eminent qualities of a man who\nhas devoted his life to the service of the United Nations.\nWhile wishing him every success in the difficult mission\nconferred upon him, it is my firm conviction that he will\ndo honour to his continent, Africa, in guiding our\nOrganization towards the next millennium.\nAs this fifty-second session of the General Assembly\nopens this year, the United Nations is at a crossroads.\nTwo years ago in this very Hall, on the occasion of the\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, 128 Heads of\nState or Government forcefully reaffirmed their faith in\nthe United Nations in its principles and its objectives.\nThey unanimously appealed for profound reflection on the\nrole and resources of the world Organization so that it\nmight be given the human, material and financial\ncapacities that are vital to its mission, and so that it might\nbe able to enter the twenty-first century with\ndetermination and professionalism.\nThis appeal was not in vain. Under the dynamic\nleadership of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nwhose courage and lucidity I wish to commend, our\nOrganization has today embarked on an ambitious\nprogramme of reform. On 14 July last Mr. Kofi Annan,\ncontinuing the work of his predecessor, submitted to the\nGeneral Assembly his report on the reform of the United\nNations. Like other Member States, Mali is now\nconsidering the proposals contained in that report and will\nwithout delay submit its observations thereon. My\ndelegation is delighted at the political will expressed by\nall to initiate the appropriate reforms in order to make our\nOrganization better able to respond to the needs of our\nday and to the aspirations of the peoples for which it was\ncreated.\nWhile on the topic of reform, I cannot gloss over the\nsubstantial progress made by Member States in the\ndifferent working groups of the General Assembly. 1997\nwill mark the crowning of sustained efforts, including the\nfulfilment of the mandates given to the Working Groups\non, respectively, the Agenda for Development and the\nstrengthening of the United Nations system. The\nunanimous adoption by the General Assembly of the\ndocuments that endorsed the often difficult and\npainstaking deliberations of these two Working Groups\n11\n\n\neloquently reflects our shared will to succeed, by\nconsensus, in laying the groundwork for the restructuring\nand modernization of our Organization in the priority fields\nof development and economic cooperation.\nAs for the reform of the Security Council, the high-\nlevel Working Group established to study this issue has\nmade considerable progress, although concrete measures\nhave not been adopted on such fundamental items as the\nexpansion and composition of the Council, and thee use of\nthe right of veto.\nHowever, I welcome the many constructive and often\ncomplementary proposals that have enriched the debates\nthis year. I am convinced that by redoubling our efforts we\nwill be able to benefit from the momentum that has been\ncreated, and that we will succeed in restructuring and\nmodernizing the Security Council by making it more\ndemocratic and credible as well as more legitimate and\ntransparent.\nThe maintenance of peace and security, we know,\nrequires the prevention, management and settlement of\ncrises \u2014 of which there unfortunately are still a large\nnumber, often pernicious. These crises are currently sources\nof grave concern to the entire international community, and\nparticularly to Africa, where some countries continue to be\nafflicted by multifaceted conflicts. In this respect, it is\ngratifying to note that significant advances have been made\nhere and there towards the restoration of peace and security.\nMy delegation is gratified at the dynamic process that\nled on 20 July to the holding of general, free and credible\nelections in Liberia, marking the end of a long and brutal\ncivil war and the establishment in that country of\ndemocratic institutions. This victory, which is above all that\nof the people of Liberia themselves, must be welcomed as\na successful example of the settlement of a regional conflict\nand should serve as a source of inspiration for the\nsettlement of other crises.\nMali, which has played an active role in the settlement\nof the Liberian crisis in both the Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS) and its Monitoring Group\n(ECOMOG), would like to recall here that assistance for\nthe reconstruction of Liberia is the only means of\nconsolidating the peace won at such cost. The results\nobtained by the Inter-African Mission to Monitor the\nImplementation of the Bangui Agreements are a good\nexample of the virtues of direct dialogue and of\ninternational mediation.\nMy country welcomes the positive evolution of the\ncrisis in the Central African Republic as a result of the\ncommendable efforts of the International Mediation\nCommittee established by the Nineteenth Summit Meeting\nof Heads of State and Government of France and Africa.\nAs regards Western Sahara, my delegation is pleased\nwith the progress achieved at the end of the fourth round\nof private contacts on the implementation of the United\nNations Settlement Plan, with a view to the organization\nof a referendum for self-determination.\nConversely, the existence of other centres of tension\nand breaches of democratic order are of grave concern.\nThis is the case in Angola, where the delaying tactics of\nthe Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola\n(UNITA) are putting a severe strain on the peace process\nunder way. My country supports without reservation the\nmeasures recently decided upon by the Security Council\nrelating to this party to the conflict.\nLikewise, in Sierra Leone, the situation is extremely\nconfused because of the obstinacy of the leaders of the\nmilitary coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in holding on to power in spite of the\npressure exerted by the United Nations, the Organization\nof African Unity and, more particularly the Economic\nCommunity of West African States whose select\nministerial committee has courageously and selflessly\nundertaken difficult negotiations in order to achieve the\nre-establishment of constitutional order with the return of\nthe democratically elected president.\nMy country, which is a member of the International\nMediation Committee in the Republic of the Congo, is\ngravely concerned by the situation of widespread civil\nwar prevailing in that country. Once again, we appeal to\nthe sense of responsibility of the parties and ask them to\nengage resolutely and very quickly in a political\nsettlement of the crisis so that the mediation process can\nbe brought to a successful conclusion.\nThis crucial moment for Africa is equally crucial for\nthe Middle East, where the dynamic of peace that began\nwith the Madrid Conference is increasingly being called\ninto question by the recent serious events. This is the time\nand place to call urgently on the co-sponsors of the peace\nprocess and the international community as a whole to\ntake further initiatives to safeguard the peace process,\ninter alia by persuading the parties to resume the\nnegotiations as a matter of urgency with a view to the\napplication of the agreements that have been concluded.\n12\n\n\nMy country, Mali, also remains concerned by the\npersistence of the sanctions against Member States of our\nOrganization, in particular the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and\nby the suffering the sanctions cause for the peoples of these\ncountries.\nFor more than 50 years, the realization of the ideal of\ndisarmament has been at the centre of our constant concern\nto build a system of collective security, free of weapons of\nmass destruction. From this viewpoint significant progress\nhas been made towards, in particular, the reduction and\nultimate elimination of nuclear arsenals. In this respect,\nMali welcomes the entry into force on 29 April 1997 of the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and\non Their Destruction.\nNevertheless, the objective of general and complete\ndisarmament has still to be achieved. On the basis of this\nconviction, Mali has demonstrated its commitment to this\ngoal by taking concrete initiatives at the international,\nregional and national levels. Evidence of this is the\nresolution initiated by my country in 1994 and co-sponsored\nby about 20 Member States, regarding \u201cAssistance to States\nfor curbing the illicit traffic in small arms and collecting\nthem\u201d. This initiative by Mali, which contributed to\ninitiating the now well-known concept of\n\u201cmicrodisarmament\u201d within our Organization, is aimed at\ndrawing the attention of the international community to the\ndisastrous consequences of small arms, particularly in the\ndeveloping countries where, as we know, they play a large\npart in fuelling conflicts.\nAll this emphasizes how important it is urgently to\nsupport the efforts of the countries of the Saharo-Sahelian\nsubregion in order to stem the phenomenon of the\nproliferation of small arms, especially through effective\ncontrol of borders and the review of legal instruments\nregarding the bearing of arms.\nAlong the same lines, from 24 to 28 March 1997, the\nGovernment of Mali organized, together with the United\nNations Department of Political Affairs, the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n(UNESCO), a \u201cWeek of Peace\u201d to commemorate the first\nanniversary of the \u201cFlame of Peace\u201d. The international\nforum, held on that occasion, which brought together the\nrepresentatives of the countries of the subregion and of the\ninstitutions and bodies to which I have just referred, gave\nan opportunity to analyse the factors that led to the\nrestoration of peace in the northern regions of Mali and to\nidentify ways and means of ensuring lasting peace and of\npromoting a real culture of peace.\nI would like here to echo the fervent appeal made at\nthat forum for good governance, which favours\nparticipation over exclusion and dialogue over\nconfrontation, and which assures respect for democratic\nprinciples and human rights. I also wish, from this\nrostrum, to make an appeal to the international\ncommunity to give its full support to the proposal for a\nmoratorium on the import, export and production of light\nweapons that was formulated during the consultations\nheld at the same time as the \u201cWeek of Peace\u201d. In addition\nto the countries of the West African subregion, these\nconsultations brought together representatives of the\nUnited Nations, OAU, the ECOWAS/Togo agreement on\nnon-aggression and defence assistance (ANAD), and our\ndevelopment partners.\nFurthermore, the conflicts in recent years have\nshown that conventional weapons can also cause mass\ndestruction. For that reason my country welcomed the\nadoption on 18 September 1997 of the Convention on the\ntotal ban of anti-personnel mines, and supports the\ninternational efforts, including the Ottawa process, to\nachieve the total elimination of anti-personnel mines at\nthe global level.\nThe values of peace, freedom and economic and\nsocial justice which inspired the founding fathers of the\nUnited Nations must remain today, more than ever, the\nfoundations of the joint action incumbent on us in the\nquest for a decent life for everyone. In this respect, we\nmust, together and in a united way, seek concerted\nsolutions to the persistent problems of underdevelopment.\nThus, from New York in 1990, with the World\nSummit for Children, to Rome in 1996 with the World\nFood Summit, the great international conferences of the\ndecade have contributed remarkably to the preparation of\na new design for human society at the dawning of the\nthird millennium. The paradigm of sustainable\ndevelopment, based on economic growth that is sustained,\nsocially equitable and ecologically viable, constitutes the\ncommon denominator on which the international\ncommunity now agrees in order to give new direction to\nthe collective search for the economic and social well-\nbeing of our peoples. The mixed results of last June\u2019s\nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to an\noverall evaluation of the implementation of Agenda 21\nare a sharp reminder of the vital need to think for our\n13\n\n\nworld globally and act collectively to meet the challenges\nconfronting our planet.\nRegardless of the angle from which we approach\nthem, the problems at the end of this century cannot be\nresolved except through concerted and integrated action \u2014\naction capable of managing harmoniously the upheavals\naccompanying this changing period of history. The\nconsensus achieved in the Agenda for Development shows\nour shared faith in the virtues of a new global partnership\nfor development, based on the imperative of\ninterdependence and on mutually beneficial action.\nSince the conceptual framework has been defined and\naccepted by all, it is now time \u2014 and high time \u2014 to move\nto action through a rational mobilization of resources in\nkeeping with the generous goals formulated in the Agenda\nfor Development.\nThe settlement of the debt crisis, just remuneration for\ncommodities, the renunciation of trade barriers and an\nincrease in official development assistance \u2014 this is\nessentially the direction that needs to be taken in order to\nbuild a world that is more accommodating to all, so true is\nit that our global village cannot be built in a lasting way if\nthe majority of its members are excluded. The fight against\npoverty in this context has absolute priority, because it is\nsimply unacceptable at the dawning of the third millennium\nthat millions of men and women throughout the world\nshould continue to lack the minimal conditions for a decent\nlife. The aspiration of peoples for a better life is a\nlegitimate quest which cannot be ignored.\nAs Mali sees it, any work towards sustainable\ndevelopment is above all a national responsibility, through\nthe effective definition and application of sound\nmacroeconomic policies, based on transparency, the pre-\neminent rule of law, the practice of democracy, respect for\nhuman rights, social justice, and the participation of all in\nthe effort of national development. For my country, this is\nthe surest path to follow in our quest for the shared ideal\nassigned to us by the United Nations Charter:\n\u201cto promote social progress and better standards of life\nin larger freedom\u201d.\nWe are on the eve of a new millennium, which will\nsee the emergence of new challenges and new threats, but\nalso of great dreams and hopes for humankind.\nAs responsible leaders of our States, we have an\nobligation to seek ways and means to meet these\nchallenges. But we also need to guide in the right\ndirection the aspirations of our peoples to live in peace,\nliberty, progress and active solidarity.\nFifty-two years ago the founding fathers of our\nOrganization cleared the way for us to attain these noble\nobjectives, which are still relevant. If we apply the terms\nof the Charter, we will be able to respond to particular\nuncertainties and put an end to the climate of doubt, fear\nand suspicion that characterizes present day international\nrelations.\nWe must also agree to do more and to do better in\nour quest for a better future for the human race. We\nbelieve in the United Nations as the institution to help us\nachieve this.\nThe President of the Republic of Mali, His\nExcellency Mr. Alpha Oumar Konar\u00e9, is convinced that\na restructured, modernized United Nations, endowed with\nthe essential capacity to act, can help to resolve our\ndisputes, ensure more orderly management of world\naffairs and eliminate the injustice, disparity and egoism\nthat threaten humankind.\nThat is why my country, Mali, will continue to work\nwith enthusiasm and determination to ensure the\nemergence of a United Nations that is truly united in its\ndiversity, at peace with itself and resolutely committed to\nthe service of all peoples.\n"

For God\nHath power over all things.\u201d (The Holy Koran, II:148)\n(spoke in English)\nI convey to you, Sir, and to the nations assembled\nhere the greetings of our people in this golden jubilee year\nof Pakistan\u2019s independence.\nSoon after achieving its independence, Pakistan was\nadmitted to the United Nations. The half-century of\nPakistan\u2019s and the United Nations existence has been\neventful. Through years of upheavals and dislocations,\nthrough turbulence and brief moments of tranquillity, we\nnow stand at the threshold of a new century and a new\nmillennium. The theme of world affairs has been\ntransformed.\nDuring these 50 years, Pakistan has demonstrated its\ncommitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter\nof the United Nations in word and deed. We have\nfulfilled our obligations to this Organization. We have\nadhered to its resolutions. We have contributed politically\nand materially to its collective endeavour to build peace\nand promote prosperity. We are especially proud of our\ncontribution to United Nations peacekeeping operations\nworldwide.\nI wish to commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for his determination and vision in carrying out\nhis responsibilities. I would like to assure him that\nPakistan will, as always, support all initiatives for the\nrealization of the objectives set out in the United Nations\nCharter.\nWe are fortunate to have a person of your stature\nand experience, Sir, to guide this session of the General\nAssembly. The items on its agenda are important and\nconsequential, particularly the crucial issue of United\nNations reform. I wish you every success.\nDoctrines of confrontation and containment are no\nlonger valid. The new idea of our times is that of global\npartnership between the North and the South, the East and\nthe West. The United Nations must forge this global\ncompact. The creed of our era is peace and development.\nThis is what the United Nations must focus on as it\nstrives to bring about organizational reform. We support\nthe process of reform in the United Nations. In pursuing\nthis objective, we must bear in mind our successes and\nfailures of the past 50 years. The centrality and sanctity\nof the Charter must be preserved as we move towards\nreconfiguring the United Nations.\nThe United Nations today stands at the brink of\nbankruptcy. The reform cannot and must not be victim to\nthe narrow strategic, political and administrative\npreferences of a chosen few as a means of regaining the\nOrganization\u2019s solvency. True reform has to take into\naccount the interests of all. The United Nations is a\nuniversal Organization of 185 States and their 6 billion\npeople. The purpose of its creation was to serve the\ninterests of all humankind. This should be the guiding\nprinciple for its reform.\nThere is undoubtedly need for reform. The map of\nthe world has been redrawn. Many new States have\nemerged since 1945, when the United Nations was\nestablished. The reform that is envisaged must be\ndesigned to facilitate the objectives for which the United\n7\n\n\nNations was created: to promote global peace, security,\ncooperation and prosperity.\nMore than mere lip service must be done to the\nprinciples enshrined in the United Nations Charter, such as\nthe sovereign equality of all its Members and equal rights\nfor all nations, large or small. The emergence of five veto-\nwielding permanent members of the Security Council was\nthe consequence of an unfortunate afterthought. It was\ncompletely incompatible with the democratic ethos of the\nUnited Nations Charter. The result was the impotence and\ninaction of the United Nations during the cold war years.\nThe legitimization and enlargement of the privileged club\nof veto powers would deal a crippling body blow to the\nability of the United Nations to carry out its responsibilities.\nThe contours of a multipolar world are gradually\nemerging. In the event of a resumption of great-Power\nrivalries, the proliferation of the veto will once again freeze\nthe Security Council into irrelevance.\nIt is ironical that the countries which practice\ndemocracy at home and advocate it abroad should want to\ncreate a new aristocracy of States. Any decision on Security\nCouncil reform that is not backed by the consensus of all\nthe Member States of the United Nations will erode the\ncredibility and undermine the legitimacy of the Council and\nof the United Nations.\nThe Charter of the United Nations rejects hegemony.\nInternational peace and security have to be built through\ncooperative efforts. This entails the resolution of disputes\nthrough negotiations, mediation and arbitration. It means\nremoving the causes of war and conflict. It involves the\npromotion of global prosperity and development. It\nnecessitates adherence to the resolutions of the United\nNations, particularly those of the Security Council.\nThe enforcement of peace should be undertaken only\nin response to actual acts of aggression or breaches. It must\nbe pursued collectively and fairly, not imposed arbitrarily\nby the strong over the weak. Nowhere does the Charter\nprovide for pre-emptive penalties against States for arms\nproliferation or presumed threats to peace.\nA central weakness of the United Nations is that some\nmembers are expected to pay their contributions to its\nbudget fully, unconditionally and on time, while others\ndelay payments. The principle of capacity-to-pay-is fair; it\nshould not be unilaterally discarded. At the same time,\nalternate sources of funding have to be explored in order to\nmake the United Nations immune to pressure, unhealthy\ninfluence and hostile onslaughts.\nThe intention of the Charter was to place the United\nNations at the apex of the system of international\norganizations that were created at the end of the Second\nWorld War. The Charter rightly perceived political,\nsecurity, economic, social, cultural and humanitarian\nissues to be interrelated. It therefore called for\ncoordinated approaches and policies to address those\nissues. To achieve this, it is essential for the United\nNations to become the central link for the entire family of\ninternational organizations, without exception. Only then\nwill the world community be able to address successfully\nthe host of diverse, complex and interrelated problems it\nconfronts.\nOn its fiftieth anniversary, Pakistan \u2014 like the\nUnited Nations \u2014 has embarked upon the course of\nreform and renewal. In this endeavour, we are inspired by\nthe eternal ideals of Islam in which justice, equity and\nhuman rights, especially those of women and minorities,\nare the central pillars. Islam draws no distinction between\ncreeds. It accepts all religions. Thus, the Holy Koran\ndeclares:\n(spoke in Arabic)\n\u201cSay ye: We believe\nIn God, and the revelation\nGiven to us, and to Abraham,\nIsma\u00af \u0131\u00afl, Isaac, Jacob,\nAnd the Tribes, and that given\nTo Moses and Jesus, and that given\nTo (all) Prophets from their Lord:\nWe make no difference\nBetween one and another of them:\nAnd we bow to God (in Islam).'\u201d (The Holy Koran,\nII:136)\n(spoke in English)\nMy Government is vigorously addressing the\npolitical, economic and social problems we inherited from\nthe past. We have taken measures to consolidate\nparliamentary democracy through constitutional means; to\nrestore financial equilibrium through austerity and\nstructural adjustments while enhancing business incentives\nand economic liberalization; to combat corruption, drugs\nand terrorism \u2014 which is often sponsored from abroad \u2014\nthrough effective law enforcement and speedy and fair\njustice.\n8\n\n\nThese policies have yielded dividends. We look to the\nfuture with hope and optimism. Our economy is open and\ndynamic. Domestic and foreign investment is growing\nrapidly. Our people are imaginative, skilful and hard-\nworking. We have demonstrated that we can master the\nmost advanced technologies. We can now deter external\naggression. With confidence in ourselves, we seek\nfriendship and cooperation with all our neighbours on the\nbasis of equality.\nPakistan strives for peace and stability in its region.\nWe seek an early end to the conflict in Afghanistan; a just\nand fair settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in\naccordance with the resolutions of the United Nations; an\nend to the wasteful arms race in South Asia; and the\ndevelopment of the immense economic and commercial\npotential of South and Central Asia.\nWe have the courage to strive for peace and the\nwisdom to know that it is essential for development. South\nAsia, with one-fifth of the world\u2019s population, remains\nmired in poverty and deprivation. I call upon India to join\nus in liberating our peoples from the dreadful grip of\npoverty. This can only be achieved by removing the causes\nof conflict and hostility.\nThe conflict that has ravaged Afghanistan for almost\ntwo decades must be brought to an end. No country in the\nworld has suffered more than Pakistan as a consequence of\nthe turmoil. We therefore have a vital interest in the\nrestoration of durable peace and stability in Afghanistan.\nTowards this end we have been in contact with all Afghan\ngroups in support of the efforts of the United Nations\naimed at promoting an intra-Afghan peace process.\nWe favour no faction in Afghanistan. We have\nrecognized the present authorities in Kabul, as we did the\nprevious entities that controlled the capital. We have\nencouraged moderation and dialogue so that a stable, multi-\nethnic Government can emerge. We request the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations to take specific initiatives for\nthe early restoration of peace and the preservation of the\nsovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Afghanistan.\nMy Government has also taken initiatives to resume\nthe stalled dialogue with India. We had agreed last June on\na comprehensive agenda and a mechanism to deal with all\nissues, including the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir, in\na sustained manner. We have, unfortunately, not yet\nsucceeded in setting up the agreed mechanism to launch\nsubstantive negotiations on all the issues on the agenda of\nour dialogue. We hope that India will reciprocate our\nsincerity of purpose in substantively addressing all the\nissues and carrying forward this process of dialogue to a\npositive outcome.\nThe resolutions of the Security Council define\nKashmir as a disputed territory whose accession to either\nPakistan or India is to be determined through a plebiscite\nsupervised by the United Nations. Under the Simla\nAgreement of 1972, India agreed to a final settlement of\nthe Jammu and Kashmir dispute with Pakistan.\nThe existence of the Kashmir dispute cannot be\ndenied. The right of self-determination is sacrosanct. It\nhas repeatedly been affirmed by the United Nations. The\npeople of Kashmir are justified in asking why this pledge\nby the international community has not been honoured as\nyet. The Security Council cannot be selective in the\nimplementation of its resolutions.\nThe Kashmiri people have risen against Indian\noccupation. Their resolute struggle for the restitution of\ntheir fundamental rights belies the claim that Kashmir is\nan integral part of India.\nI am sad to say that the repression of the people of\nJammu and Kashmir continues unabated. More than\n600,000 Indian troops in Kashmir continue to brutalize\nthe people. Custodial killings, disappearances, arbitrary\narrests and summary executions are daily occurrences.\nThousands of Kashmiri civilians have been killed, while\n32,000 languish in detention centres. I learned just this\nmorning of the shelling of Arin in Kashmir by the Indian\nforces yesterday, a mortar attack in which 11 persons\nwere killed and 12 injured. Six children and three women\nwere among the dead. This is an altogether familiar\noccurrence in occupied Kashmir.\nIf India is serious in its allegation that the conflict in\nKashmir is being stoked by interference from Pakistan it\nshould have no hesitation in allowing the United Nations\nobservers present in Kashmir to verify this claim. We\nhope that the United Nations will increase the number of\nthese observers and ask India to allow their stationing on\nits side of the line of control as well.\nThe international community has a responsibility to\nbring about a just settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The\npledge of self-determination given to the people of\nJammu and Kashmir has to be redeemed. On our part, we\nwelcome the offers made by the Secretary-General, the\nUnited States and others to help in resolving the Kashmir\ndispute.\n9\n\n\nMy Government will persevere in the dialogue with\nIndia for the sake of our people and the peoples of South\nAsia. We hope that India can be persuaded to take some\nsteps to create a climate conducive to the success of the\ntalks. These could include, first, a halt in its campaign of\nrepression against the people of Kashmir; secondly, the\nwithdrawal of at least those Indian troops which are\nengaged in internal repression in Kashmir; and, finally, the\nevolution of a mechanism to take into account the wishes\nof the Kashmiri people, as stipulated by the United Nations,\nfor a final settlement.\nIt is imperative now to negotiate arrangements to\nstrengthen peace and security between India and Pakistan.\nSince 1974 Pakistan has pursued its proposal for a nuclear-\nweapon-free zone in South Asia. On the other hand, India\nhas taken successive steps to escalate its nuclear and\nmissile capabilities. What does India mean when it\nrepeatedly asserts that its nuclear option is \u201copen\u201d? Does\nthis imply that, like chemical weapons, India has already\nmanufactured nuclear weapons? In the absence of any\nassurances to the contrary, Pakistan will have to assume the\nworst.\nIndia\u2019s nuclear-capable Prithvi missile is being serially\nproduced. These missiles specifically target Pakistan. They\nhave been moved adjacent to our borders. This creates a\nhair-trigger security environment. The development and\npossible deployment of the medium-range Agni missile and\nIndia\u2019s planned acquisition of theatre missile-defence\nsystems will further aggravate this tense security\nenvironment. It will evoke the natural response from\nPakistan to safeguard and augment its security and\ndeterrence capability. India must be persuaded to reverse its\nmissile programme.\nTo preserve peace and stability in South Asia and\nbeyond, we propose that Pakistan and India should reach\nagreement for mutual and equal restraint in the nuclear and\nballistic fields. In this context, we are deeply concerned\nabout India\u2019s acquisition of missiles and its plans for the\nacquisition of anti-missile systems. We also propose a\nsimilar arrangement for mutual and equitable restraint on\nconventional weapons which ensures equal security to both\nPakistan and India.\nWe are prepared to conclude and strengthen\nconfidence- building measures. As a first step, we could\nagree on a set of principles to guide future bilateral arms-\ncontrol arrangements.\nWe believe that a just settlement of the Jammu and\nKashmir dispute and progress on the issues of peace and\nsecurity will usher in an era of amity and progress in\nSouth Asia. To facilitate the realization of this objective,\nI offer today, from this rostrum, to open negotiations on\na treaty of non-aggression between Pakistan and India.\nThere are many areas in which we can cooperate for\nmutual benefit. Trade liberalization can take place on an\nequitable basis. Significant foreign investment can be\ndrawn to the region.\nIn the expectation that the Pakistan-India dialogue\nwill have made a heartening advance by next year, my\nGovernment intends to host a regional economic summit\nin 1998, which could help to open new vistas for\neconomic progress and prosperity for our region.\nAll this and much more can be achieved if India\njoins us in pursuing our current dialogue to its successful\nculmination. We have demonstrated our sincerity of\npurpose. It is for India to reciprocate.\nLocated at the nexus of Central Asia, South Asia and\nthe Middle East, Pakistan can contribute to and gain from\nthe economic growth and interaction between these\ndynamic regions. The United Nations and its family of\norganizations have a crucial role to play in generating\nprosperity and restoring peace with justice to these vital\nregions of the world.\nToday, I wish to renew Pakistan\u2019s commitment to\nthe United Nations, to its purposes and principles and to\nits vision of a world where genuine peace reigns and\nprosperity is universal. The vision of the founding fathers\nof the United Nations must continue to serve as a beacon\nguiding us across the uncharted waters of the coming\nmillennium. The Charter of the United Nations and its\ntimeless principles provide us the anchor to weather\nturmoil and turbulence. Let us renew our determination to\ndefend and preserve this anchor of hope and faith. Let not\npolitical expediencies infringe or erode the fundamentals\nof international cooperation enshrined in the Charter.\nWe in Pakistan, who had dared to dream of freedom\n50 years ago, are resolved to defend freedom \u2014 freedom\nfrom war, oppression, injustice, poverty and deprivation.\nLet us all move together towards realizing the vision of\nthe United Nations.\n10\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn\nbehalf of the delegation of Niger, I should like Sir, to\nexpress my warm congratulations on your unanimous\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-second session. We regard your election as a just\ntribute to your country, the Republic of Ukraine, whose\ncommitment to the ideals of our Organization is well\nknown.\nI would also like to congratulate the other members of\nthe Bureau, who I am convinced will help you in the\naccomplishment of your delicate mission.\nIn addition, I wish to express to your predecessor,\nMr. Razali Ismail, our deep appreciation for the remarkable\nwork he did during his presidency.\nTo Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of our\nOrganization, may I express my Government's full support\nand brotherly encouragement for the commendable action\nhe is carrying out in order to promote greater cooperation\nbetween our peoples and nations in order to build a world\nof peace and progress.\nOnce again, Niger is pleased to take part in a session\nof the General Assembly, which is an ideal framework for\nthe Member States of our Organization to debate, in a\nspirit of partnership, complex matters affecting the destiny\nof humanity.\nWe must all agree that over its 52 years of existence\nthe United Nations has gained a more than honourable\nrecord in achieving its purposes, especially in the areas of\npeacekeeping, decolonization, and the promotion of, and\nrespect for, human rights, as well as in the search for\nglobal solutions to the major problems of our times \u2014\ndevelopment, the environment, population and the\nprotection of women and children, to mention just a few.\nThe immense work accomplished so far is above all\nthe result of our capacity to work together in our common\ninterest and in the interest of future generations. Niger\ntherefore believes that international cooperation, which is\nthe basis of these major achievements, must be\nstrengthened, because it is the source of stability and\nprogress.\nThe maintenance of international peace and security,\nthe primary purpose of our Organization, deserves\neveryone's special attention at a time when the\ninternational community, with the cold war finally ended,\nis getting down to establishing a new world order that\nstrictly respects the purposes and principles of the United\nNations Charter.\n\n\nNiger welcomes the report presented by the Secretary-\nGeneral last July on the reform of our Organization. We\nsupport this process and hope that it will provide synergy,\ngiving the means and flexibility indispensable for the\nOrganization if it is to meet the numerous challenges it\nfaces at the dawn of the third millennium.\nMy delegation believes too that the Security Council\nmust be reformed in order to make it more effective, given\nits responsibilities in the sphere of collective security. In\nparticular, such reform must address the expansion of the\nCouncil on the basis of the principles of equitable\ngeographical distribution and of the sovereign equality of\nStates.\nIn the same vein, we consider that better handling of\nthe emergencies that constantly arise in so many places\nmust include an improvement in the Organization's capacity\nto deploy peacekeeping forces in a timely fashion wherever\nnecessary.\nLet me express Niger's deep concern at the conflicts\nand tensions in Africa and in the Middle East. Turning first\nto Africa, we note with distress that internal confrontations\nand disruptions are the main cause of the political\ninstability in some countries and of the massive movements\nof refugees that are at the root of a tragic humanitarian\ncrisis. Niger has a deep commitment to peace, and must\nonce again urge the warring parties in the States concerned\nto renounce violence and engage in productive dialogue to\nfind solutions to their disputes, thus restoring stability to\ntheir respective countries.\nI take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute\nto the people of Liberia, who after seven years of cruel war\naccepted the peace plan proposed by the States members of\nthe Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS). The Liberian people's will for peace is clearly\nreflected in their respect for the ceasefire and, above all, in\nthe 19 July national elections, which were conducted in an\natmosphere of calm and openness. I am pleased to pay\ntribute to the valuable role played by our great brother\ncountry, Nigeria, in the process of restoring peace to\nLiberia.\nIn Congo (Brazzaville), we hail the tireless efforts of\nneighbouring African countries, of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity and of the United Nations to calm the\nsituation. More than ever, that crisis highlights the urgent\nneed to create an African peacekeeping force. I can today\nassure the Assembly that my country is fully prepared to\ncontribute to the establishment of such a force, as it did\nin the cases of Rwanda, Burundi and Liberia.\nTurning to the situation in Western Sahara, my\ncountry welcomes the recent agreement by the two\nparties; we hope that the referendum will take place in\nconditions of peace and calm.\nTo promote peace and security in the Middle East,\nthe international community must pay sustained attention\nto the tension in the occupied Palestinian territories,\nwhich has been steadily rising since the Israeli\nGovernment decision to build a new settlement in\noccupied East Jerusalem. That Israeli decision endangers\nthe peace process that began in Madrid on the basis of\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and\n425 (1978) and on the basis of the principle of land for\npeace.\nIn the face of that Israeli Government position, the\ninternational community has no choice but to redouble its\nefforts to secure dialogue and, above all, justice \u2014 which\nform the foundation of a peaceful future in the Middle\nEast, along with the necessary exercise by the Palestinian\npeople of its inalienable rights, including the right to the\nestablishment of an independent State, and scrupulous\nrespect for agreements reached between the Israeli\nGovernment and the Palestine Liberation Organization on\nthe basis of the relevant Security Council and General\nAssembly resolutions.\nSince its creation, the United Nations has always\ngiven high priority to disarmament, and in particular to\nthe elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of\nmass destruction. There has been good progress on this\nissue with the conclusion of a number of international\ninstruments, the most notable of which, in our view, are\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention and the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Niger is deeply\nconvinced that disarmament is an essential element in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security and has\nacceded to those important agreements, which are aimed\nat preventing the development of nuclear weapons and of\nother weapons of mass destruction.\nMy country is keenly aware also of other, no less\nimportant, issues relating to illegal trafficking in small\narms and to a complete ban on the anti-personnel mines\nthat constitute a harsh scourge that continues to inflict\nunspeakable human suffering.\n2\n\n\nCivil wars and political upheaval in Africa have\nfostered the proliferation of illicit weapons. To collect and\nmonitor weapons illicitly held by individuals, Niger has\njoined the United Nations and several neighbouring\ncountries to take wide-ranging action against this scourge.\nOn the domestic level, we created in 1994 a national\ncommission for the collection and monitoring of illicit\nweapons.\nMy country is genuinely pleased also at the existence\nof regional disarmament initiatives, some of which have led\nto the conclusion of arrangements such as the Treaty on the\nDenuclearization of Africa.\nIn our view, it is essential to benefit from the climate\nof confidence and cooperation now prevailing on the\ninternational scene to give new impetus to multilateral\nnegotiations leading to nuclear disarmament. That is the\nonly way to make progress towards building a safer world,\nwhich is a legitimate aspiration of all our peoples.\nThe tragic effects of poverty in a large number of\ncountries merely exacerbate instability in the world.\nDespite the remarkable progress made in recent years\nin the economic and social fields, following the\nimplementation of structural economic reforms, Africa\nremains in many respects a region where poverty has\nincreased spectacularly. On this continent are found the\nmajority of countries with the lowest indices with respect\nto human development.\nFor this reason, as a Sahelian country, we feel that the\nreform process proposed by the Secretary-General must\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations and its functions\nin development matters, making priorities of reducing\npoverty and strengthening the participation of more\ncountries in an expanding world economy. The remarkable\ncontribution made by the development institutions, such as\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the\nUnited Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA), in our country must be\nhighlighted. We encourage the Secretary-General to ensure\nthat in the reform process there will be respect for the\nautonomy of these bodies in order to preserve their\neffectiveness.\nWe welcomed the United Nations New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s, adopted in 1991,\nwhich has been supplemented by the United Nations\nSystem-wide Special Initiative on Africa launched by the\nSecretary-General in March 1996. Their purpose was to\nhelp Africa in its recovery efforts. Today it is more\nurgent than ever that the industrialized countries grant\nbroad support to these programmes, and establish funds\nfor diversification to allow African countries to obtain a\nbetter return for their commodities and thus assure vital\nresources for their populations. This support in particular\nmust take the form of resources to be invested in priority\nsectors, such as basic education, health and security of\nfood and water supplies, sectors capable of laying down\nsolid bases for sustainable development in Africa.\nAfrica certainly needs assistance. But my country\nremains convinced that the resources the continent needs\nfor its development efforts can be generated by increasing\ntrade with the developed countries. African countries are\nwaiting for the industrialized countries to implement the\nmeasures adopted as part of the Final Act of the Uruguay\nRound negotiations, supplemented by specific preference\nprovisions in the Marrakesh Agreements, to mitigate the\nnegative effects the reforms envisaged in the negotiations\ncould have on countries which are net importers of food\nproducts.\nSimilarly, the external debt of African countries is a\nproblem requiring viable and fair solutions, going beyond\nthe measures taken in the Paris Club framework. The new\ninitiative taken recently by the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund to significantly reduce the\nmultilateral debt of the poorest countries, should extend\nto all those countries, without any eligibility conditions or\ndeadlines.\nNonetheless, the cancellation of all the debt is the\nmost appropriate solution in order to ensure accelerated\ndevelopment by the least developed countries. Such\nactions, in my delegation's view, will make it possible to\nreduce poverty noticeably.\nThese recommendations are set out in the Agenda\nfor Development, adopted during the last Assembly\nsession. It is up to the international community to\neffectively implement this programme to bring about\ndevelopment and growth in our countries.\nBecause of its lack of resources, successive droughts\nand high population growth, Niger is part of the group of\nAfrican countries where poverty is omnipresent. In the\nlight of its high level of poverty, His Excellency\nMr. Ibrahim Ma\u00efnassara Bar\u00e9, President of the Republic\nof Niger, and the Government decided that for society to\nprogress we needed stable and democratic institutions\nguaranteeing respect for and the promotion of human\n3\n\n\nrights. It was also decided to make all our development\nactions part of our battle against poverty.\nIn liaison with its development partners, the\nGovernment of Niger has therefore agreed on a plan to\ncombat poverty, with policies to stimulate sustainable\ngrowth, improve rural income, give better access to social\nservices and slow population growth, in particular. We\nwould like to take this opportunity to invite bilateral and\nmultilateral donors to play an active part in implementing\nthis plan to combat poverty in Niger.\nOur Government is firmly committed to ensuring good\nmanagement of our economy, deepening the\ndemocratization process and bringing about the participation\nat all levels of those who would benefit from the execution\nof this plan, which is based on principles of good\ngovernment. That commitment undoubtedly guarantees its\nsuccess.\nMoreover, I am particularly pleased to inform the\nAssembly, and thus to reassure the my country's backers\nand partners that peace in Niger has become an\nunquestioned reality. Indeed, since the signing of the peace\nagreement of 24 April 1995 in Niamey between the\nGovernment of the Republic of Niger and the Organization\nof the Armed Resistance, the peace process has made\nremarkable progress. For example, action has been taken\nwith respect to decentralization, the return of refugees, the\ncelebration each year of a day of harmony and the\nimplementation of an emergency programme for the\nrehabilitation of our agricultural region. I solemnly appeal\nto the international community to contribute to the\ncompletion of the peace progress already begun.\nBefore concluding, I would like to reaffirm the\ncomplete commitment of a Sahelian country such as Niger\nto protecting the environment, whose continuous\ndegradation is a source of real concern. Niger welcomed the\nrecent holding in New York of the nineteenth special\nsession of the General Assembly, devoted to a review of\nthe implementation of Agenda 21 and the establishment of\nnew policies for the future.\nThe special session showed us that while notable\nprogress has been made with respect to climate change,\nbiodiversity, combating desertification and the use of\nrenewable sources of energy, that is not the case with\nregard to no less important questions, such as access to\ndrinking water, which is a real problem for humankind, the\nunbridled exploitation of the oceans and deforestation.\nThus, we have to recognize that, at the conclusion of\nits proceedings, the special session did not live up to the\nhopes placed in it. In particular, it failed to create new\nlevels of international cooperation or to establish a basis\nfor legally binding codes of conduct on improved\nenvironmental protection.\nIn that context, my delegation confines itself here to\nrecalling Principle 7 of the Rio Declaration, which\nemphasizes the concept of common but differentiated\nresponsibilities for the entire international community\nwith respect to environmental matters. The\ncomplementarity between economic, social and\nenvironmental questions obliges all our countries to\nacknowledge the need for solidarity and joint action to\nreach the goals laid down in Agenda 21. We owe this\nsolidarity to future generations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, I have the\ndistinct honour and privilege on behalf of my delegation to\nextend to you, Sir, our warmest congratulations upon your\nelection as President of the fifty-second session of the\nGeneral Assembly. Your election to this office is a fitting\ntribute to your personal qualities and recognition of the\nimportant role of your great nation in world affairs. We are\nconfident that your wide experience and wisdom will ensure\nthe success of our deliberations. You may rest assured of\nthe fullest support and cooperation of my delegation.\nI would also like to thank Ambassador Razali Ismail\nfor his remarkable contribution to the last session. We\nthank him for his strong leadership and his hands-on\napproach during the discussions of some of the most\ndifficult and crucial issues concerning the future of our\nOrganization.\nThe changes taking place throughout the world today\npresent new challenges for the United Nations system and\ncall for a new approach in finding appropriate solutions.\nIt is my firm belief that the success of the United Nations\ncannot be contemplated without reform and renewal of\nthe Organization. We agree that the United Nations stands\nat a crossroads today. Its continued role and relevance\ndepend on its ability to adapt to the new world\nenvironment.\nWe now have before us a number of proposals\ncontained in the Secretary-General\u2019s report designed to\nbetter equip the United Nations to address its tasks in the\nnew era. I thank the Secretary-General for this in-depth\nand valuable exercise. I take this opportunity to pay\ntribute to a great son of Africa and to his sterling qualities\nof leadership. The report not only addresses the strengths\nand weaknesses of our Organization, but also contains\nspecific proposals to enable it to face present and future\nchallenges on a sound footing. We subscribe fully to his\nview that this reform exercise is a process which will\nhave to be carried out over a continuous period of time,\ngiven all its complexity and scope. I wish to assure you,\nMr. President, that my delegation will extend its fullest\ncooperation and will actively participate in the\ndeliberations on the report.\nWe also endorse the Secretary-General\u2019s proposals\nfor promoting greater synergy within the United Nations\nsystem. We agree that they will advance complementarity\nand coherence. The effectiveness of the Organization will\ncertainly be enhanced if it operates as an orchestrated unit\nat Headquarters and at country level, rather than as a\ngroup of semi-autonomous players.\nLikewise, we welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s idea\nof setting up a development account to be fed by savings\nfrom reductions in non-programme costs. We express the\nsincere hope that sufficient funds will be made available\nto produce a significant impact on development\nprogramme financing. We should ensure that this dividend\nfor development does indeed benefit the developing\nworld, unlike the much-trumpeted \u201cpeace dividend\u201d of the\npost-cold-war era.\nWe uphold the proposals aimed at enhancing the\nstrategic direction which the General Assembly should\nprovide. However, such proposals should be subjected to\nthe most careful scrutiny, because of all their\n10\n\n\nimplications, particularly in respect to the smaller and more\nvulnerable Member States. The General Assembly, as the\nSecretary-General rightly points out, is the organ that\n\u201cmost fully embodies the universal and democratic\ncharacter of the Organization.\u201d (A/51/950, para. 40)\nWhile we support the long-standing need for focusing\nlegislative debates and streamlining this Assembly\u2019s agenda,\nwe must ensure that this body does not end up being\ndominated by the concerns of the strong and powerful\nmembers only. Countries \u2014 big or small, like mine \u2014\nshould have equal possibilities of articulating any issue they\nconsider important. It is by the way in which this\nOrganization addresses issues most relevant to its smallest\nmembers that the international community at large will\njudge its significance.\nThe debate on the reform of the Security Council\nseems to have registered some notable movement recently.\nHowever, the distance separating the main positions\nremains quite daunting. We hope that the wide spectrum of\nviews expressed so far on this subject will eventually\nconverge and that general agreement will be reached. Such\nagreement should ensure that the composition of the\nreformed Council is based on greater representation,\ntransparency and equitable geographical distribution, with\nthe inclusion of developing countries as permanent\nmembers. In this regard, we reaffirm our support for the\nposition of the Non-Aligned Movement calling for the\nexpansion of the Security Council on the basis of fair and\nadequate representation.\nAfrica has also stated its position on this matter at the\nrecent Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit. The\ncurrent representation of Africa in the Council does not\nreflect its status as the most sizeable group of the\nOrganization\u2019s membership. Reform of this body must,\ntherefore, restore Africa\u2019s position to the fullest extent\npossible.\nIn the same vein, my delegation would like to reiterate\nits support for India\u2019s claim to a permanent seat in the\nSecurity Council.\nThe globalization of the world economy is adding\nincreasing pressures on the developing countries to embrace\ntrade liberalization as a means to achieve economic growth.\nDuring the Uruguay Round negotiations developing\ncountries made significant concessions in the hope of\nobtaining improved access to international markets. Many\nof them have still not seen the benefits of the new global\ntrading system. Instead, they are haunted by the spectre of\nimminent erosion of preferences in their major export\nmarkets. Several African countries have made strenuous\nefforts to adhere faithfully to structural adjustment\nprogrammes and have adopted trade liberalization\npolicies. Unfortunately, they have registered but an\ninsignificant, if not declining, percentage of world trade.\nAfrica\u2019s trade should become the top priority of the\ninternational community; otherwise, the multilateral\ntrading system will run the risk of becoming fraught with\ntensions and discrimination.\nIt is unfortunate to note that foreign direct\ninvestment, which plays a central role in the ongoing\nintegration of the world economy, is still highly\nconcentrated in a few countries. The recent findings of\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) indicate that Africa received\nmerely $5 billion out of $349 billion of foreign direct\ninvestment last year. Excluding South Africa, the share of\nAfrica in the total investment for the developing countries\nfigured at only 4 per cent. This is the lowest share since\nthe early 1980s, and is a further indication that the\nAfrican region is not benefiting from the global foreign\ndirect investment boom. The 33 sub-Saharan countries\nthat are classified among the least developed countries are\nin fact receiving less that 1 per cent of the total foreign\ndirect investment for Africa. It is vital that these countries\nbe provided with greater assistance and investment and be\ngiven special attention by the international community.\nOtherwise, they will be further marginalized, with the risk\nof disappearing from the world economic map.\nWe therefore wish this Assembly to give more\nattention to the development needs of the African\ncontinent. In this context, we welcome the recent special\nministerial meeting of the Security Council, which has\nhelped focus the attention of the international community\non Africa. After several years of complacency and\nstagnation, there is now cause for some optimism.\nWe agree that it is incumbent upon us Africans to\nput our house in order. But unless we are freed from our\ndebt burden, future generations may never have the\nopportunity to have access to clean drinking water, health\ncare or proper schooling while scarce resources have to\nbe utilized for debt payments.\nFor some countries, like Mozambique, which are just\nemerging from years of civil conflict, the Bretton Woods\ninitiative may have to be implemented in order to reduce\ndebt faster. Indeed, not only do these countries have to\n11\n\n\nreduce their crushing debt load, they also have to free\nresources to rehabilitate their economic infrastructure and\nfund social expenditure.\nLast week the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Robin\nCook, referred to the Commonwealth Finance Ministers\nmeeting held in Mauritius earlier this month, at which the\nBritish Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, made\nspecific proposals with respect to debt. These proposals,\nknown as the Mauritius Mandate, are meant to set some of\nthe poorest nations on a path towards sustainable\ndevelopment by the year 2000. We welcome this laudable\ninitiative by the British Government to write off debts\ntotalling 132 million pounds of heavily indebted poor\ncountries of the Commonwealth. We hope that this\nimportant measure will encourage major financial\ninstitutions and creditor nations to come forward and\nparticipate fully in transforming the destiny of debt-ridden\npoor countries.\nWe also welcome the various initiatives recently taken\nby the United States to promote investment and to develop\na new trade regime for sub-Saharan Africa.\nWe equally appreciate the partnership between the\nEuropean Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific\n(ACP) countries, which has, through the successive Lom\u00e9\nConventions, contributed immensely to the socio-economic\ndevelopment of the ACP countries. We are confident that\nthe successor arrangement to the Fourth Lom\u00e9 Convention\nwill further consolidate this long-standing economic and\ntrade partnership, and in this context we look forward to the\ncontinued support of the international community.\nWe welcome the communiqu\u00e9 of the Denver Summit,\nwhich represents a significant advance over the New Global\nPartnership for Development adopted at the Lyon Summit.\nThe Declaration \u201cAfrica: Partnership for development\u201d\nfocuses attention exclusively on the African continent, with\nparticular emphasis on the least-developed and landlocked\ncountries. However, in the pledge to integrate the poorest\ncountries into this world economy through trade\nliberalization and investment policies, no specific targets\nwere defined on trade expansion or tariff reduction. If these\ncountries are to be completely weaned from official\ndevelopment assistance, not only should their capacity to\nproduce be strengthened, but they must also be given full\naccess to foreign markets for their products, especially\nthose coming from their nascent and developing industries.\nWe are fully conscious of the fact that North-South\ncooperation needs to be complemented by effective South-\nSouth cooperation. In this regard, the countries in our\nregion have intensified their efforts to accomplish that\ngoal.\nFor the Southern African Development Community\n(SADC), a new promising chapter was opened with the\nrecent admission of the Democratic Republic of Congo\nand Seychelles. With the inclusion of these two new\nmembers, the regional grouping has become an even more\nimportant economic area in the African continent. It has\nthe potential of becoming the driving force in promoting\ngrowth and development. There is a strong determination\namong the SADC members to achieve regional integration\nthrough industrial transformation and trade growth. My\nGovernment is fully committed to this goal, and I am\npleased to inform this Assembly that Mauritius will have\nthe honour and privilege of hosting the SADC summit\nmeeting next year.\nMy Government is equally committed to the Indian\nOcean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-\nARC), which regroups several countries of the Indian\nOcean Rim in a tripartite network of Government, private\nsector and academia. The IOR-ARC was formally\nlaunched at a ministerial meeting in Mauritius in March\nthis year with 14 founding members. It has generated\ntremendous interest among the countries of the region and\ninternationally.\nWe remain confident that the international\ncommunity will lend its support to these regional\nassociations. We welcome the timely initiative announced\nlast week by the United States Secretary of State to\nenhance dialogue with SADC and encourage investments\nand trade exchanges.\nIt is a matter of regret that the special session of the\nGeneral Assembly held last June to review the progress\nmade in the implementation of Agenda 21 was unable to\nagree on a frank assessment of the commitments entered\ninto at Rio. Unfortunately, very little has been done on\nthe ground. In some areas, particularly with regard to the\nlevel of official development assistance, the overall\nsituation has actually worsened. It is disappointing that\nthe lack of new and additional resources has not allowed\nthe special concerns of the small island developing\ncountries, as expressed in the Barbados Programme of\nAction, to be adequately addressed.\nWe also regret that on the question of climatic\nchange, no consensus on limits relating to the emission of\ngreenhouse gases could be reached. We hope that the\n12\n\n\nKyoto Conference on Climate Change will seriously address\nthis issue and adopt meaningful measures to cut down the\nproduction of greenhouse gases.\nThis year the General Assembly twice had to convene\nan emergency session to consider the extremely serious\nsituation in the occupied Palestinian territories. Unilateral\nactions have negated the Oslo peace process. This impasse\nmust now be broken. The recent diplomatic effort by the\nUnited States Secretary of State, Mrs. Madeleine Albright,\nseems to have averted a total deadlock. It is essential that\nthe protagonists start talking to each other again.\nWe view with serious concern the recent events in the\nIslamic Federal Republic of Comoros, which have resulted\nin the loss of human lives on the Island of Anjouan. We\nappeal to all the parties to the conflict to show restraint and\nto strive together towards a peaceful resolution of the crisis.\nWe reaffirm our support to the United Nations stand on the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the Comoros. We\nalso welcome the constructive role played by the OAU and\nthe League of Arab States in mediating between the various\nparties. We look forward to an early convening of the\nproposed international conference in Addis Ababa for the\nrestoration of peace in the Islamic Federal Republic of\nComoros.\nThe situation in Burundi continues to preoccupy the\ninternational community. We support the Arusha peace\ninitiative and reiterate our confidence in Mwalimu\nNyerere\u2019s role as facilitator in the process aimed at finding\na lasting solution to the Burundi crisis.\nLater this year, we will kick off the celebration of the\nfiftieth anniversary of one of the most important seminal\ndocuments adopted by this body \u2014 the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. During the year leading to\nthis landmark event, Mauritius will work together with all\nMember States in promoting and strengthening the human\nrights situation everywhere, especially in the communities\nto which we are more closely associated through shared\nhistory and culture, namely the Commonwealth and the\ncommunity of French-speaking countries.\nThe promotion of human rights has been an article of\nfaith for my Government. It is also an integral part of our\nforeign policy. In this respect we welcome the setting up of\nthe Indian Ocean Institute of Human Rights and Democracy\nin Mauritius for the promotion of human rights and\ndemocracy. We pledge our full support to this Institute.\nHuman rights for all, including women and children, and\ndemocratic values are matters of universal concern.\nAs a multi-ethnic democracy, Mauritius has always\nraised its voice strongly against discrimination based on\nrace, religion, culture and otherwise. In this regard, we\nnote with satisfaction the recent developments in Fiji,\nwhich has finally decided to amend its Constitution in\norder to promote social harmony. We hope that the\nGovernment of Fiji will tackle the remaining issues\nstanding in the way of the full enjoyment of fundamental\nrights and basic economic security by all segments of the\npopulation of Fiji.\nMauritius reaffirms its full commitment to total\ndisarmament and urges the world community to make\nevery effort to rid itself of all weapons of mass\ndestruction. It is in this spirit that Mauritius was among\nthe first countries to ratify the Chemical Weapons\nConvention and the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone\nTreaty. We also reaffirm our support for the Ottawa\ninitiative for a universal ban on anti-personnel landmines.\nIt is regrettable that some major countries have decided to\nstay out of this process. We make a strong appeal to all\nGovernments to become part of this unique and historic\nendeavour to eliminate landmines.\n\nAllow me to take this opportunity to reaffirm the\nfact that my country, Mauritius, a former French island,\nbelongs to the great community of French-speaking\ncountries. This sense of belonging culminated with the\nholding in 1993 of the sixth summit of the French-\nspeaking countries, whose central theme was \u201cUnity in\ndiversity\u201d, and which celebrated not only the universal\nvalues of the French-speaking countries but also made it\npossible for us to enshrine those same values in our\nsociety. Our people, who come from Africa, Asia and\nEurope, have deep roots in all the great cultures that form\nthe French-speaking community. My compatriots can, in\nthe course of one day, travel through all these cultures,\none after another.\nIt is for that reason that my country attaches such\ngreat importance to the Francophone plan of promoting\ndiversity in a world that is increasingly unipolar and\nuniform. The upcoming summit in Hanoi will mark a\nvery important stage in the future of this French-speaking\ncommunity, providing it with the effective political means\nto make its voice heard on major international issues.\n\nThis Assembly is by now well aware of the just and\nlegitimate claim of Mauritius to the restoration of its\nterritorial integrity through the return of the Chagos\nArchipelago, including Diego Garcia, to its national\nheritage. This Assembly should also note that this issue also\nhas a tragic human dimension. Before Mauritius acceded to\nits independence, all of the inhabitants of the Chagos were\nforced to leave the land of their birth, where they had lived\nfor several generations. The plight of those inhabitants must\nnow be comprehensively addressed.\nLikewise, we are still awaiting the return of the island\nof Tromelin to Mauritius. As we pursue our efforts to\nrecover these territories, we call upon the former colonial\nPowers to expedite this process through dialogue in the\nspirit of the friendship that characterizes our relationships.\nMy Government looks forward to an early resolution of\nthese disputes.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to offer Foreign\nMinister Udovenko of Ukraine my warmest\ncongratulations on his election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-second session. His skill\nand experience will serve us well in directing the vital\nwork to be undertaken at this session. Ireland, and you,\nAmbassador Campbell as Vice-President of the General\nAssembly, will spare no effort in assisting the President\nin the important tasks of his office.\nI also wish to thank Ambassador Razali Ismail for\nthe energy and commitment he devoted to guiding the\nAssembly at its last session.\nMy colleague Foreign Minister Poos of\nLuxembourg, speaking on behalf of the European\nUnion, set out clearly in his speech to the Assembly the\nagenda for action by the United Nations and its\nMember States in facing the challenges of the world\ntoday. Ireland associates itself fully with his remarks.\nThis session is a crucial one for the United\nNations. Decisions must be taken to make the United\nNations more effective in meeting its real objectives\nand priorities in future years. The Secretary-General has\npresented us with a considered, balanced and substantial\npackage of proposals for United Nations reform. This\npackage marks a turning point in the reform and\nrevitalization process. The Secretary-General has\nrecognized that the future of the United Nations can be\nsecured only by a clearer focus and better coordination\nof effort, expertise and resources on the key\npriorities \u2014 real peace and security, sustainable\ndevelopment, equitable economic and social progress,\nhumanitarian action and, underlying all of these, the\nsafeguarding of universal human rights.\nIreland welcomes in particular the proposals for a\nmore concerted effort in the economic and social\ndevelopment sector. Together with our European Union\npartners, we have been developing our own contribution\nin this area. Our aim is a more effective and coherent\nUnited Nations effort which would finally make real\ninroads, particularly in the least developed countries, in\nthe fight against poverty and underdevelopment. We\nwelcome the intention of the Secretary-General to\nchannel the resources saved in this exercise to\ndevelopment programmes of the Organization.\nI know that some will feel that the proposals do\nnot go far enough in one direction, and others in\nanother. It is not possible to accommodate fully all\nconcerns. But there is enough in these proposals to\nmake the start on reform that we have all been looking\nfor. I therefore earnestly appeal to all Member States to\njoin this broad consensus of support.\nWe should also, at this session, work to achieve a\nsolution to the difficult questions of the financing of the\nUnited Nations and of the enlargement and working\nmethods of the Security Council. Ireland, my country,\nhas declared its candidacy for the Security Council in\nthe year 2000. We shall do everything possible to earn\nsupport for our candidacy.\n24\n\n\nLiving through times of dramatic change is rarely\neasy. Globalization and liberalization of the international\neconomy have brought significant benefits to many\ncountries and are changing the shape of our world. Some\ndeveloping countries have benefited from these processes\nand made significant economic and social strides. Others,\nespecially in sub-Saharan Africa, have become even more\nmarginalized from the world economy, and this is\nunacceptable.\nIreland has been increasing its official-development-\nassistance budget over a number of years. My\nGovernment is committed to making steady progress\ntowards achieving the United Nations target of 0.7 per\ncent in our development-cooperation assistance.\nSpecifically, we are committed to having Irish aid reach\n0.45 per cent of gross national product by 2002.\nSome critics contend that development cooperation\nhas not succeeded. The best response to this is to point to\nwhat it has already achieved. In regard to the most\nfundamental of all human rights, life expectancy around\nthe world has increased by a third in the past three\ndecades; infant mortality has been cut in half. These are\nnot small achievements.\nIn our present globalized and increasingly\ninterdependent world economy, we need to seek a new\npartnership between developed and developing countries\nto address those issues which affect the entire\ninternational community. In this the United Nations has\nan indispensable role to play, and we pledge our full\nsupport to assist the Secretary-General in his task.\nIn June 1998 the General Assembly will meet in\nspecial session to address the drugs issue, both at the\nnational and international levels. I had the honour, as\nMinister of Justice and in the role of President of the\nCouncil of Ministers of the European Union, to address\nthe General Assembly on this question in 1990. The\nAssembly has regularly considered further action to deal\nwith this menace. But the action that has been taken so\nfar has clearly been inadequate. We must redouble our\nefforts. Drugs are an international cancer which threaten\nthe lives of the present and future generations,\nparticularly our young. For all our people, they pose a\nreal threat to the very fabric of society.\nLast week saw the conclusion of negotiations in\nOslo on a global Convention banning landmines, without\nreservation, without exception and for all time. This\nmajor step forward will be particularly welcomed by\nthose countries which have suffered so much as a result\nof the use of these barbaric devices. Those countries\nnot present there and not yet ready to sign in December\nmust take account of the widespread international\nsupport for this agreement. We appeal to them to help\nensure the maximum degree of adherence to the\nConvention. The international community must now\nwork together with ever greater determination to\nprovide for the clearing of mines already placed and for\nthe care and rehabilitation, as well as the social and\neconomic reintegration, of mine victims.\nIn 1961, when the then-Foreign Minister of\nIreland, Mr. Frank Aiken, introduced a resolution at the\nsixteenth session of the General Assembly calling for\nthe conclusion of an international agreement that would\nprevent the spread of nuclear weapons, he launched a\nprocess which the Irish Government firmly believed\nwould eventually lead to total nuclear disarmament.\nThen as now, our conviction was that genuine\ninternational peace and security can never be achieved\nas long as nuclear weapons remain part of the\narmouries of States.\nWe welcome the achievements of recent years,\nwhether bilateral or multilateral: the START Treaties,\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the global\nban outlawing chemical weapons and present efforts to\nstrengthen the ban on biological and toxin weapons.\nThese show that with the necessary will progress is\npossible.\nNow is the time for serious consideration of an\nintegrated approach, encompassing both bilateral and\nmultilateral negotiations, culminating in an international\nagreement on a total ban on nuclear weapons. We must\ninject a real sense of urgency into translating the goal\nof the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons into a\nmore concrete reality. My plea is for reflection on the\npart of all; for compromise and for cooperation, and for\na flexible rather than a dogmatic approach. I believe\nthat we can offer no better vision, courage and\nleadership in the service of peace than to take up this\nchallenge.\nWhile we can look forward one day to a world\nfree of nuclear weapons, no time should be lost in\nagreeing how the peaceful uses of nuclear energy can\nbest be managed. We in Ireland live in close proximity\nto a nuclear-fuel reprocessing plant which poses a\nconsiderable threat to us because of the ever-present\nrisk of a major accident at the plant. In many countries\n25\n\n\ntoday, nuclear energy is viewed with alarm and\napprehension. Public resistance has persuaded some\nGovernments to renounce the nuclear option because the\nbenefits of nuclear energy have failed to convince a\nsceptical and questioning public.\nThe impact of accidents involving nuclear-power\nreactors can cross international frontiers. The legitimate\ninterests of States affected by such accidents demand that\nhigh priority be given to strengthening nuclear safety\nworldwide. Reactor safety and the closure of sub-standard\nreactors represent for my Government fundamental\nnecessities that nuclear-energy States must meet.\nIt is simply unacceptable that poor management of\nradioactive waste and spent fuel should threaten the\nhealth and safety of populations or cause serious long-\nterm damage to the environment of States which have no\nnuclear programmes. The recent Joint Convention dealing\nwith these matters will hopefully bring about\nimprovements. However, much more needs to be done\nthrough international cooperation to allay the deep\nmisgivings of a concerned public.\nTransport of nuclear materials and radioactive waste\nraises the most serious and justifiable fears. We must\ninsist that this, along with all other nuclear activities, be\ncarried out in strict accordance with the highest\ninternational standards of safety and security.\nFurthermore, the entirely legitimate sensitivities of transit\ncountries affected by such movements must be\nrecognized.\nAs we approach next year's celebration of the\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights, we must recognize that we have fallen\nshort in implementing the goals and aspirations of the\nDeclaration. While recognizing that none of us has\ngrounds for complacency in this regard, it is a reality that\nthe human rights situation in certain countries remains of\nparticular concern to the international community. The\nEuropean Union, in its memorandum to the General\nAssembly, has listed the areas of particular concern to us,\nincluding the human rights situation in Myanmar, East\nTimor, Nigeria and Afghanistan, to name but a few.\nWe must all work together \u2014 Governments and\nnon-governmental organizations and civil society\ngenerally \u2014 in dialogue and partnership to ensure that\nthe human rights principles enshrined in the Charter and\nthe Universal Declaration are respected to the full.\nThe current reforms proposed by the Secretary-\nGeneral, in particular his decision to consolidate the\ntwo existing human rights offices into a single office of\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, are to be\nwelcomed. They provide a clear opportunity to\nstrengthen significantly the human rights programme of\nthe United Nations by fully integrating human rights\nissues across the full range of United Nations activities.\nIt is a cause of great pride to the Government and the\npeople of Ireland that the Secretary-General has chosen\nMrs. Mary Robinson, the former President of Ireland,\nas the new High Commissioner.\nI wish to turn now to an area of United Nations\nactivity which is of particular concern and interest to\nmy country \u2014 that of peacekeeping. Ireland has a\nproud record of service in almost every major United\nNations peacekeeping operation. We will continue this\nrole, including our contribution of personnel from the\nIrish police force \u2014 the Garda Sioch\u00e1na \u2014 to the new\nand important role for civilian police in United Nations\npeacekeeping operations.\nOur peacekeepers have at times paid a heavy\nprice: some 75 Irish peacekeepers have died in the\nservice of United Nations peacekeeping.\nOur support for the role of the United Nations in\nits peacekeeping role has not wavered. But it is\ntempered by the sober recognition that, despite many\nsignificant successes in past decades, United Nations\npeacekeeping, particularly in recent times, has not\nalways been effective. We must become better at\naverting conflicts, through more vigorous preventive\ndiplomacy and action in dealing with the roots of\nconflict. When we are forced to intervene, our response\nmust be prompt and better informed through effective\nearly warning systems. Our tasks and objectives must\nbe better defined, both as regards keeping the peace and\nmaking the peace. The full support, political and\nmaterial, of the Member States is essential if they are to\nbe achieved effectively.\nToo often the United Nations has been asked, to\nits cost, to keep the peace indefinitely in conflict areas,\nwithout any corresponding efforts by the parties to the\nconflict to make peace. All Member States of this\nOrganization have a responsibility to ensure continuous\nand honest efforts to make the peace permanent.\nThe changing international situation of the last\ndecade has seen the emergence of new sources of\n26\n\n\nconflict and tension. Old ethnic rivalries and hatreds have\nresurfaced, leading to new local and regional conflicts. In\nBosnia and Herzegovina, the killing has stopped, but\nprogress in building the peace has been painfully slow. In\nthe Middle East, too, moving the peace process forward\nis proving enormously more difficult than could have\nbeen imagined. We call on all parties to live up to their\nresponsibilities and put the process back on track. In\nCyprus, in the Great Lakes region of Africa and in many\nother places, the serious efforts of the international\ncommunity to secure lasting peace are making very slow\nheadway.\nIn the island of Ireland, we face the task of forging\nreconciliation and, leaving behind us the bitterness of\nhistory, ensuring that the root causes of the threat to\npeace are addressed effectively.\nSuccessive Irish Foreign Ministers have addressed\nthis Assembly over the years and informed\nrepresentatives of the efforts being made to resolve the\nconflict in Northern Ireland and bring about a lasting\npeaceful settlement. They have brought news of\nsignificant advances, from the launching of the\nintergovernmental approach by Ireland and Britain in\n1980 and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in\n1985, to the formulation of the Joint Declaration in 1993\nand the publication of the Joint Framework document in\n1995.\nI now bring to the Assembly the joyous news that\nyesterday in Belfast we succeeded in launching\nsubstantial and historic all-party talks in which the future\nof a peaceful and agreed Ireland is to be mapped out.\nWhat is notable about all of these developments \u2014 each\nan important foundation stone in the current peace\nprocess \u2014 is that they were undertaken in partnership\nbetween the Irish and British Governments. Progress has\nbeen driven by our two Governments, united in the quest\nfor peace and a lasting and just settlement. That progress\nhas been defined and directed by the concept of the\n\u201ctotality of relationships\u201d, with which our two islands are\nintertwined and which bears directly on the question of\nNorthern Ireland. Northern Ireland represents the\ninterface between the respective traditions and future\naspirations of both Ireland and Britain. Only in the\ntotality of our relations can we come to terms with our\ndiffering visions of the past and reconcile our hopes for\nthe future.\nThe notion of the \u201ctotality of relationships\u201d has been\nreinforced recently by profound shifts in political and\nsocial attitudes in both Ireland and Britain. The\ncharacter of these shifts has much in common in that\nthey serve to illustrate the commonality that the peoples\nof Ireland and Britain share.\nIreland has been undergoing a dramatic and\ninvigorating process of renewal. This has been most\nevident in our economic performance, but it is evident\ntoo in our social and cultural life. I have a deep sense\nthat it has been encouraged and shaped by our\ninvolvement in the evolution of Europe and the\ndevelopment of our multilateral relations through the\nUnited Nations itself. This renewal has been marked by\ninspiration about what can be done and by what is\nneeded pragmatically to achieve what we set out to do.\nIn Britain, there has been a dramatic development\nwhich redefines and reshapes the nature of its political\nunion. And we too detect that same impulse to\nreinvigorate the institutions of the state, to undertake a\nreappraisal and a renewal as the new millennium\napproaches.\nI believe that this sense of change in both islands,\nthis quickening pace, will be a very important factor as\nboth Governments and all the parties to the negotiations\nin Northern Ireland take the peace process forward. It\nwill, I believe, impart an urgency and focus to the\ndeliberations. More importantly, it means that those\nwho form part of the talks process have the opportunity\nto shape their future rather than surrender through\nindifference or apathy to the inexorability of change.\nFor we live in a time which offers an invitation to\nshape our common future. That invitation is open to all\nthose with the courage and vision to participate in the\ntalks process, which seeks to reshape the relations\nwhich are central to the solution we seek \u2014 relations\nbetween the two communities in Northern Ireland,\nrelations between the North and the South of our island,\nand relations between Ireland and Britain.\nThe efforts of both Governments to construct the\ncomplex structures on which to base a peace process\nwere undertaken with the very clear acknowledgment\nthat ultimately it was there to serve all the parties most\ndirectly involved in the conflict and, through them, the\nwider community. As the leader of the Social\nDemocratic and Labour Party (SDLP), John Hume, so\nclearly recognized, it had to be an inclusive peace\nprocess if it was to be a lasting one.\n27\n\n\nCreating the conditions for this inclusive process\nwas a difficult task in the face of continued violence by\nparamilitaries on both sides \u2014 violence which has been\nongoing for over 25 years; violence which threatened to\nlimit the boundaries of a whole generation to suspicion,\nmutual mistrust and division; violence which still seeks to\nthreaten and disrupt our efforts to build a lasting peace.\nThe task of creating an inclusive peace process\nrequired us to call on our friends in the international\ncommunity. I want to acknowledge those friends,\nparticularly in the European Union, Canada, Australia,\nNew Zealand and, most important, in the United States.\nThe partnership between Ireland and Britain has\nbeen consistently encouraged and assisted by the United\nStates under the leadership of President Clinton and with\nthe backing of friends and supporters in the United States\nCongress. In particular, President Clinton offered his\npersonal support and active engagement in the search for\npeace. The President undertook to share the risks for\npeace which were being taken by both Governments. And\nin doing so, he added significantly to the momentum\nwhich secured the ceasefire in 1994 and re-established it\nin July of this year.\nThe United States has been a resource offered\ngenerously in the name of peace. I want to acknowledge\nthe invaluable role played by Senator George Mitchell in\nchairing the multi-party talks in Belfast. And I also want\nto express my Government's appreciation for the\ncooperation and assistance provided by the Governments\nof Finland and Canada, particularly by making available\nas co-chairmen of the talks former Prime Minister Harri\nHolkeri and General John de Chastelain. They have\nshown unfailing forbearance and unremitting commitment\nto this delicate and complex process.\nWith this help, and with the resolve of both\nGovernments to ensure that an unequivocal ceasefire was\na necessary condition for involvement in the talks\nprocess, another ceasefire was, as I said earlier,\nestablished in July this year. Because the ceasefire has\nbeen re-established, all parties to the problem of Northern\nIreland have now been invited to join the talks process in\nBelfast and to begin the task of shaping our respective\ninterwoven futures.\nWe have, in the course of the Anglo-Irish peace\nprocess, sought to accomplish the purpose for which this\nAssembly was established \u2014 to replace mistrust and\nviolent confrontation with dialogue, negotiation and\nagreement between all the parties to conflict. We do not\nunderestimate the difficulties that lie ahead. As the\nhistory of the United Nations itself has shown, major\nconflicts have, for the most part, been avoided.\nHowever, the resolution of localized conflicts has\nproven elusive and problematic.\nThe principles, purpose and practice of this\nAssembly and the United Nations itself were formed to\nreplace conflict \u2014 of whatever scale \u2014 with peace\nthrough dialogue. In our approach to Northern Ireland,\nwe have been guided by the same impulse to create\nprinciples, purposes and practices which will replace\nthe method and means of sectarian hatred and\nintercommunal violence.\nWe have made it clear that in our talks, all issues\nare on the table, that no outcome is ruled out of bounds\nfor discussion or is predetermined. We have constructed\na process and rules of procedure by which the parties\ncan discuss, refine and eventually agree on the\nstructures which will embrace the totality of relations\non the two islands and which command the consent of\nboth unionists and nationalists in Ireland.\nWe have established as an integral part of the\ndialogue that we recognize the rights and wishes of the\nunionist community in the same way as we insist that\nparity of esteem for Nationalists is a necessary and just\ncomponent of any eventual settlement.\nWe have set out our view that the resolution of the\nissue of the decommissioning of arms is an\nindispensable part of the process of negotiation. We\nhave emphatically declared, in our insistence on\nadherence to the Mitchell principles of democracy and\nnon-violence, that only those committed to democratic\nand exclusively peaceful means of resolving political\nissues and those who renounce force or the threat of\nforce to influence the outcome of the negotiations can\nbe a party to the talks process.\nWe have embraced as a founding principle in the\ncurrent talks process and its eventual outcome that any\nagreement must command sufficient consensus between\nboth sets of participants. We have accepted that the\nagreement reached will be put to the people of Ireland,\nNorth and South, for their approval.\nBoth Governments have set a target to conclude\nthese talks by next May and present proposals to the\npeople of Ireland, North and South, in parallel\n28\n\n\nreferendums. I believe that this target is necessarily\nambitious and realistically achievable.\nWe may well have setbacks in the interim. We\ncertainly have difficult issues to confront and\ncompromises to make which will require courage and\nvision.\nBut both Governments \u2014 and I believe the parties\ncurrently in the talks process \u2014 are collectively\ndetermined that this process will be pursued, that there\nwill be no going back, and that the future we seek of\nharmonious relations and an honourable and\ncomprehensive agreement will be secured and that lasting\npeace will be brought to our island.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nVietnamese delegation, I wish to warmly congratulate you,\nSir, on your election to the presidency of the fifty-second\nsession of the General Assembly. I am confident that under\nyour wise guidance this session will be crowned with many\nfine results.\nI should like also to express the appreciation of the\nVietnamese delegation for the active work done by\nMr. Razali Ismail, President of the fifty-first session of the\nGeneral Assembly, a session that marked new strides on the\nUnited Nations journey to fulfil its mandate in contributing\nto peace and development in the world as a whole.\nMay I take this opportunity to warmly congratulate\nMr. Kofi Annan, who, within a very short span of time\nsince assuming the very important post of Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations, has managed to accomplish\na large amount of work, including efforts related to reform\nof the United Nations in the light of the profound changes\nin the world, in response to the aspirations of peoples with\nregard to our global Organization.\nMankind is rushing towards the end of the twentieth\ncentury and preparing to enter the third millennium with\nan earnest desire for a more tranquil and better life. That\ndesire becomes even more earnest when we look back at\nthe last century, a century that has been darkened by the\nblack clouds of two world wars and countless conflicts,\nlarge and small. That desire becomes even more urgent\ngiven that the boundless mind of man has produced\nnumerous miraculous inventions, opening up a new era\ncalled the \u201cpost-industrial era\u201d or \u201cthe information age\u201d,\nwhile more than a quarter of the developing world\u2019s\npopulation still lives in poverty, some 840 million go\nhungry or face food insecurity, and even in industrial\ncountries more than 100 million people live below the\npoverty line and 37 million are jobless.\nUnder these circumstances, it is understandable that\nall nations see the need to consolidate peace and promote\ndevelopment as their primary priority so as to turn the\ntwenty-first century into a century with fewer conflicts\nand less poverty.\nPeace and development are companions; they go\ntogether like the two sides of a coin. Sustainable\ndevelopment is only possible if it is built upon the solid\npremise of a durable peace: peace for all nations, peace\nfor every region and peace for the entire planet. Here, we\nfully subscribe to the views expressed in the Agenda for\nDevelopment: development is a prerequisite for peace,\nand at the same time peace is a precondition for\ndevelopment.\n\n\nWe may take satisfaction from the fact that, during the\npast year, a series of events have shown that the trend\ntowards peace is continuing. Political solutions have been\nfound for a number of decades-old conflicts. Relations\nbetween various nations, including the big Powers, have\nseen some partial improvements. Following in the footsteps\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), the\nChemical Weapons Convention (CWC) entered into force.\nThe South-East Asia nuclear-weapon-free zone\n(SEANWFZ) has come into existence.\nIn spite of all this, the world\u2019s people still cannot be\nassured of a lasting peace if that peace is not constructed\non an equitable premise. It is truly unfair that a few\ncountries are entitled to maintain an absolute superiority,\nwhich even enables them to use their power to impose their\nwill on other countries, while many countries have to live\nin the fear of insecurity. In this context, we hold that there\nis still a need to free our planet from the burden of nuclear\nweapons, to ban, totally and resolutely, the production,\nstorage, threat and use of this most horrible and lethal type\nof weapon. In the same context, we expect the nuclear-\nweapon States to sign the protocol annexed to the\nSEANWFZ soon, in order to strengthen the power of the\nTreaty, thereby making a viable contribution to peace and\nstability in South-East Asia.\nOur world cannot have peace when conflicts are still\nraging in various parts of our planet. Today, the Middle\nEast is again raising the deep concern of everyone. We\nshare the position that tremendous efforts are needed to\nlead us to a durable and lasting peace for that region, which\nhas suffered too much and too long. Such a peace can be\nachieved only on the basis of ensuring the safety of the\nnations living in this region, respecting the fundamental\nrights of the Palestinian people, including the right to\nestablish an independent Palestinian State, and, most\nimmediately, the strict implementation of the United\nNations resolutions and the principles of the Madrid\nConference, as well as the accords that have been\nconcluded.\nIn Asia and the Pacific in general and in South-East\nAsia in particular, where, fortunately, stability is on the\nrise, incremental efforts are being made to render this trend\nmore durable. As a country bordering Cambodia, we give\ngreat attention to the situation in that neighbouring nation.\nOur position on the Cambodian question is clear to all: in\nconformity with our general foreign policy, we persevere in\nupholding the principle of full respect for the independence\nand sovereignty of nations and the principle that the affairs\nof a country must be decided by the people of that country\nitself, free from foreign interference. At the same time,\nfrom the bottom of our heart, we wish the Cambodian\npeople peace and stability so that they can reconstruct a\nprosperous country in their homeland. We sincerely wish\nto tirelessly foster relations of friendship and cooperation\nwith the Kingdom of Cambodia.\nBordering the South China Sea, which we call the\nEastern Sea, Viet Nam has always considered that\ndisputes there should be settled by negotiation on the\nbasis of international law, particularly the 1982 United\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, with a view\nto achieving a sustainable and lasting solution. For the\ntime being, it is necessary to preserve the status quo,\nexert self-restraint and abstain from acts that may further\ncompound the situation and prejudice the stability of the\nregion and the safety of international maritime navigation.\nAt the same time, we should seek cooperation measures\nacceptable to the parties concerned. We share the\nsatisfaction at the recent positive developments related to\nthe situation in the Korean peninsula, and it is our wish\nthat these developments will lead to a durable peace in\nthis very sensitive part of our world.\nAlthough peace is the most important condition for\ndevelopment, peace alone, without cooperation among\nStates on the basis of equality and mutual respect and\nbenefits, is not adequate. Today, in a world of ever-\ndeepening interdependence, and under the impact of\nglobalization and regionalization trends, the need for\ndevelopment cooperation is increasingly strong.\nIt is obvious that nations are facing unprecedented\nopportunities for expanding markets, engaging more\npartners and intensifying investment and technology\ntransfers in order to attain higher growth. Besides this,\nthere is a rather stark reality, especially for developing\ncountries: the process of liberalization has made\ncompetition extremely acute, and in that competition the\nadvantages do not go to countries which, due to certain\ncircumstances, are still at a low level of economic\ndevelopment. It is therefore no surprise that the gap\nbetween the rich and poor countries is widening, causing\ngreat losses to developing nations.\nThat situation gives the international community two\nchoices: either to let things go on, which will cause a\nmore serious crisis, affecting the global economic and\npolitical situation; or to cooperate for shared development.\nIn our humble opinion, the first scenario is not beneficial\nto anybody, while the latter brings about benefit for everybody.\n2\n\n\nWith that perception, we are of the view that it is\nnecessary to reverse the trend of decreasing official\ndevelopment assistance, both bilaterally and multilaterally.\nWith that perception, we look forward to stronger\ntechnology transfers, because outstanding and rapid\nscientific and technological progress is presenting a danger\nof developing countries being left further behind.\nWith that perception, we would like to emphasize the\nneed to set up reasonable trade terms, taking into account\nthe difficulties faced by developing countries, and to ensure\nthat the developed countries broaden market access for\ncommodities from the developing countries.\nWith that perception, we believe that it is high time to\ncompletely do away with the obsolete ways of thinking and\nacting of the past, namely, the imposition of inequitable\nterms of economic and trade relations, sanctions and\nembargoes, and so forth, which distort international\nrelations, cause suffering to the people and seriously violate\nthe minimum right of human beings \u2014 the right to a\npeaceful life.\nUnder the general circumstances of our world today,\nthe need to reform the United Nations has become more\nand more imperative. We share many of the ideas that the\nSecretary-General has put forth. In our opinion, besides its\ncontribution to the maintenance of peace, the promotion of\nequitable international cooperation \u2014 a top priority on the\nagenda of the United Nations \u2014 must mean more vigorous\nassistance to development. We offer our strong support for\nthe ideas stated in the Secretary-General\u2019s report,\n\u201cRenewing the United Nations: a programme for reform\u201d\n(A/51/950), which particularly underlined that the\npromotion of economic development and development\ncooperation was the primary mandate and function of the\nUnited Nations. It is our hope that countries, especially the\ndeveloped ones, will enhance their contribution to the\ndevelopment programmes of the United Nations.\nOn this occasion, I wish to express our high\nappreciation to the institutions of the United Nations system\nfor the assistance extended to Viet Nam, especially for our\neconomic renovation to implement social programmes of\npoverty alleviation, health care and education development,\nand international integration. The commitment to further\nenhance the efficiency of the partnership between Viet Nam\nand the United Nations development system was made by\nthe two partners at the conference to review 20 years of\nViet Nam-United Nations cooperation, which took place\nrecently in Hanoi.\nWith regard to the United Nations structure, our\nconsistent view is that it should reflect the fundamental\nchanges that have been taking place during the last half-\ncentury or more, the most notable highlight of which is\nthat over 100 independent States have joined the United\nNations. Its organizational structure and working\nprocedures could be more democratized. The stature of\ndeveloping countries needs to be strongly enhanced,\nincluding in the Security Council, and at the same time,\nthe role of the General Assembly should be further\nstrengthened. Along those lines, we share the view that it\nis necessary to increase the membership of the Security\nCouncil, both permanent and non-permanent categories,\nwith a satisfactory number of seats given to developing\ncountries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and to\nensure that every Member assumes similar responsibilities\nand rights. We believe that in order to work out a\ncomprehensive programme for United Nations reform a\nCommittee of the Whole should be established.\nThe National Assembly of Viet Nam has just held\nthe first session of its tenth term in Hanoi to elect the\nhighest dignitaries of our State and approve the list of\nnew government members, thus realizing important\ncontinuity of generations of leadership. This National\nAssembly is of special significance, as it will lead our\ncountry into the twenty-first century on the road of all-\nround renovation to attain the goal of \u201cWealthy people,\nstrong country, just and civilized society\u201d, through the\nprocess of national industrialization and modernization, in\norder to turn Viet Nam into a basically industrialized\nState by the year 2020.\nIn its foreign relations, Viet Nam will constantly\npursue an open foreign policy of independence,\ndiversification and the promotion of multilateral relations\nalong the line of gradual regional and international\nintegration, thus making worthy contributions to the cause\nof peace, national independence, democracy and social\nprogress. In line with this policy, Viet Nam will continue\nto stand as an active Member of the United Nations and\nthe Non-Aligned Movement. In line with this policy, Viet\nNam is making constructive contributions to the\nintensification of cooperation within the Association of\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and is actively\npreparing the sixth ASEAN Summit to be held in Hanoi\nat the end of next year. In line with this policy, Viet Nam\nis competing with time to ensure the successful\norganization of the forthcoming seventh summit of\nFrench-speaking community in Hanoi. In line with this\npolicy, Viet Nam is sparing no effort in making practical\npreparations to participate in the Asia-Pacific Economic\n3\n\n\nCooperation Council and the World Trade Organization.\nAlso in line with this policy, Viet Nam wishes to become\na member of the United Nations Economic and Social\nCouncil at the elections to be held at this session of the\nGeneral Assembly. We are confident that this reasonable\nwish of ours will meet with the generous support of\nMember countries.\nAs we strive for the noble aspirations of peace and\ndevelopment on the eve of the new century, countries in the\ninternational community will continue to find in Viet Nam\na sincere friend and constructive companion. On our part,\nwe expect that United Nations activities will be ever more\neffective in enabling all countries to work for shared\ndevelopment in peace and partnership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the delegation of Burundi, which we\nhave the distinguished honour to lead in the work of this\nsession of the General Assembly, and on our own behalf,\nallow us first and foremost to extend the friendly\ngreetings of the President of the Republic of Burundi,\nMr. Pierre Buyoya, as well as those of the Government\nand all the people of Burundi.\nThe delegation of Burundi is delighted at the\nunanimous choice of the President of the fifty-second\nsession of the General Assembly. His lofty, moral and\nintellectual qualities, his long and rich diplomatic\nexperience and his in-depth knowledge of the current\nconcerns of the planet no doubt augur well for a ringing\nsuccess in his term of office. Our country offers him its\nfull support.\nAt the same time, we would like to extend our\nsincere congratulations to his predecessor, Ambassador\nRazali Ismail of Malaysia, who so brilliantly conducted\nthe work of the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly.\nWe would also like to pay enthusiastic tribute to\nMr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nfor his continuing tireless efforts to promote the ideals of\nthis world Organization.\nThanks to the institutions and bodies of the United\nNations system, millions of refugees and persons\ndisplaced or scattered in the wake of internal conflicts,\nnational disasters and other emergency situations have\nbenefited from substantial humanitarian assistance,\nparticularly in Africa. The Great Lakes region has\nreceived special attention in this regard.\nAside from peacekeeping and humanitarian relief\noperations on the African continent, it is important to\nunderscore and welcome the United Nations System-wide\nSpecial Initiative on Africa. I would like to take this\nopportunity to launch an appeal to all our bilateral and\nmultilateral partners to mobilize the necessary resources\nfor the financing of this Initiative, whose fundamental\nimportance for the development of Africa is obvious.\nFor four years Burundi has been going through an\nunprecedented crisis that has been marked by numerous\ncrimes and acts of genocide. Aside from the blind\nextermination of hundreds of thousands of human lives,\narmed groups have attacked the economic, health,\neducational and administrative infrastructures of the\ncountry. In short, the political change that occurred on 25\n26\n\n\nJuly 1996 took place just in time to save the country from\ngenocide and nightmare.\nContrary to what a certain sector of international\npublic opinion would have us believe, the vast majority of\nthe population of Burundi welcomed the new direction of\nthe country with great enthusiasm and relief. New hope was\nborn with this change of political regime.\nThe results in the area of security were immediate.\nAside from certain areas of insecurity related to sporadic\nattacks by armed groups, peace and security have returned\nto almost the entire national territory. But the population\nremains vigilant because terrorist bands have not yet\ndisarmed. Essentially, they use the territory of Tanzania to\nlaunch massacres against women, children, men and the\nelderly.\nThese repeated attacks are at the source of the\ndisplacement and regrouping of populations. The\nGovernment has never decreed any regroupment policy.\nWhile the camps of displaced persons have not attracted\nparticular attention, the so-called regroupment camps have\nstirred controversy in certain circles of international opinion\nthat have been exploited and misinformed by terrorist\ngroups such as the National Council for the Defence of\nDemocracy (CNDD).\nToday these centres of the dispossessed are gradually\nbeing closed. Day by day, people who have been displaced\nor regrouped are returning to their villages of origin when\nsecurity conditions permit. A recent report indicates that in\nless than a month there will practically be no regrouped\npersons in the country\u2019s central provinces, which were the\nmost affected.\nWe must, however, recognize that problems persist. At\nthe humanitarian level the afflicted people live in deplorable\nconditions. Overcrowding, lack of sanitation, malnutrition,\nlack of health care and all sorts of epidemics are the daily\nplight of the dispossessed.\nMy Government wishes to place on record its real\nappreciation for all the support of our bilateral and\nmultilateral partners to relieve the misery of these deprived\npopulations. We appeal again to the international\ncommunity to increase humanitarian assistance to the\nafflicted populations in order to meet their food, health and\nclothing needs. In order to ensure the reintegration of the\nvictims, the Government appeals for assistance for\nreconstruction and economic recovery.\nIn the context of its vast social reintegration effort,\nthe Government of Burundi invites all Burundi refugees,\nwherever they may be, to return voluntarily to their\ncountry. It is prepared to welcome them with open arms\nand in conditions of complete security and dignity. I\nwould like to take this opportunity to request the\nassistance of neighbouring countries, in particular\nTanzania, as well as of international organizations such as\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees, to facilitate the return of our exiled brothers. In\nthe past year more than 160,000 Burundi refugees have\nvoluntarily returned to their home provinces.\nSince the political changes of 25 July 1996, the\nprincipal objectives of the Government of the Republic of\nBurundi have been to ward off the spectre of genocide, to\nrestore State authority, to organize a peace process based\non dialogue, to reintegrate afflicted people, to rebuild and\nrevitalize the economy and to democratize institutions.\nAt present the great majority of the Burundi\npopulation is determined to work to restore peace. This is\nwhy the widespread genocide that was foreseen, and\nbegan, has been contained and stopped. I can today affirm\nin all certainty that this danger has been averted. To the\ndismay of certain prophets of doom and apocalypse, the\nBurundi nation has not fallen apart either. The peace\nprocess under way in Burundi is aimed precisely at laying\nthe foundation for a lasting peace.\nSince the beginning of this year the Government has\ninitiated throughout the country a series of workshops in\npreparation for a genuine national debate, with the goal of\nleading the Burundi people to discuss frankly all the\ncountry\u2019s problems. The governmental team is now\nengaged in speeding up the peace process, and several\ninitiative have been taken in this regard. A round table\nbringing together all the internal actors has just taken\nplace in the centre of the country. It is in this context as\nwell that the Burundi peace conference, originally planned\nto take place in Geneva under the auspices of the United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n(UNESCO) from 30 June to 2 July 1997 was held at\nUNESCO headquarters from 26 to 28 September 1997.\nSome 50 Burundi political actors, along with about 30\ninternational observers, took part in those meetings.\nThat conference was designed to involve all the\nBurundi people, at home and abroad, in political dialogue,\ntaking into account different political and socio-\nprofessional leanings. Even those who chose the route of\nviolence participated in that forum in great numbers. That\n27\n\n\nevent thus marks an important step in the Burundi peace\nprocess.\nDespite the visible difficulties, the Government of\nBurundi is determined to negotiate with the various actors\nin Burundi \u2014 including the armed factions \u2014 without\nexception. Thus, the phase of the peace negotiations that\ncould not be held in Arusha on 25 August 1997 as\noriginally planned \u2014 as a result of difficulties connected to\nthe mediation arrangements \u2014 are going to be resumed\nvery shortly. Consultations are under way on this matter,\nand, true to its programme, the Government will participate.\nIn this context, I would like to recall that my\nGovernment asked for a postponement of the 25 August\n1997 meeting only so that it could better consult with its\npartners, improve the mediation arrangements and find a\nlocation more amenable to dialogue, outside of Tanzania.\nAfter that postponement the President of the United\nRepublic of Tanzania called for a summit of the Heads of\nState of the region in Dar es Salaam, which was held on 3\nand 4 September 1997.\nThe Government of the Republic of Burundi, which\nwas not invited, expresses its regret that it had no role in\nthat summit. It considers that at these meetings devoted\nentirely to the Burundi conflict its presence is indispensable\nso that it can provide information and explanations that will\nenlighten the Heads of State of the region, in the interest of\npeace in Burundi.\nThe Burundi peace process must involve dialogue and\nnegotiation among the Burundi people. At the conclusion of\nthe talks, a negotiated transitional government will be put\nin place to lead the country in the direction pointed by the\nBurundi people themselves. The ultimate objective is to put\nin place democratic institutions that all can trust.\nThe Government of the Republic of Burundi again\nexpresses its concern regarding the mediation arrangements\nand the host country for the mediation. No process can lead\nto peace in Burundi if it is not developed in cooperation\nwith the Burundi people and carried out with their complete\nagreement. It is thus imperative that there be greater\nconsultations between the mediator and the Burundi people\n\u2014 in particular with the Government that is charged with\nleading the country and that has the weighty responsibility\nof extracting it from crisis.\nTo increase the confidence of all the parties in the\nmediation and to follow the universally recognized rules for\nsuch undertakings, the Government of the Republic of\nBurundi believes that the mediator must be supported by\nother personalities and by experts in the techniques of\nconflict resolution \u2014 people who have no personal stake\nin the Burundi problem.\nThe Burundi peace process will remain stalled, if\nTanzania \u2014 the mediating country, the host country of\nthe mediation \u2014 having taken over the Burundi Embassy\nin Dar es Salaam, continues to play the triple role of host\ncountry for the armed factions responsible for the\ngenocide in Burundi, promoter of sanctions against\nBurundi and overweening mediator.\nThe objection of the Government of the Republic of\nBurundi to the holding of the talks in Tanzania is thus\neasily understood. It is based essentially on the tension\nthat has been created by the refugee camps that Tanzania\nhas set up all along its border with Burundi. Many of\nthem are armed, and from them deadly raids are regularly\nlaunched on Burundi territory. This tension has been\nexacerbated by the hostile campaign waged by the\nTanzanian authorities in several African capitals precisely\non the eve of the opening of the talks, originally set to\ntake place in Arusha on 25 August 1997.\nFurther, the Government of the Republic of Burundi\ndoes not understand why the fifth summit of the Heads of\nthe State of the region requested it to halt the process\nnow under way. Such a halt would unleash disorder and\npublic insecurity in the country. No Burundi citizen would\nbe able to understand how the judicial system could\npunish minor infractions while at the same time it was\nunable to try cases of political assassination and acts of\ngenocide. The halting of legal proceedings under way and\nscheduled is thus unacceptable. The ideal is to assure\neach defendant a just and fair trial in which the right to\na defence is guaranteed. The Government has already\nmade a commitment to do all it can to that end, and we\nthank the United Nations for its assistance in this area.\nIn this regard, the establishment of an international\ncriminal tribunal for Burundi, which the Government of\nBurundi has requested of the United Nations, is now\nurgently needed, both to combat impunity and to give the\npeace process now under way a chance. Under no pretext\nwhatsoever should any criminal, nor anyone responsible\nfor genocide, be shielded.\nIt is clear that the Burundi peace process is being\nheld back by numerous constraints.\n28\n\n\nMy Government\u2019s efforts to restore peace and security\nhave been compromised by the completely unjust and\nillegal blockade that has been maintained by neighbouring\ncountries since 31 July 1997. Paradoxically, the supporters\nof these inhumane economic sanctions claim that they wish\nto restore peace in Burundi. However, those who know my\ncountry know that it is poor and landlocked and has been\nbeset by almost four years of war.\nTo support sanctions by word and by deed is\ntantamount to killing more children and more disaster\nvictims through hunger, disease, poverty and war. No\nneighbouring country should adopt such a stance, especially\nwhen we take account of the concern that my country has\nalways shown for its neighbours when they were confronted\nwith the same problems.\nThe measures to mitigate the economic sanctions\nagreed in Arusha last 16 April have not been implemented\nin their entirety. Difficulties remain, particularly in respect\nof air transport and the supply of humanitarian fuel. How\nthen, under these circumstances, can we speak of mitigation\nwhen the released goods cannot reach their beneficiaries?\nFrom this rostrum, my delegation calls once again on\nthe neighbouring countries in the subregion responsible for\nthe blockade to please lift these inhumane and degrading\nsanctions immediately. It strongly urges the international\ncommunity to do everything in its power to make these\ncountries understand the pressing need to lift these unjust\nsanctions, which only impoverish the poorest and enrich the\nrichest \u2014 measures that ravage the most vulnerable sectors\nof society.\nI should like to remind the Assembly that my\nGovernment has already met all the demands made by the\ncountries of the subregion, which served as a pretext for the\nimposition of the sanctions. These include the restoration of\nthe National Assembly and of the political parties and the\ncommencement of negotiations with the rebel army.\nUnfortunately, at the risk of hampering the process, each\nsummit gives rise to new conditions. That is why the quest\nfor peace in Burundi often resembles the movement of\nSisyphus\u2019 stone.\nMy country, moreover, continues to be confronted\nwith repeated border attacks by armed terrorist groups that\nare based in a neighbouring country, Tanzania. These\ncriminal bands recruit in camps housing Burundi refugees\nalong the common border, in flagrant violation of the\nGeneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.\nSome of the rebels are based 15 kilometres from the\nBurundi-Tanzania border. From there, it takes but a step\nto infiltrate Burundi. In that one little step, they can\nmassacre \u2014 as they did last April \u2014 several innocent\nBurundi people.\nIn the face of this situation, my Government urges\nthe United Nations firmly to condemn these terrorist\norganizations and to bring pressure to bear on those\ncountries receiving them to separate genuine refugees\nfrom tribal terrorist groups.\nIn order to promote the necessary communication in\nthe context of a political dialogue, we ask Tanzania once\nagain to liberate the Embassy of Burundi in Dar Es\nSalaam in order to facilitate diplomatic relations current\nnegotiations and the settlement of the question of\nrefugees.\nThe Great Lakes region is experiencing an\nunprecedented crisis. One of the main reasons for this\nupheaval is doubtless the problem of refugees. The spiral\nof violence that is engulfing our subregion has prompted\na vast trans-border movement of peoples fleeing warfare\nand insecurity in their country or origin. Some are\ninnocent people who fear for their physical security, but\nsome belong to criminal groups. Faithful to its policy of\ndialogue and concertation, the Government of the\nRepublic of Burundi will spare no effort to initiate\ncontacts with its neighbours in order to explore together\nappropriate ways and means to resolve this situation. The\ngoal of this endeavour is to work together to restore a\nclimate of security on our common borders, in keeping\nwith our tradition of good-neighbourliness.\nAfrica is currently facing numerous challenges. A\nlow rate of economic growth; intense demographic\npressures; a decline in agricultural production; the\ncontinuing decrease in bilateral and multilateral aid \u2014 the\nresult of new alliances; the burden of debt servicing; and\nsocio-political conflicts \u2014 these are the many pitfalls\nalong the path to Africa\u2019s development. Our continent\nwill never achieve its development if it does not meet\nthese challenges, which is why my country resolutely\nfavours consolidating regional and subregional entities,\nwhich would represent a crucial stage for progress in\nAfrica. In this connection, we welcome the System-wide\nSpecial Initiative on Africa, launched officially on 15\nMarch 1996. We firmly support and encourage this\nambitious programme, which was set up to support our\ncontinent in its development efforts.\n29\n\n\nOur continent, Africa, is doubtless one of the most\nturbulent areas on the planet. The efforts to democratize\npolitical institutions on which so many hopes were pinned\nhave, regrettably, experienced dramatic setbacks as a result\nof factors linked with ethnicity, a lack of preparedness and\na lack of flexibility.\nWith respect to the Great Lakes region, Burundi\nwelcomes the positive changes occurring in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, as they can contribute to improving\nthe political situation and promote trade throughout the\nregion. We can therefore only encourage this friendly and\nbrotherly country to move ahead. We also urge the\ninternational community to support it.\nRwanda, our neighbour, is making a great effort at\nstabilization and reconciliation. International solidarity vis-\n\u00e0-vis this country should also be encouraged.\nAt the same time, it is deplorable to note that Congo\n(Brazzaville), a brotherly country, has also been the site of\nfratricidal confrontation. In that context, we welcome the\nefforts made by the President of Gabon, His Excellency\nMr. Omar Bongo; by the Special Representative of the\nSecretaries-General of the United Nations and the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), Mr. Mohamed\nSahnoun; and by other mediators, national and international,\nin their efforts to find a negotiated settlement to the Congo\nproblem.\nMy Government encourages our Angolan brothers and\nsisters to complete the implementation of the Lusaka peace\nagreements.\nFollowing a protracted conflict, Liberia has\nsuccessfully organized democratic elections with the support\nof the international community. We wish that country peace\nand stability.\nIn the Middle East, the deadlock of the peace process\nbetween Israel and Palestine can be overcome only if hard-\nliners on both sides show greater flexibility.\nMy Government has taken note of the report of the\nSecretary-General on the reform of the Organization.\nInsofar as it seeks greater efficiency and strives for\nmobilizing means not to maintain a hefty administration but\nrather to achieve the goal of international solidarity,\nparticularly in the area of development, my Government\nsupports that reform.\nMy delegation shares with the Secretary-General his\nconcern for efficiency and economy: efficiency in an\nadministration that is streamlined, and efficiency in efforts\nto combat poverty as well as in efforts at capacity-\nbuilding, particularly in the area of development.\nWith respect to Security Council reform, my\nGovernment supports the provisions taken in the context\nof the last OAU Summit, which met in Harare,\nZimbabwe. The terms of the common African position\nhave recently been communicated by the Chairman of the\nOAU in this forum. Moreover, the developing countries\nmust be properly represented in the Council. Beyond the\nquestion of representation, my delegation is convinced\nthat reform of the Security Council must above all\ninvolve its methods of work and its adaptation to the\nrequirements of today\u2019s realities.\nIn keeping with our position as stated during this\nsession of the General Assembly, my Government firmly\nsupports the establishment of an international criminal\ncourt that would be entrusted with prosecuting and\npunishing persons responsible for genocide, crimes\nagainst humanity and war crimes.\nDespite the many difficulties that my country,\nBurundi, has faced since the national tragedy of October\n1993, it has always sought to be present at the annual\nsessions of the General Assembly of our Organization.\nThis assiduous presence attests to our unfaltering\nattachment to the lofty ideals promoted and defended by\nthe United Nations. Despite the political and economic\ncrisis exacerbated by the blockade abusively imposed\nupon my people, the Government of the Republic of\nBurundi has been able to remit an amount of $116,000\ndollars since April 1997 as its contribution to the regular\nbudget of the United Nations. Despite the difficult\neconomic climate, Burundi will do its utmost to continue,\nto the extent that it is able, to honour its commitments\nand to support our Organization.\nBefore concluding, I should like once again to recall\nthat Burundi is resolved to emerge from this crisis\naffecting our country, and will do so through dialogue.\nThe sooner the next session is programmed, the better.\nWe hope that the obstacles that prevented the meeting of\n25 August 1997 will be overcome.\nMy country supports the principle of expanding the\nSecurity Council, but the methodology which will be\nadopted to that end is of decisive importance. We hope\nthat all this reform will imbue the United Nations system\n30\n\n\nwith the youthful vitality and energy necessary to redress\nthe shortcomings of the past, to consolidate the\nachievements of the present and to lay solid and promising\nfoundations for the beginning of the next millennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI begin by\ncongratulating Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-second\nsession. I am confident that the skills and vast experience\nhe has acquired throughout his distinguished diplomatic\ncareer will provide the guidance we need to guarantee the\nsuccessful outcome of the session.\nI must also recall the remarkable diligence of his\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Razali Ismail, and his\nvaluable contribution to the work of the fifty-first regular\nsession and the nineteenth special session of the General\nAssembly.\nAs the twentieth century comes to an end, it is\nevident that all countries in the world, advanced,\ndeveloping and transitional, will be substantially affected\nby globalization. Further specialization, the widening of\nmarkets through trade, a broader division of labour and a\nmore efficient and more diversified allocation of financial\nresources should increase overall productivity and raise\n16\n\n\nliving standards. However, no country will benefit from this\ntrend spontaneously or automatically. The major tasks that\nGovernments face today are development and the pursuit of\nsound policies and appropriate structural adjustments to\nmeet the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities\nof globalization.\nEconomic reforms, which Armenia began immediately\nafter its declaration of independence, have changed all key\nsectors of the economy, particularly agriculture, enterprises,\nprices and wages, the banking industry and the fiscal,\nforeign trade and exchange systems. Concurrently, the\ncountry began the institution of secure property rights and\na judiciary strong enough to protect them.\nAfter a devastating fall in real output from 1991\nthrough 1994, macroeconomic and structural reforms,\ncombined with privatization, have stabilized the country's\neconomy while bringing down inflation, and allowed\nArmenia to achieve significant growth in 1996. Armenia's\ngross domestic product, which dropped 25.3 per cent on\naverage from 1991 to 1993, has turned around and has\naveraged 6.3 per cent annual growth since then. This is\ndespite a disastrous earthquake in 1988, the conflict\nbetween Nagorny Karabakh and Azerbaijan, which caused\nthe inflow of more than 300,000 refugees, and continuing\nproblems in obtaining stable energy and industrial supplies\nbecause of a blockade imposed by neighbouring Azerbaijan.\nThe drastic changes were coincident with the adoption\nof a medium-term macroeconomic reform programme\nsupported by the World Bank and the International\nMonetary Fund. The major objectives for the 1997 period\nare: to maintain a real annual growth rate in gross domestic\nproduct of about 6 per cent; to continue curbing the\ninflation rate for the whole year and keeping it under 10\nper cent; and to augment the level of gross foreign\nexchange reserves to the equivalent of 2.8 months of\nimports.\nAlso, the Government of Armenia will go on to take\nseveral measures during the programme period aimed at\ncontinuing to refine the targeting of social safety-net\nbenefits to alleviate a sharp decrease in average\nconsumption levels and improve income distribution.\nFor Armenia and countries with economies in\ntransition as a whole, the move towards world market\nprices brought severely deteriorated terms of trade. The\nintroduction of currency convertibility and a notable\nincrease in external borrowing began to cause frequent\nunsustainable external debt positions. The resources which\nare urgently required to modernize the industrial structure\nto internationally competitive levels and to improve the\ngeneral infrastructure immensely exceed domestic saving\ncapacities. This situation underlines the necessity of\naddressing more thoroughly the needs of countries in\ntransition by the international donor community, though\nthis should not cause a decrease in official development\nassistance flows to the developing world.\nIn this context, Armenia welcomes the adoption of\nthe Agenda for Development by the General Assembly\nearlier this year as one of the major documents which\nshould be among the guidelines for actions of the United\nNations system and affiliated institutions to strengthen\ninternational cooperation for development. We also\nsupport the appraisal of conditions in Africa, least\ndeveloped countries, small island developing States and\nlandlocked developing countries as \u201cCritical situations and\nspecial problems\u201d within the Agenda for Development,\nand we hope that the post-cold-war international\ncommunity will pay more attention to these issues of\nprime concern.\nThe interaction between the United Nations and\nother multilateral development institutions, including the\nBretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\nOrganization, should be intensified, involving the field\nlevel in particular. Joint efforts could be concentrated\nespecially on those areas where private investors need\nencouragement, and where without such general\ninstitutional support they would hesitate to commit long-\nterm capital. Proper intergovernmental follow-up and\nimplementation of the corresponding General Assembly\nand Economic and Social Council resolutions and\ndecisions are capable of facilitating this process.\nSustainable development and related environmental\nissues are other areas of strategic importance where the\nUnited Nations must further strengthen its credibility. We\nacknowledge the outcome of the nineteenth special\nsession of the General Assembly for the purpose of an\noverall review and appraisal of the implementation of\nAgenda 21 as an important step to enhance the\nimplementation of the major international global and\nregional environmental agreements.\nEconomic and democratic reforms are\ncomplementary and heavily interdependent. Political and\neconomic freedom means more predictable, more\ntransparent, more constitutional, less discriminatory and\nless corruption-prone law-making and enforcement.\n17\n\n\nWe recognize democracy and respect for human rights,\nuniversal access to knowledge and information and a high\nlevel of public awareness as preconditions for sustainable\nsocial development. We welcome the Secretary-General's\nefforts to strengthen the role of human rights within the\nUnited Nations system.\nArmenia considers self-determination to be an\ninalienable human right. In this respect, the Nagorny\nKarabakh conflict continues to occupy the Government of\nArmenia. Despite concentrated negotiations of the past\nseveral years, the maintenance of a ceasefire for more than\nthree years, and the intensified efforts of the international\ncommunity, the Nagorny Karabakh peace process continues\nto suffer from a lack of serious progress. The Organization\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Lisbon\nSummit of December 1996, which was expected to reflect\non the peace process, to consolidate the ceasefire and to\nprovide impetus for a possible breakthrough this year, failed\nto serve its intended purpose. Instead, by attempting to\npredetermine the final status of Nagorny Karabakh, it\nunnecessarily stiffened Azerbaijan's position and minimized\nthe possibility of a mutually acceptable compromise\nsolution. We believe that the final status of Nagorny\nKarabakh should be negotiated between the parties directly\ninvolved and not dictated by outside interested parties.\nArmenia appreciates the most recent efforts of the\nMinsk Group Co-Chairmen to reach a compromise solution,\nwhich were also manifested in the Denver statement of the\nPresidents of the three co-chairing countries. Armenia has\nprovided a detailed response to the proposal of the Minsk\nGroup Co-Chairmen, insisting on securing commonly\nrecognized freedoms for the Nagorny Karabakh population,\nas well as guaranteeing their security so that their physical\nexistence and control over their territory and destiny are\nnever threatened.\nArmenia believes that a resolution acceptable to all\nparties involved is key to establishing durable peace and\nstability in the region and to stimulating economic growth\nand prosperity in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorny\nKarabakh. My country remains committed to a negotiated\nsettlement of the conflict and will continue to engage\nconstructively in the peace process. However, we urge\nAzerbaijan to negotiate directly with the elected officials of\nNagorny Karabakh, for we strongly believe that no final\nsolution can be achieved without Karabakh's direct\nparticipation in the deliberations on its own political status.\nThe Republic of Armenia has been actively\nparticipating in the fields of arms control and disarmament.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to full implementation of\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) objectives. To that end, Armenia welcomes the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) programme\non strengthening the effectiveness and improving the\nefficiency of the safeguards system. We have already\nexpressed our readiness to conclude a supplementary\nprotocol to the safeguards agreement with the IAEA.\nLast year the overwhelming majority of United\nNations Member States signed the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We join the international\ncommunity in calling upon all States to sign and ratify\nthis Treaty to ensure its early entry into force.\nThe Chemical Weapons Convention was another\nhistoric accomplishment in the field of global\ndisarmament. As a founding member of the Organization\nfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Armenia will\nadvocate the full and effective implementation of the\nConvention.\nArmenia also supports the complementary efforts \u2014\nthrough the Ottawa process \u2014 aimed at achieving a\ncomplete ban on anti-personnel landmines. We realize the\nimportance of developing technological solutions to mine\ndetection and clearance, and we fully support programmes\non assistance to mine victims.\nThe reform of the Security Council should become\nanother important component of the overall reform within\nthe United Nations. Armenia supports the current\ndiscussions on improving the representative character of\nthe Security Council. We are in favour of expansion in\nboth categories, permanent and non-permanent. However,\nwhile strengthening the capacity of the Council, such an\nincrease should also safeguard its decision-making\nefficiency. We believe that five new seats should be\nallocated as permanent for the Security Council to better\nreflect present political and economic realities. This\narrangement should include improved representation for\nthe countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the\nCaribbean. We also support the desire of Germany and\nJapan to acquire the status of permanent members of the\nSecurity Council.\nAs regards the non-permanent seats, it is our view\nthat the expansion should take into account the legitimate\ninterests of the Eastern European Group, whose\nmembership has more than doubled in recent years.\n18\n\n\nThe Government of Armenia welcomes the proposals\nby the Secretary-General for the reform of the United\nNations. We fully support his commendable efforts to refine\nthe structure of this Organization and to streamline the\noperations of its system, to make it more flexible and\ncapable of adequate, timely responses to the challenges of\ntoday's world. These proposals are a sound basis for\nimmediate actions, further negotiations and deliberations by\nthe General Assembly. There is a strong need to consolidate\nthe ongoing attempts of the United Nations system and\nMember States to alter and develop the Organization. At\nthe same time, we should avoid reducing the evaluation of\nthese reforms to a purely financial or managerial approach.\nReform must enable the United Nations to attain more\neffectively the mandates and priorities enshrined in the\nCharter.\nIn conclusion, let me assure the Assembly that\nArmenia, keenly aware of the importance of an effective\nand active United Nations, is committed to contributing its\nshare in the strengthening of this Organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe delegation of Ghana\ncongratulates His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-second session. His long experience in the affairs\nof this Organization and the great qualities which he brings\nto this high office assure us that under his wise guidance\nthe work of this session will be fruitful and constructive. To\nthat end my delegation pledges to him its full support and\ncooperation.\nMy delegation also wishes to pay a special tribute to\nhis distinguished predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Razali\nIsmail, who conducted the business of the fifty-first session\nwith remarkable zeal and efficiency. The promptitude and\nenergy with which he discharged his responsibilities as\nPresident has left an enduring imprint on the work of this\nOrganization.\nTo our distinguished Secretary-General and my\ncompatriot, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, we wish to\nexpress our deep appreciation for his sterling qualities of\nleadership. The people of Ghana are indeed grateful to the\nworld community for having chosen a son to head this very\nhigh and important body. Barely nine months after\nassuming his onerous responsibilities, Kofi Annan has\ndemonstrated an indefatigable energy and commitment to\nthe reform and efficient management of the Organization\nto enable it to measure up to the purposes and objectives\nof its existence. We pledge to him our continued\nunflinching support.\nAt the fifty-first session, Member States warmly\nwelcomed the conclusion of the Pelindaba and Bangkok\nTreaties establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa\nand South-East Asia respectively. We also welcomed the\nadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,\nwhich has since been signed by the vast majority of\nStates, including my own. We view these as progressive\nsteps on the road to nuclear disarmament. We therefore\nrenew our call on the nuclear-weapon States to cooperate\nwith the rest of the international community for the\ncommencement and early conclusion of multilateral\nnegotiations on a universal and binding convention\nprohibiting the development, production, stockpiling and\nuse of nuclear weapons, and mandating the destruction of\nthe existing stockpiles.\nWe make these appeals not as an annual ritual but\nbecause of our deep conviction that the elimination of\nweapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical\nand biological weapons, will go a long way to promote\ninternational peace and security, a principal purpose for\nwhich this Organization was established.\nWhile weapons of mass destruction deserve the\npriority attention accorded them by this Assembly, the\nquestion of conventional weapons cannot be ignored\neither. The illicit transfer and use of this category of\narmaments are a source of great concern, since they\nconstitute a threat to the stability of States and fuel the\nnumerous conflicts which bedevil the world today,\nparticularly in Africa. They also provide terrorists, drug\nbarons and other criminals the means with which to\npursue their illegal activities. We must adopt all available\nmeans to curb the illicit traffic. In the same vein, we\nsupport ongoing international initiatives to conclude a\ntreaty banning the production, transfer and use of anti-\npersonnel landmines, which continue to kill and maim\ninnocent people and disrupt the economic and social life\nof millions, long after the end of the conflicts in which\nthey were laid.\nThough the end of the cold war has greatly reduced\nthe threat of another global war, which twice in this\ncentury brought untold sorrow to mankind, intra-country\nconflicts and civil wars continue to wreak havoc in\n17\n\n\nseveral countries, with resultant loss of lives, destruction of\nnational infrastructure, displacement of innocent persons\nand outflow of refugees into neighbouring countries. In\nAfghanistan, Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia, Somalia,\nAngola, Liberia and Sierra Leone and the Republic of the\nCongo, we see the havoc caused by this new trend and its\npotential threat to regional and subregional security.\nWe in Africa are all the more concerned. For while\nthe international community is prompt to react to conflicts\nin regions of economic or geo-strategic interest to the rich\nand industrialized world, conflicts in some developing\ncountries, particularly in Africa, I am sorry to say, fail to\nelicit the same degree of response. Thus, peacekeeping,\nwhich is a primary function of this Organization, has also\nfallen prey to geo-strategic parochial considerations. We\nhasten to warn that such double standards threaten the\nconcept of collective security which constitutes the very\nfoundation of this Organization.\nIn the West African subregion, we have endeavoured\nto fill the gap left by international inertia and selectivity.\nAfter nearly eight years of fratricidal civil war and the\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) intervention in Liberia,\ncountries of the subregion, with only the limited assistance\nof the international community, finally succeeded in\nsupervising the conduct of presidential and legislative\nelections in the country in July 1997, under conditions\ngenerally acknowledged to be free and fair.\nWe are happy to welcome the worthy representatives\nof the elected Government of Liberia to this Assembly. For\ntrue and lasting peace in that country, we urge the\ninternational community to stand by the people of Liberia\nas they set out on the difficult road of national\nreconstruction. We are proud to have been part of the\nprocess to restore peace and legitimacy in Liberia, and pray\nthat the Liberian Government and people will continue on\nthe path of national reconciliation in order to consolidate\nthe hard-won peace, which is vital for social and economic\ndevelopment.\nWhile we applaud the return of peace to Liberia, we\ndeplore the onset of violence, disorder and destruction\nfollowing the unjustified overthrow of the democratically\nelected Government of President Tejan Kabbah in Sierra\nLeone. We call on the leaders of the coup to heed the\nunequivocal condemnation of their act by the international\ncommunity and cooperate with the efforts of ECOWAS to\nrestore constitutional order in Sierra Leone.\nIn recent years, my delegation has had cause to\nexpress its concern and regret at the continued imposition\nof unjust sanctions on Libya by the Security Council, in\ndefiance of the expressed wish of the vast majority of\nStates represented in the League of Arab States, the\nOrganization of African Unity and the Non-Aligned\nMovement. We note that Libya has fully met the\nrequirements of Security Council resolution 731 (1992)\nand is willing to cooperate with the other parties\nconcerned in the dispute. We urge the Security Council to\nrevisit the issue and ensure a peaceful solution of the\nconflict and an end to the sanctions.\nWe also reiterate the call of the Non-Aligned\nMovement and other States on the United States of\nAmerica to put an end to the economic, commercial and\nfinancial measures and actions unilaterally imposed on\nCuba, in contravention of the United Nations Charter and\nall principles of international law.\nWe urge the people of Korea to work together in\npeace to realize their aspirations. Since the end of the\ncold war peace on the peninsula has needlessly been\nunder threat on a number of occasions.\nOn the question of Western Sahara, we maintain our\nconfidence in the power of direct dialogue, under the\nauspices of this Organization, as the best means by which\nthe Settlement Plan can be revived to enable the Sahrawi\npeople to exercise their right to self-determination,\nthrough a free, fair and impartial referendum. The news\nthat the Secretary-General\u2019s personal envoy, in the worthy\nperson of His Excellency Mr. James Baker III, has\nsucceeded in brokering a compromise agreement through\nsuch direct talks is reassuring, and we hope that very\nsoon, this long, drawn-out conflict will be amenable to\nsuccessful resolution.\nMay I also avail myself of this opportunity to\nexpress my Government\u2019s regret that the Middle East\npeace process has been put in grave jeopardy by the\nactions of the Israeli Government, which, defying\ninternational outcry, continues its settlement activities in\nEast Jerusalem. For these are the very actions which\nencourage extremists among the Palestinians to organize\nterrorist acts against the Israeli population. We would also\nurge the Palestinian leadership to continue more\nassiduously in its efforts to achieve the objectives of their\ntreaty with Israel through non-confrontational means.\nMany a representative has drawn attention to the\ncontinued and widespread growth of the global economy\n18\n\n\nas we move towards the close of the century and to the\nbroadening of the reach of economic growth in developing\ncountries to include an increasing number of low-income\ncountries. Indeed, many African countries have achieved\nstronger growth of output and incomes in 1996 and 1997.\nThis encouraging trend has been achieved through the\nadoption and pursuit by Governments of policies and\nmeasures aimed at ensuring, among others, macroeconomic\nstability, inflows of foreign direct investment, open and free\nmarkets and stable and transparent legal and regulatory\nframeworks.\nHowever, it is pertinent also to point out that despite\nthese efforts, many African countries, and especially the\nleast developed countries, continue to face important policy\nchallenges, particularly in the areas of enhancing resource\nmobilization and allocation, strengthening savings and\ninvestment and financing development. The difficulties\ninherent in these challenges are compounded by the adverse\nimpact of globalization and liberalization. These countries\nhave not participated in, nor benefited from, globalization.\nOn the contrary, they have become even more marginalized\nin the global economy for the very simple reason that they\nlack the physical, financial and human resources as well as\nthe institutional infrastructure necessary for effective\ncompetition and integration in the international markets.\nIn specific terms our countries, despite various\nstructural reforms, have been unable to attract in sufficient\nquantities the necessary capital inflows for investment, and\nare confronted at the same time with domestic supply-side\nconstraints which limit our export potential, an\nunsustainable debt which swallows a great part of our\nnational income, and declining levels of official\ndevelopment assistance, among others. The \u201cprosperity-\npoverty\u201d gap, or gulf, between the haves and the have-nots\nis ever more yawning.\nUnder these circumstances, what we need is a new\ndevelopment strategy based on genuine partnership between\nthe developed and developing countries and which takes a\nholistic view of development, combining within itself all\nthe tools of development, including trade and investment as\nwell as official development assistance and South/South\ncooperation. Such a strategy will also necessitate the\ndemocratization of international relations, particularly in the\neconomic sphere; the establishment of open, equitable and\ntransparent international regimes; the creation of fair\nopportunities for all; and the protection of the weakest\nmembers of our community.\nIt is in this context that we welcome the successful\nconclusion and adoption of the Agenda for Development,\nwhich is intended to serve as an initial framework for\nrenewing and strengthening the partnership for\ndevelopment on the basis of mutual benefits and genuine\ninterdependence. While acknowledging and affirming our\ncommitment to the primacy of national policies and\nmeasures to achieve our development goals, we wish to\nstress the importance of the fulfilment by all parties of the\nglobal commitments aimed at supplementing national\nefforts. In this connection, we express the hope that the\ncommitments and internationally agreed targets reached at\nrecent major United Nations conferences will be fully\nimplemented by all parties. It is also our view that the\nUnited Nations must be strengthened and adequately\nequipped to carry out its important role in development.\nIn seeking to achieve our goals, we the countries of\nthe developing world need to cooperate more among\nourselves as a means of strengthening our self-reliance\nand complementing international development\ncooperation. We therefore need to strive to enhance\ncooperation at all levels \u2014 bilateral, subregional, regional\nand interregional \u2014 in the important areas of trade,\ninvestment, finance, science and technology, environment,\nhuman resources development, and information and\ncommunications. This, in the view of my delegation, will\nconstitute an important strategy for facilitating the\neffective participation of developing countries in the\nglobal economy.\nThe review and appraisal of the implementation of\nAgenda 21 last June revealed worsening trends for\nsustainable development, as well as the continued\ndeterioration of the state of the global environment as a\nresult of the failure of the international community to\nfulfil the commitments it undertook in 1992. This is a sad\nstate of affairs. But even sadder still was the failure of the\nreview session to make any significant progress on the\ncritical issues of Agenda 21, owing to the unwillingness\nof Member States to establish time-bound and quantified\ncommitments. It is absolutely necessary that we all\nrecommit ourselves to the global partnership established\nat Rio in 1992 and to the fulfilment of the obligations\nvoluntarily assumed under Agenda 21.\nGhana has in various forums indicated its support for\nthe establishment of an international criminal court. We\nare gratified that the Preparatory Committee for the\nestablishment of the Court made significant progress in\nthat direction at its last two sessions. We hope that with\nthe same determination and spirit of compromise which\n19\n\n\nhas characterized the work of the Preparatory Committee\nsince its inception, the establishment of the Court will soon\nbecome a reality. We wish to recognize the useful\ncontributions of the various non-governmental organizations\nwhich have worked closely with governmental delegations\non several difficult aspects of the proposed international\ncriminal court.\nProgress on the Law of the Sea also deserves mention.\nWith the establishment of the Commission on the Limits of\nthe Continental Shelf, all institutions envisaged by the\nConvention have now been put in place. It is our hope that\nadequate resources will be made available to these\ninstitutions to enable them fully to attain the objectives for\nwhich they were set up. It is also our hope that cooperation\nbetween the appropriate United Nations agencies and\ndeveloping countries in the sphere of the Law of the Sea\nwill be intensified to enable developing countries fully to\nutilize the benefits conferred on them by the Convention on\nthe Law of the Sea.\nThe critical financial situation of the Organization is\na major source of concern to my delegation, as it places our\nOrganization in jeopardy at a time of challenge and of\nopportunity to promote the objectives and purposes of the\nOrganization. It is regrettable that a number of countries,\nincluding some of the largest contributors, are neither\npaying their contributions nor making good on their arrears,\nwhile some even wittingly aggravate the situation by\nattaching unacceptable conditions or benchmarks to the\ndischarge of their Charter obligations in this regard. My\ndelegation strongly believes that support for the United\nNations must be demonstrated not only by an eagerness to\npromote reforms but more importantly by the willingness of\nMember States to pay all their assessed contributions\npromptly, fully and unconditionally to ensure that the\nOrganization is financially sound and can meet its mandates\nand other commitments.\nTed Turner, an individual with no obligation\nwhatsoever to support the United Nations, has demonstrated\nsupport in a dramatic and yet effective manner. He has\noffered to pay the United Nations $1 billion over 10 years.\nWhat excuse has any country got, then, to say, \u201cWe will\nnot pay\u201d, or \u201cWe will pay only if ...\u201d? On behalf of His\nExcellency the President of Ghana and of the people of\nGhana, I say thank you to Ted Turner for showing us the\nway, for pricking our consciences and for being such a\ngood citizen of the world.\nToday at the fifty-second session, perhaps more so\nthan ever before, the General Assembly is confronted with\nthe complex problem of the reform of our Organization.\nOn the threshold of a new millennium, the United Nations\ncannot continue to conduct its business as usual. It has to\nadopt bold and imaginative measures to overhaul its\nstructure and working methods with a view to removing\nthe obstacles that impede its effectiveness not only as an\ninstrument for promoting international peace and security\nbut also as an indispensable agent for resolving the\nworld\u2019s socio-economic problems.\nIt is in this context that Ghana has carefully studied\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s wide-ranging and far-reaching\nproposals presented to Member States for their\nconsideration and reaction. We warmly congratulate the\nSecretary-General on his bold initiative. The Secretary-\nGeneral has thrown a momentous challenge to all of us,\nand we should do everything possible to measure up to\nthe test by manifesting the necessary breadth of vision\nand objectivity of outlook. The United Nations remains\nthe only international body available to us in our search\nfor peace, progress and prosperity as well as in the\nresolution of differences among nations.\nFor us as a nation, we are particularly interested in\nthe new sense of purpose and dynamism that the\nproposals seek to inject into United Nations development\nactivities to make them more coherent and output-\noriented. We support the setting up of an effective\nmachinery to study the various proposals and how to\nimplement them, and we stand ready to participate in any\nsuch effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, allow me to take this opportunity\nto congratulate Minister Udovenko, our colleague from\nUkraine, on his election as President of this session of\nthe General Assembly and to express my most sincere\nthanks to Ambassador Razali of Malaysia for the\ninvaluable work he helped us achieve during the fifty-\nfirst session of the Assembly.\nIt is clear that the way in which we organize\nourselves as a world community is of the utmost\nimportance for questions of war and peace, poverty and\nwealth, and justice and injustice in the world.\nThe United Nations Secretariat and the leadership of\nour Organization have a key role in this regard. All those\nserving United Nations institutions deserve our gratitude\nfor the way in which they carry out their work, both here\nin New York and in the field, often in precarious\nsituations in which some have even lost their lives.\nBut we should ask whether we, the Member States,\nhave done enough to find common responses. Have we\ngiven the United Nations the necessary tools for\ncomprehensive management? Have we not blamed the\nOrganization for a lack of success in some of its\nendeavours, when they may have been doomed to failure\nanyway because there was not enough support from\nMember States?\nWe must be fully aware that, as Member States, we\nsometimes try to impose tasks upon the Organization\nwhich are beyond its capabilities, while we are all too\noften slow to provide help and support whenever and\nwherever it is really needed. More than once we have\nseen \u2014 in Africa, for example \u2014 that the United\nNations has had to spread itself too thinly over vast\ndistances and that adequate support for a United\nNations role has not been forthcoming from Member\nStates, which has weakened the United Nations ability\nto react when a dynamic response was needed in crisis\nsituations.\nHas not the time come, during this session, to\nensure that the Organization can act with renewed\nvigour and reconfirm its authority? I am convinced that\nthe answer to this question should be positive, and that\nwe should, like the President of the European Union\nand other previous speakers, throw our full weight\nbehind the Secretary-General's proposals to prepare the\nOrganization more effectively for the coming\nmillennium.\nMore efficiency and coordination, greater cohesion\nand better cooperation between Headquarters and\nagencies in the field are minimal changes, but fully\njustified. However, we need to do more because this\nyear we must resolve the United Nations financial\ncrisis.\nIt is unacceptable that Member States should not\npay their dues in full and that they attach conditions to\nthe payment of what they owe. All the speakers in the\ngeneral debate should be able to proclaim from this\nrostrum not just that they want to improve the\nOrganization's efficiency and that they support the\nSecretary-General in his efforts to that end, but also\nthat their contributions have been paid in full,\nunconditionally, thus proving their commitment to the\ngoals of the United Nations and our common agenda.\nThere can be no doubt that this agenda includes\nthe achievements of the 12 United Nations conferences\nwhich, from the 1990 World Summit for Children to\nthe 1996 World Food Summit, have paved the way for\nthe current agenda in the area of international\ndevelopment. But responsibilities have often been\ndistributed injudiciously and too widely, while mandates\nhave proved insufficient. A more integrated approach in\nthe social and economic sector has in any case become\nnecessary. I therefore welcome the fact that the\nSecretary-General\u2019s proposals for reform pay particular\n29\n\n\nattention to development, and I subscribe fully to his\nproposals.\nFurthermore, a well-balanced expansion of the\nSecurity Council should be achieved without delay.\nBelgium, together with a number of like-minded\ncountries that share the general concern with regard to\nstrengthening the authority of the Security Council, has\nclearly stated its views here in New York. We advocate\nan increase in both permanent and non-permanent\nmembers, greater regional representativeness, enhanced\nCouncil efficiency and a limitation of the right of veto.\nThe right of veto is incompatible with the general\ninterest. It should be possible to modify the\ndecision-making mechanism so as to avoid recourse to\nthis instrument, which has become entirely obsolete.\nBelgium also pleads for more transparency and closer\ncooperation between the Security Council and countries\ncontributing to peacekeeping operations.\nSuch organizational and financial reform can\nsucceed only if it can rely upon a team of officials who\nsee themselves as being at the service of the Organization\nand of the common good. Ultimately, an Organization\nreformed along these lines and better able to meet global\nchallenges will have to strengthen its ties with and\ncomplement regional organizations, not only in the\npolitical field but also at the social and economic level. It\nwill not be possible to make our world more humane\nwithout the joint effort of all international organizations\nin support of a global approach. In this effort, the United\nNations, together with regional and specialized\ninstitutions, is a beacon of hope for millions of people.\nStrengthening the United Nations also means\nstrengthening its ties with other organizations and\nassociations so that they can keep pace with the overall\nreshaping of our Organization and of our world vision.\nI should like to provide two examples. With regard\nto its policy on Africa, Belgium again stresses the need\nfor an objective approach on the one hand and\naccountability on the other. The approach that we wish to\npromote is based on universal principles, the most\nimportant of which is that of human rights sustained by\nmutual respect based on equality. It is high time that we\nprogressed to true mental decolonization. Efforts\noriginating in the region itself should be given every\nchance to prosper and should be fully recognized by the\ninternational community. As for Central Africa in\nparticular, our common efforts should give priority to the\nreconstruction and democratization of the Congo, in the\ninterests not only of that country and its people, but of\nstability in the Great Lakes region as a whole.\nOn the other hand, in certain areas, such as\nEastern Slavonia, United Nations \u201cblue helmets\u201d have\nsucceeded in separating warring parties, protecting\npopulations and preparing for reconstruction. It is\ntherefore the responsibility first of the parties\nthemselves and then of the international community to\nmake every effort to prevent these achievements from\nslipping away. By extension, this is also true for the\nregion as a whole. With regard to Eastern Slavonia in\nparticular, it is important for the activities of the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to\nbe based on the accomplishments of the United Nations\nTransitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia,\nBaranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) and for such\nactivities to be inspired by and based upon United\nNations experience in the region.\nI should now like to focus on another\ncontemporary issue: disarmament. Needless to say,\nweapons of mass destruction should be forbidden. But\nthis is also true for weapons whose sole purpose is to\ndestroy human beings, such as anti-personnel\nlandmines. In Angola, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Cambodia\nand elsewhere, these indiscriminate and cowardly\nweapons kill some 9,600 people and maim another\n14,000 every year. They kill and mutilate more people\nthan all the weapons of mass destruction put together.\nIt is high time that these devices were banned. In\nless than two years the objective of a total ban on\nanti-personnel landmines has met with a positive\nresponse in most parts of the world. Belgium, which\nwas keen to play a leading role in this field, fully\nsupports this objective. As chairman of the international\nconference on a total ban on anti-personnel landmines,\nwhich took place in Brussels in June, I myself noted\nthe existence of the political will necessary to achieve a\nban by the end of 1997.\nThe recent conclusion in Oslo of the negotiations\non a legally binding instrument means that most of us\nwill be able to go to Ottawa in early December to sign\nthis important treaty. My country made a great effort to\nensure that we produced a strong legal instrument, with\nno exceptions or reservations, and we also advocated\nthat assistance to landmine victims should be an\nessential part of this convention. Belgium is pleased to\nnote that this international humanitarian standard will\nsoon become a reality and invites all other States to\n30\n\n\njoin in the effort. It is also my firm hope that States will\nnot wait for the treaty to come into force before they\nhonour this total ban.\nHumanitarian tragedies will continue to occur\nthroughout the world. Whatever their origins, crises are\nbecome increasingly complicated. Still considerable in\nnumber, they create countless victims and immense\nhuman suffering. Despite greater solidarity and increased\nhumanitarian assistance granted by a growing number of\nhumanitarian and non-governmental organizations,\ndifficulties on the ground have continued to grow in\nrecent years. Above all, in addition to the problem of\naccess to victims, the lack of security and total disregard\nfor international humanitarian law and human rights\nrequire our particular attention. Indeed, I am especially\nworried about the recent increase in aggression against\nhumanitarian personnel. These acts are often carried out\nwith the sole purpose of blocking their access to\npopulations who are suffering. It goes without saying that\nthe authorities hosting the humanitarian workers bear\nprimary responsibility for their safety.\nThese authorities must also ensure respect for\nhumanitarian law, based on values for which a consensus\nexists within the international community but whose\nconcrete application on the ground remains a daily\nchallenge. This is another task for the United Nations.\nExisting legal instruments must be strengthened and\nexpanded in order to extend the same maximum\nprotection to humanitarian personnel in the field as is\ncurrently provided for military personnel in peacekeeping\nmissions. In addition, the directives on humanitarian law\nsuch as those proposed by the International Committee of\nthe Red Cross should also be revitalized and thoroughly\nexamined.\nOur Organization is increasingly confronted with\ncrises that require global responses comprising not only\ntheir humanitarian dimensions, but also their military,\neconomic, political and social dimensions. In these\ncircumstances, humanitarian organizations must not only\ncontinue to ensure a thorough coordination of the\nassistance delivered, but also develop stepped-up\nconvergence between, for instance, United Nations Blue\nHelmets involved in peacekeeping missions and\nhumanitarian workers.\nGreater interaction and cooperation between them is\nimperative if we wish to devise an integrated and suitable\nresponse to the ever more complex crisis situations facing\nthe international community.\nI believe that much remains to be done in order to\nimprove and develop such cooperation: for example,\njoint planning for crisis situations, training, defining\nroles and mandates and, finally, implementation and\nfollow-up of operations.\nWe must bear in mind that humanitarian assistance\nmust never be used for mere political purposes, and it\ncannot by itself be intended to provide a lasting\nsolution to a conflict. Humanitarian assistance should\ntherefore never be a substitute for political, diplomatic\nand military action.\nIn this context, Belgium, in close cooperation with\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross, intends\nto organize next year, an international seminar precisely\non the relationship between humanitarian, political and\nmilitary actions. The focus will be on interaction\nbetween humanitarian, political and military actors in\nsituations of crisis. This will be an opportunity to\nanalyse closely the often widely varying approaches to\nthis problem.\nThe objective of international humanitarian\nassistance is not only to guarantee the survival of\nvictims of humanitarian tragedies. It should also help\nthem be reintegrated into society. Viewed in this\nfashion, humanitarian assistance is an important factor\nin the protection of human dignity, human rights and\nhumanitarian law. The international community must\ntherefore put an end to the impunity of persons\nresponsible for grave violations of international\nhumanitarian law, whether committed against\npopulations or humanitarian personnel.\nThe creation of the ad hoc tribunals for the\nprosecution and punishment of such violations and the\nnecessary creation of a standing international criminal\ncourt, are important steps towards the fulfilment of\nthese goals.\nHowever, it is essential that these international\njudiciary bodies should be given a fair chance to carry\nout their functions. Thus, their legal competence should\nbe firmly established and recognized by all Member\nStates.\nRespect for human rights has become an essential\nyardstick of the legitimacy of the exercise of State\npower and is increasingly considered a vital part of a\ncountry\u2019s international status and influence. It has\n31\n\n\nbecome the new basis for the confidence we bestow on\nour fellow Member States.\nNext year the General Assembly will devote part of\nits session to the commemoration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights.\nThat Declaration, without any doubt, is one of the\nmost important texts of our times. It is the foundation of\nthe whole array of standards that came after it and that\nhave been incorporated into a number of international\nlegal instruments. It is also the bedrock upon which rest\nall United Nations activities aimed at better respect for\nand promotion of human rights, in accordance with the\nCharter.\nIn the spirit of the Vienna World Conference on\nHuman Rights, a growing number of Member States, in\nfull exercise of their sovereignty, have accepted\ninternational commitments by ratifying those human\nrights instruments. However, I should like to express the\nhope that Member States will also spare no effort in\nhaving their provisions implemented. By so doing they\nwill contribute to the universality of human rights.\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights remains\nan inexhaustible source of hope for all those who are\ndeprived of their rights, especially the victims of social,\npolitical or economic exclusion or exploitation on the\nbasis of their race, origin, religion, sex or any other\ngrounds.\nConsequently, I, fully subscribe to the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s stated intention to integrate human rights\nhorizontally throughout the full range of United Nations\nactivities. Belgium reiterates to the Secretary-General its\nfull support in this respect.\nLet me conclude by saying that my country will\nmake every effort \u2014 nationally, regionally and\nglobally \u2014 so that the commemoration of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights will be a resounding\nsuccess that reflects the capital importance of the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me particular\npleasure to congratulate you, Sir, the distinguished\nrepresentative of Ukraine, on your election to the\nresponsible post of President of the fifty-second of the\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations. I am convinced\nthat your rich and profound experience in diplomatic\nrelations, together with your personal qualities, will\nfacilitate the constructive work of this General Assembly\nsession and make it an outstanding international event.\nThe delegation of the Republic of Belarus is ready to\ncontribute to your endeavours in any way required. I\nwould also like to use this opportunity to say a word of\ngratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Razali Ismail, for his\ncompetent and efficient presidency during the fifty-first\nsession of the General Assembly.\nEvery day, international life and international\nrelations acquire ever more multidimensional and ever\ndeeper significance, with new meanings and trends in\ndevelopment that can no longer be constrained within the\n7\n\n\ncriteria and standards of the twentieth century. We live at\na time oriented towards the future. A fin de si\u00e8cle mentality\nis not just a nostalgic feeling for the century passing away,\nbut also embraces a deep concern for the years ahead. The\ndestiny of mankind, however contradictory and diverse, and\nthe interests of nations and States may become more\namenable to one common denominator, are increasingly\nconcerned with the well-being of humanity, and display\nnumerous convergent features which make it possible now\nto discuss the opportunity for a new international order.\nEntering the twenty-first century, with its new\ninternational order, does not mean that we renounce the\nexperience of the last 52 years in the development of the\nfamily of nations under one common programme, as set out\nfor us by the founding fathers of the United Nations and\noutlined in its Charter. On the contrary, it means adjusting\nthese lofty aims to the new realities of a multifaceted world\nand also making the Organization \u2014 no matter how\ndifferent its separate parts are \u2014 the mainstream of human\ndevelopment, where the economic well-being of people\nbrings to an end age-old ills such as starvation and\nepidemic diseases, as well as huge environmental threats,\nand which helps to achieve multilateral understanding\nbetween those participating in this development. Solving\nthese problems is becoming the overriding ambition and the\nmain goal and hope of the United Nations, as well as of\nmankind as a whole.\nRight now, the United Nations has started displaying\nits capacity to adapt its structure and policies to the\ndemands of the future. The orientation of the United\nNations towards the future is the overriding goal that was\nestablished for it during its fiftieth anniversary celebrations.\nThe change of leadership and the measures that are now\nbeing undertaken in this direction give sufficient grounds\nfor optimism. We declare our support for these goals and\nactions. With a sense of trust and the intention to\ncontribute, we take note of the actions of the new\nSecretary-General, Mr. Annan, in regard to reform within\nthe United Nations. In this respect, I would like to quote\nfrom a letter dated 5 September 1997 sent by the President\nof the Republic of Belarus, Mr. Lukashenka, to the\nSecretary-General:\n\u201cThese reforms are a timely and meaningful response\nto the objectives facing the United Nations during this\ncomplex period at the turning point of the millennia,\nincluding problems which ought to be solved with the\npurpose of enhancing the effectiveness of the United\nNations system.\n\u201cThe Republic of Belarus is in favour of a\npragmatic, comprehensive approach to United\nNations reform which would provide for the\nstrengthening, on the basis of the opportunities\navailable, of the United Nations potential in\npeacekeeping, humanitarian and informational\nfields.\u201d\nIn our opinion, these measures are very important\nand represent an up-to-date response to the need to settle\nthe issues coming before the United Nations during this\ncomplex historical period as we approach the end of the\nmillennium. These issues need to be solved in order to\nenhance the functional efficiency of the family of the\nUnited Nations. When we speak of reform in the United\nNations, we have in mind first and foremost an effective\ndistribution of United Nations resources, the streamlining\nof the Organization\u2019s administrative and organizational\nstructures, and budgetary and structural reform of the\nUnited Nations Secretariat, as well as personnel\nadjustments to meet the challenges of the modern world.\nWhen addressing United Nations reform, we place\nspecial emphasis on the reform of the Security Council,\nwhich is one of the principal United Nations bodies,\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity.\nExtremely critical in this respect is, of course, the\nprinciple of balanced representation of all regional groups\nof United Nations Member States on the reformed\nSecurity Council. The Republic of Belarus is convinced\nthat allocation of one more non-permanent seat on the\nSecurity Council to the Group of Eastern European\nStates \u2014 whose membership has more than doubled in\nrecent years \u2014 is in full compliance with the provisions\nof Article 23 of the United Nations Charter, which sets\nforth the principle of equitable geographical distribution.\nAmong all the new realities that are being brought\ninto the mosaic of international relations, efficient\nmechanisms for global and regional security still seem\nparamount. Belarus considers its national security to be\ninalienably connected and identified with the collective\nsecurity system of the European continent. Each State has,\nof course, ample right independently to select the most\nefficient means of protecting its own national interests,\nincluding the right to participate in regional security\norganizations.\nFor the last two years Belarus has displayed a firm\nstance against the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty\n8\n\n\nOrganization (NATO) as a military bloc. I hope for\nunderstanding on the part of the international community in\nthis respect. In the event that we had on our western\nborders not the friendly sovereign Polish State we have\nnow but a military organization, it would certainly push us\nto seriously analyse and reconsider our national security\nconsiderations.\nHowever, recently we have noticed developments\ninside the NATO structure itself. We took due note of\nseveral meetings of NATO member States regarding the\ntransformation of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council\ninto the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, as well as the\ntransformation of the major military aims of NATO itself.\nTaking into account current realities, we would like to\nreiterate our position against NATO\u2019s expansion as a\nmilitary organization, but also to add to it that we are in\nfavour of its development into a universal European\norganization for peace and security. It is with this intention\nthat we have entered into negotiations with NATO and\npresented a programme for Belarusian participation in the\nPartnership for Peace. We sincerely hope that by\ndeveloping a more constructive approach we will reach a\nmutual understanding, which could be reinforced by some\nmutual obligations.\nWe would also like to state that with this evolution of\nNATO and a thorough analysis of existing world and\nregional security systems and treaties, further emphasis\nshould be attached to well-established regional\norganizations such as the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and to their closer\ncooperation with the United Nations and its specialized\nagencies.\nAs to the OSCE, we feel certain that it has already\naccumulated profound experience and skills in tackling\nmany important security issues and is able to make a major\ncontribution to strengthening peace and security on the\ncontinent. Therefore, the Republic of Belarus readily\nsupports the initiatives of Russia and the Netherlands\nconcerning a number of special events to commemorate the\none hundredth anniversary of the First Peace Conference.\nShould this conference take place in 1999, it would be an\nimportant opportunity to discuss the complex problems of\npeaceful cooperation between Member States and to find\nand elaborate means to constructively handle major issues\nof contention and also to strengthen the legal foundations\nof international actions for peace.\nI should like to state that the Republic of Belarus, as\none of the founding Members of the United Nations, has\nalways spoken strongly in favour of the peaceful\nregulation of military conflicts in different regions of the\nglobe and of elaborating new and efficient measures to\nprevent the emergence of new crisis situations. That is\nwhy we share the approach of many who have spoken\nhere, when they expressed concern about the development\nof the situation in the Middle East. It is our opinion that\nthe continuation of the Arab-Israeli dialogue, which will\nlive up to the agreements previously reached, is a must to\nstop terrorism in this region, to put an end to the non-stop\nbloodletting of innocent people and to establish a firm\nand lasting peace.\nThe same can also be said of the Balkans, which is\nnow one of the hottest spots in the European region. We\nare convinced that lasting peace in the former Yugoslavia\nis possible only under conditions where violence is\nrenounced and where the parties involved settle their\nconflicts in a peaceful manner.\nThe Republic of Belarus invites the General\nAssembly to enable the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,\nas a founding Member, to resume its participation in the\nwork of the General Assembly and other bodies of the\nUnited Nations.\nUnfortunately, conflicts, including military clashes,\nare still a reality of humanity\u2019s everyday existence. We\ncall upon the Security Council to be more prudent in\nhandling these conflicts, to be more diligent in seeking\npeaceful means to regulate them, avoiding at all costs\neconomic destruction as well as the political and moral\ndamage that comes with attempts to apply sanctions.\nI should like to seize this opportunity to confirm the\nwillingness of the Government of the Republic of Belarus\nto host the Minsk international Conference on conflict\nsettlement in Nagorny Karabakh.\nAs members know, Belarus has always been among\nthose nations which have spoken and acted strongly to\nmake effective measures undertaken by the United\nNations in the field of disarmament. I should like to\nremind the Assembly that Belarus was one of the first\nCommonwealth of Independent States countries, after the\nbreakup of the Soviet Union, to withdraw nuclear\nweapons from its territory. Belarus aims to achieve\nfurther progress in the field of disarmament, in particular\nby banning chemical, bacteriological and other toxic\nweapons, by putting an end to research into new weapons\n9\n\n\nof mass destruction, and by preventing an arms race in\nspace. Awareness of these aims means a more secure future\nfor our children.\nThe Belarusian position on disarmament issues is firm\nand logically predictable. Apart from our refusal to station\nnuclear weapons on our soil, we have suggested creating a\nnuclear-free zone in the centre of Europe. I must admit that\nso far the response to this initiative has been tepid, at best.\nBut I would also reiterate that no matter the tepid response,\nonly the creation of regions entirely free from nuclear\nweapons and the nuclear threat will facilitate each important\nstep along the road to the eventual comprehensive\nrenouncement of nuclear weapons.\nApart from general support for the reform programmes\nof the United Nations, I should like to emphasize the\nparticularly positive approach of Belarus to the idea and the\nphilosophy of sustainable development. Pursuant to the\ndecisions and recommendations adopted by the Rio 1992\nEarth Summit, the Government of the Republic of Belarus\nworked out a national strategy for sustainable development,\nwhose outline was presented to the General Assembly\u2019s\nspecial session last June.\nWe appreciate the great assistance rendered to us by\nthe United Nations Development Programme, the United\nNations Secretariat and the United Nations Economic\nCommission for Europe, which helped us to hold our\nconference on sustainable development in Minsk in April\n1997, which was attended by representatives of 30 countries\nand more than 30 international organizations. That\nconference was an important landmark on the path to\nworking out an international strategy for sustainable\ndevelopment and outlined many of the important issues that\nare now faced by countries in a period of transition. I\nsincerely believe that the sustainable development\nprogramme launched by the United Nations will encourage\nthe participation of other multilateral organizations in its\nimplementation, in particular, the World Trade\nOrganization, which could advance reforms in countries\nwhose economies are in transition by accepting them as full\nmembers. We fervently hope that the Agenda for\nDevelopment, as a long-term policy of the United Nations,\nwill not only provide reliable mechanisms to deal with\ninternational catastrophes, such as the Chernobyl accident\nand others, but will also help establish a system to prevent\nsuch catastrophes and eliminate their consequences in all\nparts of the world.\nI should like to emphasize that the Chernobyl-related\nactivities of the United Nations as well as the international\nassistance in mitigating the consequences of that nuclear\ncatastrophe are highly appreciated by the people of\nBelarus. Yet the assistance is needed right now \u2014\ntoday \u2014 though we will need it in the future as well.\nThat is a tragic reality the Republic of Belarus is living\nthrough.\nAs members are aware, sometimes and in some\nareas Belarus has been the object of criticism because of\nthe slowness of reform and democratic transformations.\nConcern has been expressed regarding certain internal\ndevelopments in the Republic of Belarus. While I would\ncertainly acknowledge that some of the international\ncommunity\u2019s concern has been justified, I would like very\nmuch to say that the Republic of Belarus is a sovereign\nState that develops its own policy with due regard for the\nopportunities \u2014 economic, social, moral and\npsychological \u2014 of its citizens, within the limits of\ninternational patterns of behaviour and with respect for\nhuman rights and personal freedoms.\nIt has been an uneasy path, but so far the Republic\nof Belarus has avoided the pitfalls in economic and\npolitical areas, and with the due assistance of the\ninternational community expects to attain certain\nstandards compatible with the developed countries of the\nworld. Now we are practically the only country of the\nCommonwealth of Independent States that had a stable\neconomic growth of about 16 per cent during the first half\nof this year; we have arrested the decrease in volumes of\nindustrial production and we are a country free from\nreligious, ethnic or civil strife.\nOf course, there are many difficulties still ahead of\nus. But as long as a consensus of the people is secured on\nmajor development programmes and aims, the institutes\nof government and democracy are stable, and\ninternational cooperation proceeds within acceptable\ninternational norms. There is hope that we shall\naccomplish the goals set before us.\nDifficult as it might be, we have made quite a few\npositive steps to assure the United Nations that we are\nseriously focused on strengthening our participation in\nthis international body. No matter what objective financial\nor other economic difficulties Belarus is experiencing, we\nseek to fulfil our financial obligations before the United\nNations. This year, the Government of Belarus has\nallotted the first instalment to gradually liquidate our\narrears to the regular United Nations budget, and before\nthe year is over we plan to contribute another $5 million.\nHowever, we hope more careful consideration can be\n10\n\n\ngiven to reaching a fair solution in the settlement of the\nissue related to the payment by Belarus of its arrears in\nfinancial contributions to the United Nations regular budget\nand financing the United Nations peacekeeping operations.\nI would take up this issue, not to emphasize the need\nto avoid payments, but to invite the international\ncommunity to distinguish between the cases when payment\nis not made due to objective difficulties and when it results\nfrom the absence of will on the part of some Member\nStates to contribute in accordance with the principle of the\ncapacity to pay, or is an attempt to exert pressure on the\nUnited Nations and the policy it implements. There must be\na common quest for special solutions to further revise the\nscale of assessments, to reconstruct debt in cases where\neconomic conditions of this or that Member State do not\nallow for the regular payment to be made in time.\nDuring the limited time afforded to us, it is not\npossible to cover the whole range of problems which\nconfront the United Nations and which involve special\nactions and responsibilities of Member States. I have\noutlined only those which the Government of Belarus\nconsiders of the first priority to be addressed in order to\nsecure the normal functioning of the United Nations.\nI would like to close my statement on a note of\ncautious optimism. There are many indicators that the\nUnited Nations is advancing in the right direction, and the\nparticipation of Member States in the United Nations\nprogrammes of settling major global issues is a shade better\ntoday than it was yesterday. With all those shades blending\ninto a positive optimistic colour, the future of humanity is\nmore secure today than it was yesterday, and certainly a lot\nmore secure than it was before yesterday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFor some time now the\nUnited Nations has been engaged in a process of reform\nand restructuring with the aim of improving its capacity\nto address the many challenges which the world now\nfaces. It has been an arduous and time-consuming\nexercise which, if truth be told, has diverted us, to\nsome degree, from our primary task of promoting\nglobal peace and development. Yet the exercise is a\nnecessary one if we are in fact to enhance the\nOrganization's efficiency and effectiveness and to gear\nit for service to the international community in the\ncoming years.\nMy delegation is confident that, under the able\nleadership of the President, we will be able to make\nprogress in our endeavours. His wide diplomatic\nexperience, together with his intimate knowledge of the\n14\n\n\nOrganization, will serve, I am sure, to orient and\naccelerate our efforts. We congratulate him on his\nunanimous election and vouchsafe to him our ready\ncooperation to make this fifty-second session of the\nGeneral Assembly a significant turning point in the life\nof the Organization.\nTo the President's distinguished predecessor,\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, we convey our\ndeep and sincere appreciation for the determination and\ndynamism which he brought to bear on the work of the\nlast session. To his great credit, he laboured tirelessly to\nfind general agreement on the steps which must be taken\nto revitalize the United Nations. His exemplary leadership\nwill no doubt inspire us to fulfil the task at hand without\nundue delay.\nI also wish to acknowledge with appreciation the\nnotable contribution which our Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, has made to the reform process since\ntaking office. In keeping with the promise made to the\nAssembly, he has presented us with a set of interesting\nproposals for the reshaping of the Organization for\nservice in the twenty-first century. This comprehensive\nand constructive document requires our serious\nconsideration. I intend, therefore, in the time allocated to\nme, to make a few comments which I trust, despite their\nbrief and preliminary nature, will provide an indication of\nour thinking at the present time on the ways and means\nby which the Organization can be reformed.\nLet me first say that we share the vision which the\nSecretary-General has set forth for the future role of the\nUnited Nations. The Organization has proved its capacity\nfor preventing major wars and forging international\nconsensus on important aspects of international relations.\nIt is now poised to explore the many possibilities of\nmultilateralism. Increasingly, Member States, large and\nsmall, are seeing it in their interest to cooperate with the\nUnited Nations to maximize their ability to deal with\nseveral international concerns. There is increasing\nrecourse to its machinery in order to deal with such\nissues as development, the environment, disease, drug\ntrafficking and terrorism, to name just a few. Many of\nthe special agencies, such as the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the United Nations\nChildren's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations\nDevelopment Fund for Women (UNIFEM), and others\ntoo numerous to mention, cater to the needs of the most\nvulnerable sections of our population \u2014 the aged,\nwomen, children and our indigenous peoples.\nBuilt on the pillars of multilateralism, the United\nNations offers Member States a unique forum in which\nthey can come together for their common good. Its\ngrand design, elaborated some 50 years ago, remains by\nand large a useful chart for promoting international\ncomity. It is important, therefore, as we plan for a new\nera, that we hold fast to the founders' abiding vision\nlest we be dashed against the rocks of isolation and left\nto survive as best we can.\nThe effective translation of this vision into reality\nrequires strong and dynamic leadership. History has\nshown that, much too often, our most worthwhile\naspirations have been left unfulfilled because of\ninadequate political commitment and direction. States\noften see the world only through the prism of narrow\nself-interest and are blind to the virtues of concerted\naction. However, the challenges of our times, when no\nsingle nation, however rich and powerful, can hope to\nbe entirely self-reliant, require the highest level of\ninternational cooperation. For it is only by unity of\npurpose that we, the United Nations, can hope to\nachieve the aspirations so loftily declared in the\nCharter.\nWe are pleased to note that the Secretary-General,\nas the Organization's chief administrative officer, has\ndemonstrated vision and leadership in outlining his\nsuggestions for reform. Of particular satisfaction to us\nis the fact that in setting his priorities for the\nOrganization's future work he has accorded high\nimportance to its development activities. At a time\nwhen financial support is weak, it is imperative that\nappropriate strategies be developed to eradicate world\npoverty and restore economic and social prosperity,\nparticularly in small developing countries.\nWe therefore welcome the Secretary-General's\nintention to strengthen management capability within\nthe Secretariat to provide for full coordination of effort\nand for forward planning. We recognize the need for\neconomy, but hope that this will not be to the detriment\nof clear mandates of Member States and to the\nfundamental nature of the Organization. It would be a\ngrave pity if, in reducing costs, the United Nations were\nto be starved of substance.\nWe certainly approve of the idea initially\npropounded by the Government of Japan, and\nsubsequently endorsed by the G-7 countries, calling for\nadministrative savings to be channelled into\ndevelopment activities. This dividend, although\n15\n\n\npresumably limited in quantity, may be significant\nenough to serve as a catalyst for financing the\ndevelopment account that the Secretary-General proposes.\nLike the rest of the world, we welcome the generous gift\nof the Chairman of Turner Communications, who had\nparticipated in the 1994 World Hearings on Development\nand has now seen fit to come out in support of this\ncause. One can only hope that such philanthropy will be\nemulated by others in the private sector.\nThe recently concluded Agenda for Development,\ntogether with the joint strategy for development of the\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development\n(OECD) and the Development Assistance Committee\n(DAC), provides a basis for moving forward in the field\nof economic and social cooperation. Both documents\naccept the fact that while private investment flows have\nan important role to play in development, they are,\nbecause of their high selectivity and general\nunpredictability, insufficient to guarantee the development\nof small disadvantaged countries. For those countries \u2014\nand here I include my own \u2014 development assistance,\ndebt relief, capacity building and increased trade will\nremain crucial to our progress.\nAt the macroeconomic level, we will continue to\nlook to the United Nations to play a more central role in\nthe concertation of development policies. The Secretary-\nGeneral has said,\n\u201cThe promotion of economic and social\nprogress is one of the United Nations primary\nobjectives, enshrined in the Charter.\u201d (A/51/950,\npara. 68)\nIt cannot, consequently, be marginalized in the\ndevelopment process. Instead, it must be its principal\ngenerator.\nAccordingly, both its structure and operation must\nbe such as to provide \u201ca more integrated collaborative\napproach\u201d. (ibid., para. 72) Greater coordination of\ndevelopment activities, both at Headquarters and at the\nregional and local levels, is essential. As has been\nsuggested, the creation of a new development group and\na United Nations development-assistance framework\ncould possibly provide the necessary focus and direction.\nWe should be careful to ensure, however, that the\nstrengths of individual actors and agencies are not lost in\nany merger.\nWe fully support the proposal for a closer and\nmore cooperative relationship with the World Bank and\nother international financial institutions. Over time,\nthose bodies, although connected with the United\nNations, have moved away from their original mandates\nand developed quite independently of the Organization.\nIt is time that those bodies concentrate on human\ndevelopment as distinct from the means of\ndevelopment. We should therefore seek to bring them\ninto line with the main organs of the United Nations.\nTo that end, we encourage the Secretary-General to\ntake whatever steps are needed to achieve that\nharmonization of the development efforts. We will also\nhave to consider at some stage how to strengthen the\nrelationship of the World Trade Organization (WTO)\nwith the United Nations.\nAt the same time, we must complement these\nefforts by giving to the Assembly and the Economic\nand Social Council the direct and overarching\nresponsibility for leading the development enterprise. In\nthe past, those organs have been sadly left behind in the\ndevelopment process. Although useful as forums for\ndialogue and consensus building, they have failed to\nengage the key players. We should therefore strive to\ntransform them so that they can provide a stronger\npolitical impetus for development and ensure effective\nglobal macroeconomic management.\nWe hope that from this debate will come a clear\nindication of proposals and recommendations that are\nconsidered desirable and feasible. There will be some,\nof course, which, like the conversion of the Trusteeship\nCouncil into a forum for dealing with issues such as the\nglobal commons, will require further study. These\nproposals may be explored in informal working sessions\nof the Assembly and then taken up formally as a\npackage for approval and subsequent implementation.\nWith diligent cooperation on the part of all, there is no\nreason why such reforms cannot be agreed upon early\nin the new year.\nInstitutional tinkering alone, however, will not\nguarantee development. The most important dynamic\nremains the political will of States. The several\nstrategies that we have forged and the many\ndeclarations we have issued over the years remain\nlargely unfulfilled. It is no wonder that poverty is today\nthe single most important threat to global peace and\nsecurity.\n16\n\n\nThe reduction and eventual elimination of world\npoverty is an imperative which the United Nations cannot\nignore. At the special mid-term review of the United\nNations Conference on Environment and Development\n(UNCED), held in June of this year, we came close to\nagreeing to achieve this target by the year 2015. This\nyear, at the Kyoto session of the Conference of the\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change, and later, at the mid-term review of the\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, we will\nhave other opportunities for the further promotion of\nsustainable development. We should not fail to take\nadvantage of these in our continuing efforts to create a\npartnership for the benefit of all States.\nFor its part, my Government remains dedicated to\nthis end. In demonstration of our seriousness of purpose,\nwe have honoured the obligations that have been deemed\nnecessary to national development. As suggested by the\nWorld Bank in its publication entitled Partnership for\nSustainable Growth, we have sought to promote\n\u201cglobal governance in all its aspects, including\nensuring the rule of law, improving efficiency and\naccountability of the public sector and tackling\ncorruption as essential elements of a framework\nwithin which economies can prosper.\u201d\nWe have created a truly democratic society in which\ndevelopment is a fundamental human right. The fruit of\nour policies has been a constant annual growth rate of\nover 6 per cent. Today, all sectors of our society,\nincluding private enterprise and peoples' organizations,\nare fully involved in the development process and are\nfired by the optimistic confidence that, as a nation, we\nwill overcome the problems that currently beset us.\nIn a few weeks, our nation will conduct another\ndemocratic election, open again to the scrutiny of\ninternational observers. Out of this exercise will come a\nfresh popular determination to continue along the path\nleading to economic and social progress. To facilitate this\npursuit, the Government has prepared a national\ndevelopment strategy based on a fully participatory\neconomy. Involved in its preparation were experts from\nboth the public and the private sectors, who have\nprepared a draft text for wider public consultation and\napproval. In our view, this provides a useful policy\nframework which, by establishing needs and priorities,\ncan serve to mobilize assistance from the international\ncommunity, including donor Governments and\ninternational development agencies.\nHowever, as was clearly recognized by our late\nPresident, Mr. Cheddi Jagan, the hopes and aspirations\nof developing countries such as ours will not fully\nmaterialize over the long term until the international\nenvironment is made more congenial to our needs.\nAccordingly, he continuously advocated in his lifetime\nthe creation of a new global human order premised on\nsustainable economic development, equity and social\nand ecological justice, and based on the creation of a\nseparate global development fund for assistance to both\nthe North and the South. This new North-South\npartnership must be fashioned in a search for more\npositive and innovative ways to cope with the vagaries\nof globalization and liberalization, which are\nmarginalizing millions of people and even many\nnations.\nGuyana has openly embraced the 20/20 initiative\nadopted at the World Summit for Social Development\nas a means of sparking international cooperation for\ndevelopment. In addition, we have called for agreement\non some forms of international taxation, which, like\nnational revenue at the country level, would provide the\nfunding necessary to promote global development. Thus\nfar, some developed countries have been reluctant to\ncontemplate such innovative means of resource\nmobilization. But in circumstances of ever increasing\ninternational obligations and decreasing development\nassistance, where will the necessary financing come\nfrom? The answer to this question is key to the future\nof the United Nations, for unless the Organization is\nendowed with predictable and adequate resources, it\nwill be incapable of satisfying the many requirements\nplaced upon it by Member States.\nIn my delegation's view, the time has come to deal\nwith this issue. The Economic and Social Council has\nbroached the question in recent high-level discussions,\nbut we are a long way from testing the feasibility of the\nmany ideas that have been advanced to find new and\nadditional ways of financing multilateralism. Initial\nstudies done by the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) and other development agencies\nhave revealed that some of the mechanisms proposed\nare indeed feasible. Why, then, are some States\nunwilling to entertain any meaningful discussion of\ntheir introduction? Is it that they are afraid of losing\ncontrol of the United Nations? Or are they not serious\n17\n\n\nabout their proclaimed adherence to the concept of the\ninterdependence of States?\nAssuring the financial stability of this Organization\nmust be seen as essential not only to development but to\npeace. Invariably, instability and conflict within and\namong States are due in great measure to economic and\nsocial instability leading to intense competition for\nlimited resources. An investment in development must\ntherefore be seen as an investment in preventive\ndiplomacy and in the building of peace.\nAdmittedly, these are costly tasks, but there can be\nno doubt that the expenditure involved is much less than\nthat resulting from conflict. The international community\nshould therefore be prepared to adequately fund activities\nin this field to enhance the prospects of their success.\nApart from financial support, there is also a need for\nmore competent supervision by the Security Council. No\nreform of the United Nations will be complete without\nreform of the Council, which is the organ primarily\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace\nand security. Unfortunately, despite the most intensive\nsearch, we are yet to find general agreement on the basis\nfor restructuring that important body. We must persevere,\nhowever, in the fulfilment of our mandate to devise a\nmore effective, open and representative Council fully\ncapable of performing the functions assigned to it under\nthe Charter.\nGuyana, as a member of the Non-Aligned\nMovement, believes that this aim can best be served by\nan appropriate expansion in the non-permanent category.\nHowever, in a spirit of compromise, we are prepared to\ncontemplate enlargement also in the permanent category,\nproviding a balance can be found between developed-\nand developing-country representation and agreement\nreached on the limitation of the use of the veto and on\nthe concept of periodic review. We are ready to continue\nour work in this direction until a solution is found.\nMeanwhile, we are happy to see the progress being\nmade towards the creation of an international criminal\ncourt, which will be able to deal effectively with several\ncrimes against humanity.\nLast, but by no means least, we wish to see in the\ncampaign for peace more active interest and participation\nby this Assembly in the disarmament process, so that the\nweapons of war may be converted into tools of\ndevelopment. Although we have yet to see any significant\npeace dividend from the ending of the cold war, we\nbelieve that a reduction in arms expenditures on both\nnuclear and conventional weapons can only benefit the\nwelfare of all peoples. The Assembly must therefore\nencourage the Committee on Disarmament to intensify\nits efforts in this field and must itself take whatever\naction it deems necessary to prompt the conversion\nfrom arms production to more peaceful pursuits.\nDisarmament is too important an issue to be left to the\nmajor military Powers. The international community as\na whole must therefore exert continuing pressure on the\nprocess to achieve the desired results.\nAt the same time, we must intensify the\nOrganization's role in bringing peace to those countries\nand regions of the world where conflict or the threat of\nconflict persists. Upheavals in the Great Lakes region\nof Africa and the tenuous situation in places such as\nAfghanistan and Bosnia and Herzegovina still defy\nresolution.\nIn the Middle East, the peace process seems to\nhave atrophied. The Palestinian problem and the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict continue to hamper the progress of that\nentire area. In Cyprus, where tensions are restrained\nonly by the continued presence of United Nations\ntroops, the danger of violence is ever present. On the\nKorean Peninsula, peaceful reunification is still an\nelusive goal. The international community has no\nchoice but to do whatever it can to help the parties\ninvolved in conflict everywhere to work peacefully\ntowards an amicable settlement of their particular\ndisputes.\nThe world wants peace and development. It also\nwants the United Nations to help in the achievement of\nthese goals. Governments have a duty to heed these\nsentiments and to increase their support of the\nOrganization.\nThe United Nations itself must in turn reach out to\nbenefit from the valuable reservoir of goodwill which\nexists towards it among the peoples of the world.\nPublic information is key to securing widespread\nsupport for its activities and to expanding its role in\ninternational affairs. We therefore urge that the\ndissemination capacity of the Department of Public\nInformation be enhanced in developed countries, where\nawareness of the Organization's potential is less than it\nshould be.\n18\n\n\nAs we approach the major milestone marking the\nstart of the third millennium, we must have a clear vision\nof what we want the United Nations to be and of what\nwe want it to do. Only with such clarity can we be sure\nthat the reform process will result in a change for the\nbetter. It is therefore my delegation's hope that this\ngeneral debate will engender a common sense of purpose\namong its Members and a willingness on their part to\npress forward in the revitalization of an Organization\nwhich is so necessary to both our survival and our\ndevelopment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffBefore delivering the message of the Government of\nRwanda to the General Assembly, allow me to follow the\nHeads of State and fellow Ministers who have spoken from\nthis rostrum and express to the President our very sincere\ncongratulations on his outstanding election. We also pay a\nwell-deserved tribute to his eminent predecessor, who\ndisplayed devotion, skill and readiness to serve during the\nlast session.\nOur warmest and fraternal congratulations also go to\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for whom this\nsession of the General Assembly is his first in that office.\nAt the fiftieth anniversary session of the United\nNations we took the opportunity to express loudly and\nclearly our views with regard to the essential reforms to be\ncarried out within the United Nations. We welcome the\nproposals made by the Secretary-General, and we assure\nhim of our support and cooperation. We also made\nproposals on Security Council reform. We will continue to\nmake our contribution and lend our support to the collective\nefforts aimed at ensuring greater democracy in the Council.\nThe Government of Rwanda also wishes to take this\nopportunity to express its great satisfaction at the\nappointment of Mrs. Mary Robinson as United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. We assure both her\nand the Secretary-General of our assistance and\ncooperation.\nAt this session the Government of Rwanda wishes to\nmake its modest contribution to our consideration of some\nmatters of concern both to Africa and to the entire\ninternational community. These primarily relate to the\ndifficulties encountered in the process of bringing to life a\nnew Africa and problems related to the prevention,\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts in Africa. We shall\nalso offer some thoughts on how our peoples may enjoy a\nrelatively smooth passage into the next millennium. We will\nconclude with an appeal for international solidarity for\nRwanda and the Rwandan people.\nThe hope of the peoples of Africa and the third\nworld is first of all for an understanding of their real\nproblems, and today that understanding must be a priority.\nMuch of the international community supports the new\npolitical order in Africa and the new African leadership\nand leaders who wish to create new realities for a new\nAfrica. We had the opportunity and pleasure, at the\nspecial meeting of the Security Council on Africa held on\n25 September under the presidency of the Secretary of\nState of the United States, of hearing comments in\nsupport of the new African leadership. We stand firmly\ntogether. The others, those who do not trust in Africa and\nthe Africans, who attempt to hinder our continent\u2019s efforts\nto free itself from neocolonialism and dictatorships, who\nare today trying to discredit and undermine our leaders at\nany cost, they are the ones we will obviously be forced to\ndeal with when we come to them.\nI should like now to speak of the problems of\nconflict prevention and conflict resolution in Africa and\nother third world countries. Again, we extend our\nwarmest thanks to the Security Council for having taken\nthe positive initiative of convening a ministerial-level\nmeeting on Africa on 25 September.\nOur contribution, beyond general considerations and\nsome specific cases, will focus primarily on identifying\nthe underlying causes of conflicts in Africa, conflicts\nwhich in turn create the economic and political recessions\nof which we in our continent \u2014 and elsewhere in certain\nthird world countries as well \u2014 are aware on almost a\ndaily basis.\nAfrica and the third world in general are suffering\nfrom various ills, principal among which are ignorance,\npoverty, bad political leadership, coups d\u2019\u00e9tat and foreign\nintervention. Those are the ills that have eaten away at\nAfrica, continue to eat away at it and are the sources of\nevery conflict on our continent.\nIgnorance, it is said, is the root of all evils. Poverty\nis the cause of all misfortune. What United Nations\nprogramme will combat ignorance and poverty in Africa\nand the countries of the third world, and when will these\ntwo terrible ills that ravage our continent be cured?\nBad political leadership in Africa has led many\ncountries to ruin and even led to the first genocide on the\nAfrican continent, which occurred in Rwanda from April\nto July 1994. The United Nations was present with a\nmilitary force of 2,500 men, who packed up and left,\nabandoning the Rwandan people to the mercy of the\n26\n\n\nInterahamwe militiamen of the erstwhile single party and\narmed forces of the day. The planning and carrying out of\nthe genocide was the ignoble act of a bad political\nleadership that viewed the ignorance and poverty of the\npeoples of Rwanda \u2014 and, consequently, of the peoples of\nAfrica and the third world \u2014 as a political asset to\nconsolidate and perpetuate its dictatorship in power or to\nusurp power.\nWe hope that the United Nations will support the new\npolitical order in Africa and its new leadership, and that it\nwill oppose any manoeuvre aimed at using United Nations\nstructures to nip in the bud the new political order that is\nemerging on our continent.\nThe conflicts of which we are all aware in Africa\ntoday are the bitter fruit of the famous so-called Africa of\nthe Generals that emerged in the mid-1960s. Those coups\nd\u2019\u00e9tat sapped Africa with all their attendant tragedies, of\nwhich all here are only too keenly aware. What are our\nstrategies for fighting coups d\u2019\u00e9tat in Africa today? What\nare the strategies of the United Nations for eradicating this\nscourge, whose effects are realized by its creators only\nwhen they themselves fall victim to it?\nAll of the coups d\u2019\u00e9tat in Africa since 1965, whose\nrotten fruits we are harvesting today, were fomented by\ncertain Western capitals in their own interests and to the\ndetriment of the African people. Today, unfortunately,\nforeign manipulation is continuing in Africa, creating a new\ncycle of coups d\u2019\u00e9tat in Africa.\nWe urge the United Nations resolutely to attack the\nfive scourges I have just named, which still infect Africa\nand are the source of all the conflicts on our continent.\nThese problems exist and we are familiar with them. Let us\nnot make them taboo \u2014 let us talk about them within this\nprestigious building; let us talk about them in the Security\nCouncil. That, perhaps, would mark the beginning of\nimproved conflict prevention and resolution in Africa.\nWe cannot close this chapter on African conflicts\nwithout referring specifically to some that worry us more\nthan others. I am referring in particular to the Central\nAfrican Republic, where we feel the United Nations should\nbe on its toes and assist a country in which the keepers of\nthe old order and their opportunistic acolytes are using\nviolence against an elected Government. I am also referring\nto Congo (Brazzaville), where precisely the same scenario\nas in the Central African Republic is being played out on\na scale far larger than in the latter country.\nIn our humble opinion, the United Nations should\nalso send a clear and unambiguous message to the\nComorians of the island of Anjouan that the Comoros is\na State Member of the United Nations and that its unity\nand integrity are not negotiable. We ask the parties\nconcerned to work with the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) to find an appropriate solution to their problem.\nWestern Sahara strikes a strong note of hope in the\narea of decolonization. We welcome and encourage the\ndue implementation of the agreements that have just been\nsigned between the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic\nand the Kingdom of Morocco to promote the process of\nself-determination and independence for the Saharan\npeople.\nIn Somalia, the Government of the Rwandese\nRepublic urges all the parties to the conflict to promote\ndialogue under the aegis of the OAU and the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development.\nTwo years from the advent of the new millennium,\nwe all have the ultimate duty of leading our peoples to\nthe year 2000 without setback or fear of the unknown,\nunlike the people of the year 997 as they approached the\neve of the second millennium.\nThe twentieth century, leading into the awaited third\nmillennium, has deeded to us the two most horrendous\ngenocides in the history of humanity: the genocide of the\nJews during the Second World War and the genocide of\nthe Rwandans in 1994. Will we cross the threshold of the\nthird millennium with the same racist graffiti covering the\nwalls of our cities and airport corridors? Will those with\nuneasy consciences continue forever to play dumb with\nregard to the Rwandan genocide, the very first in the\nhistory of our continent? Will religious fundamentalism\nthrive at the cost of human lives?\nExtreme selfishness, despair, suicide, racism, crime,\nterrorism, drugs, paedophilia, battered women, rape: Are\nwe going to bring all this luggage with us into the third\nmillennium? What are we doing now? What are our\nstrategies to eradicate all these evils? Resignation?\nFatalism? Will the third millennium hold anything to\nshock us?\nWe all claim to govern on behalf of our respective\npeoples. What actions are we undertaking today to ensure\nthat they advance calmly, smoothly, without panic or\nanxiety into the year 2000? If we do nothing, how will\nwe explain it to them on the eve of 1 January 2000 or on\n27\n\n\nthe first day of the year 2000? Will we use the language of\ncynicism, pain, realism, politics, diplomacy or ritual \u2014 in\njust enough to get them off our backs and hustle them\nalong into the year 2000 as into a lifeboat?\nWhat strategies do the United Nations and its\nagencies, present throughout Africa and other countries of\nthe third world, have to help the Governments and peoples\nthat must confront the anxieties of passing from one\ncentury to another, one millennium to another? In my\ncountry, Rwanda, I see no sign of any such strategy, while\nthe country is gripped by the many traumas born from the\ntearing, or rather the shredding, of the social fabric by the\ngenocide of 1994. When the traumas of genocide are\ncomplemented by millennial anxieties, what is to become\nof such a people if it is not helped by increased\ninternational solidarity?\nI have seen no or almost no sign of such solidarity in\nall my travels, no hint of such a project. Apparently, no one\nis concerned. And yet, we are only 26 months from 1\nJanuary 2000. Why such indifference from countries and\nfrom the United Nations? Should not our concerns be those\nof the peoples on whose behalf we govern? We should be\none step ahead and thereby allay them.\nBefore closing, I wish to appeal to the General\nAssembly that the United Nations adopt a mini-Marshall\nPlan for the moral and physical rehabilitation and\nreconstruction of the first African country to have fallen\nvictim to the catastrophe of genocide: Rwanda. This mini-\nMarshall Plan for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of\npost-genocide Rwanda was drafted by Ambassador\nSahnoun, Special Representative for the Great Lakes region\nof the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the\nOAU, at the request of the Rwandan Government of\nNational Unity.\nWe also make a ringing appeal to the United Nations\nand the entire international community to provide Rwanda\nwith substantial assistance, as it has received since\nNovember 1996 more than 1.4 million repatriated\npersons \u2014 one fifth of its population \u2014 who had fled to\nthe former Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, Tanzania and Burundi. Following this mass return\nof refugees, famine has today struck heavily in over four of\nour provinces. For the victims of this famine, we request\nemergency food relief and development assistance for every\nsector of national life \u2014 agriculture, health, education, the\nsocial and socio-economic reintegration of the repatriated,\nthe survivors of genocide, justice and the rehabilitation and\nreconstruction of basic infrastructures, including those for\nwater, electricity and roads.\nAs for the social and socio-economic reintegration of\nthe repatriated, since November 1996 the Rwandan\nGovernment has been sending into the field teams led by\ntwo Ministers for each province and composed of other\nministers, members of Parliament and high-level\nadministrators. These field missions aim at supporting the\nlocal administrative authorities in their tasks of receiving\nand reintegrating the repatriates. The exercise has gone\nwell and is still being successfully pursued.\nAt the communal and municipal level, we have also\ncreated reception committees composed of local\nauthorities and members of the United Nations\nCommission on Human Rights.\nUnfortunately, some troublemakers have filtered in\nwith the 1.4 million refugees who have recently returned\nto Rwanda. Since February 1997, these fugitives have\nbeen committing murders among the civilian population.\nThey have primarily targeted the survivors of genocide,\nin order to do away with anyone who might be a witness\nin a court of law, and local authorities who are devoted\nto the cause of national unity and reconciliation.\nThe Rwandan Government has taken the necessary\nmeasures to ensure the safety of the people in the north\nof the country, which has been the site of these murders.\nAgain, results in this area have also been quite\nsatisfactory.\nIn fact, a month ago I organized a meeting of the\nentire diplomatic and consular community at Ruhengeri,\none of the provinces in the north of the country. After\nthat meeting the diplomats had the opportunity to visit\nany areas of Ruhengeri they chose.\nLikewise, before I came to New York for the\nGeneral Assembly, Mr. Pasteur Bizimungu, President of\nthe Republic of Rwanda, headed a meeting of ministers\nat Gisenyi, one of the country\u2019s three northern provinces.\nAfter the meeting the President of the Republic and the\nmembers of the Government went into the field for three\ndays. They visited and spoke with people from all sectors\nof the population, including peasants on communes and\nin municipalities and students and State officials who had\nbeen repatriated and who were participating in orientation\nseminars on the positive aspects of national unity,\ntolerance, reconciliation, respect for human life and\n28\n\n\nsolidarity. They also spoke with local authorities who are\nworking to train our people.\nThe Government of Rwanda needs support for this\nexercise. It needs the assistance of the international\ncommunity.\nBefore concluding, we would like to say from this\nlofty rostrum that we welcome the progress made towards\nresolving the misunderstanding on the question of the\nInternational Commission of Inquiry sent to the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, as the Minister for\nForeign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nannounced at his press conference yesterday afternoon.\nThe Rwandan Government therefore encourages\nthose specifically involved in this matter \u2014 namely, the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, the United\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the\nGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2014\nto work together to put an end to this problem. They have\nour confidence and support.\nIn order to support the efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral, the High Commissioner for Refugees and the\nGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nand to enlighten better the international community about\nthe refugee problem in eastern Zaire, the Rwandan\nGovernment calls on the United Nations to publish and\ncirculate as a document of the Security Council the report\nof the International Commission of Inquiry on the\ntrafficking in and distribution of weapons in refugee\ncamps in eastern Zaire.\nThe United Nations International Commission of\nInquiry was established under Security Council resolution\n1013 (1995) of 7 September 1995. The Commission\nsubmitted its report, duly signed by its members, one year\nlater, on 28 October 1996. The embargo on this report,\nwhich has hindered its publication, should be lifted\nimmediately in order to facilitate everyone\u2019s efforts."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like\nat the outset to extend my warmest compliments to His\nExcellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, Foreign Minister of\nUkraine, on his assumption last week of the presidency of\nthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly. Japan\nwill cooperate closely with him for the success of this\nsession.\nI should also like to pay sincere tribute to His\nExcellency Mr. Razali Ismail, who, as President of the\nfifty-first session of the General Assembly, demonstrated\nactive initiative for strengthening the functions of the\nUnited Nations through reform. Japan earnestly hopes that\nAmbassador Razali will continue to contribute his views\nfor the advancement of United Nations reform.\n5\n\n\nThis session of the General Assembly will be an\n\u201cAssembly for reform\u201d. I say this because the current\nsession is of unprecedented importance in terms of realizing\nthe reform of the United Nations.\nI should like to recall what the purpose of United\nNations reform is. The purpose of reforming the United\nNations is, I believe, to strengthen its functions to further\nenable it to fully accomplish its tasks. As a member of the\nSecurity Council, Japan is deeply aware that since the end\nof the Cold War grave problems of conflicts and poverty\nhave emerged, most frequently and acutely in Africa. By\nreforming the United Nations, the international community\nwill be better able to solve the problems of peoples in all\nparts of the world who are suffering due to conflicts and\npoverty, problems which are especially glaring in Africa.\nWe must begin immediately to strengthen the United\nNations in this respect and continue our efforts into the\nfuture. Japan intends to play the role which is expected of\nit in the strengthened United Nations.\nI regard highly the strong initiatives of the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, in promoting reform. In\nparticular, his proposals for United Nations reform\nannounced in March and July of this year are intended to\nenhance the coherence and effectiveness of United Nations\nactivities by strengthening the leadership of the Secretary-\nGeneral as well as the coordination function in each field,\nincluding development and humanitarian affairs; as such,\nthey have Japan\u2019s basic support. We earnestly hope that the\nreform of the United Nations as a whole will gather\nmomentum through these proposals.\nIf the United Nations is unable to reform itself to meet\nthe demands of the coming era, but simply engages in an\naimless repetition of detailed arguments in which each\nMember State pursues its own interests, the confidence of\nthe international community in the Organization will be\nseverely undermined. We must be aware that at this\nmoment we are standing at a crucial crossroads. It is the\nvery moment at which we must summon the political will\nto decide on the outlines of United Nations reform.\nJapan believes that each Member State should, in a\nspirit of statesmanship, engage in substantive negotiations,\nnot from the viewpoint of pursuing its own parochial\ninterests but from the genuinely broad perspective of\nmaximizing benefits to the international community as a\nwhole.\nJapan believes that reforms relating to the Security\nCouncil, finance and development are the three pillars of\nUnited Nations reform. Today, the Security Council is\nattentive to the economic and social aspects of the\nconflicts it seeks to resolve. Moreover, in order to\nestablish a sound financial basis, it is necessary that all\nthe activities of the United Nations, including those in the\nfields of development and peacekeeping, be rendered\nmore effective. Serious efforts in the area of development\nare also important for ensuring international peace and\nsecurity. It is therefore essential that reform in these three\nareas be achieved as a whole in a balanced manner in\norder for the United Nations, the sole universal\norganization, to respond appropriately to the dramatically\nchanging context of the international community and to\nbe better able to discharge its functions.\nNow I would like to reiterate Japan\u2019s views on some\nof the most important points regarding the United Nations\nreform effort.\nFirst, the reform of the Security Council.\nNeedless to say, the international community is\nvastly different today from what it was 51 years ago,\nwhen the United Nations was founded. Broadly speaking,\nthis is reflected in the following two ways.\nFirst, in addition to those States that were originally\nexpected to assume primary responsibility for\ninternational peace and security, other States have newly\nemerged with the capacity and the willingness to play a\nglobal role. Secondly, many States have in the meantime\nbecome independent, and today they represent a majority\nin the international community, in which they have\nbecome important players.\nParticularly in the wake of the cold war, the Security\nCouncil is expected to play an even greater role in the\narea of international peace and security. To meet such\nexpectations, it is essential that it be reorganized to adapt\nto these two changes, thereby enhancing its legitimacy\nand effectiveness. This is the very essence of Security\nCouncil reform. It is with such a reformed and\nstrengthened Security Council that effective measures to\nresolve, for example, the frequent conflicts in regions\nsuch as Africa become possible.\nIt is from this perspective that many States,\nincluding my own, are advocating the expansion of both\npermanent and non-permanent membership. If the reform\nwere to result in an expansion of only the non-permanent\nmembership, the Council\u2019s legitimacy and effectiveness\n6\n\n\nwould not be enhanced and genuine reform to adapt to the\nchanging times would not have been accomplished.\nThis year, under the leadership of former General\nAssembly President Razali, discussions on Security Council\nreform have gained greater momentum than ever before.\nJapan strongly urges that we seize this opportunity to\ndecide on at least a framework for Security Council reform\nand reach an agreement on an outline for the realization of\nconcrete reform by the end of the year. I should like to\nreiterate that Japan, with the endorsement of many\ncountries, is prepared to discharge its responsibilities as a\npermanent member of the Security Council in accordance\nwith its basic philosophy of the non-resort to the use of\nforce, prohibited by its Constitution.\nI shall touch next on financial reform. Today a further\nretrenchment by the United Nations in the area of finance\nis required, and Japan regards highly the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s efforts towards this end. The Government of\nJapan is itself currently pursuing drastic reform of its\nfinancial structure, with the aim of bringing its financial\ndeficit below 3 per cent of gross domestic product by the\nyear 2003. It is also essential for the United Nations to\nsecure a solid financial basis for itself. In this regard, I\nwould emphasize again that it is the obligation of Member\nStates to pay their assessed contributions in full, and that\nMember States in arrears should make every effort to\neliminate them.\nIt goes without saying that the expenses of the\nOrganization must be apportioned more equitably. As\nregards the basis for calculating the scale of assessments,\nJapan has advocated adopting the concept of \u201cresponsibility\nto pay\u201d to complement the present method, which is based\non the principle of \u201ccapacity to pay\u201d. Japan\u2019s assessment is\nabout to reach that of the United States, and it is already\nalmost as great as the assessments of the other four\npermanent members combined. If Japan\u2019s assessment were\nto increase further out of proportion, with reform of the\nSecurity Council not yet realized, I must say there would be\na problem with respect to the fairness of such a situation.\nJapan strongly hopes that the financial reform of the United\nNations will proceed together with reforms in other areas as\na whole in a balanced manner, and that agreement on an\nequitable scale of assessments can be achieved.\nThe third point relates to reform in the area of\ndevelopment. Development and peace are, so to speak, two\nsides of the same coin. Without development, the causes of\nconflicts will not be eliminated, and without peace the\nconditions for development will not be met. Under its\npresent Constitution, Japan has continued to attach great\nimportance to contributing to international peace through\nits active involvement in development issues and\nhumanitarian assistance efforts. Involvement in\ndevelopment issues is a matter of priority for my country,\nand its commitment to the development of developing\ncountries remains unchanged.\nJapan has been insisting that a \u201cnew development\nstrategy\u201d, based on a genuine partnership between\ndeveloped and developing countries, is particularly\nnecessary in this post-cold-war era. Consideration of the\nAgenda for Development has concluded recently. We\nbelieve it is important that the new philosophy, based on\nthe ownership of developing countries and on a genuine\npartnership, be widely shared in the United Nations.\nTowards this end, in July of this year Japan held the\nOkinawa Conference on Development, and this month co-\nhosted with the Kingdom of the Netherlands the\nConference on the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development/Development Assistance\nCommittee (OECD/DAC) Strategy \u201cShaping the Twenty-\nfirst Century: The Contribution of Development\nCooperation\u201d. We are thus exploring ways of promoting\nand realizing this strategy. Through such efforts by Japan,\nit is becoming widely recognized that South-South\ncooperation, fortified with the new dimension of\ntriangular cooperation, is an important means of\npromoting this strategy.\nWe regard the Secretary-General\u2019s proposals to\nestablish a United Nations development group and to\nconsolidate United Nations offices at the country level to\nbe very worthwhile in terms of increasing efficiency.\nUnited Nations reform must not be a euphemism for\nbudget-cutting. From this point of view, Japan, with the\nsupport of many States, has been advocating the idea of\nreinvesting in development programmes the savings that\naccrue from reforms. We urge that this proposal, which\nis reflected in the Secretary-General\u2019s reform plan, be\nquickly implemented. In addition, Japan hopes that the\nyear 2001 will be designated as the International Year of\nVolunteers in order to encourage more active participation\nin United Nations activities at the grass-roots level.\nSetting development on track and eradicating poverty\nin Africa are necessary for the fundamental solution of\nthe conflicts that frequently occur in that region. Bearing\nthis in mind, Japan has been focusing its efforts on\nAfrican development issues. At Japan\u2019s initiative, plans\nare under way to hold the second Tokyo International\nConference on African Development (TICAD II) at the\n7\n\n\nministerial level next year in Tokyo, following a\npreparatory meeting, also in Tokyo, at the senior-official\nlevel in November of this year. We would like to ask the\nStates concerned to cooperate for the success of these\nconferences and for the achievement of substantive progress\nin promoting African development.\nEver since becoming a Member in 1956, Japan has\nconsistently pursued a foreign policy that attaches\nimportance to the United Nations. Since January of this\nyear, thanks to the support of many countries, Japan has\nbeen serving its eighth term as a non-permanent member of\nthe Security Council. It has been actively cooperating in\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations and efforts for the\nprevention and settlement of regional conflicts. Next\nJanuary, Japan will convene the International Conference on\nPreventive Strategy, which Prime Minister Ryutaro\nHashimoto proposed at the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly of the United Nations. We anticipate that\nconcrete proposals will be made at that conference as to\nhow cooperation between the United Nations and the\nOrganization of African Unity, and the strengthening of the\nfunctions of the United Nations through such measures as\nreform of the Security Council, can contribute to the\nprevention and early resolution of conflicts in Africa. I am\nalso pleased to announce that next March Japan plans to\nconvene in Tokyo an international conference on the\npresent situation and future prospects of United Nations\npeacekeeping operations.\nJapan is also hosting the third session of the\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change in Kyoto this December to\ndecide on international measures to prevent global warming\nto be taken after the year 2000. Global warming is a critical\nissue, with implications for the future of humankind, and its\nsolution will require the efforts of every country, including\ndeveloping countries. Japan is sparing no effort to ensure\nthe success of this conference and its adoption of a protocol\nthat is meaningful, realistic and equitable, and I would\nearnestly ask for the cooperation of all participating\ncountries.\nNext year we shall observe the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I expect the\nUnited Nations to further strengthen its role in the areas of\nhuman rights and refugee and humanitarian assistance.\nJapan will also continue to contribute actively in these\nareas.\nIn addition, disarmament efforts, as well as the regime\nfor the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\nmust be further strengthened for the sake of world peace\nand stability. Japan will also emphasize at this session the\nimportance of steady and cumulative efforts to take\nrealistic nuclear disarmament measures, aiming for a\nworld free of nuclear weapons. We will also participate\nactively in discussions on anti-personnel landmines, the\nreview of the United Nations Register of Conventional\nArms and the question of small arms.\nThe twenty-first century will arrive in less than four\nyears. In order to make the next century brighter, the\nUnited Nations should reform itself to be ready for the\nnew era. If it is to do so, an agreement on the outline of\nUnited Nations reform must be reached this year. Let us\njoin forces to ensure that the world in the twenty-first\ncentury is stable and prosperous. This will require that we\ngreet the twenty-first century with United Nations reforms\nachieved.\nI should like to conclude my statement by stressing\nthe profound importance of strengthening the United\nNations \u2014 the only universal international Organization.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI join previous speakers in\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election to the presidency\nof the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. My\ndelegation is satisfied that your vast experience in\ninternational affairs and your proven diplomatic skills will\nguide the work of this session to a successful conclusion.\nI wish to assure you of my delegation\u2019s full support and\ncooperation in the execution of the duties of your office.\nI also wish to express my delegation\u2019s gratitude and\ncongratulations to your predecessor, Ambassador Razali\nIsmail of Malaysia, who presided over our Assembly during\nthe fifty-first session with great vigour, skill and resolve.\nHaving had the honour of serving as a Vice-President of\nthat session, I am particularly appreciative of his\nnoteworthy contributions.\nThis is my first opportunity in this Assembly to\naddress and congratulate our new Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan. He is, of course, no stranger to any of us,\nhaving faithfully served this Organization for so many\nyears. We are confident that he has the vision, ability and\ndetermination to lead the United Nations as it prepares to\nmeet the challenges of the new millennium. I wish to assure\nthe Secretary-General of the continued support and\ncooperation of the Government of the Commonwealth of\nthe Bahamas.\nOn behalf of the Government and people of the\nBahamas, I also wish to pay tribute to our former\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. The\nBahamas particularly wishes to recall and salute his tireless\nefforts in seeking to restore financial stability to our\nOrganization.\nToday, I reiterate the Bahamas\u2019 solemn pledge that as\nwe lead our nation into a new millennium the primary\nfocus of our efforts will be directed towards improving the\ndelivery of health care, education and skills training, a\nreduction in the level of serious crime and unemployment,\nand the eradication of poverty and poor housing. We are\ncommitted to achieving the full empowerment of women\nand equality among the sexes as we work toward the\nevolution of a society in which our children will live with\nhope, a society where there is opportunity for all, where\nthere is respect for human rights, fundamental values and\nthe rule of law.\nOur efforts on behalf of the Bahamian people also\nrepresent our contribution towards the collective efforts\nwhich Member States of the United Nations must make\nto ensure a safe, stable and productive global society so\nthat progress, peace and development can be achieved for\nall the people represented here. We are therefore\ncommitted to assisting in the much needed reform of this\nworld body, so as to enable us to achieve these goals.\nOne of the greatest threats to quality of life and to\nproductive development worldwide is criminal behaviour.\nMy Government has set as one of its highest priorities the\ncomprehensive reduction and prevention of crime, in all\nits forms, including drug-trafficking, money-laundering\nand illegal trafficking in firearms, and, indeed, in human\nbeings. Those who engage in such menacing activities\nrespect no borders. We therefore implore all Member\nStates, irrespective of size or might, to recognize that the\nmost effective means of reducing crime at the national\nand international levels is through joint and collaborative\nefforts.\nThe Government of the Bahamas supports the\nstrengthening of the international legal order against\ncrime. We also hope that the special session on the\nquestion of drugs in 1998 will provide new impetus and\nresolve to combat this particular menace to all of our\nsocieties.\nMy Government reiterates its call to urgently address\nthe growing problem of the traffic in small arms. The\nBahamas, neither a manufacturer nor a vendor of arms,\nurges those countries involved in the production and sale\nof arms to impose stringent control measures and provide\nassistance to vulnerable States to reduce the threat of the\ntraffic in arms.\nAnother concern of the world\u2019s nations is the\nprotection of the environment. The Bahamas recognizes\nand appreciates that conservation and enhancement of the\nenvironment are critically important to the well-being of\nour people, and especially that of future generations.\nConsequently, our national planning process incorporates\ncommunity environmental education and the regular\nmonitoring and enforcement of laws for the protection of\nnatural resources and the conservation of habitats. Indeed,\nduring the course of this year, the Government of the\nBahamas enacted legislation to protect our physical\nlandscape and prevent the destruction of certain\n13\n\n\nindigenous trees. The expansion of green and open spaces\nfor the benefit of the general population is another key\npillar in our environmental policy.\nTourism is the leading industry in the Bahamas and\nthe fastest growing industry in the world. We are all aware,\nhowever, that the development of tourism does not always\ntake place in harmony with environmental protection and\nconservation. Mindful of this fact, the Bahamas, along with\nits regional partners, seeks to develop strategies, policies\nand procedures which will ensure that the continued\ndevelopment of the industry is consistent with standards of\nenvironmental sustainability. In this vein, the Caribbean\nCommunity has adopted a regional position against the\ntransportation of hazardous and radioactive substances\nthrough the Caribbean Sea, a concern previously voiced in\nthis forum.\nWhile the concept of sustainable development remains\nsubject to further definition, my Government believes that\npoverty reduction and social development can and must be\nachieved in concert with environmental integrity, economic\nstability and good health. The proper integration of\ndeveloping economies into the rapidly advancing\nglobalization of world trade will, we believe, mark the\nmeasure of our success in these areas. Regrettably,\ndevelopments over the past decade have not always met\nexpectations.\nIn spite of the technological revolution of the last\ndecade and the rapid increase in worldwide commerce, the\nbenefits of the globalization of the world\u2019s economy have\nnot been evenly distributed. Developing countries continue\nto be marginalized even as the world\u2019s market economy\ngrows at an extraordinary pace.\nGlobalization can offer great opportunities, but only if\nit is managed carefully and with more concern for equity,\nmorality and indeed compassion. An enabling environment\nmust be created for all to take full advantage of the new\nopportunities created by globalization.\nThe peculiar vulnerability of small islands \u2014 their\nsusceptibility to natural disasters, their economy\u2019s\ndependence on primary products, their small human and\nmaterial resource base \u2014 means that small island States\nhave much more at stake in achieving sustainable\ndevelopment. The Bahamas, therefore, attaches great\nimportance to the 1999 review of the Barbados Programme\nof Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States, and calls for the mobilization of external\nresources for its further implementation. We are also\npleased to note that consideration is being given by the\nUnited Nations to the possible development of a\nvulnerability index. We welcome the proposed convening\nof an expert group meeting later this year to review\nvarious proposals, and look forward to the completion of\nthe technical study now in progress.\nThe development of a mechanism such as the\nvulnerability index will help to alleviate a concern which\nthe Bahamas has repeatedly expressed in this assembly\nregarding the persistent use of per capita gross national\nproduct as the major measurement of wealth. It is our\nview that this criterion is an inadequate measurement of\ndevelopment and is often inconsistent with the principles\nof equity.\nThe vulnerability of small island States is painfully\ndemonstrated in the unfolding natural disaster on the\nCaribbean island of Montserrat, where volcanic activity\nhas forever changed the physical, sociological and\npsychological landscape. Indeed, the viability of the island\nto provide a base for the livelihood and development of\nthe people of Montserrat is yet to be determined. We, the\nGovernment and people of the Bahamas, wish to express\nour solidarity with, and pledge our continued support to,\nthe people of Montserrat during this particularly difficult\ntime.\nWe are similarly conscious of the fact that natural\ndisasters affect virtually all the Member States of this\nOrganization, large and small, developed and developing.\nIn recent times, typhoons in South-East Asia, floods in\nEastern and Central Europe and in the central states and\nprovinces of the United States and Canada, and\nearthquakes in South America, and most recently in Italy\nand Indonesia, have wreaked untold suffering on millions\nof people.\nAs we look towards the twenty-first century, we\nmust assess how best this Organization can prepare itself\nduring the next three years to enter into this new era in\nhuman history.\nSince becoming a Member of the United Nations in\n1973, the Commonwealth of the Bahamas has at\nsuccessive sessions of the Assembly reaffirmed the\nimportance of the United Nations and has conveyed its\ncommitment to work with other Member States in pursuit\nof the principles and objectives of the Charter.\nIn this connection, we congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral on the important reform proposals which he has\n14\n\n\npresented, and we stand ready to participate in their\ncomprehensive and constructive review during this session.\nIt is the view of my delegation that reform should\nhave as its end result an improved and more efficient\nOrganization, fully able to meet the demands of the\nMembers which it serves. At the same time, reform would\nbe meaningless if the Organization were not to have a\nstable financial basis on which to carry out its functions. It\nis imperative, therefore, that we find a way to overcome the\nmyriad obstacles that have eluded resolution to date in areas\nsuch as the reform of the Security Council and the financial\nsituation of the United Nations.\nThe Bahamas strongly urges all Member States to\ncommit themselves to resolution of the question of Security\nCouncil reform at this fifty-second session of the General\nAssembly. The Bahamas supports the need to expand the\nCouncil\u2019s membership in both categories. This expansion\nmust, however, pay due regard to the principles of equal\nrepresentation, the reflection of the universal character of\nthe Organization and the need to correct existing\nimbalances in the composition of the Council.\nIn a world confronted daily by press reports on the\ntragedies of failed efforts to preserve peace between\nnations \u2014 and indeed, between different ethnic and/or\nreligious groups within nations \u2014 it is frequently easy to\nignore the successes being achieved by the Organization.\nMy Government welcomes the positive work being done by\nthe United Nations in the maintenance of international\npeace and security. The fact that increasing numbers of\ncountries are willing to cooperate with the United Nations\nis an indication of how important it is for the Organization\nto continue the implementation of its mandate in this area.\nWe note the success stories in areas such as Central\nAmerica and also in Haiti, where the mandate of the\nSupport Mission has recently been extended. It has always\nbeen the contention of the Bahamas Government that too\nearly a withdrawal from Haiti had the potential of derailing\nthe hard-earned gains made in that country. The continuing\nand recently escalating arrival of many Haitian migrants in\nthe Bahamas is a sobering reminder that a setback in\nHaiti\u2019s difficult march towards political and economic\nstability could well be destabilizing.\nThe Government applauds the international community\nin its successful negotiation of a treaty to ban anti-personnel\nlandmines. Bahamas will sign the treaty and ratify it as\nsoon as possible, and hopes that the Convention will\nreceive full support, particularly from the developed\ncountries of the world. The Bahamas fulfilled its promise\nmade last year to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty, and pledges early ratification, in keeping with\nits commitment to save succeeding generations from the\nscourge of nuclear war. These, along with other measures,\nbring us one step closer to the total elimination of\nweapons of mass destruction.\nThe Bahamas is of the view that the United Nations\nshould serve as a pillar of support for the aspirations of\nits Member States and as a beacon of hope for the\ndestitute of the world. Let us therefore resolve to have\nthis fifty-second session of the General Assembly\nremembered as a decisive turning point in the work of the\nOrganization. It should be remembered as a session where\nMember States were able to attain a greater level of\nunderstanding, trust, cooperation and a sense of purpose\nto empower them to deal with the problems affecting the\ninternational community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The\ndocument (A/51/950) submitted for debate, \u201cRenewing\nThe United Nations: A Programme for Reform\u201d, has been\nexamined extremely carefully by my Government. We\nmust admit that the United Nations in its current form is\na long way from corresponding to the geopolitical\nrealities of today\u2019s world.

Many\nmajor treaties and conventions have been concluded,\nincluding the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\nand the Chemical Weapons Convention. The international\ncommunity has also made a firm and prompt commitment\nto the Ottawa process on banning anti-personnel\nlandmines, a process in which the Republic of Guinea\ntook a particularly active part.\nWe should also welcome the implementation of\npeacekeeping operations in many parts of the world and,\nan extremely positive sign, an improvement in public\nadministration, increased democracy and the strengthening\n17\n\n\nof the ability of nations to promote human rights in the\ninterests of better governance.\nBut, in spite of this considerable progress, many\nimbalances remain, major challenges are still before us and\nthe nascent globalization is not, as a spirit of international\nsolidarity would demand, benefiting developing countries,\nwhich have tended to fall by the wayside on the road to\nprogress. Many countries are still labouring under the\nburden of debt, which is crippling their economies and\nthereby compromising their development efforts. In full\nview of the international community, thinly disguised\nprotectionism prevents our products from gaining access to\nbuoyant markets. When, taking one year with another, some\nof our products manage to overcome these barriers, they\noften succumb to prices stemming from rules that are\nsometimes fixed unilaterally or flouted with impunity. This\nis compounded by the harmful effects of the decline in\nofficial development assistance in spite of the Rio\ncommitments.\nSo-called small arms are proliferating on our borders\nand are posing serious threats to the peace, security and\nstability of many countries.\nThis short list does not nearly cover all the defects we\nhave to correct.\nCourageous and consensual reform of the United\nNations could help us to do away with these ills, which are\ncompromising, through uncertainty, the future of many\nnations represented here. We must reassure our peoples, not\njust by drafting new standard-setting instruments that are\nlegally binding on us all, but, above all, by taking drastic\naction, channelling our will and joint efforts to change the\nsituation on the ground.\nThe spirit of the Marshall Plan, which the United\nNations should espouse, should not die with the century\nthat saw its birth.\nFor all these reasons, the Republic of Guinea approves\nthe reform proposed by the Secretary-General. For all these\nreasons it is also deeply involved in the debate that will\nmake it a reality. We will not go into all the positive\naspects here; we will simply confine ourselves to a few\npoints, especially those that directly affect developing\ncountries.\nI begin with the economy, the new cornerstone of the\nsystem after disarmament. Several economic measures go\nin the right direction. We support the initiative to create a\nUnited Nations Development Group, an Office of\nDevelopment Financing and a new system for multi-year\npledges for development cooperation thanks to savings on\nadministrative expenses, the first fruits of reform.\nThe same applies to strengthening the role of the\nEconomic and Social Council and promoting dialogue\nwith the technical ministries of our countries to give\nimpetus to macroeconomic policies. We also set great\nstore by the proclamation of the International Decade to\nEliminate Poverty and especially in concrete measures to\neradicate the evil of poverty.\nThe Republic of Guinea puts women and children at\nthe heart of its development, and welcomes the attention\ngiven to the promotion of women and children.\nIn the same vein, Guinea supports the\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s and the United\nNations System-wide Special Initiative on Africa.\nMy delegation supports other aspects which are\nequally important for the restructuring under\nconsideration, especially the merger of institutions in the\nOrganization with similar activities, such as the creation\nin Vienna of a single Office to combat transnational\ncrime, drug-trafficking and terrorism, evils we should all\nfight against wherever they may rear their head, and the\namalgamation of the Centre for Human Rights with the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights.\nThe problem of the environment knows no\nboundaries. If we are not careful, this may be the greatest\ndanger we face, since many perils are lurking,\nsmouldering beneath the surface of the anarchy in this\nmatter. It should be the sacred duty of the international\ncommunity to ensure the lasting health of our planet for\nourselves and for future generations. This is why we\nwelcome the organization of a special session on the\nenvironment and development.\nWe have presented the proliferation of small arms as\na subject of concern to African countries. These weapons,\nwhich unfortunately lend themselves to all types of\nconflict, large or small, pose a real danger. We therefore\nstrongly support the idea of creating a Department for\nDisarmament and Arms Regulation. If it is to be fully\neffective, it should be given adequate resources and\ngenuine power to monitor the cross-border movement of\nthese weapons.\n18\n\n\nWhat is true of the Organization as a whole is even\nmore true of the Security Council. The times we live in\nhave made its reform essential. Nevertheless, when we deal\nwith this important and delicate issue, we should avoid\nconfrontation between regions and different groups and try\nnot to resort to useless polemics. On the one hand, we\nshould perhaps understand that we will not be able to do\neverything at once, or else we will stymie the debate. Our\nmain goal should be significantly to change a status quo\nwhich we all feel has had its day. On the other hand, if we\nput ourselves in the shoes of those who are enjoying\npermanent seats and the right of veto, we should recognize\nthat it is difficult, even human, but not impossible, to agree\nto give up, without a fight, the considerable advantages won\nafter the war after a brave struggle.\nBut, once peace has been achieved, it would be\npointless if time were not able, after half a century, to heal\nthe wounds of defeat and cast out the memories of war.\nSecurity Council reform must be one of the major proofs of\na reconciliation patiently achieved. This is only one aspect\nof the issue.\nIf the desire to disarm is sincere and universally\nshared by all members of the international community, as\ndecisive progress could lead us to hope is the case, then the\nconcept of power should no longer be measured by a\ncountry\u2019s mass destruction capabilities.\nAfter the cold war, the end of the arms race and of the\nconfrontation of ideologies, the struggle \u2014 perhaps we\nshould say \u201ccompetition\u201d \u2014 is shifting to other arenas,\nparticularly the economic arena and ensuring people\u2019s\nhappiness. In the process, many countries which not long\nago were considered small because of the size of their\neconomies are outstripping nations which have seen their\nformer glory fade.\nThe formidable progress in communications has\ninexorably reduced distances and gulfs separating the levels\nof knowledge and development in the different parts of the\nworld.\nTogether, let us square up to these new realities, with\njustice and democracy as our point of reference but above\nall, with a clear view of humanity united on the basis of a\nfruitful and trusting partnership, ensuring progress and well-\nbeing for all. And let us courageously decide now on what\nis possible, even if it means postponing matters until the\nyear 2000, when we can put the finishing touches to what\nwe will not have done today.\nIn the debate this session, Africa, in its constant\nquest for consensus, has modest ambitions. We would\nconsider two permanent seats in the Security Council,\nwith the same rights for all, pursuant to the resolutions of\nthe summit in Harare, as positive results. The delegation\nof the Republic of Guinea will fight for this during what\nit hopes will be a calm and constructive debate.\nThe United Nations is essential for today and\ntomorrow. If it did not exist, we would have had to invent\nit.\nThe United Nations, as a special and irreplaceable\nplace for 185 States to meet, work together and cooperate,\nmust lay down rules of law recognized universally by all\nso that international relations can continue in a coherent,\nequitable and efficient manner.\nStructural reform, however perfect, cannot be fully\neffective without adequate financing of the Organization\u2019s\noperations and, above all, of its activities.\nReform must necessarily be accompanied by\nconsistent funding. Without reducing this important aspect\nof the question solely to the payment of the contributions\nowed by many countries, the delegation of Guinea wishes\nto state that its reaction to the statement by the President\nof the country that is the largest contributor was a\npositive one. Nevertheless, in keeping with the principle\nthat the rules that have hitherto governed the Organization\nare still in effect, the payment of arrears by all Member\nStates must precede the opening of negotiations to work\nout a new scale of assessments satisfactory to all.\nWhile bearing in mind that our common destiny\nshould be the background to our statements before the\nAssembly, I would like to point out that each region and\nsubregion comes to this rostrum with its own pressing\nconcerns.\nThe subregion of western Africa, to which my\ncountry, the Republic of Guinea, belongs has been shaken\nby two fratricidal conflicts in Liberia and in Sierra Leone.\nIn Liberia, the recent democratic and transparent\nelections held on 19 July 1997 under the aegis of the\nEconomic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS), with the support of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU), the United Nations and such\nfriendly countries as the United States of America, the\nNetherlands, Denmark and France, have been crowned\nwith success. We welcome the Ministerial Meeting of the\n19\n\n\nSpecial Conference on Liberia that is taking place today in\nthe Trusteeship Council Chamber, and we hope that it will\nlead to the mobilization of substantial resources for the\nrebuilding of that fraternal country. The consolidation of\npeace and stability there is at stake.\nThe Republic of Guinea, faithful to its policy of peace\nand good-neighbourliness, has worked unflaggingly for the\nsuccess of such efforts. For the record, it will be recalled\nthat this is the first time that an African subregional\norganization, determined to shoulder its responsibilities, has\nmanaged to initiate, lead and successfully carry out a\npeacekeeping operation.\nWe would also like to salute here the support being\ngiven by the international community to ECOWAS for the\nrestoration of constitutional legitimacy in Sierra Leone,\nwhich was the victim of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat on 25 May 1997.\nThe consequences of the conflicts in Liberia, which\nlasted for seven years, and in Sierra Leone, which has been\ngoing on for six years, have weighed heavily on the\nRepublic of Guinea. These are two neighbouring countries\nthat share hundreds of kilometres of frontiers with Guinea.\nWe have had to take in hundreds of thousands of\nrefugees and displaced persons. The Republic of Guinea, a\ncountry of 7 million inhabitants, has up to 650,000\nrefugees, or one tenth of its population. In taking in the\nrefugees it has had to pay a heavy price and make\nenormous sacrifices. In the border areas the environment\nand infrastructures have deteriorated under the demographic\npressure. Schools have been closed to serve as shelters for\nrefugees. We have also had to cope with many health\nproblems of all kinds.\nBecause of this exceptional situation the members of\nECOWAS, meeting at Conakry on 26 June 1997, launched\nan appeal for emergency assistance for the Republic of\nGuinea. That appeal is beginning to be heeded by many\ncountries and international organizations.Here we would\nlike to thank most warmly the People\u2019s Republic of China,\nthe State of Kuwait, the United States of America, France,\nCanada, Qatar, Italy and the Organization of African Unity,\nwhich have already demonstrated their solidarity with us.\nI would be remiss if, out of a desire to inform the\nAssembly of the problems of western Africa, I failed to\ngive due attention to conflicts tearing other African\ncountries and other regions of the world asunder.\nWith regard to the Great Lakes region, my\ndelegation would encourage all initiatives to establish a\nclimate of peace and stability in that area.\nSimilarly, we would like to voice our concern at the\ndeterioration of the situation in the Congo. While urging\nthe parties to the conflict to observe the ceasefire and\npersevere in their efforts at negotiation, we reaffirm our\nsupport for the tireless efforts being made by all those of\ngoodwill to reach a settlement of that crisis.\nTurning to Western Sahara, the Republic of Guinea\nwelcomes the appointment of a new Personal Envoy of\nthe Secretary-General for Western Sahara and hopes that\nthe personal input of that diplomat will foster the peaceful\nimplementation of the United Nations settlement plan.\nOther parts of the world are also experiencing unrest\nthat threatens international peace and security. We shall\nconfine ourselves here to the situation in the Middle East.\nThe Republic of Guinea encourages the efforts being\nmade to find a just and lasting settlement in the Middle\nEast. Notwithstanding current difficulties, we must\npersevere. Peace, a just and equitable peace between\nIsrael and its Arab neighbours, is essential. Peace will\nremake that region in the interests of all its peoples and\nturn it into a magnet for all the nations of the world. The\nonly way to achieve that is through negotiation.\nIn the prevention, management and resolution of\nconflicts, Africa is increasingly shouldering its own\nresponsibilities. This new approach is in keeping with\ncurrent developments, and the international community\nshould encourage and support it.\nThe Republic of Guinea, which pursues a policy of\npeace and economic development under the leadership of\na man of peace and tolerance, the President of the\nRepublic, Brigadier General Lansana Cont\u00e9, will be\nprepared, as in the past, to bear its share of responsibility\nfor solving African problems.\nA dark cloud always has a silver lining.\nIt is comforting to note that life on the African\ncontinent is not confined to crises and conflicts. The\nstruggle of African peoples to emerge from poverty has\nmade striking progress in recent years. The needs of\neconomic development have compelled all African\ncountries to adapt their State institutions and redirect their\npolicies to cope with the changes of the new era.\n20\n\n\nToday, there are many bilateral and multilateral\ninitiatives to help Africa get off the ground. Most of those\ninitiatives draw on the lessons of the past and, happily,\navoid the imposition of patterns or stereotypes; they take\ninto account the real needs of the African people, who are\nincreasingly involved in the choice of development plans\nand programmes. Measures to convert, suspend or write off\ndebts are part of that process.\nWe face major challenges, whose diversity and\ncomplexity concern us and call for urgent solutions\ncommensurate with the expectations and aspirations of our\npeoples. The Republic of Guinea is confident that the\ncurrent session will produce decisions enabling our\nOrganization fully to carry out its noble mission as we\napproach the third millennium.\nI conclude on that note of hope and optimism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, I would\nlike to refer to the intervention which will be made\ntomorrow by the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg on\nbehalf of the European Union. I should also like to\ncongratulate the Foreign Minister of Ukraine on his\nelection as President of the General Assembly.\nAllow me to reflect a bit on the fact that three\ndecades ago a Danish Prime Minister, Mr. Jens Otto\nKrag, presented our yearly address to the twenty-second\nsession of the General Assembly. The challenges of today\nare not very similar to those of that time, and yet they are\nno less complex nor of lesser magnitude. For the United\nNations to face these challenges, the Organization must\nadapt. It must reform, must change and must modernize.\nThat is why reform must be a priority for this session of\nthe General Assembly. And that, in all humility, is why\nI am here today: to support the Secretary-General and the\nGeneral Assembly and to do what I can on behalf of my\ncountry in order to reach our goal at the end of this\nsession and to help make decisions that are necessary in\norder to modernize and to reform.\nSince the twenty-second session of the General\nAssembly, 30 years ago, we have seen disappointments.\nWe have seen civil wars. We have seen frustrations,\nbacklashes and incredible suffering. Yet we have also\nseen light. We have seen peace where war once raged.\nWe have seen former enemies living peacefully together.\nIndeed, we have seen apartheid disappear. We have seen\nthe Berlin Wall fall. We have seen the oppressed coming\nout of jails and being elected leaders of their countries,\nand some of them rank among the world's most\noutstanding leaders. We have seen the winds of change\nsweep over entire continents.\nI believe this: if our generation cannot believe in the\nimpossible, who can? If our generation cannot take the\ndecisions that are necessary, who else can? All in all, I\nthink this is of crucial importance for the United Nations.\nA reform programme for the United Nations is not\nonly about a more efficient use of scarce resources. It is\nalso, and more importantly, about strengthening and\nrevitalizing the Organization so that it can effectively\ncarry out its core activities and meet the challenges of the\nfuture. It must be a reform closer to the people, a reform\ncloser to non-governmental organizations and\nparliamentarians, a reform unifying Governments, the\nUnited Nations and peoples.\n11\n\n\nThe core activities and priorities are very clearly\ndescribed in the Secretary-General's reform programme.\nWith great precision and clarity, the Secretary-General has\nspelled out elements that my Government fully subscribes\nto: peace and security, economic and social affairs;\ndevelopment cooperation; humanitarian affairs; and, as an\nactivity cutting across the others, human rights - because\nhuman rights makes the United Nations the people's United\nNations. These core functions of the United Nations are\ninterdependent and mutually supportive. No amount of\nfunding will create sustainable development without peace,\ngood governance and respect for human rights. None of our\nefforts in the field of peace and security or humanitarian\nrelief will have a lasting effect without efforts to create\nsustainable development.\nDenmark gives its full support to the reform\nprogramme of the Secretary-General. We consider the\nprogramme, in its totality, to be a significant contribution\ntowards strengthening the Organization and towards making\nit more responsive, legitimate and efficient. I also note the\nspirit of the Secretary-General in creating much greater\nmotivation among the employees of the United Nations and\nmuch shorter lines between the Secretary-General and all\nthe rest of the people working for our common goal and\ncause, here in this House and all around the world.\nReform is about shifting resources to the core\nfunctions of the United Nations: shifting resources from\nadministration to development - in short, getting more\nvalue for money, centrally, on the national level and\nlocally.\nThe reform programme constitutes a package. It\nshould be dealt with by the General Assembly as such. The\nprogramme as a whole should receive the political\nendorsement of the Assembly in the coming weeks. My\ncountry endorses the package fully and wholly.\nGround-breaking work has been carried out on the\nway towards Security Council reform. Expansion of the\nmembership of the Council is essential to enhance its\nlegitimacy. At the same time, its effectiveness and decision-\nmaking capacity must be safeguarded. But - and I think\nthat there is a \\\"but\\\" - we must unify in order to reform.\nWe are gathered to reform, to open a new chapter of\nreforming and modernizing the United Nations.\nIt has to be said that no institution can discharge its\nfunctions without a sound financial basis. Member States'\nfulfilment of their financial obligations must be considered\nthe touchstone of their attachment to the United Nations. I\nam not a billionaire; I am probably not even a millionaire.\nI am the Prime Minister of my country, and I know the\nway to go. I know, on behalf of my country, our\nobligations. I also know, on behalf of my country, the\nfinancial duties my country has. I therefore hope that this\nsession will also be a turning point for all Member\ncountries of the United Nations, because a sound financial\nbasis first and foremost requires that Member States pay\ntheir contributions in full, on time and without any\nconditions. The contributions of Member States must be\nbased on their capacity to pay. Therefore let us join, as\nwe have done on the reform process, to finance the\nUnited Nations on its path to the next century.\nPolitical instability, violence and the collapse of the\nstructures of society have led to massive movements of\nrefugee populations. Large numbers of people - millions\nof people - have fled to regions far from their homes.\nWe are deeply concerned about this situation. We must do\nour utmost to support the humanitarian organizations in\ntheir efforts to assist refugees and other displaced persons\nas close to their local environments as possible: as close\nto their homes as possible.\nYet refugees and other displaced persons cannot\nreturn to their homes so long as anti-personnel mines\nremain scattered throughout the countryside, so long as\nhuman beings by the thousand are being injured or killed\nwhen they work their fields, so long as children cannot go\nto school without risking losing a limb on their way.\nMr. Secretary-General, you said it yourself in your\nspeech in Oslo: you underlined that the very presence, or\njust the fear of the presence, of only one mine can stop\nthe work in a whole village, can stop the work in a whole\nfield, can make it impossible for families, or whole\nvillages, to survive and to create proper living conditions.\nWe must realize that, without mines, we would have\ncountries that could double or triple their agricultural\nproduction and thereby help themselves. We must get rid\nof these anti-personnel mines and must do it today rather\nthan tomorrow.\nI look forward to the day when the last anti-\npersonnel mine has been produced. That will be a good\nday for mankind. I look forward to the day when the last\nanti-personnel mine has been removed. That will be a\ngood day for mankind, and that day must come soon. I\nlook forward to the day when a United Nations\nconvention will settle this matter so that it never comes\nbefore us again.\n12\n\n\nWe must at the same time work at improving the basic\nconditions of life for ordinary people in areas of conflict.\nOnly in this way can we prevent people from becoming\npermanent refugees.\nIn the past year we have once again experienced how\nquickly crises can break out in different parts of the world.\nThis underlines the need for the international community to\nbe able to react swiftly and in unity in order to prevent the\nspread of violence and human suffering. As the Secretary-\nGeneral has noted, my country, Denmark, has taken the\ninitiative to establish a multinational standby high readiness\nbrigade (SHIRBRIG) within the framework of United\nNations standby agreements. The planning element for the\nbrigade was officially inaugurated by the Secretary-General\nearlier this month in my country. The initiative is being\ntaken to increase the rapid-reaction capability, and it must\nbe carried forward. Improvements in the planning capacity\nof the United Nations are under way and will help reduce\nthe overall response time.\nCapacity within other areas must be enhanced as well.\nCivilian police has proved crucial in many of the recent\noperations. We must improve both the capacity and the\ntraining of civilian police officers.\nNext year we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of a\nmajor achievement in the history of mankind: the 1948\nadoption by the General Assembly of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. The noble object of the\nDeclaration is the protection of individuals - not the\ninterests of States. All human beings are equal and deserve\nequal protection against abuse. Therefore the standards of\nthe Declaration are by their very nature universal. Any\ndenunciation of human rights obligations is unacceptable\nand demonstrates a lack of respect for human dignity.\nOn the subject of credibility, I wish to underline that\na connection must also be made between violence and\nhuman rights violations and the consequences. I think,\ntherefore, that a significant recent development since the\nadoption of the Declaration is the establishment of the\noffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. I\nwelcome the new High Commissioner, Mrs. Mary\nRobinson. She will receive our full support in her\nendeavours to promote and ensure universal respect for\nhuman rights.\nBut respect for human rights demands also\ninternational justice. After the Nuremberg trials we all\nbelieved that the Holocaust would never happen again, and\nyet new genocides are haunting us. Therefore, we need a\npermanent international criminal court. We will not allow\ncrimes against humanity to go unpunished. This is a\nfundamental question of credibility, a fundamental\nquestion of consequence and of justice. Setting a precise\ndate for a diplomatic conference in 1998 is essential to\nmaintain the momentum for the early establishment of the\ncourt, by the end of this decade.\nThe need to assist the poorest countries is as\nimportant as ever. The poorest countries do not, I believe,\nattract sufficient private capital flows, nor do they have\nthe potential to benefit from the liberalization of\ninternational trade. It is time for action. It is time to\nnarrow the gap between rhetoric and action. I would\nremind the Assembly of the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment, held in Copenhagen, and I would recall the\nobligations undertaken there and our vision of narrowing\nthe gap between rhetoric and practical action. Education,\nhealth and participation for women are fundamentals.\nThe role of the United Nations system in the field of\neconomic and social development is indispensable. I\nshould like to emphasize in particular the importance of\nthe United Nations as an Organization operating with a\nglobal mandate and on the basis of a global approach of\nsustainable development, security and good governance.\nLet me mention by way of example the World\nConference on Women, held in Beijing. It should be a\nprimary task for the United Nations system to ensure an\neffective follow-up to these conferences.\nThe United Nations should be at the forefront of the\nglobal efforts to ensure sustainable development for all.\nAnd yet let us be direct, clear and honest. The United\nNations development organizations concerned are entirely\ndependent on voluntary contributions, and these have,\nregrettably, followed a decreasing trend in recent years. I\nthink it is fair to say that the United Nations development\norganizations themselves can be partly blamed for the\nemerging funding crisis. All too often they have failed to\ncooperate. Many donors have been frustrated to see\nUnited Nations organizations engage in a costly\ncompetition for funds. The mere fact that it has not been\npossible until now for the United Nations organizations to\nestablish common premises at the country level is an\nexample of this situation.\nHere again I feel that the Secretary-General's reform\nproposals are a significant contribution towards redressing\nthis unfortunate situation. Let us have one coordinated\nUnited Nations house in each country, and let us not\ncompete among United Nations organizations but\n13\n\n\ncooperate effectively. That is a vision that we want to\nfollow and to support.\nThe many, many problems faced by minorities in our\nworld, and not least by indigenous peoples, must be\naddressed in a coherent manner. We must ensure that\nindigenous peoples are given real influence on matters\npertaining to them.\nThat is why my country, Denmark - in close\ncooperation with the indigenous population of Greenland -\nhas called upon the United Nations and its Member States\nto establish, within the framework of the Economic and\nSocial Council, a permanent forum for indigenous peoples.\nThis forum should have a broad mandate to cover a wide\nrange of issues. Indigenous peoples themselves must be\nensured the possibility of active and effective participation\nin its establishment and in its function.\nThe United Nations is the future for all of us on this\nglobe - a future that can be improved by closer\ncooperation with regional organizations. This cooperation\nmust be strengthened. Since the political changes in Europe\nthat began at the end of the 1980s, the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has taken on\nan important role in that region. This role is a natural\nexpression of its status as a regional arrangement under\nChapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations. The\nOSCE cooperates closely with the United Nations in a\nnumber of areas. By taking on responsibility within its own\ngeographical area, the OSCE contributes to the United\nNations ability to deal with crises elsewhere.\nAs Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE, my Foreign\nMinister has given high priority to strengthening the\nrelationship between the OSCE and the United Nations. We\nhave frequent contact with the Secretary-General and have\nencouraged closer relations between the secretariats.\nLet me conclude. It is time for reform, as the\nSecretary-General so wisely said, and I should like in this\nconnection to make three points.\nMy first point is that the reform programme put\nforward by the Secretary-General deserves our full support.\nIf adopted, it will leave this Organization in much better\nshape. For the sake of our common future this is needed.\nLet us decide and let us follow up.\nMy second point is this: we need the United Nations,\nand the United Nations needs us. We must ensure the\nnecessary funding for the world Organization and its\ndevelopment agencies. We must do this to make the\nworld a better and safer place. Every Member must pay\nin full, on time, without conditions.\nFinally, my third point: we must address the negative\nlegacies of the past. We cannot solve the problem of\nrefugees and displaced persons without making it possible\nfor them to return to their homes. They cannot and will\nnot do that as long as their physical well-being is\nthreatened by inhumane anti-personnel mines and as long\nas their political future is threatened by war criminals\nwho have not been brought to justice.\nHuman rights are not just about words. It should also\nbe a human right to be able to live a secure life. At the\nWorld Summit for Social Development at Copenhagen,\nwe said, \\\"You cannot any longer have secure States\nwithout secure people inside\\\". This is what we need the\nUnited Nations to help us with.\nThis is not a perfect world, but I remain an optimist.\nWith the United Nations as an organization for the people\nand by the people, we can make this world a better place.\nLet us join hands to make the twenty-first century a\nhappier one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, it is a pleasure\nfor me to join preceding speakers in congratulating you on\nthe high distinction bestowed upon you and your country\nthrough your election to preside over this regular session of\nthe General Assembly, to which we have all come imbued\nwith our shared aspirations for the future of mankind. Once\nagain, we come to this forum to convey the warmest\ngreetings of solidarity, peace and hope of the people and\nGovernment of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea and, in\nparticular, to express my country\u2019s views on the issues to\nbe debated at this session.\nWe are three years away from a new millennium.\nThis waiting period is an opportunity to think deeply\nabout the challenges it has in store for us. We have\nmoved in a very short time from a bipolar world, marked\nby the cold war and both strategic and ideological\nconfrontations, to the new dynamics of globalization and\nthe interdependence of States in their relations within the\ninternational system.\nIndeed, when we consider that the millennium is\nabout to end and that our Organization has now been in\nexistence for more than 50 years, we must admit that a\ngreat deal has been achieved in terms of progress for\nmankind, particularly in the spheres of economic,\nscientific and technological development. Unfortunately,\nhowever, there are still grey areas of uncertainty as\nregards the future of mankind and the possibilities of\nestablishing peace and security throughout the world.\nIn third world countries such as ours, for example,\nthe lives of millions of people have been affected by a\nhalt to progress and development as a result of extreme\npoverty, wars and armed conflicts and of the resurgence\nof mercenary activities and organized crime. In brief, the\npeople are subjected to wanton violence, and as a result\nsocial, political and economic systems are breaking down.\nWe believe that the burden placed on our peoples is\ntoo great and that their problems require a lasting and\nstable response from the United Nations, to include the\nelimination of neo-interventionist practices; the prevention\nof conflicts; the reduction of poverty; the elimination of\nneo-protectionist barriers in world trade; and help in the\nfight against terrorism, fundamentalism and anachronistic\nnationalism. The preservation of the environment and the\nfight against drug-trafficking and the consumption of\nillicit drugs must also be prime objectives of our\ncollective action. These problems are not restricted to the\nterritory of a single State, and therefore their solution\ndemands the involvement and solidarity of all nations the\nworld over, in a context of consensus and more\ncoordinated international cooperation.\nThis, in turn, creates the need to ensure democratic\nreform of institutions and organizations of a global scope.\nThe division of the world into categories must become a\nthing of the past, although we agree that some among us\n7\n\n\nmust shoulder special responsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis mankind\nsince they, in a sense, are the ones responsible for certain\nthreats that face us: the nuclear threat, the large-scale\nproduction and sale of armaments, the deterioration of the\nenvironment and the exercise of absolute power over the\neconomy, finance and advances in science, technology and\ninformation. For if a third world exists today, it is only\nbecause someone exploited it to create a first world. We do\nnot intend to wait for the emergence of a fourth world\nwhose means and resources we can exploit to become\ndeveloped. The point is to make sure that the resources\namassed by the first world, the countries of the North, are\ntoday made available to the developing countries. For that\nto happen, the international trading system must be fair,\npoverty must be reduced, the social development and\nscientific and technological advance of developing countries\nmust be fostered and the debt problem must be alleviated.\nIn short, the differences in the quality of life that separate\nthe citizens of the North from those of the South must be\ndrastically reduced, in a spirit of open solidarity that will\nwork for the progress and development of all countries.\nAll these aspects are the real issues to be discussed as\nwe strive to attain lasting world peace and sustainable\ndevelopment in the coming millennium. The United Nations\nmust therefore become a much more global and democratic\nworld Organization so that it can take a dynamic approach\nto the problems weighing on mankind. It must be\nmodernized, brought up to date and in tune with the new\ntimes, able to express the common will of all nations.\nTherefore, it must be restructured.\nIn this connection, Equatorial Guinea feels, as do\nmany others, that it is time to reform the decision-making\nbody of the United Nations, the Security Council. With\nregard to reform, we do not know whether it is the number\nof the Council\u2019s members that has prevented the United\nNations from functioning with greater flexibility and\nefficiency. Nor are we sure that an increase in the number\nof permanent members will make for a more representative\nUnited Nations. What we must attempt to gain is more\nvoices expressing the will of the peoples to see a more\nprosperous, peaceful and lastingly stable world. If this\ncannot be achieved by returning to the General Assembly\nits legitimate rights, it would be reasonable to have more\nmembers of the Security Council representing the regions\nand to ensure that the rules governing the use of the veto\ntake into account the interest of the majority.\nEquatorial Guinea is interested in ensuring that we\nhave a properly functioning mechanism for agreement that\nreflects, above all, the spirit of equity and justice within the\nUnited Nations. For Equatorial Guinea, which is a small\ncountry in terms of both area and population, the\ndemocratic functioning of the United Nations provides a\nguarantee of security and stability in international\nrelations and, above all, ensures scrupulous respect for\nevery nation\u2019s right of sovereignty.\nIt is no idle claim that countries like ours do not\nreceive appropriate treatment in relations between States.\nThis applies, for example, to the vague demands relating\nto the universal principle of respect for fundamental\nhuman rights, which include political, economic and\nsocial rights.\nIn the specific case of Equatorial Guinea, it is\nneither understandable nor acceptable that, despite our\ngreat efforts to achieve a participatory democracy and\nrespect for human rights, international public opinion is\nstill being manipulated by some in order to project a false\nimage of our country to the outside world for reasons that\nare inconsistent with this universal principle. We do not\nbelieve that anyone has a monopoly on values and virtues\nin this respect.\nHowever, some years ago my country reached the\nconclusion that respect for human rights comes from a\ncontinuous process and not from an immediate response\nto criteria and demands imposed by groups or individuals\nwith partisan political interests. It is in this context that\nthe Government of Equatorial Guinea, of its own free\nwill, is participating in and cooperating with all the\ninitiatives of the United Nations and certain friendly\ncountries to consolidate respect for human rights in the\ncountry. To that end, working with the United Nations\nCommission on Human Rights and the United Nations\nCentre for Human Rights, we have already organized\nvarious training, educational and information programmes\nrelating to human rights.\nMy country is also proud to be one of the few\ncountries in the world that, of its own free will, has\nagreed with another country \u2014 in our case, the United\nStates of America \u2014 a technical and financial assistance\nprogramme for measures aimed at the better exercise\nwithin our society of all human rights. In the context of\nthis programme, far-reaching legal reforms have been set\nout to regulate this exercise of rights, as well as to\nachieve better administration and governance by the State.\nAll these measures will be free from political interference\nbased on ideological or partisan interests.\n8\n\n\nFrom this rostrum, therefore, I should like to confirm\nto international public opinion that in Equatorial Guinea\nhuman rights form an integral part of the priorities of the\nGovernment and of all the political forces of the nation and\nthat we are critiquing and continuously assessing our\nprogress. We do not, therefore, need either the approval or\nthe guidance of any other society or institution in order to\nevaluate this tangible reality. Nor do we need any\nfavourable or unfavourable propaganda from international\nmedia that may be linked to interests and pressure groups\nwith hidden agendas.\nWe certainly agree that the same degree of pressure\nthat is brought to bear with regard to the political rights of\npeoples must also be brought to bear in order to bring\nabout more concrete support for the right of peoples to\ndevelopment and the progress of nations. It is our\nunanimous desire that in the third millennium the millions\nof men, women and children of the world will have the\nright to health services, education, decent housing, drinking\nwater, electricity, food and clothing. But this objective\ncannot be achieved through restrictive measures and\npolicies or through discriminatory economic blockades. We\nalso wish to note that even these policies are not applied\nequitably throughout the international community.\nNevertheless, thanks to our strong conviction that we\nmust play the principal role in our own development, today\nmore than ever Equatorial Guinea is being targeted by\ncertain forces and is becoming a strategically and\neconomically significant zone in the subregion of central\nAfrica. At the economic level, our country has just attained\nthe status of oil-producing country, and attempts are being\nmade to destabilize it for purposes of hegemony and for\nstrategic reasons. Exactly five months ago, thanks to the\nspirit of African solidarity demonstrated by our sister\nrepublic of Angola, my country was saved from an\nattempted invasion by mercenaries, which was organized\nand financed by certain foreign political groups with murky\nand undisclosed designs on our nation.\nInstability in the subregion of central Africa is today\nthreatening the security of the region and the continent.\nPlans, strategies and machinery for destabilization are being\nfashioned from outside the region that are capable of\ndestroying the present incipient democratic regimes in the\nregion. Powerful communications media are actively\ninvolved in systematically distorting, disinformation and the\nmisrepresentation of everything that is happening in the\nregion. The situation in Angola, the Republic of the Congo,\nRwanda and Burundi, as well as the recent conflicts in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, have been presented\nto international public opinion as Dantesque and apocalyptic.\nWe ask the United Nations to follow up on\neverything that is taking place in this region, particularly\nin the area of the Gulf of Guinea, from the Niger river\ndelta to the enclave of Cabinda, as well as in the Great\nLakes region.\nIn the specific case of the Republic of the Congo, a\nsister country with which we share common interests, the\nGovernment of Equatorial Guinea fully supports the\ninternational mediation efforts of the President of the\nRepublic of Gabon, Mr. El Hadj Omar Bongo and of the\nspecial representative of the United Nations and of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU).\nWe have the feeling that a new cold war is being\nwaged in Africa based on cultural and linguistic\ninfluences. The fact that English, French, Portuguese and\nSpanish languages are spoken should only serve to enrich\nour values and capacities in terms of international\ncooperation and should be not a factor for confrontation\nand antagonism based on hegemony. This phenomenon\nhas a serious adverse effect on our ability to achieve unity\nat the continental level in Africa for the peaceful\nresolution of conflicts. We therefore appeal to the United\nNations and the OAU to initiate consensus-based actions\nthat will lead to the reduction of such differences.\nIn this context, my Government is making efforts to\nmaintain an internal and regional balance by developing\na policy based on dialogue, consensus and good-\nneighbourliness, which are indispensable tools for\nensuring peace and security in the continent.\nIn this process of political and economic change\nthere have been setbacks and difficulties, but we have\nkept determinedly to the upward path that will enable us\nto leave behind a past that produced severe economic\nregressiveness and a breakdown of democratic principles\nand values. We want Equatorial Guinea to be included\nfully within the dynamics of change and globalization.\nWe want to ensure that we are incorporated into the\nregenerative trend of free market economy with a strong\nsocial component and dialogue based on patriotism,\nflexibility and tolerance among all the political forces and\nthroughout civil society in our country.\nIndeed, we have just held, from 8 to 13 September\n1997, a national economic conference designed essentially\nto bring about a national dialogue to achieve a definition\n9\n\n\nof a consensus-based strategy involving all political forces,\ncivil society, non-governmental organizations and religious\nassociations, with the participation of international agencies\nof the United Nations system, the World Bank, the\nEuropean Union and African regional and subregional\norganizations, as well as friendly nations, aimed at\nimplementing structural reforms in the economy and\nsustainable development of the country, through the rational\nand transparent use of oil, forest and fishing resources.\nIn the political field, we will proceed with the free and\ntransparent reform of laws regulating the exercise of\ndemocratic liberties to achieve better governance for our\nnation. We have the firm political determination to attain\nthese objectives and to meet our commitments, and we\nappeal for international solidarity.\nI cannot conclude without expressing, on behalf of the\nGovernment of Equatorial Guinea, our warmest\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\non his wise and sound suggestions for reforming the bodies\nof the United Nations.\nEquatorial Guinea will continue to support those\nefforts, aimed at achieving more dynamic and flexible\nmechanisms and structures for peacekeeping and the\npromotion of balanced and sustainable social and economic\ndevelopment in the world.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI take pleasure in congratulating the President\non his election to preside over the fifty-second session of\nthe General Assembly and to congratulate his friendly\ncountry on his election to that high international office. We\nare confident that his wide-ranging expertise will facilitate\nhis task and lead the deliberations of this session to a\nsuccessful end.\nI should also like to thank his predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Razali Ismail, for his wise leadership of the\nprevious session of the General Assembly.\nOn this occasion I cannot fail to renew my\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General of the United\nNations and to Africa, his great continent. I wish him full\nsuccess in discharging his tasks in accordance with the\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter.\nAlthough more than 50 years have elapsed since the\nadoption of the Charter of the United Nations, and\nalthough States have since committed themselves to peace\nin their international relations, many regions of the world,\nparticularly in the Middle East, continue to suffer\noccupation, aggression and the threat of aggression to a\npoint where the sounds of war have begun to drown out\nthat of peace.\nIt has now become clear to most of those concerned\nwith peace and security in various corners of the Earth\nthat the peace process initiated at the Madrid Conference\nsix years ago has reached a dead end. This is due to the\nvolte-face by the current Israeli Government vis-\u00e0-vis that\nprocess, including the commitments, agreements and\npledges stemming from it. It is also due to its cynicism\ntowards all the strenuous international efforts seeking, for\nthe first time in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, to\nachieve a comprehensive solution to this conflict.\nPerhaps many of us, Governments as well as\npeoples, cannot foresee the extent of the serious\nrepercussions that will result from that Israeli reversal on\nthe peace process, particularly since it is taking place in\nthe post-cold-war period, when wars and armed\nconfrontations have taken ugly and barbaric forms and\nhave often raged out of control. Syria, which has opted\nfor the achievement of peace in the Middle East on the\nbasis of justice and dignity as a strategic choice, finds\nthat it is duty bound to train a spotlight from this\nimportant international rostrum on some facts concerning\nthe positions of the current Israeli Government. This\nshould enable the international community, with the\nsponsors of the peace process foremost among them, to\nbeware of any serious developments in the future leading\nto undermining the security and stability of the Middle\nEast region and beyond.\nAs a preliminary observation, I must point out that\nin our reading of the policy of the Israeli Government we\ndo not proceed from the perception widely held around\nthe world which classifies it as an extremist Zionist\nGovernment bent on negating the other party to the\nconflict rather than making peace with it. We proceed\nmerely from an objective description of declared positions\nof the Israeli Government and from its practices on the\nground, which \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 aim at gradually\nbacktracking from the commitments and agreements\nreached by the parties during the peace talks and\nultimately at completely eradicating the peace process\nlaunched at the Madrid Conference.\n20\n\n\nIt seems to us that the method now employed by the\nIsraeli Government to reach that objective is not the usual\none of one step forward, two steps back. It is now a new\npractice, a tactic of one step back, then two steps back,\nfollowed by a threat of a further step backwards which\ncannot be abandoned, even provisionally, until the other\nside accepts new conditions it had already rejected. Thus,\nthe peace process regresses until it ultimately cancels itself\nout.\nIn this context, some may find it unfairly prejudicial\nto the Israeli Government to characterize its practices in\nsuch terms. They would, however, be surprised to learn that\nthe Head of the Israeli Government himself boasts to his\ninner circle of employing such a tactic, which he believes\nis a very astute means of ending the peace process as\nunobtrusively as possible.\nThis does not stop at the modus operandi alone, but\nextends to the details of the very fundamental issues\nunderpinning the peace process. While acknowledging the\napplicability of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and\n338 (1973) to the occupied Syrian Golan, he also\nsimultaneously rejects the results reached on the Syrian\ntrack, with the participation of the United States as sponsor,\non the basis of those resolutions and relating to withdrawal\nto the line of 4 June 1967. He further rejects the resumption\nof negotiations from the point at which they were halted.\nIt is also strange that the Israeli Government rejects\nthe formula of land for peace, though it is at the very core\nof the United States initiative and has always enjoyed\ninternational unanimity. Instead of accepting this formula,\nthe head of the Israeli Government advances others that\nneither common sense nor logic could entertain and that\ncannot stand the test of time, such as the formula of peace\nfor peace or peace for security. It is clear that accepting\nthese two Israeli formulas would be tantamount to surrender\nand to becoming an instrument at the service of Israel\u2019s\nsecurity.\nIt is indeed true that security issues are of the utmost\nimportance to all States, peoples and individuals. That is\nnot in doubt. However, security is the fruit of peace; the\nachievement of peace brings security and not vice versa.\nProceeding from that, we believe that the Israeli\nGovernment, in giving priority in its policy to security over\npeace, runs counter to all the concepts defined by societies\nand warring States throughout history. It is no exaggeration\nto say that the insistence of the Israeli Government on its\nerroneous concept of achieving security before ending\noccupation will turn the peace process into a bloodletting\nprocess, a cycle of killing that will obtain neither security\nnor peace for Israel and may return the Arab-Israeli\nconflict to its tragic beginnings.\nThe Charter of the United Nations states that the\nefforts of the peoples of the world must be concerted in\norder to save succeeding generations from the scourge of\nwar. Respect for the commitments proceeding from the\nprinciples of international law and its sources lies at the\nvery heart of the Charter. It is regrettable that the Israeli\nGovernment does not realize that its failure to respect the\ncommitments reached with the previous Government on\nthe Syrian track, based on the principles of international\nlaw and relevant Security Council resolutions, does not\nrepresent a mere legal violation. First and foremost, it\ncasts doubt on the credibility of any previous Israeli\nGovernment, and such doubts thus apply to the\ncommitments made by the current Administration when\nit is replaced.\nSince coming to power, the Israeli Government has\nnot limited its positions to undermining the peace process.\nIt has chosen the exact opposite path to that of peace. It\nhas increasingly diversified its attacks against Lebanon; it\nhas bombed cities teeming with civilians and has planted\nexplosive devices in many parts of southern Lebanon in\norder to incite enmity among the Lebanese and cast\naspersions on the role of the Lebanese resistance.\nHowever, such attempts, contrary to Israel\u2019s objectives,\nhave only solidified unity among the Lebanese. They have\nstrengthened the resolve of the Lebanese resistance to\nconfront Israeli occupation more than ever before. In the\noccupied Palestinian territories, the pace of settlement\nactivities has escalated, including a sharing of roles\nbetween the Israeli Government and extremist settlers, in\norder to expropriate more land, destroy homes and\nmaintain the drive to judaize East Jerusalem.\nIn our occupied Syrian Golan, the policy of\nentrenching Israeli occupation has also been escalated to\nthe point that the Israeli Knesset recently voted on a bill\nentrenching the occupation and impeding withdrawal from\nthe Golan, in clear defiance of Security Council resolution\n497 (1981). This has been accompanied by an\nintensification of Jewish settlement activity with the aim\nof swelling the numbers of settlers in the Golan and\nundermining the chances for peace. That is a flagrant\nviolation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the first\nadditional Protocol thereof. The Golan is Syrian land \u2014\nit always was and always will be. The Israelis will have\nto leave it sooner or later.\n21\n\n\nWe, the Arabs, have championed just and\ncomprehensive peace and consider it a strategic choice. For\nsuch a choice to be realistic and supported by the people,\nit requires full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian\nGolan to the line of 4 June 1967, as well as from southern\nLebanon and the western Bekaa, in implementation of\nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978). It must guarantee\nthe legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people,\nincluding those to self-determination and their own\nindependent State.\nSyria has always stressed its keen wish to establish a\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Syria once\nagain expresses its grave concern at the serious obstacle\nthat Israel has placed on the road to that goal in order to\nprevent the establishment of the zone by refusing to adhere\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT). This intransigent Israeli position does great harm to\nthe credibility and universality of the Treaty. We believe\nthat the measures and arrangements to establish a nuclear-\nweapon-free zone in the Middle East, as called for by\nUnited Nations resolutions, require Israel, the only State in\nthe region possessing nuclear facilities and stockpiles, to\nadhere to the NPT and place all its nuclear establishments\nunder the full-scope safeguards regime of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency. It must further destroy its entire\nstockpile of nuclear weapons.\nAt a time when the urgent need to intensify\ninternational efforts towards a just and comprehensive\npeace in the Middle East is very clear, some States of the\nregion are engaging in military cooperation similar to an\nalliance and have recently declared their intention to\nconduct military manoeuvres in the eastern Mediterranean.\nSuch manoeuvres would be a threat to the peace and safety\nof neighbouring States as well as to the stability of the\nregion.\nSyria supports all the efforts being made to eliminate\ntension in various regions of the world and to resolve\nstanding problems. In this context, Syria underlines its\nconcern for the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq. Syria\ncalls for easing the suffering of the brotherly people of Iraq,\nwhile Iraq is required to implement the remaining Security\nCouncil resolutions in a manner ensuring a just solution to\nthe issue of Kuwaiti prisoners.\nWe also hope that there will be a positive response to\nthe initiatives of the League of Arab States and the\nOrganization of African Unity, as well as towards the\nflexibility shown by the Libyan Government to resolve the\nLockerbie crisis. We would also like to see the embargo\nagainst Libya \u2014 a fellow Arab country \u2014 lifted, as well\nas an end to the suffering caused to the brotherly Libyan\npeople by that embargo.\nSyria supports measures to guarantee peace and\nsecurity in the Korean peninsula. We also wish to express\nour support for the aspirations of the Korean people for\nreunification. We further hope that serious efforts will be\nmade to provide assistance to the Korean people to\novercome its economic crisis.\nSyria stresses the need to take the necessary steps as\nsoon as possible to lift the economic, trade and financial\nembargo which has been imposed on Cuba for more than\n30 years.\nSyria is following with concern the severe conflicts\nafflicting some African countries. We call on the\ninternational community to make the necessary efforts and\nto endeavour to find solutions to these disputes, in close\ncooperation with the Organization of African Unity, in\norder to promote peace and stability on the African\ncontinent. The international community is further called\nupon to provide assistance of all kinds to enable African\nStates to eradicate the scourge of poverty and achieve\ndevelopment.\nAmong its primary purposes, the Charter of the\nUnited Nations provides for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security; the fostering between\nnations of international relations based on respect for the\nprinciple of equal rights and self-determination of\npeoples; international cooperation in the economic, social,\ncultural and humanitarian fields; and the promotion of\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms for all. It also\ncalls for non-interference in the internal affairs of States.\nThe Charter encouraged the establishment of specialized\nagencies in the field of international cooperation. It\nentrusted the General Assembly with setting out\nregulations governing the appointment by the Secretary-\nGeneral of the employees of the international\nOrganization. Syria underlines the importance of strict\nadherence to the purposes and principles of the United\nNations during the process of reform of the Organization\nin order to enable it to respond to the needs and\naspirations of its Members in the twenty-first century.\nWe believe that promoting development is among\nthe first priorities of the United Nations. There is\ntherefore a need to underscore the right to development.\n22\n\n\nSyria expresses its concern about any weakening of\nthe role and working methods of the General Assembly. We\ncall upon the General Assembly to perform its effective\nrole in accordance with the Charter.\nIn this context, we believe that the changes in the\ninternational arena and the significant increase in the\nnumber of Member States of the United Nations call for a\nreview of the composition and working methods of the\nSecurity Council. Checks and criteria must be put in place\nto prevent the arbitrary use of the veto power. Thus the\ndemocracy and transparency which are required in its\ndecision-making would be enhanced, thereby leading to\nmore fairness and balance, as well as to non-selectivity in\nthe implementation of the Council\u2019s resolutions. Although\nthis is an urgent matter, we believe that, in order to reach\ngeneral agreement on this question, the reforms of the\nSecurity Council must not be subjected to a specific time-\nframe.\nThe Secretary-General recently presented his proposals\nto reform the United Nations. We appreciate the efforts he\nmade in preparing his proposals. However, proceeding from\nour concern to strengthen the United Nations capacity to\nshoulder the responsibilities entrusted to it, we would have\nwished to have seen in the proposals more attention given\nto the fundamental role of the Organization in promoting\ninternational cooperation for development. We would have\nliked the proposals to exclude any measures likely to affect\nthose programmes and activities related to development\nissues and poverty eradication in developing and least\ndeveloped countries.\nHuman rights are a very important issue, which we\nbelieve must continue to be pursued as an independent issue\nin order to avoid any overlap with other United Nations\nactivities. Such an amalgamation of issues would only\nfurther the opportunities to politicize human rights issues\nand their use as a means to exert specific pressures, to\nimpose preconditions or to intervene in the internal affairs\nof States.\nHumanity has pinned great hopes on the United\nNations, an Organization born of a world war which was\ndestructive to great hopes. Humanity entertained the\nexpectation that the Organization would succeed in\noutlawing war, ending all forms of aggression and\nchampioning the right of peoples to self-determination. It\nfurther expected it to succeed in achieving development and\nin eradicating poverty and underdevelopment.\nToday, as we stand at the threshold of a new\ncentury, we all face great challenges which require us to\nfind the appropriate enabling environment for future\ngenerations to live in peace, security and cooperation\nwithin the context of international relations free of\nviolence and confrontation. This is the hope of our\npeoples and this is what we must strive to reach as we\nlook forward to a better future that is more just and more\nhumane for the benefit of all mankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to convey the congratulations of the\nGovernment and the people of Bolivia to you,\nMr. President. Your well-deserved election is fitting\nrecognition of your work and prestige.\nAllow me also to commend the work of Ambassador\nRazali Ismail of Malaysia, who so ably conducted the\ndeliberations of the previous session of the General\nAssembly.\nFinally, my congratulations go as well to Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan, whose contributions to the cause of\nworld peace and cooperation have earned him the\nunanimous gratitude of the Member States of this\nOrganization.\nAll the countries of Latin America, in one way or\nanother and each at its own pace, have put long decades\nof ideological confrontation and economic crisis behind\nthem. They have opened their markets, controlled\ninflation, reduced the deficit and privatized public\nenterprises. They have rebuilt their democratic\ninstitutional structures on new foundations, with new\nprotagonists, and restarted the process of growth.\nHowever, old structural adjustment problems,\naggravated by the period of crisis, have surfaced. Clearly\nthe most important of these is the inequitable distribution\nof income and its results: exclusion, poverty, violence and\nsocial fragmentation. Such inequities have created ever-\ngreater gaps between the immensely rich and those who\nhave barely enough to survive. There are no social\nsecurity systems to protect the dispossessed, to cushion\ntheir fall and rehabilitate them so that they can live a\nproductive life. For this reason, the potential for violence\nand discontent on our continent is growing larger and\nmore dangerous.\nThese factors aside, however, Latin America meets\nall of the necessary conditions to forge ahead and grow in\nthat it has the capacity and courage to continue to\nchange \u2014 to increase society\u2019s store of knowledge, create\nnew competitive advantages, eliminate internal\nmarginalization, reduce extreme poverty, rebuild the State,\n\n\nand speak with its own voice in the world political\ncommunity.\nEducation stands out as a vital precondition for all of\nthese goals. Without a far-reaching revolution in the area of\neducation, we will not be able to achieve these goals or\nmeet the challenges of our time.\nToday, Latin America is no longer asking others for\nwhat it cannot do on its own. Proof of this is the significant\nprogress recently made in strengthening mechanisms for\neconomic integration, such as the Andean Group and the\nSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR). The\nregion is also taking a different approach in its relations\nwith the economically advanced countries. The old\ndefensive and mistrustful attitude has yielded to the\nconviction that it is necessary to merge Latin America\u2019s\neconomy into the contemporary current of productive and\ntechnological development, attract investments and open its\nmarkets to its products while preserving its identity,\nupholding its values and attending to its interests, without\nfor an instant losing sight of the fact that the key to its\nstrength lies in its own markets and in its resources.\nLet me reiterate Bolivia\u2019s concern about landmines. It\nis incomprehensible that those very same borders across\nwhich we are seeking to promote trade and integration\nshould be sown with devices of war that endanger the\ncivilian population and threaten their fundamental rights.\nWe are convinced that the Governments of the region\ndirectly affected by the problem will find a way to resolve\nit.\nThis matter is of particular and direct relevance to\nBolivia, due to the well-known and acknowledged fact that\nChile has laid a significant number of mines along our\ncommon border. Removal of those mines is of the utmost\nurgency, in keeping with the commitments entered into in\nOslo, the dictates of morality and the imperative of the\nspirit of integration that should prevail between\nneighbouring nations. Avoidance of this topic is not the\nattitude that the international community wishes to see.\nWhat is needed is firm resolve and the sincere will to\ncontribute to peace between countries that must impart a\nsense of solidarity to their borders.\nSince the early days of its independence, Bolivia has\nrejected the use of force and the arms race as an instrument\nof its foreign policy. We have the moral authority,\ntherefore, to condemn those commercial interests that seek\nto foster the procurement of war mat\u00e9riel, thereby\ncompromising what we have achieved so far in terms of\npreserving peace on the continent.\nI have sought to describe the process of change in\nLatin America in order to show the extent to which\ndevelopments in each of our countries are part of a\nbroader and more comprehensive historical trend.\nHowever, Bolivia\u2019s transformation has its own particular\nfeatures. Following a lengthy process of social\nconfrontation, we have restored democracy and economic\nfreedoms in Bolivia. In a spirit of respect for human\nrights and freedoms, we have given full support to the\npolitical system and fuelled the economic growth and\ndevelopment that prevail today in Bolivia. It should be\nunderscored that this was a peaceful reconstruction\nprocess \u2014 the result of democratic dialogue.\nMy Government, the product of a mandate of the\npeople, represents more than 70 per cent of the Bolivian\nelectorate. Nonetheless, we must continue to move\nforward and broaden the scope of dialogue and consensus,\ninvolving social institutions and their leaders in the task\nof identifying the main objectives of development in\nBolivia as well as the broad outlines of our strategy for\nthe twenty-first century. That is the purpose of the\nnational dialogue that I have recently called for, which\nhas the support of all the political parties \u2014 Government\nand opposition; the church; private enterprise; and farmers\nand workers.\nOf course, this new country we are building is\nlooking to the future from a different perspective and with\na sense of renewed confidence. The time has come to\nreaffirm Bolivia\u2019s role on our continent \u2014 its role as a\ncrossroads and as a land of contacts, at the juncture of the\ngreat basins and the great cultures of America. Bolivia\u2019s\nkey geographical position may become one of its major\ncomparative advantages and an essential element in\nenhancing the country\u2019s international stature.\nHowever, this is not yet a reality. It is a task that\nremains to be accomplished, a promise that remains to be\nfulfilled. To this end, Bolivia will need to rebuild its\nmaritime capacity; reduce the transportation cost of its\nproducts; and create a modern export sector and connect\nit with the Pacific and the Atlantic. We must see and\nunderstand our country as a part of the continent.\nBolivia\u2019s association with MERCOSUR is not only\nthe result of a desire to cultivate a historical friendship\nbut also a consequence of the concrete needs of Bolivian\ndevelopment. The exceptional growth in the eastern areas\n2\n\n\nof Bolivia calls for a more intense and productive\nrelationship with our neighbours on the Atlantic.\nThat effort coincides with one of the most impressive\ndevelopment ventures in the history of America, which is\ntaking place now on the territories of Brazil, Bolivia,\nParaguay, Argentina and Uruguay. Investments and\ntechnology must be allowed to flow freely in that region.\nWe must set up a genuine common market, a multinational\ndevelopment project, around this potential, which should\nalso promote the integration of our countries into the world\neconomy. It is well known that the Paraguay-Paran\u00e1\nwaterway is the natural route linking the area.\nThat major project, however, has already gone beyond\nthe imagination of the visionaries and the negotiating tables\nof the diplomats. It is now in the hands of engineers and\nworkers. After more than 30 years of efforts, construction\nhas begun on the Santa Cruz-San Pablo-Curitiba gas\npipeline, the first segment of a network of energy\ndistribution for which Bolivia\u2019s territory provides the\ncrossroads. This is one of the largest engineering projects\nin the history of the region. It will stretch for more than\n3,000 kilometres, will carry more than 7 billion cubic feet\nof natural gas over 20 years and will require a total\ninvestment of nearly $5 billion.\nBolivia\u2019s very existence is directly tied to the Pacific.\nAccordingly, we have been following with great interest the\nprocess of consolidating the vast potential of the Andean\ncommunity. That potential is also found in our immediate\nvicinity. The economies of Bolivia, Peru and Chile are\ncomplementary.\nOur territories are not only markets, but avenues for\nintegration. The territories of Peru and Chile hold Bolivia\u2019s\ngateway to the Pacific, while that of Bolivia opens up\ncommunication between those nations and the vast interior\nof the continent.\nI must stress, however, that the reality still falls far\nshort of the potential. The reason for this is to be found in\na war that took place just over 100 years ago, and whose\nadverse consequences continue to be felt in the relations\nbetween our countries. Undoubtedly, the most unjust and\nserious of those consequences is the geographical enclosure\nimposed upon Bolivia.\nBolivia\u2019s demand to return to the Pacific Ocean, with\nsovereign rights and a coastline of its own cannot be\nrenounced. It is a vital condition for our national\ndevelopment but, above all, a historical claim that cannot be\ncompromised. The recovery of our maritime access,\ntemporarily lost, is an essential condition for fulfilling our\ncontinental role as a crossroads and a point of\nconvergence. My country will turn to the international\ncommunity as many times as necessary in order to call\nattention to a problem that has already been deemed a\nmatter of permanent hemispheric interest in the light of its\nmany implications for continental security and harmony.\nDespite everything, my Government, as always, remains\nready to explore avenues of constructive dialogue with an\nopen mind.\nIllicit drug trafficking unjustly distorts the reality of\nBolivia and affects and interferes with the proper conduct\nof external cooperation. Bolivia itself has done a great\ndeal to contain this problem. It has not permitted drug\ntrafficking to taint beyond repair its economic,\ninstitutional and political structure. And it has done so\npeacefully, without resorting to violence. Nevertheless, the\nstigma of drug trafficking exists, and while we are\ndisturbed by the manner in which it is magnified, it would\nbe a mistake to ignore it.\nAccordingly, my Government has taken the decision\nto remove Bolivia from the drug-trafficking circuit within\nthe term of my administration. We shall use dialogue and\nconsultation with peasant producers of coca in order\ndefinitively to eradicate illegal crops. We shall be ruthless\nwith the drug traffickers. We shall not give them a\nmoment\u2019s rest until they have been for ever banned from\nthe history of Bolivia.\nNaturally, this is not an exclusively Bolivian\nproblem, nor can our actions alone resolve the global and\nhemispheric problem of illegal trafficking in narcotics. It\nis a matter that concerns all and that requires everyone\u2019s\ncommitment. Therefore, the time has come to reaffirm the\nprinciples of shared responsibility. The characteristics and\nscope of this problem mean that it cannot be faced\neffectively through isolated efforts. It undeniably calls for\nresolute action by all countries, especially those affected\nby consumption and who have sufficient economic\nresources to combat this terrible evil.\nMy country reaffirms its commitment to the peace\nprocess in the Middle East in keeping with the principles\nand values that guide harmonious coexistence between\npeoples. However, given the resurgence of tensions and\nnew acts of confrontation, we call upon the parties not to\ngo back on the commitments already made. That is the\nfirm answer for maintaining peace in the region.\n3\n\n\nIn another vein, Bolivia has received with satisfaction\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s initiative proposing a broad\nprogramme of reforms in the United Nations system. We\nfeel it is essential to strengthen the role of the Secretariat.\nWe reiterate the importance of the process of expansion and\nreform of the Security Council with a view to correcting\npresent imbalances, guaranteeing equitable and non-\ndiscriminatory geographical distribution, improving its\ndecision-making mechanisms and making it an organ that\ncan take action in a manner that is increasingly legitimate\nand representative of the countries that make up the United\nNations. Bolivia shares the view that we should move\ntowards the elimination of the veto, limiting its use in the\ninterim to issues considered under Chapter VII of the\nCharter.\nBolivia reiterates its commitment to the principles that\nhave guided global solidarity for more than 50 years. We\nBolivians believe that there can be no relinquishing of the\nstandards that establish mutual respect and the sovereign\nequality of States, regardless of their size or level of\ndevelopment. Nor can we surrender the principles of\npeaceful settlement of disputes, the inviolability and\nintegrity of territories and respect for self-determination of\npeoples that wish to preserve their own systems of life and\nGovernment, free from threats.\nIf there is a lesson to be learned from the experience\nof the century now drawing to a close, it is the versatility\nof the human endeavour. Mankind has an incorrigible\ntendency to make mistakes, but also a talent for correcting\nthem and for building from the rubble the new portals of\nfreedom and faith.\nWith the approach of the new millennium, at an hour\nthat is both dusk and dawn, we must look upon the events\nof the world from the dual perspective of humility and\nhope.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me great pleasure\nto offer Foreign Minister Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine\nthe felicitations of my delegation on his assumption of the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-second\nsession. I am confident that, under his experienced\nleadership, we will achieve substantive progress in our\nwork.\nI should also like to pay tribute to his predecessor,\nMr. Razali Ismail, for the skilful manner in which he\nguided our deliberations during an extraordinarily busy\nyear. His purposeful and decisive stewardship secured the\nsuccess of the fifty-first session of the General Assembly.\nI join other members in commending our Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his report \u201cRenewing the\nUnited Nations: A Programme for Reform\u201d. His initiative\ndeserves our praise and the recommendations in the report\nmerit our serious consideration.\nSince we met last year, world developments have\ncontinued to show a mixture of bright promise, new\n7\n\n\nchallenges and pervasive uncertainty. The post-cold-war era\nhas opened up new possibilities for the solution of\npersistent problems and conflicts and the pursuit of a global\nagenda for peace and development. In various parts of the\nworld, protagonists have shown a desire to resolve their\ndifferences through dialogue and negotiations. Globalization\nhas raised the hopes of mankind for equitably shared\nprosperity.\nYet, intra-State conflicts continue to rage in many\nparts of the world even as the international community\nfaces a multitude of new and unpredictable threats and\nchallenges. Despite significant strides in limiting\narmaments, the destructive power of nuclear weapons\ncontinues to pose a threat to all life on Earth. Poverty and\nbackwardness hold dominion over vast areas of the\ndeveloping world, while the developing countries are\nincreasingly marginalized in international economic\ndecision-making.\nWe cannot hope to rid the world of these systemic\nproblems unless we can devise an effective system of\nglobal governance capable of managing the impact of\nglobalization and interdependence, fulfilling the interlinked\ndemands of peace, security and development, and\nreconciling the competing interests of a constantly widening\nrange of actors in international affairs. For that system of\nglobal governance to be effective and universally accepted,\nit must have for its central mechanism and source of\nlegitimacy a United Nations revitalized through a process\nof judicious reform and democratization.\nMy delegation has therefore welcomed the United\nNations reform package that the Secretary-General\npresented to the General Assembly last July. We support\nthe endeavour to transform the leadership and management\nstructure of the Organization so that it can address the\nchallenges of the new millennium with a greater sense of\npurpose, effectiveness and efficiency. We commend the\nproposal to promote sustained and sustainable development\nthrough, inter alia, the creation of a \u201cdevelopment\ndividend\u201d by shifting resources to development activities,\nespecially those for poverty alleviation.\nWe attach great importance to the proposed measure\nto overcome the financial crisis of the Organization through\nthe creation of a revolving credit fund pending the\nattainment of a permanent solution to the crisis. Just as\ncrucial is the idea of enhancing the effectiveness of the\nUnited Nations in disarmament activities by establishing a\nnew department for disarmament and arms regulation, to be\nheaded by an Under-Secretary-General. That new\ndepartment, however, should squarely address the\nquestion of nuclear disarmament as a priority issue and\nnot only the non-proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nWe also welcome the efforts to improve the\nOrganization's ability to deploy peacekeeping and other\nfield operations more rapidly, enhance the United Nations\ncapacity for post-conflict peace-building, strengthen\ninternational efforts to combat drugs, crime and terrorism,\nand bolster international response to global humanitarian\nneeds. The reorganization and restructuring of the human\nrights secretariat is also timely and appropriate. However,\nthe idea of extending human rights activities by\nintegrating them into all United Nations activities and\nprogrammes entails careful study. Hence, Indonesia stands\nready to participate constructively in the detailed\ndiscussions on the proposed reform package which will\ntake place during this Assembly.\nOf equally vital concern is the question of the\nreform and expansion of the Security Council so as to\nreflect the realities of today and to accommodate the basic\ninterests of the developing countries which comprise the\noverwhelming majority in the Organization. On the\nexpansion of membership of the Council, our view is well\nknown: that new permanent members should be chosen\nnot only on the basis of equitable geographic\nrepresentation, but also on the basis of a set of criteria\nsuch as political, economic and demographic weight; their\ncapability and their track record of contributing to the\npromotion of peace both regionally and globally; and their\ncommitment to assume responsibilities inherent to\npermanent membership. And we should first discuss and\nagree on this set of criteria before we determine who\nrepresents which region or which group of Member\ncountries. We should not put the cart before the horse.\nIn this regard, predetermined numerical limitations\nwould unduly restrict and possibly distort the\nrepresentative value of the expansion of the Security\nCouncil. The African Member countries have indicated\nthat they would like to have two permanent seats\nrepresenting their region. By the same token, we believe\nthat it is legitimate that the new composition of the\nSecurity Council should have two new permanent\nmembers from among the developing countries of the\nAsian continent.\nAs emphasized by the Ministerial Conference of the\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries, held last April in\nNew Delhi, there should be no partial or selective\n8\n\n\nexpansion of the membership of the Security Council to the\ndetriment of the developing countries, and efforts to\nrestructure the Council should not be subject to any\nimposed time-frame, for although the issue is urgent it\nshould not be decided before there is general agreement.\nThe Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement also\nstressed that the use of the veto should be curtailed with a\nview to its eventual elimination, and that the improvement\nof the working methods of the Council should be given\nequal importance.\nWhile we are deeply engaged in this process of reform\nwe must not lose sight of the fundamental goals that\nimpelled us to undertake it in the first place: to enhance the\nOrganization's ability to foster development and to address\nthe root causes of poverty and conflict. Reform should not\nbecome a euphemism for budget slashing or an excuse for\ncertain Member States to renege on their financial\nobligations to the Organization. When reforms are in place,\nthey could indeed ensure optimum use of resources and\ngenerate savings. But they could become meaningless if,\ndue to insolvency, the United Nations were rendered\nincapable of fulfilling its mission.\nMuch of the insecurity in the world today stems from\nthe fact that the international community has not been able\nto abolish nuclear armaments. The Non-Proliferation Treaty\nhas been indefinitely extended, but without any guarantee\nthat the commitment to nuclear disarmament will be\nhonoured. We are also dismayed that the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty does not effectively prohibit\nnuclear testing in all environments and for all time, without\nloopholes or exceptions.\nNevertheless, we signed the Treaty in the hope that the\nnuclear Powers on their own would refrain from testing\nthrough simulation. That hope has been shattered by the\nsub-critical tests announced recently by a nuclear-weapon\nState. Although these sub-critical tests do not legally violate\nthe CTBT, they make a travesty of the spirit of the Treaty.\nThe nuclear Powers should desist from conducting such\ntests, as they could lead to the resumption of the nuclear\narms race and its attendant risk of global disaster.\nMeanwhile, in South-East Asia, the South-East Asia\nNuclear- Weapon-Free Zone Treaty came into force earlier\nthis year. We hope that the nuclear-weapon States will also\ncontribute to regional security by their timely accession to\nthe relevant Protocol of the Treaty.\nIn the Middle East we are witnessing a continuing\nescalation in Israeli provocative acts. Israel's encroachments\non East Jerusalem, especially in Jabal Abu Ghneim, have\nplunged the peace process into deeper crisis and triggered\nunrest and tension on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\nIsrael persists in its illegal construction activities, in\nblockading Palestinian territory and besieging Palestinian\ncities and towns and in withholding funds belonging to\nthe Palestinian Authority.\nThe imposition of a harsh regimen of collective\npunishment contravenes all international legal norms and\nprinciples and violates the fundamental rights of the\nPalestinian people. We must therefore vigorously support\nall efforts to restore the momentum of the peace process\nand to bring about the resumption of negotiations based\non the provisions of the Declaration of Principles and the\nprinciple of land for peace. And we must continue to\npress for progress on the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-\nIsraeli tracks of the peace process, for without such\nprogress a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East\nquestion is not possible.\nIn Cambodia, the recent regrettable turn of events,\nwhich resulted in a significant change in the governmental\nset-up and political situation has threatened to plunge the\ncountry back into factional strife and instability. The\ninterests of the Association of South-East Asian Nations\n(ASEAN) and Cambodia are inextricably linked, and the\nstability of Cambodia is essential to the stability of the\nSouth-East Asian region. Therefore, while ASEAN\nreaffirms its commitment to the principle of non-\ninterference in the internal affairs of other States, it stands\nready to contribute its efforts to help restore political\nstability in Cambodia. Accordingly, ASEAN has proposed\nthe immediate cessation of all armed hostilities and acts\nof violence throughout Cambodia and called on the\nconflicting parties to resolve their differences amicably.\nIndonesia believes that a principled solution can only\nbe reached through dialogue, with the aim of preserving\nthe coalition Government that reflects the power-sharing\narrangements resulting from the elections of 1993, held\nunder the auspices of the United Nations. Furthermore,\nfree and fair elections should be held as scheduled next\nMay, with the participation of all Cambodian parties and\npolitical forces as an important element of its success.\nIndonesia welcomes the convening of the four-party\ntalks among the Republic of Korea, the Democratic\nPeople's Republic of Korea, the United States and the\nPeople's Republic of China. We believe that a positive\noutcome to these talks will pave the way for the\nestablishment of a permanent peace mechanism and that\n9\n\n\nthe Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization\n(KEDO) will facilitate endeavours towards a lasting\nsolution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina the implementation of the\nPeace Agreement has entered a critical phase. Key\nprovisions of the Agreement remain unimplemented.\nRefugees and displaced persons continue to be denied their\nright to return to their pre-war homes. Freedom of\nmovement has not been restored fully, and discrimination\nand harassment are still prevalent. Challenges remain in the\nfunctioning of the common State institutions that are so\nvital to unity and reconciliation.\nThe unravelling of the Peace Accord would have\ndevastating consequences for Bosnia and Herzegovina and\nits neighbours. All concerned should therefore join ranks\nand work together to ensure the irreversibility of the peace\nprocess and the full implementation of the Peace Accords.\nIt is encouraging to note from the World Economic\nand Social Survey and other authoritative sources that the\nglobal economy is basically healthy, that growth rates have\nrisen for the third consecutive year and that such progress\nhas been more widespread than before. However, we have\nno illusions that the global economy has fully recovered\nfrom a protracted period of decline during the past decade.\nThe echoes of the recession in the 1980s are still\nreverberating. Millions in the developing world are still\nlanguishing in wrenching poverty. And this new growth has\nhad little impact on rates of unemployment and under-\nemployment. In fact, it would take another 10 years of\nsimilar growth just to recover the gross domestic product\nper capita levels of the early 1980s.\nGlobalization has indeed brought about an\nunprecedented surge in international trade, investments and\ninformation flows, but it has also accentuated the inequities\nand imbalances of international economic relations. Only\nthe developed economies have fully benefited from it. The\ndeveloping countries as a whole continue to suffer its\nnegative impact while being marginalized from international\neconomic decision-making processes in which they could\notherwise seek redress from the inequities weighing down\ntheir development efforts.\nEven developing economies that have attained some\nmeasure of dynamism are not immune to the perils of\nglobalization and liberalization. Given the sharp fluctuations\nof international financial flows and currency manipulation\nby speculators, economies built through years of patient,\nsound and solid fiscal and monetary policies could be\ncrushed overnight in the anarchy of the globalized market\nplace. Globalization should, therefore, be managed so as\nto soften its impact on vulnerable economies.\nIndonesia welcomes the adoption by the General\nAssembly of An Agenda for Development, a major\ninitiative designed to restore the theme of development to\nthe centre of the operations of the United Nations. The\nAgenda provides a comprehensive framework of\nprinciples and measures designed to promote development\nas a vital preoccupation of the international community.\nIt also seeks to restore the centrality of the United\nNations in the pursuit of international cooperation for\ndevelopment.\nPerhaps the greatest constraint to development today\nis the dearth of financial resources for development.\nWhile there is an increased emphasis on foreign direct\ninvestment, and this is welcome, the fact remains that\nofficial development assistance constitutes the principal\nsource of development financing for the majority of the\ndeveloping countries. Regrettably, official development\nassistance is in sharp decline, and has today reached its\nlowest level since target levels were adopted in 1970.\nBecause many developing countries are unable to attract\nadequate volumes of foreign direct investment, the\nconstriction of official development assistance has taken\nan enormous toll on their social and economic\ndevelopment, particularly in their efforts aimed at\nreducing hunger, illiteracy and child mortality. We\ntherefore support the proposal in the reform package\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General for the creation of an\nOffice of Development Financing that will pursue this\nendeavour full-time in tandem with the proposed\n\u201cdevelopment dividend\u201d.\nThe problem of chronic external indebtedness\nconstitutes another debilitating impediment to\ndevelopment. Despite various debt relief initiatives in the\npast, many developing countries remain crippled by their\ndebt overhangs. My country has always advocated a once-\nand-for-all approach that entails a reduction of\nindebtedness to a level that will allow resumption of\ndevelopment. We therefore support the Heavily Indebted\nPoor Countries Initiative of the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) and the World Bank, as it would help some\nof the poorest countries escape the vicious cycle of\nindebtedness and deprivation and once again take the road\nto development. In this context, Indonesia has pledged, as\na concrete expression of this support, $10 million to the\nWorld Bank's Trust Fund for the debt relief of the heavily\nindebted poor countries. We also urge that these\n10\n\n\ninitiatives be implemented expeditiously and with\nflexibility, and that they cover other heavily indebted\ncountries that are also in dire need of development.\nIn this era of trade liberalization, and in spite of the\npresence of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the\ndeveloping countries are finding their comparative\nadvantage rendered meaningless by an array of non-tariff\nbarriers, preference-erosion and the misuse of anti-dumping\nmeasures and countervailing duties. Moreover, the\npersistent attempts of developed countries to link\ninternational trade issues with extraneous issues, such as\nlabour standards, amount to a new form of protectionism.\nSuch insidious obstacles to free and open trade have to be\ndone away with so that the global economy can benefit\nfrom an equitable, transparent and rule-based multilateral\ntrading system, with the World Trade Organization as its\nembodiment.\nOur common aspirations for global economic and\nsocial development will never be realized until all forms of\ndiscrimination are removed from society and opportunity is\nafforded equitably to all humanity. The Programme of\nAction for the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial\nDiscrimination (1993-2003) should be the vehicle of our\nendeavours to end all forms of racism and racial\ndiscrimination. The Beijing Declaration and Platform for\nAction, adopted at the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen, must be vigorously implemented at all levels.\nLikewise, implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration\nand Programme of Action is essential for the attainment of\na positive environment for enhancing the human condition.\nAs to the environment, it is regrettable that the special\nsession of the General Assembly devoted to the review of\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment and Agenda 21 has revealed that the\ncommitments to the Rio Conference and to the Agenda\nhave not been substantially fulfilled. The international\ncommunity, particularly the countries that have the\ntechnological and financial resources, must summon the\npolitical will to bring positive action to support Agenda 21.\nVigorous measures should also be taken in defence of\nour human resources and social values against the thrusts of\ninternational crime, drug trafficking and drug abuse. We\ntherefore remain committed to support the mechanisms of\nthe United Nations anti-crime and anti-drug programmes.\nWe look forward to the convening of a special session of\nthe General Assembly in 1998 to assess the situation and to\ndevelop further ways and means of combating these\ninternational social evils.\nIn the area of human rights, the United Nations\nshould continue to strengthen its role as the architect of\na common plan based on a holistic approach toward the\npromotion of, and respect for, the inherent dignity of the\nhuman being. At all levels, we must work with all\ninterested parties, maintain constructive relationships and\nfoster dialogue and cooperation as the most effective\nmeans of advancing human rights. In this regard,\nIndonesia stands ready to cooperate with the High\nCommissioner for Human Rights. We also support all\ninitiatives promoting a more balanced approach to human\nrights. In this context, we note with interest the 19-point\nUniversal Declaration on Human Responsibilities\nproposed by the InterAction Council. We agree with\nformer Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, the\nInterAction Council Chairman, that, if adopted by the\ninternational community, the Declaration on Human\nResponsibilities, together with the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights, could serve as twin pillars providing an\nethical base for a just world. Indeed, freedom without\nacceptance of responsibility can destroy freedom itself,\nwhereas when rights and responsibilities are balanced,\nfreedom is enhanced. We have always held that although\nthe individual should not be sacrificed in the name of\nsociety, neither should society be allowed to disintegrate\nto accommodate the individual. Without this fine balance,\nneither rights nor responsibilities can meaningfully exist.\nAllow me to take this opportunity to express the\ngratitude of my Government to the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) for the singular honour\nit recently bestowed on Indonesia by formally citing\nHis Excellency President Soeharto and the people of\nIndonesia for\n\u201coutstanding accomplishments and commitments to\nthe significant reduction and continued eradication of\npoverty in Indonesia and for making poverty\neradication an overriding theme of national\ndevelopment efforts.\u201d\nThis is an honour that Indonesia holds in trust for all\ndeveloping countries endeavouring, in spite of their\nconstraints and adversities, to attain a better life for their\npeoples while still contributing to the making of a better\nworld. With developed and developing nations working\ntogether within the framework of a revitalized United\nNations, we can indeed before too long achieve the final\nconquest of the most formidable and tenacious enemy of\nhumankind, poverty.\n11\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to extend to the\nPresident the warm congratulations of my delegation on his\nelection to preside over the fifty-second session of the\nGeneral Assembly. We are on the verge of what may be a\ndefining moment in the direction and capabilities of the\nOrganization. His vast diplomatic experience assures us that\nat this moment the reins will indeed be in very capable\nhands.\nWe must also deeply thank his predecessor,\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for the high level\nof relevance, focus and commitment achieved at the fifty-\nfirst session under his bold and astute stewardship as\nPresident. His forthright appraisals of the critical issues\nfacing the Organization, particularly the extraordinary\nimpetus he injected into the question of the reform of the\nUnited Nations, will be felt well into the next millennium.\nWe are also very pleased to offer our sincere\ncongratulations to the new Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan. In less than a year since assuming that high\nresponsibility he has already brought his considerable\nexperience and vision to bear on the operations of the\nUnited Nations. Throughout his long and faithful service\nwith the United Nations he has demonstrated a keen\nawareness of the need for a strong and responsive\nOrganization. His all-encompassing reform proposals go a\nlong way towards realizing a dream that has often eluded\nus in the past. We are confident he will persevere in his\nonerous task of keeping the Organization afloat.\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the\nOrganization is an excellent starting point for an overview\nof the principal issues confronting mankind today. On the\none hand, there are widespread ripple effects emanating\nfrom the end of the cold war, the advent of a single global\nmarket and the trend towards democratization and respect\nfor human rights. On the other hand, there are the ominous\ntrends towards the fragmentation of societies, the search for\nnew identities and the consequent spread of civil strife and\nconflict. Today, therefore, the need to deal with post-\nconflict situations is as critical as the need to prevent them.\nThere is now universal recognition that much of this\nconflict is the result of the widespread poverty and severe\nunderdevelopment facing many societies.\nFor an economy to overcome poverty and\nunderdevelopment it must today participate in the global\neconomy, which has become a driving force in the world.\nThe 1997 World Economic and Social Survey suggests\nthat all developing countries and countries with\neconomies in transition need to raise per capita income by\nat least 3 per cent annually. To achieve that, however, the\nSurvey contends, and the Secretary-General agrees, the\nless affluent countries, in particular, require a more\nconducive external economic environment than now exists\nfor them.\nThe elements that until quite recently served to\ndefine our world have dramatically and rapidly changed.\nThe predominant concerns of global atomic warfare and\nthe cold war and the destructive policies of colonialism\nand apartheid have quickly given way to the challenges of\npoverty, globalism and development. This has created an\nunprecedented demand for the services of the United\nNations at a time when it is facing critical challenges in\na world of revolutionary change.\nTo remain relevant, the United Nations must carry\nout fundamental structural adjustments or changes, which\ncan no longer be addressed through ad hoc, piecemeal\nreforms. A coordinated, top-down, comprehensive reform\nof the entire edifice is necessary to overhaul and\nstreamline the Secretariat; create a new organizational\nculture and focus; consolidate functions; do away with\noverlapping programmes and duplications; eliminate\nfinancial waste; mobilize new resources for development;\nand strengthen and enhance coordination of United\nNations operations at the field level. The savings derived\nfrom such rationalizations, trimming of inefficiencies and\nadministrative costs could be directed to development for\neconomic and social activities. These, it seems, are\nprecisely the aims of the Secretary-General\u2019s extensive\nand far-reaching proposals, issued under the title\n\u201cRenewing the United Nations: A Programme for\nReform\u201d. They are a serious and bold set of proposals\nthat deserve our utmost consideration. Djibouti fully\nsupports the proposals and endorses their implementation\nas a package.\nThe General Assembly at this session has\ndemonstrated overwhelming support for the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s reform proposals, particularly in their design as\nan integrated package. They should be considered as such\nby this plenary. It would be helpful to look at the\nproposals as the United Nations equivalent of the World\nBank\u2019s new Strategic Compact. Each initiative is intended\nto take its respective organization into the next\nmillennium by bringing about a fundamental renewal of\nthe institution.\n15\n\n\nWe know that every element of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s package may not generate agreement across the\nboard. Divergences of views are bound to occur and are to\nbe expected. Indeed, genuine fears, even scepticism, have\nbeen voiced against a reform process that may translate\nsimply into a cost-cutting exercise, which ultimately may\nmean less focus on underdevelopment, poverty and social\ndislocations. These are valid concerns which I am sure the\nSecretary-General is conscious of and must address. But for\nthe sake of the larger purpose at stake, let us refrain from\nminuscule nit-picking. We need, rather, to adopt a\npragmatic and positive approach to the package. In this\nway, we can spare ourselves from long and protracted, if\nnot interminable, discussions which, as we know from\nexperience, too often end in committee gridlock, a type of\nparalysis by analysis.\nBowing to the realities of the Organization\u2019s dire\nfinancial predicament, the Secretary-General has\naccordingly fashioned a credible reorganization that will\nenhance efficiency and responsiveness and effectively\ncontribute to a strengthened Untied Nations, capable of\nfulfilling its mission.\nThere appears to be a near universal consensus on the\nneed to reform the United Nations. Regrettably though,\nmuch of the impetus is dictated by the Organization\u2019s acute\nfinancial situation. Were all Member States to honour their\ntreaty commitments to pay their assessment obligations in\nfull, on time and without condition, reform would focus\nmore on what the United Nations can and must do than on\nwhat it cannot and is unable to do. An effective United\nNations cannot operate on subsistence, hand-to-mouth and\never dwindling resources that perpetually keep it on the\nbrink of bankruptcy.\nUltimately, the financial solvency of the United\nNations is the responsibility of Member States. Sound\nfinances are the sine qua non of the effectiveness and\nstability of the Organization. Without a continuous and\npredictable flow of resources, the danger posed to the\nindependence, if not survival, of the United Nations is very\nreal.\nThe issue of Security Council reform need not be\nlinked to the reform proposal presented by the Secretary-\nGeneral. The latter must run its own course and, acted upon\nindependently, culminate in a resolution for its adoption.\nIn step with the growth in membership of the\nOrganization, the Council must be enlarged to reflect the\npressing need for equitable representation. In view of the\nconsiderable debate this issue has generated over the\nyears, we believe that the time has come for a change in\nthe Security Council, particularly with the admission of\nnew permanent members from all the regions of the world\nand from the industrialized countries, wielding the same\npowers as the existing ones. As we all know, a cardinal\ntenet of the thesis of good governance is that all members\nof a body politic have a fair and equal role in decisions\nwhich affect them. Djibouti fully endorses the position of\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Non-\nAligned Movement regarding the expansion, composition\nand working methods of the Council.\nExcept as a metaphor for international peacekeeping\nfailure, Somalia has exited the international radar screen\nof concern. This is regrettable, for there have been\npersistent regional and international efforts to initiate\ndialogue among the parties. True, much of Somalia\ncontinues to exist in a cycle of misery and political\nimpasse, lacking a central authority, internal security and\nnational cohesion. The spread of conventional weapons\nhas engendered insecurity and political uncertainty \u2014 a\nlooming threat even to the warlords and to the long-range\nprospects for peace in the country and the region.\nPerhaps, as is often the case, there may be foreign\nelements that are developing profitable interests under the\npresent state of anarchy.\nThere is, however, a growing and encouraging\nemergence of a movement to reconstitute some form of\nnational structure and to set aside differences. We cannot\nignore this glimmer of hope, however elusive. With one\nor two notable exceptions, the factions seem to have\nresolved to hold a conference this November in Somalia,\nin the town of Bossaso. The aim is to establish an interim\nauthority whose main task will be to prepare the\ngroundwork for drafting a constitution, holding elections\nand the emergence, hopefully, of a national Government.\nThis subregional effort, spearheaded by Ethiopia, not only\nenjoys the wide support of many Governments and\norganizations, but is perhaps the most promising initiative\nat the moment.\nThe interminable stalling of progress towards\nreconciliation, the stifling stalemate, must come to an end.\nThe time has come to say to our Somali sisters and\nbrothers, \u201cEnough is enough!\u201d Enough misery, mayhem,\nbloodshed and destruction. Enough of the senseless\nindifference to and reckless disregard for life, property\nand nationhood. Enough of the grim prospects of an\nuncertain future for a whole generation of Somalis.\nEnough of assigning Somalia to the footnotes of history.\n16\n\n\nIn the final analysis, the creativity, vision and determination\nof the Somali people shall prevail. For all its anarchy and\ndestruction, Somalia can benefit from the example of\nLiberia, which, like Somalia, was a country written off, a\ncountry in name only, just a few months ago. There as\nwell, conflict between warlords and factions succeeded only\nin bringing the country to its knees. Now, through\nconcerted dialogue and determination, and constant\nprodding by the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS) and the United Nations, elections have\nbeen held and stability and peace reestablished, and there\nis a legitimate Government which enjoys international\nrecognition. The same could be true for Somalia.\nThe countries of the region, the United Nations,\nnations with a historic relationship with Somalia and the\ninternational community at large must support, morally as\nwell as materially, the ongoing efforts to bring about\ndialogue, reconciliation, lasting peace and harmony in\nSomalia. As in Liberia, that may be the gist of the message\nSomalia is sending the international community at this\ncritical juncture. We must respond, and respond united,\nwith one voice.\nBy virtue of the close proximity and the many\ncommon factors that bind us together, Djibouti has a special\ninterest in the destiny and well-being of the Somali people.\nThat is why, as far back as 1991, at the advent of the\nconflict, we took the lead in bringing the contending parties\ntogether in two successive and substantive reconciliation\nconferences in Djibouti. Since then we have remained\nseized of the situation there. It is well known that Djibouti\nhas received a staggering flow of refugees from Somalia,\nwhich, in relation to our size and resources, has been\noverwhelming. This mammoth humanitarian undertaking on\nour part is indeed beyond our capacity to sustain\nindefinitely. We appeal to the international community to\ncontinue to be supportive of our sacrifices by contributing\nsubstantially towards the mitigation of this burden.\nThe Horn of Africa region is passing through a period\nof relative stability and rejuvenation. The aftermaths of\nprevious conflicts are still visible, of course, in the extent\nof physical, institutional and human destruction.\nReconstruction will require genuine regional cooperation.\nOur peoples, our land, our waters and coastlines and our\neconomies are too interdependent to survive in isolation.\nThat is the spirit which must prevail.\nWe have an important regional institution in the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD),\nwhich serves as a regional focus for development\ncooperation and conflict resolution. Its capability and\nresources deserve the continued support of the\ninternational community.\nDjibouti continues its economic transformation,\ninstitutional reform and demobilization process. For each\nof these we continue to require generous international\nassistance, and towards this end wish to express our\nappreciation for the commitments pledged during the\nround-table conference held in May this year under the\numbrella of the United Nations Development Programme\nand the Bretton Woods institutions.\nThe legacy of past instability, widespread conflict\nand State collapse in the Horn of Africa have had many\ndisruptive consequences for Djibouti. No doubt we\nsuffered in tandem with our neighbours. But we are\nconfident our efforts to deal with these difficulties will be\nsupported by the international community.\nThe Mid-Term Review of the Implementation of the\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\nAfrica in the 1990s and the United Nations Conference on\nTrade and Development Least Developed Countries 1997\nreport indicate that the ominous slide suffered by many\nleast developed countries during the 1980s was reversed\nin 1995, and improvements continued into 1996. Despite\ndeclines in commodity prices and terms of trade, a\nnumber of least developed countries have enjoyed positive\ngrowth rates, indicating the beneficial effects of ongoing\nstructural adjustment efforts. These encouraging signs\ncomplemented efforts towards democratization, good\ngovernance and regional economic cooperation.\nNowadays it is commonly accepted that as more\npeoples and countries participate in the global economy,\nproduction and wealth increase for everyone. It is equally\ntrue, however, that in this era of rapid globalization many\ndeveloping countries with small markets, poor\ninfrastructures, unskilled manpower and high levels of\nexternal debt are excluded from the benefits of\nglobalization and are unable to cope with the challenges.\nMost of the least developed countries \u2014 and 33 of the\nworld\u2019s 48 are in Africa \u2014 face the risk of further\nmarginalization despite determined efforts towards\nreforms which must merit greater international support.\nCoupled with this is the falling of official\ndevelopment assistance, which Norway\u2019s Minister for\nDevelopment Cooperation described as unacceptable,\nsince the poorest countries need to finance basic social\n17\n\n\nservices and infrastructure as well as capacity-building and\ncompetence.\nThe least developed countries, particularly those in\nAfrica, tread a fine line between sustainable progress and\ndecline. They are expected to carry out extensive reforms\nwhile concurrently addressing the social needs brought\nabout by widespread poverty, environmental degradation\nand urban explosions. Africa also continues to attract\nnegligible foreign direct investment flows, which are largely\nconcentrated in a few countries.\nThe internal conflicts raging in a number of African\ncountries seriously further undermine an already fragile\nregional stability. African leaders and organizations such as\nthe Organization of African Unity, the Economic\nCommunity of West African States, IGAD and the Southern\nAfrican Development Community (SADC), together with\nthe international community, are engaged in active and\nrelentless efforts to bring about cessation of hostilities,\nreconciliations and the re-establishment of law and order.\nOn the positive side, we congratulate Liberia for\nhaving finally overcome the prolonged and sustained\nbloodshed and self-destruction. We deplore however,\ngrowing signs of a resurgence of hostilities in Angola, and\nwe condemn the overthrow of Sierra Leone\u2019s constitutional\nand legitimate Government. We hope the efforts of the\ncountries of the region through ECOWAS will be crowned\nwith success.\nLikewise, we applaud the tenacity of President Omar\nBongo of Gabon and Ambassador Mohamed Sahnoun, the\nUnited Nations/Organization of African Unity Special\nRepresentative, in the effort to secure a durable ceasefire in\nBrazzaville and to find a political solution in the face of\nopen and undisguised challenges to the authority of the\nelected President.\nSimilar challenges have either succeeded or stalemated\nin Burundi, the Central African Republic and, now,\nComoros. We hope reason will eventually prevail in all\nthese situations so that the people are spared further strife\nand uncertainty.\nIn this context, I welcome the timely initiative by\nSecretary of State Madeleine Albright, to convene a special\nministerial meeting of the United Nations Security Council\non Africa, which took place on 25 September 1997. We\nbelieve such bold initiatives will help mitigate the ominous\ntendencies of increasing insularity and inward focus of\nmany developed countries, where events in far-off places\nno longer seem so relevant to core interests within them.\nWe welcome Secretary of State Albright\u2019s injection\nof new momentum into the peace process between Israel\nand the Palestinians. Unilateral decisions by Israel must\nstop, and Israel must also refrain from actions which\ncontinuously disrupt and divert the direction of the talks.\nContrary to what Israel wants us to believe, the peace\nprocess has not been faltering on account of the suicide\nbombings alone \u2014 which, unfortunately, took many\nlives \u2014 but because of Israel\u2019s refusal to implement\nterms of the Interim Agreement.\nNo one, of course, condones the bombings, with\ntheir gruesome human toll. They are acts which must be\ncondemned and only underscore the urgency of resuming\nthe peace process with a genuine determination. The\npunishment meted out on Palestinian territories has only\nfurther aggravated an explosive situation. Predictably, the\neconomic effects have been devastating. Ironically, Oslo\nhad convinced a majority of Palestinians that it might be\npossible to coexist with Israel in peace under an\nindependent Palestinian State controlling its own destiny.\nYet now they are little more than security hostages under\nrelentless coercion and pressures.\nThe basic situation in Palestine has not changed.\nIsrael needs security and peace; Palestinians need land, as\nwell as peace and security. Neither can unilaterally dictate\nterms to the other side. Escalating punishment will not\nbring security. Israel needs to demonstrate its seriousness\nand its willingness to move towards secure peace in the\nMiddle East and towards credible negotiations and lasting\nsettlement on the basis of resolutions 242 (1967), 338\n(1973), and 425 (1978), exchanging land for peace.\nFor the overwhelming majority of humanity the\ndisillusioning regression in the peace process has caused\ndeep anguish. It would be a pity if the yearning for peace,\nsecurity, justice and resolution continues to be eschewed\nand misdirected. We are quite hopeful Secretary Albright\nwill persevere to keep the process on track.\nOnce again we implore Iran and the United Arab\nEmirates to commence serious negotiations to peacefully\nresolve the dispute regarding the three islands occupied\nby Iran.\nThe recently concluded Oslo Diplomatic Conference\nseeking a worldwide ban on the production, distribution,\nstockpiling and use of landmines was clearly a watershed\n18\n\n\nevent. We welcome this landmark achievement, which now\nprovides us with a vehicle to stop the slaughter of so many\nthousands of human beings each year by the 110 million\ndevices already in place all over the world.\nTo prevent our global village from becoming an armed\ncamp, the landmine Convention, to be signed in Ottawa this\nDecember, is perhaps as critical as the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Chemical\nWeapons Convention. Landmines are surely as dangerous\nas terrorism, drug trafficking and international mobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, allow me sincerely to\ncongratulate you, a representative of friendly Ukraine, on\nyour election to this responsible and honoured post. We\nare confident that under your Presidency, the General\nAssembly will be able to achieve significant results.\nIn just a little over 800 days, mankind will enter\nupon the twenty-first century. From a historical point of\nview, this is indeed no more than a sprinter\u2019s lap, and\nthus the need to look at what lies ahead, at what awaits\nus, would appear quite natural.\nOne year ago, in speaking from this rostrum, I spoke\nabout the emerging process of a transition to a multipolar\nworld order. The developments of the past year support\nthat. There is a growing diversity in the political,\neconomic and cultural development of countries. New\ncentres of economic and political influence in the world\nare shaping up, coupled, at the same time, with increased\nintermeshing of the interests of different States and\npeoples.\nThe horizons opening up to the international\ncommunity in the twenty-first century are making new\ndemands. These are the assertion of the ideals of\ninterdependency and partnership in inter-State relations;\nthe prevention of the emergence of new dividing lines or\nexclusive bloc structures; and strict adherence by all to\nthe principles and rules of international law. As a separate\nissue, I should like to cite not only the creation of\nconditions for economic and social progress of all\ncountries, but also the maintenance of environmental\nbalance.\nThere is also a need to mention that the transition\nfrom a confrontational bipolar world to a multipolar\nsystem per se would not provide a solution to these\n17\n\n\nproblems. Furthermore, realistically minded people realize\nthat although we are moving farther away from the\nsimplistic stereotypes of the ideological confrontation era,\nthe number of existing risks and threats in the world is not\ndecreasing.\nRegional conflicts continue to be one of the major\nsources of instability on the global level; they should not be\nallowed to continue into the twenty-first century. How can\nthis be achieved? A characteristic of our days is the\nincreasing number of intra-State problems \u2014 conflicts of an\nethnic rather than social nature. There are many\nmultinational States in the world today, and we support the\ninitiatives designed to prevent their forcible disintegration.\nThe formula for settling such conflicts in today\u2019s\nworld \u2014 and, of course, in the twenty-first century \u2014 can\nand must combine the need to preserve the territorial\nintegrity of those States with the provision of the maximum\npossible number of rights to their national minorities. To\nabandon any of the principles of this two-track formula\nwould result not only in the continuation but in the\ndangerous escalation of such conflict situations.\nLikewise, I wish to draw the Assembly\u2019s particular\nattention to a dangerous aspect of regional conflicts: their\nability to trigger terrorist waves and spread them far and\nwide beyond the borders of the actual conflict zone. For\nexample, many of the militants who launched a bloody\ncampaign of terror in a number of countries emerged out of\nthe ongoing armed conflict that still rages in Afghanistan.\nWe strongly support the combat against terrorism,\nwhatever trappings it may don, be it in Ireland or in Israel.\nToday, we will not be able to prevail in this fight without\nall States pooling their efforts to combat this greatest of\nevils. While we oppose the backing of terrorism in any\nform by any Government, we believe that we cannot\nstigmatize individual Member States forever as international\nrogues, irrespective of changes in their policies, simply\nbecause of their suspected links to terrorists.\nIn the present-day world, no country can hold a\nmonopoly on any kind of conflict-resolution effort. This\nfully applies as well to the long-standing conflict in the\nMiddle East, where the settlement process has been\nstalemated. As the saying goes, \u201cit takes two hands to\napplaud\u201d. Broad-based international efforts are required to\nundo the taut Middle East knot. Russia, as one of the co-\nsponsors of the peace process launched in 1991 in Madrid,\nis prepared actively to cooperate actively with all to attain\nthis goal.\nFor many years, so too has the Cyprus issue been\nawaiting the effective international cooperation needed for\nits resolution.\nA synergy of efforts would provide the shortest cut\nto the resolution of both long-standing and of relatively\nnew conflicts. But our stance by no means implies \u2014 and\nI wish to emphasize this \u2014 that any individual country\nthat has influence in a zone of conflict or that can exert\nit over conflicting parties should not make active use of\nits own potential. It must do so, however, without putting\nup a high fence around itself to ward off others.\nI should like in this connection to draw the\nAssembly\u2019s attention to Russia\u2019s peacekeeping efforts in\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States region. First of\nall, as concerns Tajikistan, Russia is doing a great deal\nsince we are equipped with the particular tools needed to\ndo the job, in part for historical reasons. Our efforts have\nproved rather effective. Recently in Moscow an\nagreement was signed that put an end to the armed strife\nbetween the Government and the opposition in that\ncountry. The return to Dushanbe of Mr. Nuri, the\nopposition leader, shows that the agreement is already\nworking.\nNevertheless, we want only our fair share of the\ndeal. We note with satisfaction that the attitudes of Russia\nand the United Nations towards the parameters of the\noperation in Tajikistan are in concurrence, based on the\nclose cooperation between the United Nations Observer\nMission, the collective Commonwealth of Independent\nStates peacekeeping force, and the contingent of Russian\nborder troops. We welcome the intention of the United\nNations to expand the mandate of its observers and to\nincrease their number.\nNagorny Karabakh provides yet another example.\nActing on its own, Russia has done a great deal to\nstabilize the situation in the region. But I believe that we\nhave quite productively cooperated with the United States\nand France, which, jointly with Russia, are acting as co-\nchairmen of the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe\u2019s Minsk process to settle the\nNagorny Karabakh conflict. The Georgian-Abkhaz\nconflict offers a similar example.\nI should now like to say a few words about\npeacekeeping as a whole. Over the last few years, a trend\nhas been observed towards its decentralization. Naturally,\nthere are objective reasons for this: the financial\nconstraints placed on the United Nations, and the increase\n18\n\n\nin the number of regional organizations working, inter alia,\nin peacekeeping. We see nothing wrong with such\ndecentralization.\nHowever, it is extremely important that peacekeeping\nactivities, whatever their sponsorship, should rely first and\nforemost on the underlying principles developed within the\nUnited Nations framework. We need here to be extremely\ncautious in dealing with peacekeeping activities. We believe\nthat actions involving force should be carried out solely\nwhen authorized by the Security Council and under its\ndirect supervision, as provided for in the Charter of the\nUnited Nations.\nAs we move towards a multipolar world in the twenty-\nfirst century, it is essential to create conditions that will\nbring stability to a new world order. To that end, work\nmust be completed to demolish the hurdles of the past and,\nabove all, the legacy of the massive, decades-long arms\nrace.\nWe are moving together along this path, and we are\ndetermined to proceed further. Together with the United\nStates, we have been steadily reducing our national strategic\narsenals. President Yeltsin of Russia and President Clinton\nof the United States have reached an understanding on the\nbasic parameters for agreement in this area.\nOn the agenda now are systematic measures for a\nreduction in the nuclear arsenals of all the nuclear Powers.\nBut let us be perfectly clear here: the stability of a\nmultipolar world cannot be ensured simply by ending the\nnuclear-arms race of the past. It is also essential to have\nguarantees against the re-emergence of that arms race on a\nnew basis, and here I have in mind the desire of individual\ncountries to acquire nuclear weapons. This once again\nproves the need for urgent measures to relieve tensions in\nthe relations between India and Pakistan.\nHence the essential need for the entire international\ncommunity to give a universal dimension to the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Those few\ncountries that have so far remained outside the Treaty must,\nin our view, come to grips with their responsibility. They\nmust realize that their own security is an integral part of\nglobal security, and they must assume those obligations to\nwhich over 180 States have already committed themselves\nas parties to the Treaty.\nThe entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty (CTBT) on a global scale, as well as the\nforthcoming talks to ban the production of weapon-grade\nfissile materials, figures likewise among those badly\nneeded steps intended to impart stability to global security\nin the twenty-first century.\nThe implementation of the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling\nand Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction\nis getting under way. We consider this document as one\nof the major instruments designed to eliminate one of the\nweapons of mass destruction subject to the greatest\nproliferation. We have been working together with the\ndeputies of the State Duma to ratify the Convention, and\nwe look forward to the early, successful completion of\nthose efforts.\nBut even now it is conventional weaponry that is\nkilling people in local conflicts, often in situations where\nhostilities have already stopped. In this connection, we are\nfully aware of the humanitarian dimension of the problem\nof landmines. We think that the elimination of the threat\nof landmines to people, especially to civilian populations,\nis long overdue. We advocate active, phased efforts and\nnegotiations to resolve it.\nStability on a global or regional level is impossible\nwithout the establishment of security systems. We have\nmade headway in this direction on the European\ncontinent. We feel confident that only a universal\norganization which brings together all the members of the\nEuropean family of nations can serve as a foundation for\na genuinely durable security system in Europe in the\ntwenty-first century. I am talking here about the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE). It is first and foremost in the frame of that\nforum that it is possible to seek agreement with a view to\nmeeting the new and diverse challenges, which are not\nnecessarily of a military and political nature.\nA beneficial effect on the improvement of the\nEuropean climate has already been exerted by the\nFounding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and\nSecurity between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nand the Russian Federation, which was born out of the\nagonizing quest for compromise. This document will have\nbroad international resonance and will doubtless play an\nessential role in European politics. Of course, the signing\nof that document has not changed our negative view of\nNATO\u2019s enlargement, which, on the one hand, totally\nignores current realities and, on the other, is fraught with\nthe risk of creating new dividing lines.\n19\n\n\nI must mention yet another contribution to the\nstrengthening of good-neighbourly relations in Europe. I am\nreferring to the agreements signed recently by Russia,\nUkraine and Belarus that have allowed our three countries\nto take major steps forward in developing mutually\nbeneficial, equitable relations which have strengthened\nstability in the region.\nRussia has an interest in the security and stability of\nits Baltic neighbours and is ready to guarantee their\nsecurity. Such guarantees could be provided in the form of\nour commitment backed by an agreement on good-\nneighbourly relations between Russia and the Baltic States.\nSuch an agreement could become a kind of pact on regional\nsecurity and stability.\nThe Asia-Pacific dimension is also of great\nsignificance to us. We are convinced that the Russian-\nChinese agreements on borders and military d\u00e9tente in the\nfrontier zone, which were also signed by Kazakhstan,\nKyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, will become a long-term factor\nfor stability in that vast region. Russia also holds a number\nof other Asian countries \u2014 including India, Japan and the\nStates of the Association of South-East Asian Nations\n(ASEAN) \u2014 among its priority partners.\nAt the same time, our future in the twenty-first century\nat both the global and the regional levels depends directly\non whether the international community will be able to stop\nand reverse the economic impoverishment of a great\nnumber of the Member States of the United Nations.\nA central role in resolving the most important tasks\nfacing all the countries of the world today belongs to the\nUnited Nations.\nEstablished over half a century ago, the Organization\nin general has succeeded in passing the durability test,\ntraversed the thorny road of the bloc-confrontation era,\nsurvived both the ice-age period and the thaw in\ninternational relations. But today this could be viewed as\naxiomatic \u2014 the United Nations needs a rational\nrenovation, referred to by virtually all the speakers in this\ndebate. The substantive report of Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan gives clear proof of this need. Today, figuratively\nspeaking, the image of this Organization in the twenty-first\ncentury is being shaped.\nIt is our strong conviction that the priority objective\nof the Organization\u2019s reform is to enhance the usefulness\nof the United Nations. Naturally, it is impossible to\nreform the United Nations in order to increase its\neffectiveness without overcoming the financial problems.\nWe must note that the financial problems of the United\nNations have unfortunately become chronic. It must\ntherefore be emphasized that the responsibility for the\nfinancial health of the United Nations is borne by all\nMember States and that they must all pay their dues\nproperly.\nWe are also in favour of expanding the membership\nof the Security Council. A decision to that effect is long\noverdue. But this expansion should not render our\nOrganization less efficient.\nThe reform of the United Nations will take place\nagainst the background of the ever increasing role of\nregional organizations. This is a fully logical process. At\nthe same time, we are convinced that the special leading\nrole of the United Nations among all other universally\nrecognized international organizations must be preserved.\nWe see the United Nations in the twenty-first\ncentury as a highly efficient Organization, free from\nbureaucratic constraints, and as a proactive Organization\ncapable of swiftly responding to the challenges of the\ncontemporary world.\nI began my remarks by encouraging concerted action\nby the international community to concentrate on current\nproblems and on the prospects for the coming century.\nAnd I shall conclude by citing a well-known saying:\n\u201cPessimists are no more than casual observers, it is the\noptimists who can change the world\u201d. We are optimists,\nand we believe that the United Nations will be able to\nplay a positive role in the ongoing evolution of the\ninternational community.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It would thus be a matter of legitimate pride to\nrealize at the end of this process that major and positive\nUnited Nations reforms would have been achieved under\nthe tenure of a native African Secretary-General.\n(spoke in French)\nThere is no doubt that the question of United\nNations reform, which has been of concern to us more\nparticularly since the middle of July last and which has\nfigured prominently in most of the statements made\nduring the general debate, is not only making the fifty-\nsecond session of the General Assembly seem like a hive\nof feverish activity leading up to major events but also is\nlending it a special character that will remain in the\nannals of the Organization because of the importance of\nthe stakes for all of humankind.\n\n\nIt is a starting point for this necessary process to find\nanswers to our aspirations for the future of our\nOrganization, following the solemn commitment made here\ntwo years ago by our Heads of State and Government, in\nthe framework of the commemoration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, to work jointly to\npromote peace, development, equality, justice and\nunderstanding among peoples.\nThis reform process should reflect the changes and\nprofound upheavals that have taken place in the world and\nthat have made it necessary for our Organization to adapt\nitself and its structures to the new realities of the world in\nwhich we live \u2014 a world characterized by an upsurge in\nglobalization and by greater interdependence among\nnations. The free movement of goods, people, capital and\ninformation has increased. Technological progress is\nmaking it possible to transmit and disseminate ideas,\ncultures and lifestyles.\nSome developing countries have undergone rapid\neconomic growth and have become integrated into the\ndynamic current of the world economy. Others \u2014 and\nunfortunately there are far too many of them \u2014 have\nexperienced slow or even negative growth and have been\nmarginalized in the globalization process. Poverty and\nfamine still affect a considerable number of people. The\nfigures speak for themselves: at a time when some people\nare privileged enough to surf the Internat to do their\nshopping, 800 million others go hungry every day \u2014 that\naccording to a report of the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization at the World Food Summit last November.\nAnd that is to say nothing of illness, illiteracy or violence.\nThe basic principles that have given impetus to this\nprocess of renewal include good governance, sound\nmanagement, transparency and the democratization of\ninternational relations. In this respect, Madagascar cannot\nbut welcome this innovative approach because it is based\non the same values and the same ideals underlying my\nGovernment\u2019s quest for social and economic progress,\nwhose goal is to provide a higher standard of living for the\nMalagasy people in conditions of greater freedom.\nIndeed, we in Madagascar hope to ensure that the\nobservance of human rights, social justice, participation by\nall in national development efforts, the implementation of\neconomic reforms and the practice of democracy do not\nremain mere political slogans but are put into practice. As\nthe representative of a Government born of a democratic\nchange of power seven months ago, I know what I am\ntalking about.\nAt this stage of the considerations presented by our\nSecretary-General, certain points are noteworthy. Among\nthose I would refer specifically to restructuring, financial\nreform and the Security Council.\nWith respect to restructuring, it is clear that efforts\nmust be made to merge agencies of the United Nations\nsystem in order to ensure improved efficiency and better\ncoordination. An example would be to merge into a single\nunit in Geneva the Office of the High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights and the Centre for Human Rights in order\nto strengthen complementarity in related activities of our\nOrganization.\nMy country believes that we must increase\ntransparency and create a culture of shared savings, which\na reform of the Centre\u2019s administration would bring\nabout \u2014 this with the aim of avoiding by every possible\nmeans the non-observance of democracy, which is the\nfundamental reason for serious human rights violations\nthroughout the world. Likewise, humanitarian relief,\nwhich the United Nations continues to provide to\ncountries that are facing natural disasters, would become\nmore effective with the creation of an office for the\ncoordination of emergency situation efforts,\ncomplemented by an appropriate intervention mechanism.\nI take this opportunity to convey my country\u2019s\ngratitude to those who did not hesitate to assist\nMadagascar in our efforts to deal with the locust invasion\nin the southern part of the island. I would mention in\nparticular the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\nUnited Nations, the United Nations Development\nProgramme, the World Food Programme, the United\nStates Agency for International Development and the\nWorld Bank, as well as friendly countries \u2014 Japan,\nGermany, France, Norway and the United Kingdom,\namong others.\nMy delegation, which welcomes the strengthening of\ncertain United Nations activities and the inclusion of new\npriorities, agrees with the conclusions of the fifty-third\nsession of the Commission on Human Rights, according\nto which human rights are inseparable from the promotion\nof peace, security, economic prosperity and social equity.\nIt reaffirms, therefore, that the work of the United\nNations in the area of human rights must be considered as\nan element of the Organization\u2019s activities in the field of\npreventive diplomacy, and that United Nations operations\nto monitor the observance of human rights must promote\nrespect for these rights in order to be able to restore\n2\n\n\nsocial stability and assist in the reconstruction and recovery\nof societies following periods of conflict.\nIn this regard, the restructuring of the Secretariat\nshould take into account all approaches to human rights, in\naccordance with the outcome of the Vienna Conference,\nwhich, as we know, proclaimed the interdependence and\nindivisibility of human rights as well as the promotion of\nthe right to development.\nMy delegation, however, would appeal for greater\nvigilance on the question of human rights, bearing in mind\nthat on 10 December we shall begin to celebrate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\nand in view of the possible consequences of international\noversight of human rights for the sovereignty of States,\nparticularly when this involves monitoring measures and\neven conditionality, under the guise of humanitarian\nconcerns.\nReform must not be reduced to a simple cost-cutting\nexercise; rather, it must strengthen the role of the\nOrganization and above all enhance its efficiency. Hence\nMadagascar recognizes the need to strengthen the role of\nthe General Assembly, which we feel must remain the\nprimary forum for States to discuss essential issues of\npeace, security and development. At a time when the\nvirtues of democratization are preached, the General\nAssembly is the only body capable of guaranteeing that as\nmany people as possible can make their voices heard at the\nworld level and play an effective part in the management of\ninternational affairs.\nThe Charter could therefore be amended to give\ngreater power to the General Assembly, so that it might\nplay a bigger role alongside the Security Council,\nparticularly in the maintenance of peace. We therefore\nsupport the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative to set up a\nministerial commission to consider the possible changes.\nOn financial reform, many eminent speakers \u2014 I\nwould refer in particular to the Prime Minister of\nPakistan \u2014 have stated in this debate that one of the main\nweaknesses of the United Nations stems from the fact that\nwhile some Members are supposed to pay their assessments\nin full and without conditions, others delay payment,\nmaking it contingent on one reason or another, whether\nstated or not.\nMadagascar appeals for what I would call a code of\ngood conduct or financial civic-mindedness, in order to\nremedy this situation. We support the principle that the\nfinancing of the United Nations must be an integral part\nof the reform process. Moreover, the scale of assessments,\nthe key to the apportionment of expenses, must reflect the\ncapacity of each State to pay, as it is applied in most, if\nnot all world organizations, on the basis of equity, pure\nand simple. It is clear to us that the scale cannot be set in\nstone and that there should be provision for amendment\nwhen necessary \u2014 that is, when there is a change in a\ncountry\u2019s capacity to pay.\nFinally, we welcome the desire of the Secretary-\nGeneral to allocate more predictable resources to finance\ndevelopment, to ensure an overall increase in official\ndevelopment assistance and to create an Office for\nDevelopment Financing to allocate to developing\ncountries what have been described as the dividends of\nreform.\nIn regard to the Security Council, it would be putting\nit mildly to say that its present membership no longer\nreflects reality. To speak of our continent alone, Africa\nhas the greatest number of Member States of the United\nNations, and yet the continent has no permanent seat on\nthe Security Council. Nor was the continent even\nconsulted or considered at the time of the first review of\nthe Council in 1965.\nMadagascar endorses the position of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and would opt for\nan expansion of Security Council membership based on\ndemocratization, transparency and equitable geographical\nrepresentation. An increase in number and an\nimprovement in the Council\u2019s functioning and working\nmethods, as well as its relations with States that are not\nmembers of the Council, are essential in order to reflect\nthe present reality, and above all to allow the United\nNations to lend an attentive ear to the problems of the\npoor and less favoured countries. In addition, relations\nbetween the Security Council and the Economic and\nSocial Council must be strengthened, so that decisions on\ninternational peace and security can take into account\nsocial factors.\nIn this regard, my delegation welcomes the decision\nof the sub-working group of the African Group, chaired\nby Egypt, which is considering the modalities for\nimplementing a rotation system for two permanent seats\nwhich could be allocated to Africa, called for in the\nHarare Declaration of the summit of Heads of State and\nGovernment of the OAU.\n3\n\n\nWe feel that the veto must not be considered\nseparately from the question of expanding the membership\nof the Council. Moreover, given the principles of\ndemocracy supported by the international community as a\nwhole, it would be logical to extend the right of veto to all\npermanent members, or simply to abolish it.\nIn addition, we emphatically reaffirm that any question\nrelating to reform of the Security Council must be subject\nto a two-thirds majority vote of Member States, in\naccordance with the provisions of Article 18 of the Charter.\nAny initiative to submit a simple resolution running counter\nto that would be prejudicial to the Organization and to its\nMembers.\nThe 15 priority areas on which the Secretary-General\nhas taken action and made recommendations respond to the\ndemands of today\u2019s world. My delegation is certain that the\nsubstantive comments and proposals of the General\nAssembly will help implement the initiatives taken, so that\nour Organization can keep pace with the demands of our\ntime and, above all, live up to the expectations of our\npeople. In any event, Madagascar, within the framework of\nthe regional forums to which it belongs, is considering the\nproposals of the Secretary-General in a spirit of\nconstructive dialogue and without preconceptions.\nHowever, I cannot speak of international peace and\nsecurity without expressing my concern at the slow pace of\nnegotiations leading to general agreement on every aspect\nof Security Council reform. We are concerned because,\ndespite the establishment of a Department for Disarmament\nand Arms Regulation, announced in the package of reforms,\nthe Council will still remain, under the Charter, the body\nentrusted with maintaining international peace and security.\nHowever, the Malagasy Government welcomes the fact that\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OAU with\nregard to peace was mentioned in the Secretary-General\u2019s\nreport to the fifty-second session, as well as in statements\nmade last Thursday at the ministerial meeting of the\nSecurity Council on the situation in Africa. We are pleased\nto note the determination of the Secretary-General to\nincrease this cooperation and extend it to all activities\nrelated to the maintenance of peace, including conflict\nprevention. In this area, we welcome the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s plan to appoint a representative based in Addis\nAbaba. It is important here to emphasize the importance not\nonly of combining, but also coordinating, the efforts of the\nOAU \u2014 which has a central Mechanism for Conflict\nPrevention Management and Resolution \u2014 with those of\nthe Security Council, so that we do not work at cross-\npurposes. Here I would like to recall that the OAU\nwelcomed the principle of strengthening African\npeacekeeping capacity, which France, the United\nKingdom and the United States of America have jointly\nproposed to assist.\nMy delegation welcomes the negotiations to date on\nnuclear disarmament measures and on limiting and\ngradually reducing conventional weapons and in particular\nanti-personnel mines. On this last point, Madagascar has\nvoted in favour of General Assembly resolutions on a\nmoratorium on the export of mines. We welcome the\nagreement drafted in Oslo on the text of a convention for\nthe complete elimination of anti-personnel mines, as well\nas Norway\u2019s commitment to provide $100 million for\ndemining activities and assistance to victims.\nIn this respect, my country appeals to States with\nmilitary arsenals to continue resolutely to take measures\naimed at general and complete disarmament. The\nparticipation of all States in this process of disarmament,\nin cooperation with the Department for Disarmament and\nArms Regulation, whose establishment is part of the\nreform programme, will provide an invaluable\ncontribution to the easing of global tensions.\nThis international determination will also be a source\nof mutual assistance and cooperation in combating\norganized transnational crime. Transnational criminal\norganizations have, in fact, existed for a long time, but\nthe globalization of international relations with regard to\nthe economy, commerce, telecommunications and the\nrapid progress of technology, as well as the disappearance\nof ideological blocs, have permitted the activities of\ntransnational criminal organizations to expand and have\nincreased their power to such an extent that they are now\na permanent threat to the foundation and internal security\nof States, to their cultural and artistic heritage and to the\nenvironment of the planet. Today we are witnessing the\nemergence of new forms of transnational crime: money-\nlaundering or the investment of capital generated by\nactivities that are usually interconnected, including drug-\ntrafficking, corruption, traffic in weapons, terrorism,\ntraffic in nuclear and toxic material, traffic in protected\nnatural resources, traffic in human beings, removal of\norgans, and more.\nFrom this standpoint, the countries that are weakest\nin terms of economic, institutional, material and\ntechnological capacity are the most vulnerable \u2014\ndeveloping countries in general and African countries in\nparticular \u2014 because the automatic effect of the activities\nof developed countries to prevent and combat organized\n4\n\n\ncrime is to condemn such countries to becoming new zones\nof expansion.\nWe must therefore urgently find an effective response\nto this threat by defining a common objective based on a\nunited stand and coherent action, by establishing or\nstrengthening cooperation for exchanging experience and\nknowledge, by increasing our exchange of information and,\nabove all, by actively promoting and supporting cooperation\nwith international or regional forums so as to provide\ninstitutional technical assistance and logistical support. That\nnotwithstanding, we note the special importance attributed\nby the Secretary-General to the need to improve the\ncapacity of the system to combat drug-trafficking and\nterrorism.\nPeace is, with development, one of the main missions\nof the United Nations. My country reaffirms its unwavering\ncommitment to the principle of settling disputes peacefully.\nIt is deeply concerned by the threats to destabilize peace in\nthe world, especially in Africa.\nWith regard to the Republic of Congo, therefore,\nMadagascar appeals to the parties to develop a dialogue\naimed at a definitive ceasefire, in accordance with the spirit\nof the Libreville Summit, held on 14 and 15 September\n1997, and at allowing the deployment, under the auspices\nof the United Nations and the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU), of the international intervention force\nrecommended at the Summit.\nAs for the internal crisis in the Comoros, which is an\nimmediate neighbour of Madagascar, we support of the\nefforts of the Secretary-General of the OAU as well as\nthose of the League of Arab States and the Organization of\nthe Islamic Conference. Furthermore, we reaffirm our\nsupport of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros\nwith regard to sovereignty and territorial integrity. In this\nrespect we support the convening of an international\nconference to restore peace in that sister Republic, and we\nhave expressed the readiness of Madagascar to become\ninvolved in any initiatives along these lines.\nAlso in Africa, Madagascar welcomes the\nestablishment of direct talks between Morocco and the\nPOLISARIO Front, which recently culminated in the\nHouston Agreement, as a result of the mediation of James\nBaker. We believe this to be a major landmark on the path\nto the settlement of the question of Western Sahara, which\nhas gone on for too long.\nIn the Middle East, Madagascar also strongly appeals\nto the parties concerned to safeguard the progress\nachieved in the peace process. We believe that an\nessential element for this is for Israel to halt the\nestablishment of new settlements.\nFinally, we reaffirm our support for the concept of\nthe reunification of Korea and welcome the progress that\nis starting to appear in this regard.\nDuring the course of the United Nations conferences\non human rights, the environment, population, social\ndevelopment, women, etc., we succeeded in achieving\nimportant global commitments, and we must ensure the\nfollow-up. We have achieved an international consensus\non the need to ensure that ecological realities and\npriorities for environmental policies are taken into account\nin structural changes that are in progress in the\ninternational economic order. To be more specific, we\nmust integrate environmental factors \u2014 a precondition for\nsustainable development \u2014 into economic priorities. In\nthis regard Madagascar encourages the efforts already\nundertaken by international development finance\norganizations and by Governments. We are convinced that\nthe overall implementation of the provisions in the basic\nAgenda 21 document for rapid and specific action will\ncome to fruition in the recommendations of the Secretary-\nGeneral as contained in his programme for reform.\nIn conclusion, I take this opportunity to recall my\ncomments at the nineteenth special session of the General\nAssembly, on an overall review and appraisal of the\nimplementation of Agenda 21. While reaffirming our full\nadherence to the principles of mutual interest and the\nshared but differentiated responsibilities of developed and\ndeveloping countries contained in the Rio Declaration,\nand to its general implementation, we requested, first, that\ndeveloped countries honour the commitments undertaken\nin Rio to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national\nproduct to development assistance. Secondly, we\nrequested that the Global Environment Facility be\nrestructured and adequately replenished so as to facilitate\naccess to resources; and thirdly and above all, that,\nfollowing the concept of the \u201cdemocracy dividend\u201d and\nthe \u201ceconomic adjustment and reform dividend\u201d, an\n\u201cenvironment dividend\u201d should be advocated for the least\ndeveloped countries to enable them to protect their\nenvironment and thereby speed up the eradication of\npoverty, the main cause and consequence of\nenvironmental degradation.\n5\n\n\nWe now ask whether the United Nations Environment\nProgramme (UNEP) in its present form has the necessary\npower to impose sanctions or to grant dividends, or whether\nwe need to strengthen its mandate or create a new structure\nwith adequate power.\nFor its part, Madagascar \u2014 we cannot repeat this\noften enough \u2014 is proud to comply with the measures\nrecommended in Agenda 21. Indeed, it stands out in its\ncapacity as a country that is both a nature sanctuary and a\nnatural sanctuary, possessing treasures and specific\ncharacteristics that are rare, if not unique in the world, in\nterms of flora and fauna.\nWe hope that in Kyoto in December firm\ncommitments will be made to reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions, which cause global warming and thereby\ncontribute to the further deterioration of our environment.\nIt rests only with us to make this session a session of\nreform, as the Secretary-General wishes, or to make it a\nsession like so many others \u2014 one in which speakers assail\nus with rhetoric or at best with verbal promises that are not\nfollowed up with actions. Madagascar is convinced that we\nwill make the right choice at the right time to consolidate\nour ideals.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, first of all I\nwould like to congratulate you on your election as President\nof the General Assembly at this session. We wish you\nsuccess in this responsible task in a year that will be of\ngreat importance for the Organization.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to express\nour gratitude to the previous President of the Assembly,\nAmbassador Ismail, who showed exceptional commitment\nto the reform initiatives throughout the fifty-first session.\nThat recently concluded session was an important step\ntowards a reinforced United Nations which, with its\nuniversal membership, will have to be able to deal with\nserious problems facing the world today.\nWe expect the fifty-second session of the General\nAssembly to be a decisive landmark in the renewal and\nrestructuring of the United Nations \u2014 a major endeavour\nundertaken by Member States several years ago. In this\nrespect we would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral, who presented his report on this question to the\nGeneral Assembly on 16 July. My Government lends its\nfull support to Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his\nefforts. We also note with satisfaction that part of this\npackage has already been implemented.\nEstonia is looking forward to an agreement within\nthe foreseeable future concerning a response by Member\nStates to the Secretary-General\u2019s proposals. It is our\nsincere hope that Members will deal with this matter in a\nconstructive manner and that a generally acceptable\nscheme for reforming the United Nations will be agreed\nupon. We are confident that all Member States will\nbenefit from the reform of the Organization.\nI would now like to focus my address on points of\nspecific relevance to present needs in the reform package.\nThe aim of reform as a whole is to adapt the Organization\nto its new challenges, to make it more effective and\nefficient, more manageable and modern in every way. We\nare now remodelling this Organization to make it\ncompatible with the twenty-first century. The world has\nchanged \u2014 the United Nations has to change with it.\nHaving criteria for the appraisal of performance seems to\nbe of crucial importance. Result-based budgeting should\nassure a strengthened linkage between intergovernmental\nmandates and their efficient implementation. Enhanced\ncost effectiveness envisaged for 1998-1999 is also an\nencouraging sign.\nEstonia lends strong support to the idea of cutting\nthe number of agenda items for future sessions. We also\nfind the idea of consolidating the representation of\ndifferent United Nations funds and programmes in\n\n\nMember States on common premises and under one flag to\nbe very attractive. United Nations Houses would enhance\nthe visibility of the Organization and provide a valuable\nsource of information about it and its activities. I would\nlike to note the positive experience Estonia has gathered in\ncooperation with the local United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) country office. Many programmes\nvital to Estonia have materialized owing to the support of\nthe UNDP. We highly appreciate this cooperation and hope\nthat the future United Nations House will be able to use\nthat valuable expertise.\nThe financing of the United Nations is a question that\ninterests all of us. Without adequate financing, the\nOrganization would not be able to fulfil its mandate. This\nfifty-second session of the General Assembly must assess\nthe impact of the Secretary-General\u2019s proposed reforms on\nthe programme budget for 1998-1999 and define a new\nscale of assessments for its Member States. Estonia\nsupports the Secretary-General\u2019s reform measures aimed at\nenhancing the Organization\u2019s effectiveness and better\nimplementation of its programmes by reducing excessive\nand unnecessary expenditures.\nWith regard to the new scale of assessments, Estonia\nwould like to see a more transparent scale based on the\nfundamental principle of capacity to pay to be adopted. All\nmeasures should lead towards putting the Organization on\na sound and predictable financial footing. We believe that\nthe main prerequisite for achieving this goal is that Member\nStates clear their arrears to the regular as well as to the\npeacekeeping budgets. Estonia is committed to doing so.\nWe welcome the appointment of Mrs. Mary Robinson,\nformer President of Ireland, to the position of the High\nCommissioner for Human Rights. Estonia supports the plan\nfor the consolidation of the Centre for Human Rights and\nthe Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights\ninto one office. We would also like to stress the importance\nthat we attach to adequate financing of the Organization\u2019s\nhuman rights machinery.\nTwo major events have occurred in the past year in\nthe field of economic and social cooperation. The first of\nthem was the adoption of the Agenda for Development.\nEstonia shares the perception of the importance of\ndevelopment issues for the United Nations. Health and\neducation should also be high priorities. The second such\nevent was the nineteenth special session of the General\nAssembly, the aim of which was to review the\nimplementation of Agenda 21, the global plan of action for\nsustainable development adopted in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.\nAlthough the special session acknowledged the positive\nresults which have been achieved since Rio, it also\nexpressed concern over worsened overall trends for\nsustainable development. In this regard, we expect the\nfifty-second session of the General Assembly to give\nfurther political impetus to the implementation of the\nmandates and tasks defined at the session.\nIn Estonia, we believe that our task today is to\nprovide the present generation with the safe, good-quality\nliving environment and resources needed to promote a\nstrong and diversified economy without compromising the\nneeds of future generations. For that reason, over the last\nfive years Estonia has signed, ratified and acceded to\nmore than 40 bilateral and multilateral environment\nagreements and conventions. We have also established the\nGovernmental Commission on Sustainable Development,\nled by the Prime Minister. Estonia is working closely\nwith the countries in the Baltic Sea area to develop a\nBaltic region sustainable development strategy.\nI would like to stress the importance that we attach\nto the consideration of economic and social issues by the\nGeneral Assembly. With this in view, the work of the\nSecond and Third Main Committees should be\nrationalized in order to avoid any overlap and duplication.\nOne of the central areas of the reform concerns\nrenewing the Security Council. This year, Member States\nmust continue efforts to achieve the goal of making the\nCouncil more representative and to improve its working\nmethods. Estonia elaborated its position in cooperation\nwith a group of smaller like-minded countries. We\nsupport enlargement in both existing categories. We also\nview Germany and Japan as potential new permanent\nmembers of the Council. The developing countries of\nAsia, Africa and Latin America should also be\nrepresented on a permanent basis.\nDisarmament has been one of the United Nations\npriority goals since its founding. In fact, disarmament\nefforts have yielded considerable progress. The conclusion\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty last year\nwas an important step forward.\nOne of the important responsibilities of the United\nNations is managing conflicts \u2014 acting rapidly in the\nface of crises. Peacekeeping continues to be an important\nactivity of the Organization. In recent years, we have\nbeen witnessing a change in the role of United Nations\npeacekeeping missions. United Nations peacekeepers have\n2\n\n\nbeen facing the challenge of dealing with internal conflicts\nthroughout the world.\nEstonia is continuing to take part in United Nations\npeacekeeping. An Estonian company has recently completed\nits successful deployment in the United Nations Interim\nForce in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Together with Latvia and\nLithuania, we are looking forward to contributing a\nbattalion of peacekeepers to the United Nations\npeacekeeping operations. The battalion, called BALTBAT,\nwill be operational from the beginning of 1998. I would\nlike to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all Member\nStates of the Organization that have been participating in\nthis project. The initial experience of Baltic peacekeepers\nin United Nations peacekeeping missions has shown how\nregional cooperation evolves into global cooperation. The\nBaltic preparedness to merge as a joint battalion is an\nelement strengthening regional security. It proves our\nreadiness to assume responsibility as well as our right to\nchoose our own means of security. Estonia is currently\ncontributing civilian police officers and military observers.\nWe have also joined the United Nations peacekeeping\nstandby arrangement.\nWe strongly believe in the cooperation of the United\nNations with regional organizations in all parts of the\nworld. Reliance on the expertise and capacities of these\norganizations would allow us to avoid duplication and\nallocate scarce resources in the most effective manner. We\ndo have examples of fruitful cooperation with regional\nentities. In Europe, we have been witnessing joint United\nNations actions, in particular with the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation (OSCE) in Europe and with the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\nWe would like to note that the structure and\ncomposition of regional organizations is changing. The\nEuropean Union and NATO are gradually opening to new\nmembers. This is a very important phenomenon in the\nprocess towards enhancing stability and security in our\nregion. Estonia associates its future with full membership\nin both of these organizations.\nIn conclusion, let me express my sincere hope that on\nthe eve of the twenty-first century mankind is willing to\nreverse its classical interpretation of the past so eloquently\nexpressed at the dawn of this century by the English\nnovelist and poet Thomas Hardy:\n\u201cWar makes rattling good history; but Peace is poor\nreading.\u201d [Thomas Hardy, The Dynasts, pt. II, Spirit\nSinister]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me first join all the\ndistinguished personalities who have spoken before me\nfrom this rostrum in congratulating Mr. Udovenko on his\nelection as President of the General Assembly for the\ncurrent session and wishing him all possible success in this\nlofty post. I would also like to convey my high appreciation\nto his predecessor, Mr. Razali Ismail, for the excellent\nleadership he provided during his tenure of the previous\nGeneral Assembly presidency.\nMay I take this opportunity to warmly congratulate the\nSecretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his election to the\nhighest post of our global Organization. We are confident\nthat his long experience as an international civil servant\nand his correct assessment and proper action in\nimplementing the United Nations reform are guarantees of\nthe successful crowning of our efforts to have a stronger\nand more efficient Organization.\nBefore I deal with the more general questions\nconcerning our common work and efforts in the\nOrganization, I would like to dwell briefly on the\ndramatic events and developments that occurred in my\ncountry, in particular during the first half of the current\nyear, which were also of concern to the United Nations.\nThe Assembly is already aware of what happened in\nmy country, during which total chaos and anarchy reigned\nfor months. That was perhaps the biggest crisis in our\nmodern history. Albania has a peculiar history of chronic\nisolation, of almost total estrangement from the rest of the\nworld, of great potential, human and natural wealth, while\nbeing, at the same time, underdeveloped and poor. Our\ndifficulties of growth are directly linked to the legacies of\nformer rules and half a century of communism, of non-\nexistent, non-functioning or malfunctioning democratic\ninstitutions, both during and after the collapse of\ncommunism and its structures, as well as with our\nmentality. They are linked to flaws and shortcomings in\ndifferent fields, to clear tendencies to forsake freedom, to\npartisan intolerance, to lack of inter-party constructive\ncooperation, to mismanagement and corruption, to\nautocratic behaviour and decisions \u2014 not rare phenomena\nin our part of the world.\nIt was the great complexity of these and other\ndevelopments, coupled with the collapse of the get-rich-\nquick pyramid investment schemes, which led to broad\npopular frustration, disillusionment and general unrest and\nbrought the whole country to the state of unprecedented\nchaos and anarchy I mentioned a moment ago.\nIn these circumstances, the international community\nreacted promptly, displaying a remarkable sense of\nresponsibility, unity and solidarity amongst its members\nand with my people and country, one of the Members of\nthis Organization. The involvement of the Organization\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the\nEuropean Union, the United Nations Security Council\u2019s\nbenediction, and the well-balanced, all-out efforts and\ncontribution of important neighbours and friends helped\nus to prevent further aggravation and to alleviate and\ngradually overcome the crisis.\n18\n\n\nWe would like to take this opportunity to commend in\nthe warmest possible terms the very serious commitment of\nthe OSCE; its Chairman-in-Office, Minister Petersen, and\nhis Personal Representative, former Austrian Chancellor,\nMr. Vranitzky; the United Nations and its Security Council\nfor their prompt response to this emergency situation\nthrough their relevant decisions, resolutions and concrete\nactions. Let me also thank most warmly all the troop-\ncontributing States \u2014 France, Greece, Turkey, Spain,\nRomania, Denmark, Portugal, Austria, Belgium and\nSlovenia \u2014 which, under the excellent leadership and\ncommand of Italy, made the entire effort of the\nMultinational Protection Force a full success in the\nimplementation of its mandate. Last but not least, I would\nwish to express my deep appreciation and thanks to the\nEuropean Union and all the other international and regional\norganizations, the United States of America, as well as to\nother individual States, for the continuous support and\nassistance they have given and are giving my country. My\npeople are indebted to them and to all here.\nThis highly appreciated assistance helped us start a\nprocess of reconciliation and gradual restoration of political\nstability in the country. It is also a reflection of historical\nlessons learned in today\u2019s efforts to establish a peaceful,\ndemocratic and united Europe, without walls and fully free,\nin which the integration processes should be comprehensive\nenough not to exclude any country, even the weakest, as\nPope John Paul II said. This is the only road to ensuring\nthat the universal principles which this global Organization\nand others stand for are permanently upheld and defended.\nThe successful holding of elections in Albania on 29\nJune, which were considered by the international\ncommunity as adequate and acceptable, can and must be the\nfoundation for a stable democratic system. They showed the\nstrong desire of my people for a democratic future for\nAlbania. The coalition Government which emerged from\nthese elections is fully determined to work with a new\nphilosophy based on cooperation and coexistence, on\nsharing and, at the same time, assuming responsibilities, by\nthe majority and the minority alike. The guiding yardstick\nwill be making maximum use of internal capacities as the\nbest way to ensure continuation of the spirit of\nunderstanding, the process of reconciliation, constructive\ncooperation, economic recovery and the overall return of\nnormalcy to the country in the shortest possible time. This\nis the spirit we have decided to be guided by, as personified\nbrilliantly by the Albanian famous worldwide, Mother\nTeresa.\nWe do hope and will work to ensure that this\nprocess will bring about the necessary transformation of\nthe country into a reliable partner that truly shares\ncommon democratic values and qualifies for its gradual\nbut sure integration into the Euro-Atlantic structures it has\nthe objective to achieve.\nLet me inform the Assembly that our main, urgent\nchallenge remains the restoration of public order and\nsecurity in the country. Therefore, we have devoted\nmaximum and special attention to it. Lack of public order\nand security cannot coexist with the development of the\neconomy and democratic values. Intensive work is already\nunder way on the basis of short- and long-term plans.\nSpecial emphasis is being put on and we have\nstarted work towards the reorganization of the army, with\nthe objective of gradually having a smaller, more efficient\nand professional force under strict civilian control, in\nconformity with all standards of modern armies, capable\nof performing its functions properly and of being a\ngenuine partner in partnership activities. Various problems\npersist in the economic field, where we have witnessed a\nquasi-paralysis of life and the deterioration of all micro-\nand macroeconomic indices. In cooperation with and the\nassistance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and\nthe World Bank, we hope we will be able to deal\nsuccessfully with the main economic and social priorities.\nWe have already started work in this direction, for both\nthe emergency situation and the mid-long-term\nperspective.\nAlbania is determined to go ahead with the\ndemocratization processes in general \u2014 the rebuilding,\nestablishment and proper functioning of democratic\ninstitutions to ensure the true entrenchment of the rule of\nlaw in all its dimensions.\nAll of these issues were discussed in Rome at the\npreparatory meeting for the upcoming ministerial meeting\nto be held in that city and the donors conference set to\ntake place in Brussels next month. We are prepared for\nthese meetings to begin the implementation of what we\nhave achieved and will agree upon, in close cooperation\nwith the relevant organizations.\nOn behalf of my Government, I should like to pay\ntribute to all of the international organizations and\nfinancial institutions, from the United Nations and its\nspecialized agencies to the European and Euro-Atlantic\nbodies as well as individual countries, which have since\nthe beginning of this process shown unstinting interest\n19\n\n\nand commitment in working in their respective areas of\nresponsibility.\nThe main objective of my Government\u2019s foreign\npolicy is directly to contribute to the enhancement of peace,\nsecurity and stability in our region and in Europe through\na gradual integration into all relevant Euro-Atlantic\nstructures.\nAlbania\u2019s past, present and future are closely linked,\nin a variety of ways, with those of our neighbours. Like all\nneighbours, we share not only common borders but also,\nwe hope, common interests and values and a common\nfuture. This requires our full participation in the European\nintegration processes, in a common Europe united by these\nvalues and not characterized by friction and confrontation.\nRelations with neighbouring countries and peace and\nstability in the region are of paramount importance for us.\nWe will continue to work constructively and openly to\nsolve all the pending problems that involve vital national\ninterests for Albania and represent a major concern for the\ninternational community. One such question is that of\nKosovo. Inter-linked issues \u2014 good relations with\nneighbouring countries, peace and stability in the region,\nand the situation in Kosovo and its just solution \u2014 should\nbe pursued in a complementary manner, with none of them\nopposing, undercutting or jeopardizing the others.\nI should like to say a few words about the situation in\nKosovo and how we see its future, because unless this\nquestion is dealt with properly and settled accordingly, this\nserious issue could continue to threaten peace and regional\nstability. Kosovo has been on the agenda of the\ninternational community, and in particular of the General\nAssembly and the Security Council, the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the\nEuropean Union, for years now. Unfortunately, the situation\nthere remains the same, and we are not sure how long the\nstatus quo can be maintained. Police violence and brutality,\nmassive repression and gross violations of human, political\nand national rights \u2014 which we strongly condemn \u2014\ncontinue unabated in Kosovo. The Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia has given no real, concrete sign of changing its\nattitude, despite three General Assembly resolutions, one\nSecurity Council resolution and scores of OSCE decisions\nand statements.\nWe appeal to this global Organization, to European\norganizations and structures, to those who made a major\ncontribution to ending the war in Bosnia through the\nDayton accords and to all those who have the power and\nthe political will to continue to exert the necessary\npressure to direct this major pending issue in the Balkans\nonto the path of negotiation, with proper international\nmediation, with a view to a just, peaceful and democratic\nsolution acceptable to all. Perhaps a mini Dayton-type\nconference aimed at solving all the remaining problems of\nthe former Yugoslavia, including and focusing on the\nKosovo issue, might do the job by Europeanizing our\nregion, a process that would have to start with a full-scale\nreactivation of Balkan cooperation.\nThe General Assembly will hopefully be able to\nsend another message to all those concerned, in particular\nthe people of Kosovo, that the international community\ncontinues to be deeply concerned and seized of the\nmatter, that it supports and encourages peaceful\napproaches, and that it wants to see positive changes in\nthe right direction.\nMy country fully supports all the efforts under way\nto ensure the full and unequivocal implementation of all\nthe Dayton accords. It considers attempts to circumvent\nor avoid certain Dayton provisions as dangerous, with\nimplications that could go beyond its scope. We maintain\nthat there is no alternative to the full implementation of\nDayton.\nThe Albanian Government is strongly committed to\npromoting and actively taking part in regional\ncooperation, knowing that democratization, market\neconomy prosperity, good-neighbourly relations and\nconstructive cooperation are prerequisites for the secure\nenvironment and prosperity that our region deserves, as\nwell as for the realization of our country\u2019s aspirations to\na gradual but full European integration. Our vision for our\nregion\u2019s future is a Schengen-type approach. We believe\nthat regional initiatives such as the Conference on\nEuropean Stability, Security and Cooperation in South-\nEastern Europe, the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and\ninitiatives of the Commonwealth of Independent States,\ninter alia, are worthy steps that are also contributing to\nthis end.\nAlbania is highly appreciative of the efforts, the\nassistance and the contribution of the Organization with\nrespect to conflict resolution in various parts of the globe.\nWe sincerely wish for peace to be established and reign\nin all those parts of the earth that are still being shaken\nby internal or other conflicts. We hope that the role and\ncontribution of the Organization, with its reform\nprogramme fully implemented, will be further enhanced\nin this direction. All Member States should do their\n20\n\n\nutmost to achieve this common objective. By so doing, the\nlead members will be able to provide better guidance\nthrough the United Nations, and all of us will work better\ntogether.\nAlbania is fully and unreservedly supportive of the\nMiddle East peace process and of the intensive and ongoing\nefforts to bring that process back on track. Mutual\nconfidence must somehow be restored, as it is the only\nalternative to ensuring continued progress in the peace\nnegotiations. We are confident that the unsparing and\nconcerted efforts under way will yield the awaited results.\nWe participated in and followed with great interest the\nnineteenth special session of the General Assembly on the\nenvironment and consider it to have made an important\ncontribution to resolving the environmental problems\naffecting the earth. Similarly, Albania considers the special\nsession on the fight against drugs and related activities, due\nto be held next year, as another very significant\ncontribution to promoting and further strengthening\ninternational cooperation in this highly sensitive field.\nThe open debate in the Security Council last May on\nhumanitarian crises and the protection of the civilian\npopulation was another indication that there is great\nconcern, preparedness and political will to deal with these\nconflicts at an early stage, before they develop into real\ncrises, thus playing a major preventive role. We all look\nforward to this. Prevention is the best medicine, because a\nproblem can become very costly to treat and be hard to\ncure.\nAlbania has tried its best to make a modest\ncontribution to the activities of the United Nations,\nincluding the significant fact that we are on the list of\ncountries ready to contribute to United Nations\npeacekeeping operations. Our objective in future is to play\nan even more active role in this direction, as well as in\noperations of an international humanitarian character. One\nsuch objective has already been included in our platform\nfor the reorganization and restructuring of the army.\nWe intend to play a more active role in the activities\nof main bodies of the Organization, including the Economic\nand Social Council, the Commission on Human Rights, the\nUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme, the\nCommission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and\nthe leading bodies of the International Atomic Energy\nAgency, the United Nations Industrial Development\nOrganization and others. Individual concerns should be\ntreated as, and should become, the concerns of all. In\naddressing individual concerns, participation and\ncontribution by all members of the community of States,\neach within its capacity and making available all possible\nresources, even if modest, will make the Organization\nmore comprehensive and substantive, and its role\ngenuinely more effective.\nThe Organization has started a process aimed at\nachieving the overall reform of the Organization and its\nsystem in order to make the United Nations and its role\ntruly more effective and capable of coping with the new\nchallenges and dynamics of the ever-changing world\nreality. To do so, all Members should live up to their\nobligations. We also feel the need for greater efforts to\nenhance efficiency, which would lead to an enhanced role\nfor the Organization. Reform should not take place for\nreform\u2019s sake. We believe it should be our duty to define\nour needs in order to have reforms that are not only\nstructural. We must ensure that money is saved not as a\none-shot exercise but as a long-lasting process with its\naccent on transfers for the economic development of those\nwho are most in need. We support action in this direction.\nWe have taken very serious note of the work of the\nSecretary-General for United Nations reform in general,\nand of his proposals for the reform of the Secretariat. We\nappreciate his proposals and believe they represent the\nright approach.\nThe reform of the Security Council is one of the\nmost sensitive issues and is part of the reform package. It\ntook our Organization almost the half century of its\nexistence to come to this point. No one can say for sure\nwhen, if at all, the Security Council will be reformed\nagain in the future. Therefore, there might still be some\nwork to be done in this direction, without necessarily\nmaking haste or getting caught up in endless discussions.\nWith a clear objective, we will be able to show the\nmaturity necessary to give the Council the right, balanced,\nflexible, democratic representation capable of successfully\ndealing with the challenges and objective of the next\ncentury: to live in peace and harmony; to live in and\nleave to our children a better world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We are confident that the wisdom, experience and\ndiplomatic skills that you bring to the office will ensure\nsuccess in the many issues facing this session.\nSwaziland would also like to commend the work of\nyour predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail, who\npresided with such skill over the deliberations of the fifty-\nfirst session.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland would like to place on\nrecord its deep appreciation for the work of Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali during his tenure as our Secretary-General.\nMuch was achieved during the five years of Mr. Boutros-\nGhali\u2019s leadership, and the whole world owes him a huge\ndebt of gratitude.\nWe would like further to welcome our new\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who has shown in his\nfirst year that he has the vision and qualities effectively\nto lead our Organization into the twenty-first century. All\nof us in Africa are proud of what he has achieved in such\na short time.\nOne of the main challenges facing our Secretary-\nGeneral is the reform of the United Nations into a cost-\neffective, accountable, credible, well-managed and fully\nrepresentative Organization.\nSwaziland gave its full support to the initial Track 1\nproposals put forward by the Secretary-General. In\nparticular, we supported the various initiatives designed\nto reduce administrative costs in favour of increased\nefficiency in the development programmes in the field.\nWe trust that the welfare of those affected by the\nnecessary cuts has been carefully considered.\n\n\nWe have also welcomed the Track 2 reforms,\nannounced in July, and again, we support the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s proposals on economic and social reform,\ndevelopment cooperation, humanitarian relief and human\nrights.\nWe believe that the Secretary-General\u2019s address at the\nfirst meeting of the general debate struck exactly the right\nnote of wise optimism. The responsibility now lies with the\nGeneral Assembly to support the Secretary-General\u2019s bold\napproach, and the Kingdom of Swaziland urges its fellow\nMember States to back the proposals and allow the reforms\nto forge ahead.\nOne area of reform that will have a major impact on\nthe openness and accountability of the United Nations\ndecision-making process is the question of the membership\nand expansion of the Security Council, in particular the\nneed for greater representation of the developing world\namong the permanent members.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland fully supports the updated\nAfrican Common Position, which calls for, among other\nthings, membership in the Security Council to be based on\nan equal geographical formula, on a regional or continental\nbasis. This would make the Council more democratic and\nensure that all Members would feel fairly and equally\nrepresented in our Organization\u2019s most influential body.\nAfrica believes that the continent should have at least\ntwo permanent seats, with full voting and veto rights, to\nrepresent the views and concerns of the other 51 countries.\nThese two permanent seats would be appointed through the\nmechanism designed by the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU), following the established traditional practice in\nforce.\nAt the heart of the debate on overall United Nations\nreform is the question of finances. Most of the reforms\ninitiated by the Secretary-General are aimed at making the\nOrganization more cost-efficient and accountable and at\nallowing more of our finances to be available for the\nprogrammes in the field. This is a timely and necessary\ninitiative and is deserving of the strongest support of all\nMember States.\nThese reforms also justify the recommitment of all\nMember States to keep up to date with their dues. The\nKingdom of Swaziland has consistently tried to maintain a\ngood record in fulfilling its financial obligations to the\nUnited Nations. We pledge to do our best to continue to\nkeep up to date, and we would urge all our fellow Member\nStates to show similar confidence in, and support for, our\nOrganization.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland would also like to add\nits voice to the appreciation expressed to Mr. Ted Turner\nfor his extraordinary display of confidence in our\nOrganization. His act of generosity, from the private\nsector, reflects a new spirit of optimism in the United\nNations, and we would call on others with the resources\nto do so to follow Mr. Turner\u2019s example.\nHopes for future global stability have been raised by\nthe various initiatives for reducing the numbers and\nspread of nuclear weapons and warheads.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland in particular commends\nthe commitment of the United States of America and of\nRussia to the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START)\nprogrammes, whose implementation will contribute\nsignificantly to a more peaceful world for future\ngenerations.\nWe are also encouraged by the global support for the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and for the\nChemical Weapons Convention, both of which have been\nsigned by the Kingdom of Eswatini.\nAll these initiatives are important indications of the\nreal commitment of almost all countries to promote\ninternational peace and security. We fully support the\nSecretary-General\u2019s proposal to create a new Department\non Disarmament and Arms Regulation as a necessary\naddition to the Organization.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland continues to support all\nmoves to bring about a total ban on the production, use\nand sale of all types of landmines. We participated at the\nrecent Oslo negotiations on anti-personnel landmines and\nwelcomed the signing of the treaty.\nWe regret, however, that not all countries could be\nparties to the treaty, while understanding the reasons\nbehind their decisions. We sincerely hope that a way can\nbe found soon to achieve universal agreement on this\ncrucial humanitarian issue.\nAs a consequence of situations of instability on our\nborders, we have experienced first hand the terror of\nlandmines, and we have great sympathy for all who have\nundergone the suffering associated with them. We also\nwatched with great admiration the efforts of the late\nDiana, Princess of Wales, to bring to the world an\n2\n\n\nawareness of the horrors of these indiscriminate tools of\nwar. We therefore call on all Member States to support the\ninitiatives aimed at ending for ever the threat of all types of\nlandmines.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland views with great concern\nthe situation in the Middle East and in particular the\nstrained relations between the Israeli and Palestinian people.\nThe climate of reconciliation and hope inspired by the Oslo\npeace accord has given way to suspicion and dread. It is\nclear that the international community must continue to\nsupport the peace initiative as the only way forward and\nmake every effort to bring the two sides back to the\nnegotiating table on a basis of mutual trust and confidence.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland supports the efforts of all\nwho are trying to achieve a breakthrough in this area. We\ncall on the Israeli Government and the Palestinian\nAuthority, for the sake of their own people, to find a way\nout of this apparent deadlock and return to the spirit of\ncompromise which prevailed during the Oslo negotiations,\nand which held out the promise of lasting peace.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has been encouraged by\nthe recent developments in Northern Ireland, with all-party\ntalks on the future of that troubled province at last under\nway. We commend the determination of the British and\nIrish Governments to involve all stakeholders in the\nnegotiations, and we call on all involved to make every\neffort to ensure that these negotiations lead to lasting peace\nand stability.\nThe continent of Africa continues to experience\nsituations of instability and conflict which have unfortunate\neffects on all of us who call it our home. In the past 12\nmonths we have seen crises in Sierra Leone, the Congo and\nthe Comoros islands, and the continuation of problems in\nmany areas and countries such as the Great Lakes region,\nthe horn of Africa and Angola.The Kingdom of Swaziland\nprays for the many millions caught up in the violence of\nthese and other situations of instability on our beloved\ncontinent, and continues to support efforts to find peaceful\nsolutions.\nAt the same time, we welcome a number of\nencouraging events on the continent, in countries such as\nLiberia, where United Nations efforts towards peace over\nthe years contributed significantly to the elections earlier\nthis year.We applaud the peaceful nature of that process,\nand we hope and pray that lasting, sustainable peace has at\nlast come to the Liberian people after so many years of\nconflict.\nAnd we commend the appointment by the Secretary-\nGeneral of Personal Envoy Mr. James Baker to oversee\nthe situation in Western Sahara. We are most encouraged\nby developments in this long-running dispute, and we\nlook forward to a lasting resolution in the near future.\nIn the light of continuing instability on much of our\ncontinent, one practical measure undertaken by the whole\nAfrican community has been the recent initiatives by the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and subregional\norganizations, such as the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) and our own Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC), to become better\nprepared to cope with our continent\u2019s crises using the\nresources available to maintain peace in our region. One\nelement of this has been the training and preparation of\nAfrican peacekeeping forces for deployment throughout\nthe continent. The Kingdom of Swaziland has pledged its\ncommitment to provide troops for such forces, once\nadequate training and preparation have been completed.\nWe should like to record our appreciation to the\nUnited States of America for its African Crisis Response\nInitiative, which is focusing a number of African\ncountries, including the Kingdom of Swaziland, on the\nrequirement for such things as standardized procedures,\ntraining and equipment. It is clearly essential for this type\nof peace force initiative to have the support of the\ninternational community and for the OAU to maintain\nclose cooperation with the United Nations in our joint\nattempts to provide adequate policing of crisis situations\nin Africa.\nFor almost 30 years the Kingdom of Swaziland has\nenjoyed excellent relations with a nation which, despite an\noutstanding record in international development\nassistance, and while fulfilling all the requirements for\nmembership of our Organization, is nonetheless excluded\nfrom participating in the activities of the United Nations.\nI am referring to the issue of the Government of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan.\nIn October 1971 the United Nations adopted a\nresolution which withdrew membership from the Republic\nof China. That resolution has the effect today of denying\nthe rights of almost 22 million people to be represented\nhere in the United Nations, and to contribute to all the\nglobal initiatives undertaken by our Organization.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has been in a position to\nrecognize and experience at first hand the peace-loving\nnature of the Republic of China on Taiwan and its\n3\n\n\nwillingness to help foster peace and prosperity throughout\nthe world. The Government and people of the Republic of\nChina have made enormous advances in economic, social\nand political terms, and have shown themselves ready and\nable to share their experience and advice with all the\nnations of the world.\nMany countries and political groupings over the years\nhave also recognized the need to involve the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan in global development activities, through\nthe offices of the United Nations and its agencies. There is\nalso a growing voice of international opinion, including in\nthe European Parliament, the American Congress and\namong many countries on all five continents, that\nmembership of the United Nations is necessary for the huge\nresources and wealth of expertise of the Republic of China\nto be put to the best possible use for the benefit of all\nmankind.\nOne of the founding and guiding principles of our\nOrganization has been that of universality, of granting all\npeoples of the world the right to belong to the United\nNations and to be heard in our chambers. It is a reality that\nalmost 22 million people believe that that right is denied to\nthem, by virtue of their country's exclusion from the\nactivities of the one truly global development Organization.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland therefore proposes to its fellow\nMember States that the time has now come to review the\nresolution of 26 years ago. We believe that there is an\nurgent need to re-examine this issue, taking into account the\nprofound changes in the situation that have occurred since\n1971.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has viewed with concern\nthe recent report of the United Nations Conference on\nTrade and Development, which highlighted once more the\neconomic plight of the developing world. Globalization and\nliberalization are economic principles with which we all\nagree, but not at the expense of a greater concentration of\nwealth in the developed countries and an increase in\npoverty amongst the underdeveloped.\nIt is all very well to quote the long-term benefits of\ntrade liberalization, but we must understand the severe\nshort-term penalties for those countries which are least\nprepared to meet them. The Kingdom of Swaziland\nunderstands very well what is required of us in a world of\nfree trade, in terms of becoming a producer of finished\ngoods and services in a manner which will allow us to\ncompete effectively and on an equal basis with the rest of\nthe world. But for us to achieve the growth and standards\nof technology and production required, we and the rest of\nthe developing world need the understanding and support\nof the developed countries in what will be very difficult\neconomic times ahead.\nTo meet this economic challenge, the Kingdom of\nSwaziland is continuing its efforts to develop in a\nsustainable manner, and to create an environment in\nwhich our people can prosper. We have been following\nup recent national initiatives designed to address our\nshort- and long-term social and political challenges and to\nenhance the right conditions to allow our private sector to\ncontinue to be the engine for growth. We have just\ncompleted our latest national development strategy, which\nwill set out Government priorities for the next 25 years.\nOur own internal restructuring programme is continuing,\nand Government has begun a series of short-term\nmeasures to improve the economy.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland is a developing nation\nwhich is largely dependent on agriculture for its survival.\nIn common with other Member States in our position, we\ncontinually find ourselves at the mercy of Mother Nature,\nand in particular we are dependent on adequate rainfall.\nOur economy is only just recovering from the devastating\ndrought of 1991 and 1992, and now we have learned with\ngreat dismay that the dreaded El Ni\u00f1o is once more\npresent in the Pacific Ocean. If true, this will have the\ngravest consequences for all of us in southern Africa. The\nKingdom of Swaziland has learned the lessons of the last\ndrought, and we have begun a programme of dam\nconstruction throughout the rural areas. But the threat of\na renewed period of reduced rainfall has come much too\nsoon, and we hope for the support once more of our\nOrganization and our fellow Member States.\nIn addition to addressing its economic concerns, the\nKingdom of Eswatini has also begun a review of the\nnation's Constitution. In response to the call by the Swazi\npeople for a fundamental and far-reaching review of our\nexisting Constitution, a Commission has been established\nand is in the process of conducting a constitutional\neducation programme, reaching even to the most remote\nareas of the country.\nThis will be followed by a period of submissions\nfrom everyone in the Kingdom, after which a constitution,\nin accordance with the wishes of the whole nation, will be\ndrawn up for national approval.\nIt will truly be the people's constitution, since the\nprocess allows the free participation of all Swazis.\nNational participation in important matters such as these\n4\n\n\nis a crucial guiding principle of the Swazi people and, over\nthe years, has ensured the peace and stability we have\nalways enjoyed.\nWe have welcomed the encouragement and support for\nour constitutional review process from the international\ncommunity, including the United Nations Development\nProgramme office based in the Kingdom. We are confident\nthat, with the involvement of all Swazis, we will produce\na document reflecting the wishes of the whole nation, one\nthat will serve us well for generations to come.\nThere is much vital work to be done in this fifty-\nsecond session of the General Assembly. The Kingdom of\nEswatini believes that our Organization is at a major\ncrossroads in terms of its own development. We have the\nopportunity now to carry out the correct reforms and ensure\nthat our Organization is equipped to face the many global\nchallenges that lie ahead in a more efficient, accountable\nand open manner. We must choose our steps carefully and\nwisely. Those for whom we are responsible \u2014 our\npeople \u2014 look to the United Nations to provide the global\ndevelopment leadership that we so desperately need. We\ncannot afford to fail them.\nOn behalf of Her Majesty the Indlovukazi, the\nGovernment and the whole Swazi nation, it is my proud\nduty to reaffirm the commitment of the Kingdom of\nSwaziland to the Charter and principles of the United\nNations. May God watch over the Assembly's deliberations\nhere in the coming months and guide it in its decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to begin by expressing my warmest\ncongratulations to the President upon his election. We are\nconfident that his experience, know-how and broad\nunderstanding of international issues will be invaluable in\ncarrying out the noble mission that has been entrusted to\nhim and will provide the best possible assurance of the\nsuccess of this session. His election to the presidency\nreflects the very special respect the international community\nhas for his friendly country, Ukraine, because of its wise\npolicy, based on moderation and a sense of proportion and\nalso because of the efforts it is making to consolidate the\nprinciples of peace, justice and cooperation as the\nfoundation of relations between States.\nI also wish to express our warmest thanks and\ngratitude to last year's President, His Excellency Mr. Razali\nIsmail, who throughout his term in office distinguished\nhimself by the dedication and loyalty with which he carried\nout his functions, playing a remarkable role in the reform\nof the United Nations and its restructuring and adaptation\nto the changes occurring in the world, and in preparing it\nto enter the twenty-first century with greater efficiency.\nReform of the United Nations and its restructuring are\nundoubtedly in the forefront of the issues on this session's\nagenda, particularly since Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nhas kept the promise he made when he took office and\nhas submitted a report on reform of the Organization that\ncontains numerous measures and recommendations that\nare important for the Organization's future. It is with\npleasure that I pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan for all the initiatives he has taken and the bold\nproposals he has made since taking office a short while\nago with a view to reforming the Secretariat and\nrationalizing its functioning.\nTunisia, which took an active part in the discussions\nheld in the various working groups entrusted with the\nreform process, wishes to underscore the prime\nimportance of the issues raised in the Secretary-General's\nreport, both those that fall within his competence\nregarding coordination between the different Departments\nof the Secretariat and between the United Nations and its\nspecialized agencies and those reforms that concern the\nUnited Nations activities and fall within the competence\nof the General Assembly, in connection with which the\nAssembly will adopt relevant resolutions.\nThere is no doubt that the international community\nis motivated by a sincere will to give a powerful impetus\nto the reform process to enable the United Nations to\naccomplish the tasks provided for in the Charter, whether\nwith regard to achieving security and peace in the world\nor to establishing conditions for sustainable development,\ntwo closely related, complementary goals.\nIn our view, the most important priority of the\nreform process is to focus on strengthening the United\nNations role in achieving development and in reducing\nand eradicating poverty, mobilizing the means required so\nthat developing countries can achieve economic and social\ndevelopment and meet the crucial challenges imposed\nupon them by globalization and by the market economy.\nNotwithstanding the well-being and prosperity that\ntechnological progress and globalization of the economy\nhave brought to certain countries, while others have been\nexcluded, the world's economy continues to suffer from\nimbalances that hinder growth in developing countries and\nendanger international stability. We consider it essential\nto give priority to these situations in United Nations\nprogrammes and activities in order to narrow the chasm\nthat exists between States, give new impetus to\ninternational cooperation in the field of economic and\nsocial development and strengthen the United Nations\ncapacity for effective and efficient action in this regard.\nTunisia stresses the need to strengthen the role of the\nUnited Nations in the field of development in order to\n19\n\n\nconsolidate the General Assembly's prerogatives with regard\nto preparing cooperation policies and monitoring their\nexecution. The United Nations continues to be the ideal\nforum for this within the framework of the international\ncommunity. That also requires that Member States honour\ntheir financial commitments to the United Nations in order\nto provide the necessary means required for successful\nreform, the realization of the United Nations various\nprogrammes and rational, judicious use of resources.\nIn this connection Tunisia once again reaffirms its\nsupport for the restructuring of the Security Council to\nensure a fairer representation of Member States and to\nguarantee the interests of developing countries within the\nframework of equality for all Member States, consecrating\nthe spirit of the Charter and giving concrete expression to\nits principles. In this regard, my country would recall the\nlegitimate claim of the African States, as expressed at the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Summit Meeting held\nat Tunis in June 1994 and reaffirmed at the recent OAU\nSummit at Harare, calling for the allocation of two\npermanent seats on the Security Council to be occupied by\nAfrican States on a rotating basis.\nIt is also important to continue to improve the working\nmethods of the Security Council and to implement fully the\nprocedures stipulated in the Council's rules of procedure to\nensure the effective participation of United Nations Member\nStates and their collective responsibility for maintaining\ninternational peace and security.\nThe maintenance of international peace and security\nand the elimination of the hotbeds of tensions, conflicts and\nwars that still rage in many regions of the world are today,\nin addition to the problems of development, at the forefront\nof the international community's concerns, and they\ncontinue to require determined and consistent action by the\nUnited Nations.\nIn this context, Tunisia emphasizes the importance of\nthe role the United Nations must play with regard to the\nsituation in the Middle East in the light of the dangerous\ndevelopments that are taking place there. The United\nNations has followed the Palestinian problem since the very\nbeginning and has had a special responsibility to the\nPalestinian people from the adoption of the resolution on\nthe partition of Palestine until the formulation of the basic\nprinciples of a pacific settlement of the Arab-Israeli\nconflict.\nTunisia has stood by the Palestinian people in their\nstruggle to recover their legitimate rights and for 12 years\nwas home to the Palestine Liberation Organization. It has\nfollowed, from a position of neutrality, the Middle East\npeace process and played, at the behest of its of President,\na historic role in triggering that process. It has supported\nthe process at every stage, beginning with the initial\ncontacts between the conflicting parties, at the Madrid\nConference, and in the Oslo, Washington and Cairo\nagreements. Tunisia was also a party to the multilateral\nnegotiations. As such, Tunisia wishes here to express its\nprofound concern and indignation at the obstruction of\nthis process and at the freezing of the agreements that led\nup to it, as well as at the renewed dangers of conflict,\nviolence and instability in the region.\nWe denounce the Israeli Government's policy of\nfait accompli, its failure to respect the international\nagreements that have been signed and the unilateral\nmeasures it has taken in building colonies inside and\noutside Al Quds, destroying houses, confiscating identity\ncards, inflicting collective reprisals against the Palestinian\npeople, seizing their financial assets, continuing to besiege\nthem and taking all sorts of other arbitrary measures. We\ncall emphatically for a return to the basic references that\nhave been part of the peace process since its inception,\nparticularly the principle of land for peace, and for\nrespect of international legality on the basis of Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425\n(1978) and the relevant General Assembly resolutions.\nFurthermore, we call for the implementation of all the\nprovisions of the agreement pertaining to the transition\nstage, including the second redeployment, the opening of\na secure road between the West Bank and Gaza, the\nopening of the airport and the port, the release of\nprisoners and the beginning of the final status\nnegotiations, in accordance with the agreed-upon\nschedule.\nThe international community, particularly in the\nmeetings of the Security Council and the three\nconsecutive meetings of the tenth emergency special\nsession of the General Assembly, has already condemned\nthe current Israeli Government's policy of building\nsettlements in Al Quds and in the occupied Palestinian\nterritories. This policy has greatly discouraged the\nPalestinian community and international opinion in\ngeneral, particularly since it has given rise to acts of\nviolence for which Israel bears sole responsibility, given\nthe profound despair that has replaced the relief that had\nbeen felt throughout the entire region.\nTunisia exhorts the international community, and\nespecially the two sponsors of peace, to act expeditiously\nand firmly to save the peace and avert the dangers that\n20\n\n\nthreaten the region so that the Palestinian people is able to\nrecover its legitimate rights to the creation of an\nindependent State on its own soil with Al-Quds Al-Sharif\nas its capital, and to ensure the restoration to Syria and\nLebanon of the territories which Israel has occupied.\nWe note with satisfaction the United States'\nresumption of efforts to save the peace process, notably the\nmeeting held yesterday in New York between the parties\nconcerned. We also welcome the efforts being made to\nrestore confidence among the parties concerned with a view\nto helping them overcome the current crisis and achieve an\nequitable settlement of the Palestinian problem and the\nArab-Israeli conflict as a whole. We feel that actions\nundertaken to date to mitigate the risks of tension and\nconflict in the region remain far below what we had hoped.\nTunisia regrets the deterioration of the current\nfinancial situation of the United Nations Relief and Works\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA),\nwhich hinders its mission to alleviate the suffering of the\nPalestinian people. While reaffirming the international\ncommunity's responsibility for the question of Palestinian\nrefugees, we urge it to continue to provide assistance to\nUNRWA in order to allow it to carry out its mandate fully\nand resume its work. We urge all donors countries to\nmaintain and honour their financial commitment and to\nincrease their contribution to the Agency budget, taking into\naccount the natural growth in the number of Palestinian\nrefugees, in order to allow the Agency to overcome its\nsevere financial crisis.\nTunisia's awareness of the importance in today's world\nof economic and geographic groupings to meeting the\nchallenges of globalization and the changes we are currently\nwitnessing encourages us to be firm and consistent in\npursuing our efforts to complete the construction of the\nArab Maghreb Union. The Union represents a particular\nclaim made by the peoples of our region and one of the\ngoals that we, together with the leaders of our brother\nMaghreb countries, are striving to attain.\nThis strategic option for the future of the peoples of\nthe region and their cooperation with their immediate\nenvironment is strengthened by the efforts our country is\nmaking, under the impetus of President Ben Ali, to\nconstruct a Euro-Mediterranean area that will serve as a\nframework for cooperation among the Mediterranean\nriparian countries, for solidarity among their peoples and\nfor cultural and social dialogue in the context of the noble\nvalues and principles in which we all believe. Our country\nhas already assumed a distinctive role in ensuring the\nsuccess of the various meetings and conferences held to\nthis end, from the preparatory meeting of the region's\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs held in Tabarka, Tunisia, to\nthe Barcelona conference and the meetings that followed.\nOur country gave concrete expression to this option in\n1995 by signing an association agreement with the\nEuropean Union.\nWe believe that it has become imperative to respond\nfavourably to the willingness of the Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya to settle the Lockerbie question in a fair and\nhonourable manner in the framework of proposals made\nby the League of Arab States, the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) and the Non-Aligned Movement. These\nproposals can help to achieve a peaceful solution based\non international legality and thereby hasten the end of the\nsuffering being endured by the brother Libyan people\nunder the embargo. They would also strengthen stability\nin that part of the Mediterranean.\nWe also take this opportunity to call for an end to\nthe suffering that has been inflicted upon the Iraqi people\nfor a number of years now. We hope that relations among\nthe States of the Gulf region will be based on respect for\nthe sovereignty of all the States of the region, their\nterritorial integrity and the inviolability of their borders,\nin accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security\nCouncil. In this context, Tunisia once again reaffirms its\nsolidarity with the United Arab Emirates in the peaceful\nefforts they are making to recover the islands of Greater\nTunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa.\nThe success of the United Nations in achieving\ninternational peace and security does not rest only on\npeacekeeping operations, preventive diplomacy and the\npeaceful settlement of conflict. It also requires progress\nand accomplishments in the field of disarmament. Despite\nthe end of the cold war and the achievement of a number\nof positive results, particularly in limiting the proliferation\nof weapons of mass destruction, these weapons \u2014\nparticularly nuclear weapons \u2014 continue seriously to\nthreaten all mankind.\nTunisia, which has ratified all the international\nconventions on the subject, reiterates its appeals for the\nestablishment of a denuclearized zone, free of all weapons\nof mass destruction, in the Middle East. This appeal has\nbeen supported by the accession to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of all the countries\nof the region with the exception of Israel, which has\nneither ratified the Treaty nor placed its nuclear facilities\n21\n\n\nunder the system of international controls, thereby\nendangering the security and integrity of the entire region.\nThere are many regions of the world that continue to\nbe torn by war and conflict and whose populations are\nconfronted with tragic situations as a result of instability,\ninsecurity, famine and destitution. We nonetheless note with\nsatisfaction that, despite the persistence of hotbeds of\ntension and instability in some of these regions, the African\ncontinent is beginning truly to awaken to the possibility of\nrestored security and renewed economic growth in a\nnumber of its regions and countries.\nTunisia welcomes the development of the situation in\nAfrica and the sincere determination of member countries\nof the Organization of African Unity to pursue the reforms\nthat have been undertaken to restructure economies and\nconsolidate democracy. At the same time, my country\nreiterates the appeal made by President Ben Ali many times\nto the international community for increased attention to be\npaid to the continent's problems in order to eradicate once\nand for all the hotbeds of tension that remain in Africa, so\nthat security and stability may be instituted throughout the\ncontinent, enabling all its peoples to devote themselves to\nwork and to economic development.\nIn this context, the role to be played by the United\nNations in assisting the countries concerned to overcome\nthese difficulties and challenges assumes primary\nimportance. It is a role that should be seen in the context of\nthe prime responsibility that our international Organization\nassumes in preserving peace and security and in confirming\nthe fact that the United Nations is irreplaceable in these\nendeavours. However, this in no way minimizes the\nimportance that should be given to the action of regional\norganizations, whose role has grown in recent years,\nmaking their influence visible and palpable.\nOur country emphasizes the importance of the role\ndevoted to the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\nManagement and Resolution, which was set up by the\nOrganization of African Unity for all issues related to\nsecurity and stability on the African continent. This clearly\ndoes not prevent us from supporting any international\ninitiative that is consistent with this essential principle and\nthat reinforces African efforts to preserve peace and\nsecurity on our continent.\nWe applaud the efforts of the United Nations\nSecretariat to stimulate cooperation and to promote\nconsultation with the Organization of African Unity to\nstrengthen its capacity for preventing conflicts and\nmaintaining peace. Numerous African States, including\nTunisia, have declared their willingness to participate in\nthe standby arrangements for peacekeeping, thereby\ndemonstrating their determination to contribute to United\nNations efforts to improve the methods of organizing\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. There is no\ndoubt that the promotion of international cooperation,\nparticularly in the field of training and logistics, can\nensure the success of the standby forces, thereby making\nit the basic formula for the establishment of United\nNations peacekeeping forces. In this regard, we reaffirm\nTunisia's unswerving desire to make a real contribution to\nthe efforts of the United Nations to preserve international\npeace and security.\nOur country has contributed both military and\ncivilian contingents to many United Nations peacekeeping\noperations \u2014 from the Congo in the early 1960s to other\nsimilar operations in a number of African countries; in\nCambodia; in Bosnia and Herzegovina; in Croatia; and\nrecently in Haiti \u2014 thus giving concrete evidence of its\nfaith in international action and cooperation carried out by\nthe Organization. Tunisia will continue to support and\nassist United Nations peacekeeping operations whenever\nnecessary.\nIn order to meet the challenges generated by\nglobalization and openness in the world economy, Tunisia\nhas introduced substantial and coherent reforms in the\npolitical, economic and social fields to ensure society's\nequilibrium and integrity and the solidarity of its\nmembers, thereby eliminating the negative factors that\ncould hinder this: exclusion, neglect of the human aspect\nin development, and the creation of chasms between\nsocial categories resulting from disparate levels of\ndevelopment within a given society.\nWe are convinced that global development can be\nachieved only when the vulnerable sectors of society have\nbeen assured the conditions for integration with economic\ndynamics. This requires uprooting the causes of poverty,\ndestitution and marginalization, which is consistent with\nthe commitment to promote solidarity and mutual\nassistance between the members of society on the national\nlevel, and efforts being made in that direction on the\ninternational level.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\nafforded the leaders of Member countries an opportunity\nto confirm their determination to revitalize the role of the\nUnited Nations and to confer upon its actions greater\ndynamism at a time when problems of security,\n22\n\n\ndevelopment and environment multiply, requiring joint\nefforts and shared determination to face them with a view\nto achieving progress, prosperity and well-being for all.\nThe success of the United Nations remains contingent\nupon action in accordance with the goals and principles\nenshrined in its Charter. It is also conditioned by the\ncommitment of all countries, large and small, to implement\ndecisions which uphold the values of liberty, dignity and\njustice. In so doing we will respond to the aspirations of\nour peoples who are the essential guarantors of the United\nNations vitality and of its capacity for renewal, durability\nand ability to meet the challenges which humanity will\nconfront during the next century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst, I join other speakers in\ncongratulating my Ukrainian colleague upon his election to\nhis high office.\nLast week in Oslo, almost 100 countries agreed to a\nConvention text for a total ban on anti-personnel landmines.\nWho would have imagined, only a year ago, such a\nremarkable achievement in such a short time? Thanks to the\ntireless efforts and model cooperation of Governments, non-\ngovernmental organizations and civil society, we have\nreached this milestone event. I would like to extend a\nspecial tribute to the International Campaign to Ban\nLandmines and the International Committee of the Red\nCross. They have been a driving force in our efforts to get\nrid of the scourge that landmines represent in the lives of\nmen, women and children in conflict areas around the\nworld.\nAt the beginning of December we will meet in Ottawa\nfor the signing of the Convention. I appeal to all countries\nengaged in this process to ratify the Convention. To those\nwho have not yet joined us, I say: \u201cPlease do so as soon as\npossible\u201d. Landmines cannot be allowed to terrorize, maim\nor kill more innocent civilians. The United Nations and its\nMembers have an important role to play and responsibility\nfor bringing success to the Ottawa process. I appreciate the\nsupport of the Secretary-General and welcome the fact that\nhe will be the depositary of the treaty. We all have a strong\nmoral obligation to increase our efforts to reduce the\nsuffering and prevent new casualties caused by landmines.\nNorway intends to provide $100 million over a five-year\nperiod for mine clearance and assistance to victims.\nThe spread of landmines, small arms and weapons of\nmass destruction is unfortunately only one of the many\ninterlinked global challenges illustrating that the world now,\nmore than ever, needs the United Nations as a well-\nfunctioning global Organization. At the threshold of the\nthird millennium, it is unacceptable that poverty and\npollution still dominate the daily lives of billions of people\nall over the world; it is unacceptable that hostilities and\nhatred still create deadly new conflicts and humanitarian\ndisasters, between and within States on all continents; and\nit is unacceptable that basic human and individual rights\nare still widely violated through injustice by Governments\nand the negligence of the international community.\nOnly the United Nations can tackle these universal\nand interdependent problems in a comprehensive and\nintegrated manner. But the world has surely undergone\nradical changes since 1945, and so has the nature of the\ntasks confronting us. Hence, the United Nations also\nneeds to change in order to do better what the Member\nStates want it to do. I was therefore very pleased by the\nletter that Mr. Kofi Annan sent to all of our Governments\nlast month. In clear and concise terms, the Secretary-\nGeneral set out the elements of what is without doubt the\nmost comprehensive reform package in the history of the\nUnited Nations.\nLet me state clearly that Norway warmly welcomes\nand fully supports the Secretary-General\u2019s programme for\nreform and renewal of the United Nations. Together with\nthe other Nordic countries, we have given our strong\npolitical backing to his reform proposals. We will work\nactively with other Member States to ensure that the\nGeneral Assembly endorses the reform package this\nautumn. We want the reform plans to be implemented as\nsoon as possible. Norway urgently wants a stronger and\nmore efficient United Nations. Without such reform, we\nwill have an Organization less able to promote\ndevelopment, peace and progress.\nNorway is, as many know, one of the main\ncontributors to the United Nations system. We are one of\nthe group of countries that fulfil the aim of allocating\nmore than 0.7 per cent of our gross national product to\ndevelopment. One out of every 100 Norwegians has\nparticipated in peacekeeping operations around the world.\nIn terms of money, resources and personnel, our voluntary\nassistance to humanitarian relief activities, is, I am proud\nto say, second to none. But we want to make sure that\nour contribution is put to good use. We want to see it\nutilized by the United Nations to improve the lives of\npeople where the needs are the greatest. That is why we\nsupport the Secretary-General\u2019s reform proposals.\nFirst of all, the reforms will ensure that more\nresources are allocated more efficiently for development.\n11\n\n\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s excellent proposal to use\nadministrative savings for a \u201cdevelopment dividend\u201d is but\none element in the process. We encourage him to continue\nfurther on the course that he has taken. United Nations\nactivities targeting sustainable development, poverty,\npopulation, education, the promotion of the role of women\nin development and the implementation of the results of the\nBeijing Conference must be strengthened and integrated at\nthe headquarters and field levels. Health should be among\nthe main priorities. Increased international efforts are\nneeded to assist developing countries in improving their\nnational health policies and to combat emerging and\nre-emerging diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis and\nAIDS. Member States must follow up by fulfilling their\nobligations to increase their transfers of aid to the\ndeveloping countries and peoples that need it the most.\nHopefully, this will also have the effect of creating the\nconfidence needed to bring us forward in the Rio process,\ntowards renewed environmental commitments which can\npave the way for a successful meeting in Kyoto later this\nyear.\nSecondly, the reforms will strengthen the ability of the\nUnited Nations to manage conflicts. Too often, the United\nNations has shown a lack of capacity to act rapidly in the\nface of emerging crises. Therefore, we believe it is high\ntime to establish a rapid-deployment mission headquarters\nfor peacekeeping and other operations. Norway has offered\nto provide funding for personnel for this headquarters.\nFurthermore, we encourage other Member States to\ncontribute to the Trust Fund for Preventive Action, which\nwas established this year. We are pleased to note that the\nFund has already facilitated the work of the Special Envoy\nof the Secretary-General in Central Africa. We want to\ncooperate closely on conflict resolution with our friends and\npartners in Africa, including through our training\nprogrammes for peacekeeping tasks in that region.\nThirdly, the reforms will extend the capacity of the\nUnited Nations in the human rights field. Norway welcomes\nthe proposals to strengthen the human rights secretariat and\nthe excellent choice of Mary Robinson as High\nCommissioner for Human Rights. We pledge to work\nclosely with her to ensure that the international community\nincreases its focus on human rights violations. Human\nrights concerns must become an integral part of all core\nareas of the Organization\u2019s work, including at Headquarters\nin New York.\nWe must follow up reform of the Security Council.\nOur position is, I believe, well known: the Council must be\nmade more representative and should better reflect changes\nin political and economic realities. We want new\npermanent seats for Germany and Japan and for the\ndeveloping countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America.\nAt the same time, a limited number of new non-\npermanent seats should be added.\nWe need financial reform and changes to the scale\nof assessments. Some countries have experienced high\nand sustained economic growth, but still resist reforms\nwhich would better reflect their increased capacity to pay.\nOther countries feel that they are paying too much. We\nagree that the time has come to show flexibility in the\ndiscussions on lowering the ceiling on the scale of\nassessments to the United Nations budgets, as part of an\noverall solution. It cannot be justified that some countries\nunilaterally pay less than their legally binding share, or\nnothing at all. Non-payment is unacceptable. How can\nthose of us who always make a point of paying in full\nand on time, without conditions, expect our citizens and\ntaxpayers to continue financing free riders?\nWe need better integration and coordination within\nthe United Nations system and between the United\nNations, regional organizations, Governments, civil\nsociety and non-governmental actors. For Norway, this is\nnot least important in the area of humanitarian assistance.\nWe welcome the proposal to enhance the capacity of the\nEmergency Relief Coordinator to deal more effectively\nwith complex emergencies.\nIn Bosnia we are engaged in peace-building under\nvery difficult conditions. Men and women are serving a\nwide range of different organizations: the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization, the United Nations civilian police,\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE) and humanitarian non-governmental\norganizations. Without the excellent coordination and\ncooperation that has evolved between the High\nRepresentative, the United Nations Special Representative,\nthe Stabilization Force Commander, the OSCE Head of\nMission and others, the peace-implementation process\nwould have been in dire straits indeed.\nNationalist leaders in Bosnia are still inciting hatred.\nRefugees are being denied their right to return to their\nhomes. Our personnel are being threatened. War criminals\nare still at large. But despite the failure of local leaders to\nfulfil their obligations, the recently held elections show\nthat the international community has given this country\nhope for the future. We will stay the course and remain\nengaged in Bosnia until peace is consolidated. We will\ninsist that wanted war criminals be brought to justice. The\n12\n\n\nconvening of a United Nations conference to establish a\npermanent international criminal court in 1998 must be\ngiven priority.\nNorway remains committed to the Middle East peace\nprocess. While we will continue to work actively with other\ndonor countries to ensure the availability of funding, we are\nextremely concerned by the current deadlock. The parties\nmust realize that there is no alternative to the peace process\nand to the fulfilment of the spirit and the letter of the Oslo\naccords. Further credible efforts to combat terrorism must\nbe undertaken. The current settlements policy is not\nconducive to the peace process. We must redouble our\nefforts to bring the parties back into dialogue about the\nremaining issues.\nWe must not forget the success stories of United\nNations conflict resolution. Just since last year, for\nexample, the decades-long civil war in Guatemala has\nended peacefully. We have had the pleasure of working\nwith the United Nations and others, like the Group of\nFriends for Guatemala, in seeing through the ceasefire\nagreement signed in Oslo and the other peace accords.\nI would like to take this opportunity to commend the\nGovernment of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria\nNacional Guatemalteca for their courage and determination\nto see the peace process succeed.\nFinally, our experience in Guatemala and other\nconflict areas corroborates the importance that the\nSecretary-General attaches to the close interaction between\nthe civil society, Governments and the United Nations. We\nmust make use of the dedication, resources and\ncommitment to peace and progress that exist among\ncitizens, in non-governmental organizations and in the\nprivate sector. Through the active involvement and support\nof civil society, we can build a stronger and more effective\nworld Organization for the next century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI have the honour to convey to\nall representatives the warm greetings and good wishes of\nHis Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, King of Bhutan, for\nthe success of the fifty-second session of the United\nNations General Assembly.\nMay I express, Sir, my heartfelt congratulations on\nyour election to the high office of the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly. We are confident that with your vast\npersonal experience and in-depth knowledge of the United\nNations you will lead our deliberations in this important\nsession to a fruitful conclusion.\nI would like to express our deep appreciation to\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia for the bold and\ninnovative manner in which he led the fifty-first session of\nthe General Assembly.\nI would like to take this opportunity to pay a special\ntribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\ndynamic leadership of our Organization. I wish to\ncongratulate him on his comprehensive report on the reform\nof the United Nations and also to express our appreciation\nto the Executive Coordinator for Reform and his team for\ntheir valuable contribution.\nThis session of the General Assembly has been widely\nregarded as a session for the reform of the United Nations.\nI shall therefore confine my remarks to this subject. The\nquestion of United Nations reform is not a new issue and\nhas been the subject of ongoing discussions. We share the\nview that concrete steps must be taken this year so that the\nfeeling of uncertainty can be put behind us and we can\nconcentrate on other important challenges that confront our\nOrganization.\nBefore we embark on the task of reforming the United\nNations it is important that we first understand what the\nUnited Nations means to different Member States. The\nUnited Nations is certainly unparalleled in history as a\nforum for international dialogue and cooperation, as well as\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security.\nHowever, for many of the larger Members it remains but\none of several means of pursuing their national interests.\nFor smaller Member countries, however, the United Nations\nremains the primary Organization for the protection and\nexpression of their sovereignty. Many of them also rely\nheavily on the United Nations for their economic and social\nadvancement. Any reform of the United Nations must\ntherefore take into account the needs and aspirations of\nthe majority of its Members, which are small developing\ncountries. The United Nations must be able to protect the\npolitical independence of its smaller Members and support\ntheir social and economic development in order to enable\nthem to meet their aspirations for peace and development\nwithout undue pressures or interference from outside.\nThe proposal for reform submitted by the Secretary-\nGeneral is significant in that he has not only sought the\nviews of Member States but has also taken into account\nthe perspective of the United Nations staff, for the\nchanges would have a direct bearing on their functions\nand responsibilities. In our view, this effort to involve\nMembers States as well as the United Nations staff will\nprovide a congenial atmosphere in which to discuss\nreforms and their subsequent implementation.\nWith regard to the reforms, there are clearly areas\nwhich fall within the mandate of the Secretary-General.\nIt is our view that reforms which are already moving\nahead in some areas must be allowed to do so. We find\nmerit in clustering together various divisions within the\nUnited Nations Secretariat in the core areas of peace and\nsecurity, humanitarian affairs, economic and social affairs\nand human rights. We also find the various coordination\nand planning mechanisms being put in place among the\nnew broad clusters necessary and useful.\nWe look forward to receiving from the Secretary-\nGeneral his report on the measures he is taking to\nimplement the organizational changes which are within\nhis mandate. While the General Assembly and some of\nthe existing consultative mechanisms exist and will no\ndoubt be used for interaction with the Secretariat, there\nshould be mechanisms by which the general membership\ncan interact with the newly formed divisions.\nThe new post of Deputy Secretary-General is\nnecessary in our view, given the formidable number of\nresponsibilities that the Secretary-General currently has to\nshoulder. The role of the Deputy Secretary-General\nshould, however, be clearly defined in the larger interests\nof the Organization.\nThe question of refocusing the work of the General\nAssembly itself is an interesting proposal which we fully\nsupport. The long debates in the Assembly, as well as in\nnumerous Committees, and the large number of issues\nand resolutions, are well beyond the capacity of many of\nthe smaller Member countries to handle. We support the\n4\n\n\nidea of dealing with thematic issues, both within the\nplenary and the Committees, during the annual sessions.\nWe also support the view that the follow-up to all\nglobal conferences should be properly tied to the work of\nthe General Assembly. The resolutions and other decisions\nadopted during the General Assembly must be organized in\nsuch a manner that they will have a direct bearing on the\nwork of the Secretariat, providing both guidance and\ndirection.\nThe proposed Development Group that has been\nconstituted, bringing greater coordination of the three key\nUnited Nations development agencies \u2014 namely, the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the United\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA) \u2014 is of special interest\nto the majority of small developing countries to which the\nactivities of these agencies provide significant support. It\nmust be recognized that the coordination among these three\nagencies must support the ongoing programmes which these\nagencies have arrived at with individual countries and that\nthe changes should be brought about without any disruption\nto the current programmes, both in financial and\nprogramming terms.\nAs a country which has benefited greatly from the\nactivities of UNDP, UNICEF and UNFPA, we express our\ngratitude to these and other United Nations bodies and\nspecialized agencies for their assistance to my country. The\nexperience of Bhutan and many smaller developing\ncountries clearly indicates that there is a continued role for\nthese United Nations bodies and agencies. It is our hope\nthat with better coordination within the Development Group\nand field-level implementation of their activities there will\nbe enhanced financial support by the donor community.\nThe proposal by the Secretary-General to have a high-\nlevel ministerial commission to review the work of other\nUnited Nations agencies and their relationship with the\nGeneral Assembly and the Secretariat is timely. The work\nof the specialized agencies is extremely important, and it is\ntime their methods of work and their activities were\nreviewed so that all United Nations programmes are better\nsynchronized.\nAll the efforts to reform and revitalize the United\nNations will not be possible if the United Nations does not\nhave a sound financial position. The financial health of the\nUnited Nations must be restored. All members must work\nearnestly towards meeting this objective. We welcome the\nSecretary-General\u2019s proposal to create a revolving credit\nfund to meet the Organization\u2019s funding. However, the\nprimary requirement must be met from the assessed\ncontributions of Member States. In this regard, it is our\nview that the negotiations on the scale of assessments\nmust proceed and be resolved at an early date in a\nmanner that is acceptable to all Member States. We also\nfirmly believe that all Member States must meet their\nfinancial obligations to the Organization through the\nunconditional payment of their assessed dues in full and\non time. The United Nations must also institute more\ndynamic means of fund management, including utilization\nof the financial market in a prudent manner. All legal\nrestrictions to such management should be reviewed.\nOne of the most important issues relating to the\nreform of the United Nations remains the membership of\nthe Security Council. It is our view that the discussions\non this issue, emanating from complex and fundamentally\ninequitable premises, have led to the current difficulties.\nHowever, the continued status quo does not benefit the\nvast majority of Member States. Bhutan fully supports the\nNon-Aligned Movement\u2019s position that there must be\nexpansion of the permanent membership to include the\ndeveloped and developing countries and that there should\nbe additional non-permanent seats. The expansion must\ntake into account the new security needs and the objective\ncriteria, of who would best be able to shoulder the new\nresponsibilities. We believe that on the basis of objective\ncriteria, Japan, as one of the foremost economic and\npolitical powers in the world today, qualifies for\npermanent membership. Among developing countries,\nIndia\u2019s case merits serious consideration for permanent\nmembership due to its massive population \u2014 one out of\nnearly six people on our planet is an Indian \u2014 and its\ngreat economic potential, in addition to the fact that India\nhas played an active role in all United Nations activities.\nDiscussion on the expansion must continue, and we\nshould not be deterred by the complex nature of the\nsubject. We remain confident that an early and equitable\nsolution can be found.\nIt is our hope that the reform of the United Nations\nand the renewal of the United Nations can be completed\nin the two remaining years of this century, so that during\nthe millennium session of the General Assembly, in the\nyear 2000, we can concentrate on the vision and\naspirations of mankind for the twenty-first century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, it is my\npleasure to congratulate you on your election, to share the\nconfidence expressed in your leadership, and to pledge the\ncooperation of the Barbados delegation in the work of the\nfifty-second session of the General Assembly.\nI also wish to convey our deep appreciation to His\nExcellency Ambassador Razali Ismail for his outstanding\nstewardship of the fifty-first session. My delegation\nwelcomed the firm management and dispatch of the\nGeneral Assembly agenda which characterized his tenure as\nPresident. We would wish that this businesslike approach\nreflect the new direction of a reformed United Nations,\nmore efficient and more effective, to face the challenge of\nrapid global change.\nThe Assembly meets again for its review of the global\npolitical scene against a background of recurring strife and\nconflict in many parts of the world. The increasing\ndemands on the resources of the Organization continue to\nhamper implementation of its priority mission in the post-\ncold-war world, namely, promoting sustainable\ndevelopment and, in particular, the elimination of absolute\npoverty.\nMy delegation believes that the United Nations must\nremain the conscience of the international community in\nthe fight against poverty and misery, which afflict so\nmany of the world\u2019s people. Yet we face the stark reality\nthat without peace, the fruits of development and the\ngoals of economic and social justice will remain for them\na distant dream.\nThe numerous conflicts, both old and new, which\ndarken the global political scene underline the need for a\nnew urgency in the quest for peace, so wherever conflict\nexists we call on all concerned parties to redouble their\nefforts towards reconciliation and to accelerate the\nconditions for stability and economic and social progress\nfor their people.\nBut, as we look to the new millennium, we believe\nthat prospects for an era of lasting peace must extend\nbeyond traditional responses to conflict after they have\nerupted. The promotion of a \u201cCulture of Peace\u201d, launched\nby the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO), holds considerable promise. It\nfocuses greater attention on prevention and addresses the\ncause of conflict at its roots. We share the view of\nUNESCO that this challenge is broad and far-reaching\nand would require priority commitment by the United\nNations system, non-governmental organizations, and civil\nsociety.\nInstitutional reform and restructuring at both the\nnational and multilateral levels in response to rapid global\nchange is an imperative, not an option. Barbados strongly\nsupports the United Nations reform process, and has\nfollowed with deep interest the progress of the various\nWorking Groups.\nThe Working Group on an Agenda for Development\nhas completed its task. We now have a comprehensive\ndocument which embodies the main development\npriorities contained in the various programmes of action.\nBut if the Agenda is to be implemented, it must claim\nwide ownership, not only among the organs and\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations system, but\namong the operational Ministries of Governments as\nwell \u2014 in particular, Ministries of Finance. Here we\nremain concerned that the critical question of the future\n11\n\n\nfinancing of development has not been resolved. This has\nheightened uncertainty about the international commitment\nto development cooperation, through which the United\nNations system has played such an important supportive\nrole in developing countries.\nNegotiations taking place in the Working Group on\nreform of the Security Council should facilitate, not limit,\nopportunities for membership of developing countries, and\nreflect the altered structure of the Organization since 1965.\nBarbados attaches particular importance to the principle of\nopenness and transparency in the work of the Council and\nwelcomes the steps already taken in this direction through\nregular briefings and monthly assessments by Council\nPresidents.\nDifficult negotiations remain on key issues, including\nthe size of the Council, the nature of its enlargement and\nthe use of the veto. We must now step up consultations,\ndrawing on the useful proposals submitted by Member\nStates and the Co-Chairmen of the Group. We hope such\nnegotiations can be conducted in a timely and open manner,\nin a spirit of compromise, and to the general satisfaction of\nall.\nThe report on the strengthening of the United Nations\nsystem contains many important recommendations for\nimproving the role and functioning of the General\nAssembly and the accountability and efficiency of the\nSecretariat. Some may argue that these proposals do not go\nfar enough. In the view of my delegation, however, they\nconstitute a firm basis on which the effectiveness of these\norgans can be built. We look forward to their\nimplementation.\nMy delegation remains deeply concerned about the\nprolonged financial crisis facing the Organization and the\nserious implications for its long-term viability. We believe\nthat the United Nations is at the crossroads. Payment of\nassessed contributions in full, on time and without\nconditions is a hallowed treaty obligation of Member States.\nUnilateral conditions, however convenient, constitute a\ndangerous precedent which could hobble the United Nations\nand the reform process for many years to come. We urge\nthe Working Group concerned to step up its efforts to put\nthe Organization on a more secure financial footing.\nAgainst this background of United Nations system\nreform, we welcome the second phase of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s reform programme \u201cRenewing the United\nNations: A Programme for Reform\u201d. It contains many far-\nreaching proposals designed to streamline the organizational\nand management structure of the United Nations and to\nimprove its overall effectiveness. My delegation will\nparticipate actively in the relevant forum which will\nconsider this report, and seek greater clarification and\nspecificity on a number of key recommendations.\nIn principle, however, we believe that as chief\nexecutive officer, accountable to Member States for the\nOrganization\u2019s performance, the Secretary-General must\nbe able to implement those management actions within\nhis immediate authority. At the same time, we would\ncaution that reform should not be driven by staff\nreduction targets, nor predetermined by budgetary\nconstraints. We believe reform should be guided by the\nmandated objectives and priorities set by Member States,\nas reflected in the various programmes of action of the\nglobal conferences, and the financial and human resources\nrequired to implement them.\nThe scientific achievements of this century have\nbeen truly spectacular. We have visited the Moon and\nlived in outer space for months. We have made great\nadvances in medicine and genetic engineering, in\ninformation technology, in high-speed mass transport and\nin food production, to mention only a few. Yet so much\nremains to be done. Abject poverty, disease, illiteracy and\nill-health still afflict far too many fellow inhabitants of\nthis planet as we approach the new millennium.\nThis Organization has done much to alleviate\nsuffering. But it can continue to do so, and do so more\neffectively, only if Member States, according to their\ncapacities, give unselfishly of the financial and technical\nresources necessary for the execution of its social\nprogrammes.\nIn Barbados, our own national development\nprogrammes underscore the Government\u2019s assignment of\nhighest priority to the social sectors, which at present\naccount for almost 40 per cent of total Government\nexpenditure. Through sustained economic growth,\nsupplemented by an effective social safety net, the\nGovernment aims to spread the benefits of development\nto all its people. Among new major programmes are Edu\ntech 2000, a five-year education-sector programme aimed\nat enhancing the use of information technology by\nstudents and teachers, and the Youth Entrepreneurship\nScheme, known as YES, which provides training,\nbusiness counselling, mentorship and access to finance for\nyoung entrepreneurs.\n12\n\n\nWhile our strong commitment to social policy has paid\nrich dividends, as illustrated by the successive high\nrankings of Barbados in the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) human development index, emerging\nproblems largely associated with poverty, particularly\namong youth, are of critical concern.\nThe Government has therefore launched a major\ninitiative in collaboration with UNDP to elaborate a plan of\naction for poverty alleviation including the feasibility of a\nsocial-investment funding scheme. It will target pockets of\npoverty throughout the country and provide funding for\nprogrammes submitted by local non-governmental\norganizations and community groups, focusing on skills\nacquisition and community empowerment. Through related\npolicies, the Government is implementing measures to\npromote gender parity and the full integration of women\nand youth in the development process.\nBarbados enjoys a robust democracy and so recognizes\nthe increasing influence of civil society in shaping national\npolicy. The Government has taken a number of actions to\nfoster and to strengthen this participatory process, including\nthe establishment of National Commissions on Social\nJustice and on Reform of the Constitution. This underscores\nthe highest priority we give to social justice and democracy\nand the importance we attach to keeping these fundamental\nrights under periodic review.\nBarbados participated actively within the Alliance of\nSmall Island States (AOSIS) during the nineteenth special\nsession of the General Assembly, which reviewed the\noutcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment\nand Development. We consider the Rio Conference to be\none of the great achievements of the United Nations. It\nunderscored the integration of environment and\ndevelopment policies through a comprehensive programme\nof action \u2014 Agenda 21 \u2014 which speaks to the very\nsurvival of our planet. More particularly, it called the\nattention of the international community to the special\nvulnerabilities of small island developing States through the\nfollow-up Global Conference on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of the Small Island Developing States, and\nthe Barbados Programme of Action which it adopted.\nBarbados shared with other developing countries the\nexpectation that the special session would rekindle the spirit\nof Rio and reaffirm the commitments made for the\nfinancing of sustainable development. The special session\nclearly fell short of these expectations. Since Rio, progress\nhas been made in enacting international law and\nconventions in the areas of biodiversity, the seas, climate\nchange and desertification, and in implementing\nenvironmental policies at the national level. But the\nfailure of donors to honour commitments on finance and\ntechnology was clearly the most crucial factor limiting\nfurther implementation of Agenda 21.\nWe welcome, however, the decision to hold a two-\nday special session to review the Barbados Programme of\nAction in 1999. It is our hope that this review will\nreinforce the long-term viability of this Programme and\nunderscore the vital role small island developing States\nplay as a laboratory for the study of environmental\nchange in the interest of all countries. While recognizing\nthat, through self-help, small island developing States\nmust do more to revitalize the Barbados Programme, we\nurge the international community to provide greater\nfinancial support to strengthen its implementation,\nespecially its information network and technical assistance\ncomponents. The upcoming Caribbean ministerial meeting\non the plan of action, scheduled to be held in Barbados in\nNovember, will give strategic direction to our preparatory\nwork over the next several months.\nI wish to turn briefly to specific developments of\nmajor concern to the Caribbean region. The vulnerability\nof our region, both environmental and economic, is a\ndaily reality. On the emerald isle of Montserrat, nature\nhas dealt a most cruel blow. There the people face not\njust the effects of a natural calamity, but the distinct\npossibility that their island home and way of life could be\nobliterated. The eruption of the Lange Soufriere Hills\nVolcano shows no signs of abating. Barbados has joined\nits Caribbean Community (CARICOM) partners in\nproviding financial and material assistance to the people\nof our sister isle in this time of crisis. We urge the\ninternational community to come to the assistance of this\nbeleaguered island.\nMan-made disasters can be no less cruel. The recent\ndecision of the World Trade Organization panel on the\nbanana question has threatened the very lifeline of the\nexporting countries of the region. We know that\ndiversification is the long-term answer. But such\neconomic transformation cannot be achieved overnight or\nwithout consistent support from the international\ncommunity. Barbados joins affected countries in appealing\nfor such support.\nLast June Barbados and the other CARICOM States\nwelcomed Haiti as the fourteenth member of our\nCommunity. Haiti\u2019s future is now linked to CARICOM\u2019s\nfuture.\n13\n\n\nIn supporting Haiti during its critical hour, CARICOM\ncountries cautioned then, and we do so again now, that the\ntask ahead would be long and difficult and that progress\nwould be uneven, and urged the international community to\nstay the course with Haiti. We are therefore grateful not\njust to the Security Council for agreeing to a United\nNations Transition Mission in Haiti whose mandate extends\nto 30 November 1997, but also to the Friends of the\nSecretary-General for Haiti, and to other concerned\ndelegations that made this compromise possible. This\nextension will further professionalize the National Police\nforce and enhance its capacity to secure the stability on\nwhich democracy and development can flourish.\nIn May 1997 Barbados had the honour to host the\nCARICOM/United States summit on partnership for\nprosperity and security in the Caribbean. It underlined our\nmutual economic and security interests and opened a new\nchapter in the CARICOM/United States partnership,\nconsistent with the changing global economy.\nThe summit adopted the Bridgetown Declaration of\nPrinciples. It will guide an ambitious action plan designed\nto promote sustainable development and foster democracy,\npeace, and economic and social progress in the region.\nBarbados considers the summit an important landmark in\nCARICOM/United States cooperation. We look forward to\nmonitoring the action plan at annual meetings of\nCARICOM Foreign Ministers and the Secretary of State of\nthe United States of America, starting early in 1998. We\ntrust that this process of consultation will embrace the\nconcerns of Caribbean countries over a number of critical\nissues, such as the adverse impact of recent immigration\npolicy on the very fabric of Caribbean society.\nBarbados and the CARICOM States have been\nparticularly concerned with the threat to democracy and\nsociety posed by drug trafficking, crime and violence,\nmoney laundering and corruption. Our efforts to rid the\nCaribbean of those scourges have centred on increased\ncooperation and information sharing and on the\nstrengthening and training of our police and coastguard\nforces. We welcome the valuable support for these efforts\nby our bilateral partners as well as by the Regional Office\nfor the Caribbean of the United Nations International Drug\nControl Programme. The special session of the General\nAssembly on the issue of drugs next year will provide a\nvaluable opportunity to share our experiences and also to\nlearn from those of others.\nLet me comment briefly on the phenomenon of\nglobalization, which has reshaped the development\nlandscape, with far-reaching implications for the\nCaribbean Community. The reordering and strengthening\nof CARICOM-United States cooperation are an integral\npart of our adaptation to this powerful impulse. Through\nthe liberalization of trade, finance and services and the\nrapid expansion of telecommunications and information\ntechnology, developing countries have become a driving\nforce in this process, although the level and pace of\nintegration differ widely among countries. Barbados\nshares the anxiety of small developing States, which are\nhighly vulnerable to marginalization in this fiercely\ncompetitive environment given our sparse natural and\nhuman-resource base and limited administrative and\ntechnical capacity.\nGlobalization presents new opportunities for trade\nand investment \u2014 witness the performance of East Asian\neconomies. But the gains have been largely reaped by the\nstronger countries, leaving the weak even more\ndisadvantaged and the inequality between and within\ncountries even more pronounced. It is for this reason that\nwe urge the United Nations to play a greater advocacy\nrole on behalf of vulnerable States in the policy dialogue\non globalization.\nThe CARICOM States recognize that we must\nstrengthen our technical capacity to negotiate effectively\nour integration into the global economy. Accordingly,\nregional negotiating machinery has been established to\nmanage these crucial negotiations, which will determine\nour future relations with major trading blocs.\nThis fifty-second session of the General Assembly\nhas before it many critical issues. It must guide the\nreform process, which, in effect, will determine the very\nfuture of the Organization. It must come to terms with the\nchronic and grave financial crisis that threatens the\nOrganization\u2019s integrity and viability. It must redouble its\nefforts to foster reconciliation and stability in the many\nstrife-torn countries where millions of people remain\ntrapped in poverty and deprivation.\nBarbados believes that this indispensable institution\ncan meet these challenges. But it must expeditiously put\nits house in order so that it can intensify its efforts with\nregard to the priorities that define its unique mission of\npeace, development, democracy and social justice.\nBarbados pledges its full commitment and support.\n14\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI sincerely\ncongratulate the Foreign Minister of Ukraine,\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly, a most crucial task\nwhich I trust he will execute in a most productive and\ncreative manner.\nLet me also record my admiration and praise for the\nway in which his predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail,\nperformed his demanding mission during the whole of the\nfifty-first session of the General Assembly. He laid a\nunique foundation on the basis of which we must now\nmake advances towards a better United Nations.\nI refer to the statement made yesterday by the\nForeign Minister of Luxembourg on behalf of all\n20\n\n\nmembers of the European Union; my Government fully\nsubscribes to that statement.\nOn the threshold of the new millennium, profound\nchanges are affecting the lives of nations and individuals.\nMany are benefitting from open international relations.\nOthers feel marginalized politically and economically. And\nall too many countries are still threatened by persistent\npoverty, social injustice and domestic strife.\nWe need a strong United Nations to counter these\nforces, which separate nations and tear them apart. We need\na renewed United Nations to focus on the tasks for which\nit was established, and to meet the new challenges of today\nand of tomorrow.\nThis is why we need fundamental United Nations\nreform: not piecemeal improvements, but major change.\nThis is why Sweden wholeheartedly endorses the reform\nproposals presented by the Secretary-General. We give our\nsupport as an active participant in all spheres of United\nNations activity and as a major contributor to its\ndevelopment funds and programmes.\nUnited Nations reform is not a cost-cutting exercise.\nIts aim must be to make the Organization strong, effective\nand efficient, focusing on its core activities and ready to\nmeet its future challenges. The Swedish Government\nsupports the proposal that efficiency savings should be used\nfor development.\nThe United Nations cannot be reformed under the\nthreat of political and financial crisis. It is simply not\nacceptable that Member States should set conditions for\nfulfilling Charter obligations. The Swedish Government\nurges all debtors \u2014 including the main debtor, the United\nStates \u2014 to settle their accounts before the end of this year\nand to pay their assessed contributions in full, on time and\nwithout conditions.\nSecuring a sound and viable financial basis must be an\nintegral part of reform efforts. The idea of establishing a\nrevolving credit fund could be considered as an emergency\nstep. We should also enact measures to reverse the current\ntrend of late payment. Article 19 of the Charter should be\napplied more strictly. It is also time to agree on a new scale\nof assessments based on capacity to pay. A realistic\nproposal has been presented by the European Union.\nWe, the Member States, should provide political\ndirection for the reform process. We should take an overall\nview of United Nations reform, and avoid getting trapped\nin details. We are fully aware that there will be further\nsteps: reform is a process, not a one-time event.\nToday, I will emphasize the need to strengthen and\nreform the United Nations in four key areas: peace and\nsecurity, sustainable development, human rights, and\ndisarmament.\nFirst, the United Nations must be strengthened and\nreformed to effectively prevent and settle armed conflicts.\nThis is the purpose for which the Organization was\nestablished. This is where success or failure will\nultimately be determined. Long-term prevention should\naddress the root causes of conflict: poverty, social\ninjustice, oppression and violations of human rights. The\nUnited Nations world conferences have established the\nclose relationship between security and development. The\nUnited Nations must continue to build on this political\nplatform.\nConflict prevention is a task which requires\ncoordinated action by the United Nations system as a\nwhole, including the international financial organizations,\nand also by non-governmental organizations. Cooperation\nat the regional and subregional levels is increasingly\nimportant for building a security environment based on\ncommon values and norms.\nIt is equally urgent to strengthen the ability of the\nUnited Nations to act on the threat of an erupting conflict.\nThe whole range of United Nations instruments, including\nthose mentioned in Article 33 of the Charter, should be\ndeveloped and used to their full potential. Sweden wishes\nto cooperate with other Member States to enhance the\nUnited Nations capacity for early warning and early\naction. The new generation of peacekeeping operations\nmust combine political, military, humanitarian and civilian\nUnited Nations action, and strike the right balance\nbetween various forms of response. The United Nations\nHumanitarian Coordinator plays a key role in fostering a\nresponse to humanitarian crises. This should lay the\ngroundwork for post-conflict reconstruction and long-term\nrecovery of war-torn nations.\nThe Swedish Government supports efforts to set up\na rapidly deployable mission headquarters within the\nUnited Nations. Together with Austria, Canada, Denmark\nand Norway, we are creating the multinational Stand-by\nForces High-Readiness Brigade (SHIRBRIG) to enhance\nthe United Nations capacity for rapid deployment. In\nmany situations United Nations civilian police can help\nprevent conflict and restore ravaged societies. I therefore\n21\n\n\nappreciated the opportunity I had, during Sweden\u2019s\npresidency of the Security Council in July, to deliver a\npresidential statement on civilian police in peacekeeping\noperations. It calls on Member States to make qualified\npolice quickly available to the United Nations through\nbetter and standardized training.\nWe need a global security architecture: a web of\norganizations capable of dealing quickly with a wide range\nof threats and potential conflicts. Regional organizations\nwill further gain in importance. But the primary and overall\nresponsibility remains with the United Nations. Conflict\nprevention, peacekeeping, peace-building and humanitarian\naction to protect the victims of conflicts have to be at the\ncore of United Nations reform efforts. But the decisive\nfactor will not be the instruments with which we equip the\nOrganization, but rather our willingness to use them, to pay\nfor them and to accept the authority of the United Nations.\nMy second theme is that the United Nations must be\nstrengthened and reformed to combat poverty and promote\nsustainable development. Fighting poverty, supporting\nsustainable development and promoting economic\nintegration are part of the Organization\u2019s mandate as set out\nin the Charter. Sweden sees this crucial task as being in its\nown best interest. Our own development has benefited\nmuch from the multilateralism of this century.\nThe Swedish Government wholeheartedly supports the\nproposals of the Secretary-General to reform the United\nNations in the economic and social fields. We want an\nempowered and capable United Nations. We want a unified\nUnited Nations presence in the field so that the United\nNations system can be a reliable and flexible partner for\ndeveloping countries. We want long-term commitments\nfrom donors and more equitable burden-sharing for\nfinancing development.\nSweden is one of the four countries fulfilling the\nUnited Nations aid target. Over a three-year period, by the\nyear 2000, we undertake to further increase our aid budget,\nchallenging the international trend. In spite of a few\ndifficult years, we have kept up our voluntary contributions\nto the multilateral system. In the coming years we foresee\nincreases. To support debt relief for the poorest countries\nthe Swedish Government will contribute 295 million\nSwedish Krona to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\nand World Bank Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt\nInitiative.\nOne of the greatest challenges facing the international\ncommunity in the coming years will be to achieve global\nsustainable development. The industrialized countries\nmust take the lead and learn how to do more with less\ninput of resources and energy. Our goal should be to use\nenergy and raw materials 10 times more efficiently. In\nour efforts to combat climate change, the developed\ncountries should, this December in Kyoto, agree to reduce\nthe emission of greenhouse gases.\nMy third theme is that the United Nations must be\nstrengthened and reformed to protect and promote human\nrights. Sweden applauds the Secretary-General\u2019s steps to\nintegrate human rights into all United Nations activities.\nWe welcome the appointment of the distinguished Mrs\nMary Robinson as High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nNext year the United Nations will celebrate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. This historic document establishes the individual\nas a subject in international relations, with her or his own\nrights and aspirations. Violations of human rights are a\nlegitimate concern for the international community.\nThe Human Rights Year 1998 will be an opportunity\nfor celebration, but also for critical assessment. We\nshould reform human rights machinery and strengthen\nassistance in this field. The implementation of\ninternational human rights standards must be improved.\nPublic information and fact-finding on human rights\nviolations are crucial. It is particularly important to\nexpose any attempt by Governments to silence those who\nbravely stand up in defence of human rights and basic\nhumanitarian principles in their own countries.\nSweden will continue to work hard to combat\ntorture. We will stand firm in our rejection of the death\npenalty, wherever practised. It is an abhorrent practice,\nunworthy of our times.\nCooperation must be enhanced to eradicate sexual\nabuse, exploitation and trafficking in children and women.\nGovernments need to take firm action against\ndiscrimination based on gender, ethnic origin or religious\nbelief.\nNext year\u2019s diplomatic conference will be a\nmilestone in the decades-long endeavour to establish an\ninternational criminal court. The court will play a crucial\nrole in closing the gap of impunity for those who commit\ngenocide, serious war crimes and systematic or large-scale\nhuman rights violations.\nMy fourth and last theme is that the United Nations\nmust be strengthened and reformed to build security\n22\n\n\nthrough disarmament. Disarmament, non-proliferation and\narms control are central features of any policy aimed at\npreventing conflict, promoting peace and fostering\neconomic and social development. They must become fully\nintegrated elements in a coordinated policy for peace-\nbuilding.\nThe 1990s have seen impressive progress towards\ndisarmament, but much work lies ahead. The international\npolitical and security climate now offers a historic\nopportunity. It must be fully translated into concrete\nactions.\nIt is imperative that the quest for a nuclear-weapon-\nfree world continue. Sweden urges the Russian Federation\nto ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks II (START II),\nenabling the conclusion of START III. This should pave the\nway for further reductions, on the part of all nuclear-\nweapon States, with a view to the total elimination of\nnuclear arsenals, in accordance with Article VI of the Non-\nProliferation Treaty (NPT).\nThe Canberra Commission on the Elimination of\nNuclear Weapons has proposed a series of measures to\nachieve a world free from nuclear weapons. Its report\nmerits in-depth consideration in international disarmament\nforums. Let me focus on two timely aspects.\nThe Commission proposes that nuclear forces should\nbe taken off alert and that warheads be removed from their\ndelivery vehicles. I urge the United States and Russia to\napply these measures without delay to all strategic weapons\ncovered by START II, and subsequently by START III.\nNuclear-weapon-free States have a legitimate right to\nassurances that they will not be attacked or threatened by\nnuclear weapons. The time has come to elaborate a legally\nbinding instrument under the NPT, giving such assurances\nto non-nuclear-weapon States Parties.\nConventional arms \u2014 especially light weaponry \u2014 are\nat the heart of today\u2019s conflicts. They aggravate tensions,\nprovoke and prolong wars and inflict human suffering \u2014\nsometimes long after ceasefires and peace settlements. The\nflow of conventional arms to areas of tension and conflict\nmust be stemmed. I welcome the high priority given to\nsuch objectives in the Secretary-General\u2019s reform\nprogramme. There is a need for export control of\nconventional arms as well as of dual-use products.\nInternational cooperation in this field and the demand for an\ninternational code of conduct for arms transfers are matters\nof high priority for the Swedish Government.\nFrom a humanitarian point of view, anti-personnel\nlandmines are in a category of their own: indiscriminate\nby nature, crippling innocent children, women, men and\nnations. I am proud to say that Sweden was the first State\nto propose a total ban on this terrible type of weapon. I\nwarmly welcome the Oslo agreement on a convention on\nsuch a ban. I urge all States to accede to it. We must now\nmake every effort to achieve universal adherence to this\nban.\nReform is necessary to build a stronger and more\nrelevant United Nations. I have outlined some major\naspects from Sweden\u2019s point of view. As I have\nemphasized, but must not look at United Nations reform\nin isolation, we must consider why we need the\nOrganization and what it can do for all of us through all\nof us.\nToday\u2019s international environment is rife with\ncontradictions. We have a globalized economy, but we\nalso have a periphery unable to benefit, and left further\nand further behind. We have ever closer international\ncooperation, but we also have aggressive nationalism and\nxenophobia. We have growing support for democracy and\nhuman rights, but we also have atrocities and blatant\ndisregard for international law.\nIn this situation, the purpose of the United Nations\nshould be precisely what is spelled out in its name and its\nCharter: to unite nations and people.\n\n\n\n\n"

We understand comprehensiveness in its\nbroadest sense, namely, all parties to the conflict without\nexception must be involved and all aspects of the conflict\nmust be dealt with, whether its inherent causes or those\nwhich have evolved and been aggravated over the years\nand during the various phases of the conflict.\nJordan has always emphasized its adherence to\nSecurity Council resolutions, particularly resolutions 242\n(1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978), as the basic terms of\nreference for the peace process, in addition to the\nprinciple of handing back occupied Arab territory in\nreturn for peace. Based on this and on relevant United\nNations resolutions, legitimacy and justice, we call for the\nresumption of negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track and\nthe Lebanese-Israeli track. We have also made and\ncontinue to make our best efforts to achieve the\nimplementation of the transitional phase agreements and\ngo on to the final status negotiations on the Palestinian\ntrack. We do this out of our firm conviction that the\npeace process will not attain comprehensiveness nor\njustice unless the Israelis and Palestinians arrive at a just\nsolution for the question of Palestine, including the right\nof self-determination for the Palestinian people and the\nestablishment of their independent State on their national\nterritory.\nJerusalem, the city of peace, which is the seat of the\nHoly Places of the three heavenly religions, and to which\nthe hearts of believers the world over turn, deserves our\nutmost attention, with a view to reaching a satisfactory\nsolution that ensures to all freedom of access to the Holy\nPlaces, preserves the holy character of the city and keeps\nit as a symbol of peace among peoples across the world.\nWe affirm that East Jerusalem is an occupied Palestinian\nArab city to which Security Council resolution 242 (1967)\napplies, as it applies to all occupied Arab territories.\nIf the security problem is a major obstacle to peace,\nconfidence-building and peacemaking are the best means\n6\n\n\nto achieve individual and regional security as well as\nstability in the Middle East. There is no peace without\nsecurity and no security without peace.\nAccordingly, we would like from this international\nrostrum to call upon Israel \u2014 the State with which we have\nconcluded a peace treaty \u2014 to do everything possible to\nbuild and consolidate confidence with the peoples of the\nregion in general and the Palestinian people in particular. A\nfirst step toward that would be to abandon, in its dealing\nwith security matters, the language of force, the language\nof siege and restrictions on the livelihood of the Palestinian\npeople. At the same time, Israel must abide by the Fourth\nGeneva Convention by abandoning the settlement policy\nand the policy of creating a new fait accompli on\nPalestinian territory, including its attempts to change the\ndemographic structure and the religious, historical and\ncultural character of the occupied territories, including\nJerusalem. We also call upon Israel to implement the\nagreements concluded with the Palestinian side in letter and\nspirit as soon as possible, for delay and siege will create a\nstate of despair in which it becomes impossible to control\nextremism and prevent it from wreaking havoc on security\nand stability. Extremism undoubtedly finds in these policies\na fertile ground for the achievement of its anti-peace\nobjectives.\nOn the other hand, in order to build confidence with\nthe Governments and peoples of the region, Israel has to\nabandon the production and development of weapons of\nmass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons. All the\nMiddle East States, except Israel, have become parties to\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT). The whole world recognizes that the current\nsituation in the region is indeed a unique situation\nunparalleled in other regions of the world. A single State\nhas a monopoly of nuclear capabilities, while the other\nStates of the region are bound by treaties and international\nlaw.\nBecause the presence of nuclear weapons is a major\nobstacle preventing the peace process from reaching its\ngoals, the ideal solution for this problem would be to\nremove this obstacle by establishing in the Middle East a\nzone free from all weapons of mass destruction.\nIn this context, permit me to announce the decision of\nthe Government of Jordan to accede to the Convention on\nthe Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling\nand Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.\nThis decision was motivated by Jordan\u2019s belief that\nweapons, including all weapons of mass destruction, do not\nestablish security nor restore stability to the Middle East\nregion or to any region in the world unless there is full\nconfidence among its Governments and peoples.\nThe Iraqis no longer see any ray of hope of ending\ntheir continuous suffering caused by the embargo that has\nbeen imposed on them for the last seven years. Iraqis\nhave suffered enough and tasted enough bitter pain. It is\nhigh time that our international Organization moved to\nalleviate their suffering and dress their wounds, so that\nthey may recover their livelihood and contribute anew to\nthe development and prosperity of the region.\nIn issuing this serious and sincere call for the lifting\nof the embargo imposed on the people of Iraq, we would\nlike to reaffirm that it is necessary to preserve Iraq\u2019s\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. We also call upon the\nIraqi Government fully to implement all Security Council\nresolutions and to do its best to reach a solution for the\nproblem of Kuwaiti prisoners and missing persons, to\npave the way for the reestablishment of normal and\nfriendly relations among the States of the region on the\nbasis of mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of all States.\nJust as the Iraqi people are suffering from the\nblockade, so are the Libyan people. Since the sanctions\nwere imposed on Libya, the Libyan people have been\nsuffering from a ban on flights. We therefore call for a\npeaceful settlement of the problem arising from the\nLockerbie tragedy within a framework of international\nlaw and legitimacy.\nWe call upon Iran to enter into serious negotiations\nwith the sisterly United Arab Emirates in order to reach\na peaceful solution, ensuring the return of the three\noccupied islands, Abu Musa and the Greater and the\nLesser Tunb, to the United Arab Emirates, which would\neffectively contribute to the establishment of peace,\nsecurity and stability in the Gulf region.\nSince war began in the former Yugoslavia, Jordan\nhas joined its voice to those of all the States that called\nfor an end to the suffering of the people of the nascent\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, suffering that\nshocked the conscience of the whole world and moved\nthe international community, which had held high hopes\nfollowing the conclusion of the Dayton Peace Agreement.\nWe now reaffirm that peace, security and stability in\nBosnia \u2014 and, indeed, throughout the Balkans \u2014 depend\nlargely on the full and honest implementation of that\nAgreement. A strong international commitment is also\n7\n\n\nessential for making the peace process an irreversible\nreality. The international community must do what is\nincumbent upon it in this regard, including providing\neffective assistance for reconstruction in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and ensuring the effective management of\npublic enterprises as provided in the Dayton Agreement.\nThis would have an important impact on the preservation of\nBosnia\u2019s unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nThe problem of Palestinian refugees, the resolution of\nwhich has been left to the final status negotiations, is one\nof the most intricate problems faced by the Middle East\nregion. However, the international community, regrettably,\ndoes not accord this problem the attention that it deserves.\nThe financial crisis which grips the United Nations Relief\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East\n(UNRWA) has been escalating year after year without a\nsolution being found. UNRWA has been forced this year to\nannounce austerity measures entailing a large reduction in\nservices offered to the Palestinian refugees, including the\nimmediate cessation of the scholarships funded from the\nregular budget; the elimination of all medical compensation\nand referral to hospitals during the last two months of this\nyear; the freezing of emergency cash assistance and shelter\nrehabilitation from the regular budget; a freeze on the\ncreation of new posts, international as well as local; the\nsuspension of recruitment of international staff; the\nsuspension of appointments to local posts, with the\nexception of those considered essential for the continuation\nof operations; and a plan to consider collecting fees from\nstudents in UNRWA\u2019s areas of operation.\nAlthough all those measures have been put on hold\nfollowing pledges by certain donor countries during their\nmeeting with UNRWA and host countries, held recently in\nAmman, to increase their voluntary contributions by an\namount sufficient to cover this year\u2019s deficit, which\namounts to $20 million, the danger of cutting services\nremains as long as no final solution has been found, taking\ninto consideration the need to meet the requirements of\nnatural population growth among refugees and inflation\nrates.\nSince the beginning of the refugee tragedy more than\nfive decades ago, Jordan has borne the heaviest burden of\nall the host countries. The number of refugees in Jordan is\n1.5 million, 20 per cent of whom live in refugee camps\nserviced by UNRWA and the rest of whom are scattered\nthroughout Jordanian cities and villages. Out of its sense of\nhumanitarian responsibility, the Government of Jordan has\nprovided all services needed by the refugees, including\ninfrastructure, education, health and welfare services and\nfinancial support, in addition to public security and civil\ndefence services. Thus, Jordan, despite its scarce\nresources and limited means, spends approximately $340\nmillion annually on services provided to refugees, an\namount almost equal to UNRWA\u2019s total budget. That is\nnot all. The Government of Jordan has also developed\nthis year a strategic plan, a so-called social security\npackage designed to develop infrastructure for refugee\ncamps and disadvantaged areas, to provide sustainable\ndevelopment and to reduce poverty. The total share of\nrefugee camps in this plan comes to nearly $240 million,\nwhich will be allocated to the rehabilitation of water\nsystems, solid waste treatment, sewerage systems, water\npurification plants, road and electricity projects and the\nprovision of essential public services.\nWhile Jordan affirms that improving the standards of\nliving for the Palestinian refugees does not diminish their\npolitical right to return and compensation, as provided for\nin General Assembly resolution 194 (III) of 1948, it\nreaffirms that the support of UNRWA is a collective\nresponsibility of the international community. It also\nstresses the legal, political and humanitarian dimensions\nof the refugee question and considers that any failure to\ndischarge the humanitarian responsibility for this question\nwould negatively reflect on political responsibility.\nMy country therefore affirms from this rostrum the\nneed to take serious and sincere action and to make every\neffort to continue the services provided by UNRWA to\nPalestinian refugees until a lasting, just and\ncomprehensive solution to their problem is reached. We\nalso call for the abandonment of any attempts to abolish\nUNRWA, suspend its operations, reduce the services it\nprovides to refugees or turn its mandates and\nresponsibilities over to any other agency, for that would\nhave a negative impact on the political and legal\ndimensions of the refugee question. It would also have a\nnegative impact on the peace process and stability in the\nregion.\nWe call for compliance with the letter and spirit of\nGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III) of 1948 on the\nquestion of refugees, as well as with Security Council\nresolution 237 (1967), which calls for facilitation of the\nreturn of displaced persons. We call upon donor countries\nto fulfil their commitments to UNRWA and increase their\ncontributions to an extent commensurate with the natural\nincrease in the numbers of refugees. We also call upon\nthe international community in general, and potential\ndonors in particular, to give due attention to this matter.\n8\n\n\nThe refugee problem reminds us of international\nhumanitarian law in general and the need for its full\napplication in particular. This subject has always been one\nof interest to Jordan. Since 1981, Jordan has been\nsubmitting a draft resolution to the Third Committee\nentitled, \u201cA new international humanitarian order\u201d, which\ncalls for respect for the full application of international\nhumanitarian law. My Government has also amended\nJordanian laws to give priority and immense importance to\nthe application of this law. I would recall here the appeal\nby His Royal Highness the Crown Prince of Jordan to work\nhard with the international community to bring into\nexistence a new international humanitarian order.\nThe report of the Secretary-General entitled,\n\u201cRenewing the United Nations: A Programme for Reform\u201d,\nwhich he submitted last July, constitutes a good basis for\nthe reform process and a studied plan for the future,\nembodying a serious and real desire for change for the\nbetter.\nThe report reviews the main strategic functions of the\nOrganization and provides for each of them specific\nproposals charting the way and making Member States real\npartners in achieving an Organization better prepared to\ndeal with humanitarian and political crises; based on greater\nefficiency; qualified to play a more vital role in the areas\nspecified by the Charter; and made imperative by the\nchanging security, economic, social and political\ncircumstances of this world. Jordan calls for opening\nmembership of the United Nations to all peace-loving\nStates, in accordance with Article 4 (1) of the Charter, in\norder to achieve the universality of the Charter.\nThe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, while fully\nappreciating the good efforts of the Secretary-General in\npreparing his plan, stresses the fact that the purpose of\nreform is not confined to cutting costs or dealing with\nunwieldiness. It goes far beyond that to reactivate the role\nof the Organization to discharge its responsibilities and\ncarry out its functions with a high degree of efficiency,\ntransparency and credibility. We agree with the Secretary-\nGeneral that reform is not an isolated event, but a\ncontinuing process that does not stop at the implementation\nof the proposals contained in the report. It extends to\nencompassing the general direction in which the\nOrganization will evolve as a result of the implementation\nof the proposals.\nThe coming century will witness deeper and quicker\nglobal changes. The United Nations must be prepared to\ndeal with these changes in the five major areas\ncorresponding to the main mandates of the United\nNations: peace and security, economic and social affairs,\ndevelopment cooperation, humanitarian affairs and human\nrights.\nIn the area of international peace and security, we\nfind that the multiplicity and diversity of armed conflicts\nin the post-cold-war era have made the Security Council\na hub of international efforts to establish peace and\nsecurity throughout the world. This makes it very\nimportant to restructure and reform the Council. The\nSecurity Council, established after the Second World War,\ndoes not reflect the balance of power prevalent in today\u2019s\nworld. It has become necessary to review its structure and\nrules of procedure. The Working Group on the\nrestructuring and reform of the Security Council has made\ntireless efforts over the past few years to achieve this\npurpose.\nThere are many useful and feasible concepts that\nhave appeared in the context of reform. What has been\nlacking so far is the collective political will to translate\nthese concepts into reality. In this regard, Jordan feels that\nany new restructuring of the Security Council must take\ninto account the representation of the developing countries\nthroughout the globe. We feel that the Arab Group, in\nview of its major and effective role, is entitled to a\npermanent seat on the Security Council.\nThere is no doubt that the United Nations\npeacekeeping operations will continue to be one of the\nmost important activities of the Organization in enhancing\ninternational peace and security. Driven by its belief in\nthis noble aim, Jordan has, on the direction of its\nHashemite leadership, participated for many years in these\nactivities to the extent that, at one point, its contribution\nranked second among all the troop-contributing countries.\nI must, however, point to the financial difficulties\nfaced by some troop-contributing States, including Jordan,\nas a result of the financial crisis gripping the\nOrganization, because reimbursements have not been\nmade in a timely manner. I appeal from this rostrum to\nall Member States to pay their assessed contributions to\nthe Organization without condition, in full and on time.\nMoreover, Jordan has participated in the United\nNations stand-by arrangements. It was the first country to\nsign a memorandum of understanding with the United\nNations under this system. It also participated effectively\nin crystallizing the idea of establishing a rapidly\ndeployable mission headquarters to contribute to\n9\n\n\nenhancing the Organization\u2019s ability to respond rapidly to\ncrises as they occur.\nAs for disarmament and arms control, the progress\nwitnessed by the world during the past few years is really\nencouraging. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons has been extended indefinitely and is now\napproaching universality. Last year, the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was concluded, in addition to\nother significant achievements in the reduction of the\nnuclear-weapon arsenals of the United States and the\nRussian Federation. All eyes are now set on the Conference\non Disarmament in the hopes of seeing it crown its\nachievements with a treaty banning the production of\nfissionable materials used in the manufacture of nuclear\nweapons and another providing full security assurances to\nnon-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use\nof nuclear weapons.\nSince development in the economic and social fields\nis one of the primary objectives of the United Nations,\nserious attention must be directed towards reform of United\nNations organs functioning in these two spheres, foremost\namong them the Economic and Social Council. This reform\nshould enhance international cooperation in setting forth\neffective national policies aimed at advancing growth in all\nMember States with no exceptions.\nThe most important characteristics of the world\neconomy, as we stand on the threshold of the twenty-first\ncentury, are two: first is the global transition to market\neconomy, and second is the rapid technical development of\ncommunication and information technology, making\nknowledge the most important factor of production. The\nnew world economy is also characterized by intense\ncompetitiveness, speed, the intensive use of information and\nincreasing globalization.\nWe must, however, consider how we can find the\nmeans to avoid the negative effects of globalization,\nrepresented by the marginalization of some developing\ncountries, because of their declining exports and an increase\nin their external indebtedness, and of social groups in these\ncountries as a result of the inequitable distribution of\nincome. Globalization is not concerned with the problems\nof distribution, but with being a prime mover of economic\ngrowth in general.\nIn view of this situation, the industrialized countries\nare called upon to increase their official development\nassistance to the developing world, to find comprehensive\nsolutions to the problem of external indebtedness, to\nintegrate the developing countries into the world\u2019s free-\ntrade system and to improve these countries\u2019 terms of\ntrade.\nJordan, as a developing country, has suffered\neconomic problems since the end of the 1980s, which\nwere aggravated by the Gulf crisis and the Gulf War early\nin this decade. By pursuing structural adjustment policies,\nhowever, with the assistance of the International Monetary\nFund, Jordan was able to achieve very good results that\nexceeded expectations. The budget deficit was\nsubstantially reduced, as was the size of external debt. All\nmacroeconomic indicators have improved.\nSubstantial progress has been achieved in the area of\nprivatization and the reform of internal financial\nregulations and the banking sector, which gave the private\nsector a chance to participate effectively. Jordan has gone\nahead on the way to development. It has initialled a\npartnership agreement with Europe and is now taking the\npreparatory measures needed to join the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO). To that end, we are doing our best\nto adjust our economy and prepare it for full integration\nin the global free-trade system.\nIn association with our Arab brethren and other\ncountries in the Middle East, we are making tremendous\nefforts to widen the area of cooperation, trade and\ninvestment in the region. We have succeeded in attracting\nsubstantial investments in the stock exchange and other\nindustrial and tourist projects. The Government of Jordan\nis working hard to remove the remaining restrictions\nwhich limited the inflow of regional and global\ninvestments, including lifting all restrictions on foreign\ncurrencies.\nThe world recognizes the historical responsibility\nthat we assume towards future generations to preserve a\nsound global environment, in compliance with the\nprinciples adopted by the Earth Summit. In spite of its\nscarce resources, Jordan is committed to applying the Rio\nprinciples and is working hard to make its contribution as\na partner with other countries of the world in sustainable\ndevelopment.\nAlthough we are committed, as a developing\ncountry, to doing what is required of us by virtue of this\npartnership, we, along with other developing countries,\nhave noticed regression and procrastination by developed\ncountries in discharging their obligations under this\npartnership. We have also felt that the nineteenth special\nsession of the General Assembly was held to consecrate\n10\n\n\nthis regression in the discharge of obligations, rather than\nto enhance them and to cooperate in carrying out those not\nyet implemented.\nIn conclusion, if the establishment of peace, security\nand stability in this world is one of the noble purposes of\nour international Organization, we must provide the solid\nground for that, which is to reduce poverty, control\ndiseases, illiteracy and unemployment and work towards the\ncreation of a clean environment and sustainable\ndevelopment for future generations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn recent years we have, happily, drawn closer\nto the ideals enshrined in the preamble of our Charter.\nWe have taken substantial strides towards the ideal of\npeace and security; strengthened and broadened the\nobservance of human rights; enhanced and developed\ninternational law and widened the scope of international\npenal law, in particular; and laid the foundations for\ngreater responsibility by States in the advancement of\nsocial progress.\nHowever, even as we draw closer to these goals, we\nsee rapid changes in our countries and in the world which\npresent a new and complex challenge for the\nOrganization. The challenge begins when we note that the\nbenefits of globalization fall short of being able to\nalleviate the situation of extreme deprivation from which\nmore than a quarter of the world\u2019s population suffers.\nSimilarly, we see more clearly new threats to security and\ndevelopment, such as drug trafficking, terrorism,\ncorruption, and irresponsible assaults upon the\nenvironment.\nThe process of reform undertaken by Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan must first and foremost identify what\nis the essential role of the United Nations. We believe\nthat it unquestionably continues to be the maintenance of\n14\n\n\ninternational peace and security. In order to achieve this we\nmust bring about a world where sustainable development is\npossible and where the norm is the rule of law; respect for\nhuman rights, including respect for the rights of indigenous\npeoples and minorities; and non-discrimination by reason of\nrace, religion, gender or anything else.\nThe United Nations, through the General Assembly,\nmust continue to be in the vanguard on all these issues,\nplaying the role which in the past enabled it to overcome\nthe scepticism of the times and successfully to combat\ncolonialism, champion nuclear non-proliferation, and, even\nmore important, alert the world to the grave risks of\nenvironmental pollution, marginalization, poverty and that\nnew form of moral pollution: corruption.\nAlthough, on the whole, reform has aroused feelings\nof hope, we must overcome the present climate of\nscepticism and support the Secretary-General. In a world\nwhich today is increasingly marked by globalization, the\nautonomy which formerly characterized State action has\nbeen considerably limited. This obliges us to reassess the\nclassical concept of sovereignty, by which I mean flexible\nand dynamic \u2014 not static \u2014 reassessment. Argentina has\nparticipated with conviction in the process of reform and\ncommits itself to continue to work actively in its\nimplementation.\nThe question of the Middle East is going through a\ndifficult phase. The peace process begun in Madrid in 1991\nmust necessarily continue, with fulfilment of the Oslo and\nWashington Agreements.\nWe fully support the determined efforts made some\ndays ago by the Secretary of State of the United States of\nAmerica, Mrs. Madeleine Albright. We are certain that time\nwill show that those efforts were timely and well-directed.\nOur country likewise firmly supports the system-wide\nProgramme of Action for the economic recovery and\ndevelopment of Africa, as well as the United Nations\nSystem-wide Special Initiative for Africa launched by the\nSecretary-General in March 1996. We attach particular\nimportance to the mobilization of financial resources for the\nAfrican continent, and we note with satisfaction the first\nsigns of renewed activity in some very important areas of\nthat continent.\nWith regard to international security, we welcome the\nadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,\nwhich we hope shortly to ratify. Likewise, we extend our\nunqualified support to the Ottawa process to ban anti-\npersonnel landmines. Our commitment to this noble\ninitiative was made manifest in 1994, when we offered to\nassume the task of removing the mines laid in the\nMalvinas Islands. We laid those mines ourselves and thus\nfelt a sense of responsibility. We hope that we shall soon\nbe able to achieve the agreement that will allow us to\ncomplete that task.\nA lasting peace requires United Nations contingents\nendowed with the capacity to deploy rapidly and\neffectively. Accordingly, Argentina, together with other\ncountries, is working to improve mechanisms of\ndeployment. In this context, allow me also to recall that,\nnext year, Argentina will mark the fortieth anniversary of\nits participation in peacekeeping operations. That is a\ngreat many years.\nThe magnitude of the adverse consequences for\nindividuals of current conflicts requires us to exert our\nutmost efforts with regard to humanitarian assistance.\nSuch assistance constitutes an indispensable element in\npeace-building. Accordingly, the \u201cWhite Helmets\u201d\ninitiative has made possible a growing mobilization of\nhuman and financial resources, bringing about a healthy\nreassessment of humanitarian assistance criteria and\nprocedures.\nIn order to consolidate a lasting peace, we must not\nallow impunity to prevail for crimes that offend the\nconscience of humankind. The creation by the Security\nCouncil of tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and\nRwanda is a recognition that justice and law are\ninseparable components of the system of collective\nsecurity. Argentina firmly supports the creation of a\ngeneral and permanent international criminal court. We\ntrust that the Rome conference in 1998 will make possible\nthe realization of this initiative.\nLet me also say that the Argentine Government\nfirmly intends to pursue its struggle against the abusive\nconsumption of psychotropic substances and illicit\nnarcotics trafficking, as well as related offenses.\nIn the subregional context, we are proud that the\nSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) continues\nto grow in both the commercial and political spheres,\nwhich are interrelated, and to contribute to advancing\nintegration in the hemisphere. MERCOSUR is a clear\ncase of open regionalism. It has not resulted in the\ndistortion or diversion of trade but has, rather, generated\ntrade both between the countries of the region and with\ncountries outside it. Argentina, jointly with its other\n15\n\n\nMERCOSUR partners, is active in the formation of the\nAmerican Free Trade Area (AFTA). MERCOSUR has\nintroduced a proposal for negotiation of AFTA based on a\nphased approach.\nWith regard to regional security, Argentina has been\na leader in reducing residual tensions in the area. It has\ncontributed to the attainment of such cherished goals for the\nnations of South America as the resolution of border\nproblems in a climate of confidence with our neighbours\nand by promoting common positions in support of\nstrengthened democracy and political and economic\nstability. Accordingly, we have, through the Mechanism for\nConsultation and Concerted Political Action of the Rio\nGroup, been promoting the Declaration on the Defence of\nDemocracy, to which we attach great importance as one\nmore means to advance peace and security \u2014 goals that\ncan be achieved only with representative democracy. We\nalso welcome the inclusion of Bolivia and Chile as full\nmembers of the Mercosur Mechanism for Consultation and\nConcerted Political Action.\nWith our neighbours, friends and partners, we are\npursuing a deepening of the dialogue on security and\ndefence. We are adjusting it to the new international and\nregional reality, convinced that security is enhanced through\nintegration. Indeed, the basis of security in the Southern\nCone is the friendship and cordiality of its countries. In this\ncontext, military cooperation has increased, with positive\nresults for transparency and mutual confidence-building. As\na result of these efforts, Latin America today can point with\npride to the peace and harmony that prevails among its\nStates.\nThere remains, however, in the South Atlantic, an\nimportant unresolved issue: the question of the Malvinas\nIslands. I reaffirm once again the legitimate rights of the\nRepublic of Argentina in that dispute and its appeal for a\npeaceful and lasting solution.\nIn keeping with the repeated appeals of this General\nAssembly and the Decolonization Committee, we believe\nthat it is imperative to resume negotiations on all aspects of\nthe question of the Malvinas Islands. No Member of the\nUnited Nations should evade the obligation to resolve a\ndispute by peaceful means as laid down in the Charter of\nthis Organization. We call for the parties to sit at the\nnegotiating table and discuss all the relevant issues.\nWe have made too much progress with the United\nKingdom to avoid addressing this issue. We have made\nvery important strides in building our bilateral relationship\nwith the United Kingdom, which are reflected in\nheightened economic, commercial and cultural relations\nbetween the two countries. We have recreated a climate\nof mutual trust in the South-West Atlantic, which enables\nus today to cooperate in the conservation of living\nresources and in the exploration and exploitation of\nhydrocarbons. Undoubtedly, these activities would gain\nsubstantial impetus from the resumption of direct links\nbetween the mainland and the islands, which have proven\nto be most beneficial in the past. Nothing, however,\nreplaces human contact between individuals.\nI trust that the new British Government will heed\nour appeal and that of the international community to\npursue a dialogue without preconditions with a view to\nfinding a definitive solution to the sovereignty dispute\nover the Malvinas Islands. To the islanders, I once again\nreiterate our firm commitment to fully respect their way\nof life, culture and institutions, as stated in our national\nConstitution.\nThe Decolonization Committee, which has\nhistorically played a decisive role in this sphere, has\nshown itself to be the appropriate forum to continue\naddressing the situation of the Malvinas Islands and other\ndependent territories. Accordingly, the six countries that\nmake up the MERCOSUR Mechanism for Consultation\nand Concerted Political Action have reaffirmed the\nimportance of the work of the Committee of 24 on the\ndecolonization process, which has not yet been completed.\nWe trust that the Committee will maintain its\neffectiveness to the full.\nAnother fundamental issue is the composition of the\nSecurity Council, which in 1945 was consonant with the\nreality prevailing at the end of the Second World War.\nThat is no longer the case, however. On the eve of the\ntwenty-first century, we should not design a model that\nonly adds new discriminations to those we have inherited.\nThat would be a conceptual mistake. Argentina, while\nunderstanding the position of each Member State on this\nmatter, is of the view that there is not yet a general\nagreement concerning the increase in the number of\npermanent members. We all agree that the reform of the\nSecurity Council should make it a more democratic and\nrepresentative body. To reach that goal, each region will\nneed to arrive at a compromise without being pressured\nor rushed.\nIn the case of Latin America and the Caribbean, the\nSummit of Heads of State of the Rio Group has agreed\nthat the region itself will have to decide how to fill the\n16\n\n\nseats assigned to it. Argentina is of the view that an open-\nended mechanism of rotation should be established that will\nenable the participation of all those States that have shown\ntheir commitment to and respect for the Charter. This\nwould avoid discrimination against those States that, like\nArgentina, bear greater financial responsibilities. In short,\nthe Argentine position is aimed solely at promoting the\nample participation of all States of the region, without any\nexclusion whatsoever.\nI must say, however, that there is more to this matter\nthan the increase in the number of members. Methods of\nwork and procedures also need to be updated. In this\ncontext, I concur with the comments made by the\nrepresentative of New Zealand.\nIt is our firm conviction that reform of the United\nNations must necessarily be built upon two fundamental\npillars. First, it must respond to the requirements and\nexpectations of the international community. Secondly, it\nmust reflect a general agreement among the Member States.\nIt is only in this way that the Organization will retain its\nrelevance in the twenty-first century.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, it is a particular\npleasure for me to see you presiding over the General\nAssembly. As Ambassador to the former Soviet Union for\nfive years, I had a long association with Ukraine, and I\nretain the fondest memories of my several visits to your\nbeautiful country. You preside over an Assembly that will\ndeliberate on crucial issues before the world community,\non which your experience and guidance will be\ninvaluable. I would also like to congratulate your\npredecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail, on the\nengagement with which he acted during his presidency to\ncarry our work forward. I am delighted also to see the\nSecretary-General here.\nWe are celebrating in India the fiftieth anniversary\nof our emergence as a free nation. The constitutional\nmoorings and the democratic forms which the new nation-\nState has accepted and adopted rest on the vast foundation\nof civilizational experience and ethos. This explains the\nstability, coherence and creative unity of the vast Indian\nsociety, which is a world in itself. The experience has\nwrought in us the deep conviction that, while there are\nuniversally shared values and striving, there can be no\nrigid prescriptions. We see the United Nations in this\nimage, as a crucible in which we meld together our\nindividual contributions to a world civilization, yet\n6\n\n\nrecognizing the variety of historical and cultural experiences\nwe bring to it.\nThe cold war cast an early shadow on the\nOrganization, creating a situation of ideological\npolarization. The Non-Aligned Movement rejected this\nimposition of rigidity, representing an independent and\nresponsible alternative to the world view. This remains true,\nand the Non-Aligned Movement retains its validity and\nrelevance, even after the disappearance of bloc rivalries.\nNon-alignment was not a by-product of the cold war. Then,\nit expressed the overwhelming need of previously colonized\nand disempowered nations to a voice, a perspective and an\nagenda in a politically and economically unequal and\ninequitable world. Today, it remains a voice of reason and\nconstructive engagement for the times ahead, which demand\ncommon purpose and contribution from all sides towards a\nconvergence of intent on vital, even fateful, global\nconcerns.\nSince the creation of the Charter of the United\nNations, the world should have changed far more than it\nhas in the half century that has elapsed. Decolonization is\nalmost complete, but the scars of colonization are still with\nus. The present bears a heavy burden of the past. South\nAfrica is free, but racism rears its ugly head amidst us,\noften laced with xenophobia. Development and growth \u2014\nand even human dignity \u2014 remain for much of the world\na distant dream. We must insistently ask ourselves what we\ncan decisively do at the United Nations to make the dreams\nof the hundreds of millions come true, how we can make\nthe United Nations a more vibrant organization for the\nworld community as a whole, at a time when we need it\nmore than we ever have, a United Nations that is better\nequipped to fully respond to the challenges of the next\ncentury.\nAs an organization, the United Nations must also\nevolve and adapt itself to a rapidly changing environment,\nthe better to serve the core needs of the world community.\nAs a country which sets very great store on the capacity of\nthe United Nations to contribute to international peace and\nsecurity, and to development \u2014 the two crucial priorities\nbefore the world community \u2014 India, like others, has a\nvital interest in a United Nations that continually makes\nitself more responsive to the needs of its Member States\nand prepares itself to serve them better. This, we believe,\nis the objective of reform. We are hence very pleased that\nthe Secretary-General, immediately after taking office,\nmade reform one of his priorities and we congratulate him\non this commitment. Within the first seven months of his\ntenure, he has produced a series of proposals of impressive\nbreadth and scope. These are before us, and many have\ndescribed this session as a reform General Assembly. In\nthis connection, I extend my good wishes to you,\nMr. Secretary-General.\nWe judge the agenda for reform by the measures I\nhave described. We are supportive of all proposals that,\nin our view, will carry forward, or improve, the\nSecretariat\u2019s ability to respond to the mandates of the\ninternational community. We will express our thoughts\nconstructively with the aim of strengthening the process\nand direction of reform to the collective advantage of the\nglobal community and the Organization that represents it.\nWe do not see reform simply as an exercise to trim the\nbudget of the United Nations. Instead, reforms should\ncontribute towards strengthening the United Nations and\nits capacity to respond effectively to the priorities\nidentified by the overwhelming majority of its\nmembership.\nThe crisis that confronts the United Nations\nmanifests itself in many ways. A financial crisis has\nresulted from the inability of some to fulfil their Charter\ncommitments, and from the laying down of pre-conditions\nto meet them. The United Nations does not have the\nmeans to execute programmes that respond to the felt\nneeds and priorities of its membership, precisely at a time\nwhen such programmes are sorely necessary. As a result,\nthe United Nations is in danger of being marginalized as\nthe global forum where decisions can be taken that truly\nrespond to the challenges of globalization. The solution\nlies not in piecemeal reform but in building trust between\nnations, and in an acceptance that in international\nrelations democratic principles should be the norm, just as\nthey are being increasingly accepted in national\ngovernance.\nIn our view, international peace and security and\ndevelopment are inextricably linked. The one is\nimpossible to achieve without the other. Over the last six\nor seven years, there has been a growing emphasis on the\npolitical aspects of the tasks of development, such as\ndemocracy and human rights. Unless the underlying\ncauses of underdevelopment, poverty and social alienation\nare effectively addressed and removed, this emphasis will\nremain unrealized. Therefore, the single most important\ntarget that the United Nations should set itself is the\npromotion of sustained economic growth in the\ndeveloping countries that will lead to the eradication of\npoverty, and erase the tensions and pressures that have\nled to the collapse of governance and social order in\nseveral States, and to conflicts between others.\n7\n\n\nInternational peace and stability will be enhanced only\nwhen all countries enjoy a minimum standard of economic\nself-sufficiency and well-being. Therefore, we believe that\nthe thrust of any reform proposals in the United Nations\nshould make the promotion of sustained economic\ndevelopment the principal cross-sectoral issue for the\nSecretariat\u2019s programmes. We believe that there are enough\nintergovernmental mandates to permit the Secretariat to\ntailor programmes towards this end.\nThe universality of human rights, to which we all\ncommitted ourselves almost five years ago at Vienna,\nexpresses itself at one level in the international norms for\nthe promotion and protection of human rights and our\ncollective efforts to foster respect for these standards. On a\nhigher plane, this universality stems from the search in\ndifferent civilizations for ways of protecting the human\ndignity of every individual. Next year, as we celebrate the\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, we will reflect on whether the ideals enshrined in\nthe Declaration have become a reality for people in all parts\nof the world. As we do so, we must build confidence in a\nprocess that encourages introspection and self-criticism,\ndialogue and consultation, rather than confrontation and\njudgement. The Declaration calls for the advent of a world\norder in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech\nand belief and freedom from fear and want as the highest\naspirations of the common people. It recognizes the\nimportance of economic, social and cultural rights as well\nas their interdependence with civil and political rights. The\nfull realization of all these rights is what will give true\nmeaning to the quest for human dignity embodied in the\nUniversal Declaration.\nIndia\u2019s approach to the observance and promotion of\nhuman rights is inspired by the holistic vision of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the Indian\nConstitution. A strong constitutional framework, mutually\nreinforcing safeguards, both within and outside this\nframework; a policy of transparency and responsiveness to\ncivil society; and cooperation with the human rights system\nof the United Nations \u2014 in particular with the treaty\nbodies \u2014 are the main elements of this approach in the\nareas of civil and political rights. Equally important, if not\nmore so, are the assault on poverty and underdevelopment;\nthe promotion of awareness of rights; and a policy of\naffirmative action for the uplifting of socially and\neconomically vulnerable sectors of society.\nThis is a complex task, especially in a country of\nIndia\u2019s diversity. Many times, when the State has faltered\ncivil society has stepped in. In India, as elsewhere,\nindividuals have wrought miracles by working outside the\nestablished systems and going beyond traditional ways of\nthinking. In recent times, the most moving example has\nbeen that of a frail, sari-clad woman: Mother Teresa. Her\nfathomless compassion and soothing touch will be missed\nby millions in India. I would like to pay tribute to this\napostle of mercy who rendered service and brought hope\nto millions of poor and suffering people, not only in India\nbut all over the world.\nWhile development must be our supreme objective,\nwe also need peace, stability and security in order to\nachieve it. The dangers that threaten us have become\nincreasingly more frightening during the last 50 years\nthan any that have cast their shadow over mankind in its\nentire history. The development of nuclear, chemical and\nbiological weapons has made it possible to destroy whole\npopulations. As the international community, we have\ndecided to outlaw the production, possession and use of\nchemical and biological weapons.\nHowever, with regard to the weapons of mass\ndestruction capable of the total annihilation of human\ncivilization, the global community has lived for too long\non a diet of empty promises. The pretexts cited in favour\nof clinging to nuclear arsenals, while always questionable,\nhave now vanished. Mere non-proliferation treaties\npromoted as disarmament measures only serve to entrench\na nuclear monopoly. No credible steps towards striving to\nrealize a nuclear-weapon-free world are contemplated,\nmuch less taken, by those who should be showing the\nway. No justifications can be proffered, as they were\nduring the cold war.\nThe patience of the world community \u2014 as\nexpressed by the International Court of Justice, by the\nenlightened voices of those who formerly believed in\ndeterrence, by political and general opinion and by\nweighty voluntary initiatives \u2014 is starting to wear thin.\nNuclear-weapon Powers owe it to the world to answer the\nquestion why they need nuclear weapons. Global opinion\nwants a nuclear weapons convention \u2014 as has already\nbeen outlined for the class of biological and chemical\nweapons \u2014 and will not rest until it is achieved. We\nappeal to nuclear-weapon States to align their policies\nwith what the world wants. We see the United Nations as\nthe forum in which the international community must\ncontinue to demand universal nuclear disarmament, and\nwe therefore expect that the Secretariat's programmes will\nsupport this intergovernmental objective.\n8\n\n\nUnder the Charter, the Security Council was\nconstituted as a body on which the general membership\nconferred primary responsibility for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, acting on its behalf. In\nrecent years, the Security Council has been able to play a\nmore active role in discharging its responsibilities.\nHowever, there is often a perception that the Council\u2019s\nactions have not always reflected the sentiments of the\ngeneral membership. Therefore, it is imperative \u2014 and the\ntime has come \u2014 for the Security Council to take on as\npermanent members developing countries which are\nequipped to make important contributions through their\nworld views and historical experiences and the values of\ntheir civilizations. In this way the decisions of the Council\nwill truly reflect the wider membership of the United\nNations. Otherwise, the Council\u2019s actions will be seen as\nprogressively less representative precisely at a time when it\nis being called upon to act far more frequently than before\non behalf of the world community.\nIndia has let it be known in the General Assembly\nsince 1994 that it is prepared to accept the responsibilities\nof permanent membership. We are the largest democracy in\nthe world, with a civilization replete with ancient values\nand achievements, as well as a world view based on a\nuniversalist inspiration, participatory governance, respect for\ndiversity and pluralism, and a readiness for constructive\nengagement in the world\u2019s affairs. These strengths, we\nbelieve, would be an asset to an expanded Security Council.\nIndia\u2019s standing as one of the leading economies of the\nworld will be progressively strengthened, and we are\nprepared to bear fully the responsibilities of permanent\nmembership. India\u2019s long-standing participation in United\nNations peacekeeping operations testifies not only to the\ndedication and professionalism of Indian soldiers, but also\nto the political will of the Government to actively\ncontribute to these operations.\nThe core of our foreign policy is our keenness to\npursue close ties and build confidence and cooperation with\nour neighbours, while recognizing fully that we are the\nlargest country in the region, in terms not only of size and\npopulation but also of economic capabilities. We extend our\nhand of friendship not in a spirit of mere reciprocity but in\ngood faith. Where we do expect reciprocity, unrelated to\nsize and capacity, is in mutual respect for each other\u2019s\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty. We seek to advance\ncohesion, synergy and mutual goodwill in our\nneighbourhood so that together we can fully participate in\nand derive benefits from the dynamic changes the world is\ncurrently witnessing. Our approach has contributed to the\nsetting in motion of a trend towards cooperation in our\nregion.\nAs a large and diverse economy, we are developing\nnew partnerships that go beyond the region and revitalize\nthe old cultural and commercial links. Politically, this is\nexpressed in the active interest that we have taken in\nsupporting the Middle East peace process \u2014 our ties with\nthe Arab world reaching deep into history \u2014 and our\nstrong fraternal ties with developing countries in general\nand with Africa in particular. In our larger\nneighbourhood, with which we have a shared history, we\nhave enhanced our engagement with the Association of\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) as a full-dialogue\npartner and as a participant in the ASEAN Regional\nForum.\nWhile maintaining our traditional relationships with\nthe United States, Russia, the European Union and Japan,\nwe have also been strengthening global trends in regional\ncooperation by actively promoting cooperation among\ncountries of the Indian Ocean rim and trying to recover\nthe cultural and commercial connectivities that have\nexisted since time immemorial and which were snapped\nin the colonial era.\nGlobal society is seeking to find an equilibrium\nbetween the opposing pulls generated by the forces of\nglobalization, nationalism and sub-nationalism. Indeed, it\nis difficult to see just how they can be balanced, yet they\nmust be or else the potential for international\nconflagration will be immense. Hence, the absolute need\nfor extreme caution to prevent established nation States\nfrom being destabilized either through too hasty a push\ntowards globalization or through the pull of sub-national\ndemands. We see this as a challenge which we will have\nto face collectively as well as individually.\nA global menace that threatens international peace,\nand to which open democracies are particularly\nvulnerable, is terrorism. It takes innocent lives\nindiscriminately, brings fear into the lives of others and\nshatters the peaceful existence and the normal growth of\nentire communities. Terrorism should be anathema to the\ninternational community because it is the antithesis of\nevery ideal that the United Nations Charter enshrines. Its\nmain vehicle is violence; its aim is destruction rather than\ndevelopment; its doctrines are founded on intolerance;\nand, in the means it uses and the effect it has, it destroys\nhuman rights utterly.\n9\n\n\nIncitement to terrorism and complicity and\nparticipation in terrorism across borders undermine the\ninternational system. And even though very few societies\nare free from its clutches, we still have not developed a\nglobal strategy to defeat this evil. The resolve is absent. It\nis important that we find it, not least because terrorism has\na global web, spanning all countries and continents and\nquickly building links with the other global menace: drugs.\nWe in India see in our region just how deadly a poison this\nmix of terrorism and drugs is. The United Nations should\ntake the lead in determined global action to root out these\nscourges.\nThe protection and preservation of the environment is\nan area to which all of us attach the highest importance.\nThe commitment to global partnership for preventing\nfurther degradation of the environment, made at the Rio\nSummit in 1992, was reiterated and the need for effective\nimplementation of Agenda 21 reaffirmed during the special\nsession of the General Assembly in June this year. All the\nelements of Agenda 21 have to be implemented in full and\nwe need to accelerate the process of such implementation.\nAny partial or non-comprehensive implementation will be\ndetrimental not only to international cooperation in this\narea, but also to the threatened stability of the Earth\u2019s\nfragile environment. In this connection, it is our hope that\nthe spirit of the Convention on Climate Change and the\nBerlin Mandate will be fully encompassed by the protocol\nor legal instrument to emerge from the Kyoto Conference\nto be held in December 1997.\nWhat has been touched upon represents huge\nchallenges beyond the capacity of any country to face on its\nown. This is why it is so vital for the United Nations, now\nmore than ever before, to be a forum where we can pool\ncreative ideas and lessons from our experience and to assist\nus in understanding and coping with these challenges. This\nis the ultimate rationale of reform. We will be ready to\nwork with other countries to rebuild the United Nations in\nthe image of our collective aspirations and as our trusted\ninstrument to meet the challenges of the approaching\ncentury.\nAddressing the General Assembly at its fifteenth\nregular session, I recall India\u2019s first Prime Minister,\nJawaharlal Nehru, saying here in 1960:\n\u201cThe main purpose of the United Nations is to\nbuild up a world without war, a world based on the\ncooperation of nations and peoples. It is not merely a\nworld where war is kept in check for a balancing of\narmed forces. It is much deeper than that. It is a world\nfrom which the major causes of war have been\nremoved and social structures built up which further\npeaceful cooperation within a nation as well as\nbetween nations.\u201d (Official Records of the General\nAssembly, Fifteenth session, Plenary Meetings,\n882nd meeting, para. 117)\nIt is in this spirit that we should approach the tasks\nbefore us. I do hope and pray that, under your guidance,\nSir, and under the spirited leadership of the Secretary-\nGeneral, these objectives will be achieved.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am honoured to extend to you, Sir, on behalf\nof the Government and the people of Ecuador, warm\ncongratulations on your election to preside over this\nsession of the General Assembly. I am sure that your\nefforts will contribute to the advancement of the activities\nof our Organization. You may rely on the constant and\nresolute cooperation of Ecuador.\nI should like to speak of several matters of interest\nto the international community that the United Nations\nhas incorporated into its working agenda. My country\nfollows with interest their development within the\nOrganization and will act on the basis of the principles\nthat guide Ecuador\u2019s foreign policy.\nEcuador believes that the search for general and\ncomplete global disarmament is a goal that our\nOrganization should pursue indefatigably. This is not a\nutopian ideal but, rather, a constant objective that\nrequires the active participation of all States within a\nglobal ethical context. True to this principle, my\ncountry is a party to all international and regional\ninstruments related to disarmament.\nThe nations of the world have welcomed the end\nof the cold war and the attendant reduction of the risk\nof nuclear holocaust. Nevertheless, Ecuador views with\napprehension the persistence of nuclear-weapon-\ndevelopment programmes and the continued existence\nof large atomic arsenals and the risks they pose for the\npeace and well-being of all. The international\ncommunity cannot relax its guard and cease to insist on\nthe elimination of such means of massive and\nindiscriminate destruction. This conviction has led\nEcuador to lend its determined support to the global\nnon-proliferation regimen and to the establishment of\nnuclear-weapon-free zones. Thus, at the last session of\nthe General Assembly, Ecuador was a sponsor of the\nresolution calling for the establishment of a nuclear-\nweapon-free zone in the southern hemisphere and\nadjacent areas.\nFurthermore, Ecuador supports the work of the\nConference on Disarmament in drawing up a draft text\nfor a convention on the control of fissionable material,\nwhich is to be submitted to the General Assembly, and\nfully agrees with the working document submitted by\n\n\nmembers of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries\nconcerning the universal nature of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nWith regard to weapons of mass destruction,\ndisarmament has particular significance for the whole of\nthe international community. However, we cannot\noverlook the fact that the subject of conventional\ndisarmament is equally sensitive and that it is an issue\nthat must attract the full and determined attention of the\nUnited Nations. For this reason, Ecuador welcomes the\nDisarmament Commission\u2019s decision to include in its\nagenda an item on guidelines for control, limitation and\ndisarmament in connection with conventional weapons,\nwith special attention to the consolidation of peace within\nthe context of General Assembly resolution 51/45 N.\nEcuador also supports the convening in 1999 of the\nfourth special session of the General Assembly devoted\nto disarmament, in accordance with the decision taken at\nthe Assembly\u2019s last session. My country is especially\ninterested in including in the agenda of that special\nsession such relevant issues as the effective reduction of\nconventional forces and weapons, the relationship\nbetween disarmament and development, and confidence-\nbuilding measures among States.\nBecause of their humanitarian cost, I must refer to a\nspecific type of conventional weapon: anti-personnel\nlandmines. Ecuador is a contracting party to several\ninternational agreements that ban and restrict the use of\nsuch weapons, and we urge all countries, whether\nsignatories to those treaties or not, to observe them and\nscrupulously respect their terms.\nMy country is convinced that the community of\nStates must persist in its efforts to reach agreement on\nthe total prohibition of the use, production, stockpiling,\nand transfer of anti-personnel landmines. Ecuador thus\nsupports the Ottawa process, which is to conclude in\nDecember 1997 with the signing of a binding agreement\non a total ban on anti-personnel landmines.\nHumankind has painfully come to realize that\ninternational peace and security cannot be based on\natomic equilibrium, arms races or mistrust and mutual\nsuspicion. On the contrary, genuine peace must be based\non respect for the rule of law, on the acceptance of the\nsolidarity and interdependence of all States and on the\ncommon desire to move dynamically forward towards the\nsolution of the critical problems of dire poverty, disease,\nunemployment, illiteracy and economic and social\ninequality among peoples and nations. In order to make\nprogress, we must recognize and live by universal\nethical principles and seek peaceful solutions to our\nmultilateral and bilateral problems through peaceful\nprocesses, through dialogue and reconciliation.\nThe countries of Latin America, and Ecuador in\nparticular, are concerned by the fact that economic\ndevelopment is not accompanied by social development.\nIt is ironic that in an ever wealthier world,\ndevelopment-cooperation resources have fallen\n20 per cent in real terms in recent years. How, then,\ncan the international community fulfil the commitments\nentered into at the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment?\nWe, the developing countries, assume our\nresponsibility in fighting poverty, providing better\nhealth and education to our people, reinforcing our\ndemocracies and consolidating our institutions.\nHowever, it is essential that international cooperation\nfor development be continued, since this will result in a\nmore just, stable and peaceful world.\nThere is no doubt that in recent years the world\nhas changed dramatically. We have moved from an\ninternational society where political and military\nconfrontation weighed heavily on relations to a system\nwhere cooperation and dialogue among the great\nPowers have gradually eased the fear of a nuclear\nholocaust. In this new environment of international\nrelations, in which economic questions have become\nglobal in nature, the United Nations must also modify\nsome of its previous patterns of conduct and\nmanagement.\nWhat do we want from the United Nations in the\ntwenty-first century? The Secretary-General has\nsubmitted a comprehensive programme for the reform\nof the United Nations system, a programme that must\nbe profoundly and carefully analysed by all Member\nStates, and Ecuador will actively participate in the\ndebate on this subject.\nIt must be pointed out that this world body must\nconfront the great challenges to mankind, such as the\npromotion of economic and social development along\nwith the needed preservation of the environment; the\nmaintenance of international peace and harmony; the\nachievement of total and complete disarmament; the\npromotion of human rights; and the strengthening of\ncooperation among all nations to eradicate poverty.\n2\n\n\nSince its establishment, the United Nations has\nfulfilled a number of the purposes for which it was\ncreated. It is true that the Organization, for various\nreasons largely attributable to Member States themselves,\nhas not fulfilled some of the high expectations of the\ninternational community. It is worth noting that one of\nthe most accurate phrases ever uttered in this forum\nrecognizes that the United Nations is exactly what its\nMembers want it to be. The successes and failures of the\nOrganization are the successes and failures of the States\nthat make it up. I do not wish to start listing past errors,\nbut we should not forget them, because they can serve as\nuseful lessons. We must above all be aware that today\nthere are new challenges, and that we must look ahead\nand face them.\nWe must design an Organization which, through\npractical mechanisms, leaves rhetoric aside and assumes a\ndynamic role in the solution of world problems. This will\nrequire substantial reform of the working methods of the\nUnited Nations. Furthermore, it will require a new\nattitude by Member States in order to create a just and\nequitable international society based on the authentic,\ndemocratically expressed will of the international\ncommunity.\nFor the Organization to respond more effectively to\nthe challenges now facing the international community,\nthese reforms should not be restricted to a single sector\nwithin the institutional structure. Let me mention the\nreform of one of the most important organs of the United\nNations: the Security Council. Ecuador attaches particular\nimportance to the reform of that body as part of the\nstrengthening of the United Nations. We believe that the\nultimate objective of these efforts must be to develop a\nmore democratic, transparent and truly representative\nworking system for the Council.\nThe reform of the Security Council must not be\nlimited to a mere discussion of the number of members\nor of how many delegations should represent each\nregion \u2014 although here we believe that the number of\nSecurity Council members must be increased in the light\nof the new world realities, to obtain a more significant\npresence of developing countries in accordance with\nequitable geographical distribution. We also believe that\nreal reform of the Security Council should aim above all\nat ensuring that decision-making machinery and processes\nhave the transparency, effectiveness and pluralism that\nmust characterize every democratic institution. This\nincludes, among other specific measures, the limitation of\nthe veto power of the Council's permanent members, and\ntimelier and more effective action to prevent\ninternational conflicts at the request of any State\nMember of the Organization.\nAs we approach the end of the United Nations\nDecade of International Law, I would like to reaffirm\nour hope that its objectives will be fully met,\nparticularly those relating to the promotion of and\nrespect for the principles of international law and to the\nbroadest possible recourse to ways and means for the\npeaceful settlement of disputes between States. We\nknow that complex international disputes cannot be\nsettled solely by legal mechanisms, but it is no less true\nthat any settlement must be based on legal instruments\nand must follow formal procedures.\nAn essential element of Ecuador's international\npolicy is the search for a just and permanent solution to\nthe Ecuador-Peru territorial issue. With the valuable\nhelp of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States\nas guarantor countries, talks between Ecuador and Peru\nare currently under way in Brasilia on the remaining\nimpasses that affect our common border, in accordance\nwith the commitment of both countries to find a\npeaceful and final solution to these issues. Ecuador will\ncontinue to participate in these talks, motivated by a\ntrue spirit of peace, because we desire a global, final,\nhonourable and realistic solution that reflects the\nlegitimate expectations of our people, which, together\nwith the other peoples of the Americas, are seeking to\ncreate a future of mutual benefit and constructive and\npeaceful cooperation. The efforts of the Ecuadorian and\nPeruvian peoples are aimed at finding a definitive\nsolution to this dispute.\nInternational interest in the progress of the Brasilia\ntalks and the immense prospects that would open for\nboth countries in the new millennium are factors that\nshould encourage our Governments to make all efforts\nnecessary to settle this age-old historical controversy,\nand thus respond to the just aspirations to peace and\ndevelopment that we all share. Our country longs for\npeace and wants peace; it does not want war. We are\nconvinced that there is no victory in a war, only\ndifferent degrees of defeat owing to the incalculable\nconsequences that can affect the political, moral, social\nand economic life of our countries.\nThe Charter of the United Nations states that\nworld security is not limited to the significant issue of\nthe prevention and settlement of violent conflicts. A\nsafer world is also a world where general prosperity\n3\n\n\neliminates the causes of most conflict and human\nsuffering. The United Nations should continue to be a\nforum for the discussion of critical issues concerning the\nsearch for the economic development of more than three\nquarters of the world's population.\nTo be sure, Ecuador is aware that economic growth\nper se is not enough to generate adequate social justice\nand an equitable distribution of income. My Government\nhas designed programmes and plans aimed at covering\nthe needs of the marginal populations of Ecuador. With\nthe assistance of the World Bank and the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, we have established a national\nsocial development plan that includes government action\nin line with the commitments assumed by the\ninternational community during the World Summit for\nSocial Development.\nThe socially oriented philosophy of my Government\nleads me to join those who suggest that the eradication of\npoverty throughout the world should be the main goal of\nthe international community's coordinated efforts in the\ncoming years. The globalization of the economy cannot\nbe limited to the use of cheap labour in the developing\nworld, the proliferation of profitable investments and the\nexploitation of certain markets. It should also aim at\nproviding coordinated and systematic assistance to\nimmense populations whose only experience of\nglobalization has been their eternal poverty and\nfrustration.\nSince time immemorial, the inhabitants of Ecuador\nhave had special devotion to nature. My country, which\nhas one the greatest biodiversity reserves in the world,\nhas a deep sense of respect for nature and an awareness\nof its value, which are deeply rooted in our traditional\nculture. Ecuadorian indigenous communities, for example,\npossess ancestral knowledge concerning the rational\nmanagement of resources and the preservation of the\necosystem.\nEcuador is aware of the difficult dilemma faced by\nevery society when it comes to choosing between\neconomic progress and the preservation of the\nenvironment. Given the basic value that the natural\nenvironment has for the Ecuadorian people, we have\ndedicated all our efforts to preventing, or at least limiting\nto the greatest extent possible, the degree of destruction\nof nature caused by economic progress.\nAs it did during the special session of the General\nAssembly held last June, my Government would like to\nreiterate its strong commitment to the implementation\nof Agenda 21 and to reaching the Agenda's goals of\nsustainable development. The efforts of developing\nnations will be successful only if they can secure the\neffective support of developed countries through\ncompliance with the commitments assumed at the\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, the Rio summit. There can be no\nuniversal environmental preservation without a genuine\nchange in the unsustainable consumption patterns that\nbring about the increasing deterioration of the global\nenvironment, without adequate financial assistance for\ndevelopment in percentages proportional to gross\ndomestic product, and without adequate facilities to\naccess modern technologies.\nThe establishment of new trade and financial\nregimes and the urgent need to restructure our\neconomies give rise to enormous challenges for\ndeveloping countries. We believe that we should\nredouble our efforts in order to meet the requirements\nof globalization, in such a way that our nations can also\nbenefit from the new international economic vigour.\nUnlike developed countries, for developing\ncountries the globalization process is not only a way to\nreactivate productive growth, maintain an upward trend\nin stock market indicators or increase business profits.\nFor developing countries, the economic aspect of the\nso-called globalization should be an opportunity to\naccelerate the sustainable development of their peoples,\nparticularly with regard to social issues.\nIt should be recalled that developing countries\nhave made spectacular efforts to adjust to the new\neconomic realities. Trade adjustment and liberalization\nprogrammes have had strong short-term impacts in\nsignificant sectors of our society. Several States have\nadopted severe economic measures, hoping that in the\nend they will have positive results for all. However, we\ncannot help but feel that this attitude contrasts with the\nbehaviour of some industrialized countries.\nIn trade matters, for example, although some\ndeveloped nations insist on the liberalization of trade,\nthey persist in keeping various barriers against trade\nflows originating in the South. We are not opposed to\nthe moderate liberalization of markets regulated by\ninternational trade in order to prevent negative effects\non sensitive sectors of local economies, but we are\nopposed to those who preach freedom of trade for some\nand then systematically avoid it for themselves as they\n4\n\n\nsee fit. Developing countries demand a fair, equitable and\ntransparent environment for international trade that will\nallow us to reap the benefits of economic globalization.\nOn the other hand, many developed countries with\ninfluence in financial decision-taking circles maintain a\npurely economic perspective \u2014 as opposed to a wider\nsocial vision \u2014 of the financial difficulties affecting the\ndeveloping world. They continue to associate a nation's\neconomic health with the vigour of its macroeconomic\nindicators alone. In fact, no nation can have a healthy\neconomy if a significant sector of its population lives in\nextreme poverty or if internal growth indicators do not\nguarantee a sustainable and continued development in the\nfuture. Foreign debt still weighs heavily on my country\nand prevents us from reaching the objectives of sustained\neconomic and social development and environmental\nprotection. With the same constructive spirit as that\nwhich guides our trade policies, we are convinced that\nthe institutions of the international financial system\nshould support developing countries' efforts to facilitate\ntheir economic advancement and fulfil the commitments\nof the Earth Summit.\nInternational trade and finance, disarmament and\nsecurity, environment and development are issues that\ncannot be considered separately from one another. We\nknow that all the issues in the international agenda are\ninterrelated and we address them separately just for\nconvenience of consideration. In any case, we must never\nlose sight of the principle of globality and interrelation in\nthe international agenda, or we may run the risk of\nhaving an utterly limited historical perspective and\nobjectivity.\nAccordingly, Ecuador shares the view of the United\nNations Secretary-General on the importance of human\nrights in the modern world and that all relevant\nprogrammes implemented by the Organization must be\nfully integrated within the scope of activities of the\nUnited Nations.\nIn the case of Ecuador, I am pleased to inform the\nAssembly that one of the principles of my Administration\nis to enforce a policy of absolute respect for human\nrights. I have the ethical conviction that modern civilized\nlife is impossible without individual guarantees and\ntolerance for diverging opinions. The Ecuadorian State is\ncommitted to following this line of conduct and to\npromoting and protecting all human, civil, cultural,\neconomic, political and social rights, including the right\nto development. We are also committed to encouraging\ninquiry procedures in cases of violations of such rights\nand to punishing those found liable for them.\nThe battle against corruption is one of the essential\nobjectives of the National Government in order to\nensure that government institutions can recover their\nrespectability and the trust which our people is entitled\nto place in them.\nI wish to refer to a specific aspect related to the\nhuman rights issue: the establishment of an international\ncriminal court to punish the most serious crimes, such\nas genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\nEcuador strongly supports this initiative. We share the\nview that this court should be established by\ninternational convention. We therefore urge all States to\nshow the necessary political will to overcome the\nremaining technical difficulties in order to convene the\nconference of plenipotentiaries charged with approving\nthe court's statutes.\nTo conclude, as President of the Republic of\nEcuador, I have the pleasure to bring the message of\nfriendship and brotherhood of the Ecuadorian people to\nthis forum, in which all the nations of the world are\nrepresented. Our people has consolidated its democracy\nand balanced its economy and is moving boldly forward\nto build its future. It is a people that sincerely aspires to\nensuring that international mechanisms understand the\nrealities of developing countries. Above all, at this\nmoment in our history, in the face of any potential\nnatural disaster, such as the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, we\nwould like to count on the timely, effective and direct\ncooperation of the United Nations and the various\nrelevant international institutions. I wish to extend once\nagain our message of friendship and fraternity, as well\nas my country's commitment to the lofty ideals that\nguide the efforts of the United Nations in the\ninternational sphere."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to begin by congratulating you, Sir,\non your election as President of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-second session. Costa Rica joins the previous\nexpressions of appreciation that have been addressed to\nyou and wishes you every success in this period that will\nbe remembered for its special contribution to the reform\nof this highest forum of international politics.\nTen years ago Central America surprised the world\nby proclaiming peace. Ten years ago nations separated by\nhatred and divided by ancestral injustices decided to put\nan end to their differences through dialogue and\nreconciliation and to move, without haste, but also\nwithout delay, towards a more promising future of\nequality and sustainable development.\nThe world has changed greatly in this decade. The\nwalls of intolerance fell in Berlin and in Pretoria; the\n20\n\n\nMothers of the Plaza de Mayo have not lost any more\nchildren. There is no doubt that we live in turbulent times\nbut, most world leaders, regardless of their religion or\nethnic origin, subscribe to the widespread conviction that\nthe models of the cold war cannot guide us through the new\nmillennium. Moreover at the global level, despite the\ntemporary images from Sarajevo, Kigali, Rwanda and\nMonrovia, there prevails a vision of a twenty-first century\nin which democracy, reason and justice reign.\nMy people believes in peace. My people believes in\ndisarmament. My people believes that the destiny of the\nhuman family is one of harmony and solidarity under the\nauspices of international law. These beliefs are not the\nproduct of intellectual speculation. Costa Rica has lived for\nmore than 100 years in a democracy protected by pluralism\nand respect for human rights. My compatriots, men and\nwomen, are aware that they are the sons and daughters of\na nation whose history proves that there is no force stronger\nthan that of reason. This is why, when our armed forces\nwere abolished as a standing institution in 1948, almost at\nthe same time as the United Nations was being born, Costa\nRica declared peace to the world and thus unequivocally\nshowed its profound love for harmony among all the\npeoples of the world.\nCentral America comes to this forum united around an\nideal of common integration and working together on a\nshared democratic project. For the first time in history, our\ncountries come before the General Assembly to declare not\njust their reiterated adherence to the Charter and to the\nprinciples and obligations inherent in civilized coexistence\nin the community of nations, but also their intention to\nmarch decisively towards unity as a higher stage in the\ncommunitarian partnership that we already enjoy under the\n1991 Protocol of Tegucigalpa.\nFor the last three years, Central America has made a\ngreat effort to link up with the rest of the world, something\nwe regard as essential if we are to realize the objectives\nand priorities of our Alliance for Sustainable Development.\nThis initiative, signed in 1994, was the first in the world to\nbe adopted since the Declaration of the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development.\nThe fruits of this effort have been abundant. Central\nAmerica has established preferential relations with Canada,\nChile, the United States, Japan, Mexico, the Republic of\nKorea and the European Union. The biggest innovation has\nbeen the definition of agendas based not on short-term\ninterests, but on regional strategic priorities. We are now\nconcentrating on improving integration by thoroughly\nreforming regional institutions. Convinced that economic\ngrowth can be achieved only if accompanied by\nincreasing levels of sustainable development, the Central\nAmerican countries wish to inform the international\ncommunity of our decision to move forward resolutely\ntowards a common future, a future of great progress and\nsolidarity for our peoples.\nThe world today is still diverse, still divided. Many\ncultures and societies live on a single shared planet. In\ntoday\u2019s complex scenario, now that the Cold War is over,\ndivisions remain and new dangers threaten international\nsociety. This is why the United Nations continues to be\nthe meeting point, the unifying institution for all of us. It\nwill continue to play that important role, provided we\nshoulder our commitments, face our challenges and make\nprogressive changes.\nSince our Secretary-General presented his proposals\nfor reform in July, the Central American countries have\nexpressed firm support for his ideas about a modern,\nefficient, nimble Organization with better coordination in\nline with current administrative and financial trends, an\nOrganization enabling us, without further delay, to move\nfrom lofty aspirations to real actions that will help\neverybody, especially those in developing countries,\nwhich comprise the overwhelming majority of the\nmembers of this body. We take this opportunity to\nreiterate our clear and firm support for the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s proposals submitted to Member States for\nconsideration at this session.\nUnited Nations reform should be accompanied by a\nconstructive review of the scale of assessments. In Central\nAmerica we believe that the criteria for the scale of\nassessments need to be changed so that all Member States\ncontribute financially to the Organization in accordance\nwith their means.\nThe Central American countries believe that the\ninternational peace and security system designed in 1945\nshould be subject to detailed review in a broad and\nconsensual exercise. In principle, we support the idea of\nincreasing the number of Member States with permanent\nmembership in the Security Council. We believe, at the\nsame time, that any such proposal must be democratic\nand representative of the plurality of States and regions\nthat make up the United Nations. In particular, we\nstrongly support the argument that the three developing\nregions of the world should have permanent\nrepresentation in that organ and that the veto power, if\n21\n\n\nthere is no willingness to eliminate it, should be confined\nto topics under Chapter VII of the Charter.\nThe founders of the United Nations saw a world that\nhad to decide between peace and extermination. Still\naffected by the Second World War, they were well placed\nto understand that humanity had no other choice but to\nshelter under the protection of international law as the only\nway of preventing a new Holocaust. More than 50 years\nlater, we have a similar duty, but one that is less dramatic\nthanks to the significant progress made since the end of the\nCold War: the duty to provide the United Nations with the\npolitical, financial and administrative conditions it needs so\nthat it can continue its work for peace and international\nsecurity. Central America is ready to make its contribution\nso that these noble objectives may be attained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSir, your rich experience in the United Nations\nsystem, your country \u2014 Ukraine \u2014 your current\nresponsibilities and your personality assure us of the\ncompetence and dedication with which you will fulfil\nyour mission as President of the fifty-second session of\nthe United Nations General Assembly.\nWe would like to extend our most sincere\ncongratulations and our gratitude to your predecessor,\nAmbassador Ismail Razali of Malaysia, for a full, hard-\nworking and stimulating fifty-first session. We reiterate\nour encouragement and support to the Secretary-General,\n22\n\n\nMr. Kofi Annan. We also wish to commend the work\nwhich he and his team have accomplished in only nine\nmonths.\nLast Thursday, 25 September, the Security Council\nissued a statement on the situation in Africa, in which it\nsaid:\n\u201cThe Security Council reaffirms the responsibility of\nall Member States to settle their international disputes\nby peaceful means and its own primary responsibility\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security\nin accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.\u201d\n(S/PRST/1997/46)\nBurkina Faso shares this vision. Together with other\nAfrican countries, it has become involved in subregional\nand regional initiatives with regard to our brother countries\nof Liberia, the Central African Republic and Burundi, to\nname only a few. Burkina Faso, whose confidence has been\nstrengthened by that experience, reaffirms the inestimable\nvalue of preventive diplomacy. We therefore support any\naction designed to achieve that end, and call upon the\nUnited Nations to develop a genuine conflict-prevention\npolicy. From north to south and from west to east, African\nStates have been taking action on a continuous basis and in\na variety of ways to deal with armed conflicts, political\ninstability and internal disorder in our continent.\nAfrica is daily demonstrating its clear determination to\nsolve its own problems as a matter of priority by creating,\namong other things, a Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\nManagement and Resolution. Having made the maximum\nregional contribution, therefore, to the resolution of these\nproblems, it wonders why the Security Council seems not\nto be responding. Where does the Security Council\u2019s chief\nresponsibility lie? The worst thing that could happen to the\nOrganization would be for Member States to begin to\nbelieve that our common institution has two different\nyardsticks. Our statements and appeals would then no\nlonger be of any value, and our possible actions would be\naffected, and weakened.\nThe purposes enshrined in the United Nations\nCharter \u2014 peace and security and economic and social\ndevelopment \u2014 can only be attained, consolidated and\nmaintained by means of justice within nations, justice\namong nations and, therefore, justice throughout the world.\nThe task is enormous. The justice demanded would not\nimply the end of the influence of power, but it would\nindicate whether such influence was positive or negative.\nWith regard to disarmament, we must reaffirm the\nnecessity of working towards the elimination of weapons\nof mass destruction, whether nuclear, chemical or\nbiological.\nIn Africa, the illicit traffic in small arms has had\nnew and increasingly uncontrollable consequences,\nranging from an increase in armed criminal acts to the\nproliferation of armed refugees. This provokes and adds\nto the instability of entire regions. My delegation would\nlike to know what has become of the follow-up to the\nSecretary-General\u2019s initiative under resolution 51/45 L on\nassistance to States for curbing the illicit traffic in small\narms and collecting them.\nBurkina Faso welcomes the results of the Oslo\nconference on anti-personnel landmines, and urges all\nStates to adhere as quickly as possible to the Convention\nadopted in Oslo, and above all to comply with its terms.\nBurkina Faso remains concerned by all situations of\nturmoil, instability and conflict, from Afghanistan and the\nformer Yugoslavia to Cambodia.\nThe illusions harboured after the end of the cold war\nare now giving way to a contrasting vision in which the\nfactors of integration and disintegration in our world are\nbecoming clearer. In Africa, the tragedy in Somalia has\nbeen followed by tragedies in the Great Lakes region and\nthe Republic of Congo, while the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo is now embarking, with some hesitation, upon\nthe road towards restoration. In Liberia, elections finally\nallowing that country to recover, too, and to contemplate\nthe colossal task of national reconstruction are taking\nplace. However, in the neighbouring country of Sierra\nLeone constitutional order has been violated and flouted.\nBurkina Faso reaffirms its resolute condemnation of\nthe interruption of the democratic process in Sierra Leone\nas well as its adherence to decision 356, on the situation\nin Sierra Leone, taken by the Heads of State or\nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity at its\nthirty-third summit meeting in Harare.\nWe welcome the significant advances made in\nAngola and urge all the parties, especially UNITA, to\nplay a constructive role.\nIn the Middle East, Burkina Faso is concerned about\nthe repeated setbacks to the peace process and calls on\nthe parties to ensure that acts of provocation do not create\n23\n\n\na deadly chain of violence that would go against the\ninterests of the peoples of the region.\nThe international environment is undergoing a process\nof constant change under the combined effect of three\nphenomena: globalization of the economy and of threats;\nliberalization of markets; and the information and\ncommunications revolution. While we welcome the creation\nand consolidation of large economic and monetary\ngroupings throughout the world, the upheavals created by\nglobalization and the demands of a triumphant free-market\nmodel illustrate the fragile nature of the successes achieved,\nand show more clearly that moderation and justice are the\nbasic requirements.\nAfrica, like a patient being cared for on his sick-bed,\nhas heard and heeded the diagnosis and the suggested\nremedies, including programmes, projects, agendas and\nspecial initiatives. This continent, which is engaged in a\nconstant struggle, is achieving some results that run the risk\nof being wiped out by globalization, in that its international\ntrade is continuing to decrease as a result mainly of outside\nfactors, further increasing its marginalization.\nDeveloping countries expect the Agenda for\nDevelopment, adopted during the fifty-first session of the\nGeneral Assembly, to be a catalyst for a new global\npartnership for development. The sincerity of the\ncommitment of each and every one of us will be judged\naccording to the effectiveness of its implementation. In this\nregard, and on all economic and environmental issues, we\nsupport the comments made on behalf of us all by\nTanzania, which holds the presidency of the Group of 77.\nBurkina Faso, together with other Member States, has\nasked for consideration of the need to review resolution\n2758 (XXVI), which excludes from the United Nations the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan. In doing so, Burkina Faso\nhas no intention of violating the rights of another Member\nState. It merely asks that, given the new context, the reality\nof the Republic of China be acknowledged. This reality is\ndemonstrated by the many and various relations that the\nRepublic of China has in one form or another with most\nStates. A review would do justice to the 21.5 million\ninhabitants while work goes on to resolve the matter by the\nreunification desired by both sides.\nWhile we continue to call for respect for human rights\nand respect for freedoms, there is still concern that it has\nnot yet been possible to implement a position that the\nGeneral Assembly has affirmed and reaffirmed, year after\nyear. The principle of freedom of trade is overtly being\nviolated, and Cuba, a Member State, is the victim.\nBurkina Faso believes that the international community\nmust continue its efforts to convince all the parties\nconcerned that since the embargo and obstacles to free\ntrade have not yet resolved the dispute, new constructive\npaths must be explored.\nSimilarly, along with the current Chairman of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), Burkina Faso\naffirms the need to find a solution to the dispute between\nLibya, the United States and the United Kingdom with\nregard to the Lockerbie tragedy. As well as the sufferings\nof the families of those who perished, many other people\nare continuing to suffer from the sanctions imposed\nagainst Libya. The Organization of African Unity has\nalways expressed its concern at the unremitting sanctions\nimposed on Libya and their humanitarian consequences\nfor its people, and has advocated a fair trial of the\nsuspects pursuant to accepted principles of justice and\ninternational law. With the OAU, Burkina Faso hopes that\nthe Security Council will give due attention to the\nproposal made jointly by the Organization of African\nUnity and the League of Arab States with a view to\nfinding a just and equitable solution to the crisis.\nSpeaking of the Security Council, a permanent\nmember of the Council used the formula that it is far\nbetter to support a proposal for change backed by a large\nmajority than to support a status quo that enjoys the\nsupport of almost no one. Such reform is now a necessity\nwith regard to which Africa has developed a common\nposition. Africa, which was absent in 1945, intends to\ngain recognition for its right to a place in the Security\nCouncil, in which most of the matters dealt with are\nAfrican. Two permanent seats and some non-permanent\nseats would represent the beginning of justice for a\ncontinent which, along with Latin America, has no\npermanent representation. Burkina Faso believes that the\nenlargement of the Security Council, while including\nJapan and Germany, must necessarily provide equitable\nrepresentation for Africa, Asia and Latin America.\nIn addition to the Council\u2019s composition, its\nfunctioning must also be reviewed. The future Security\nCouncil must no longer be a body that behaves all too\noften like a club for the privileged; rather, it must behave\nlike an institution imbued with the highest responsibilities\nand aspirations for the benefit of all, without\ndiscrimination. Without that understanding, reform will be\nfutile.\nAt the fifty-first session, I concluded by saying:\n24\n\n\n\u201cWe are now seeing that the State is surrendering\ncontrol over certain elements of its sovereignty.\nEverywhere, structures and organizations with varying\ndegrees of legality are transcending States and\nestablishing transnational networks and relations. It is\ntherefore imperative that we keep pace with these\ntrends and adapt now and in the future our special\ninstrument, our common instrument: the United\nNations at the service of peoples. Political will is what\nwill make the difference.\u201d [Official Records of the\nGeneral Assembly, Fifty-first Session, Plenary\nMeetings, 20th meeting, p. 24]\nEarlier today, speaking of the globalization of the\neconomy, I also mentioned the globalization of threats. I\nhad in mind poverty, environmental deterioration, terrorism,\ndrug trafficking, pandemics and, in general, the great\ndisasters caused by man or by nature.\nThe United Nations is in this regard an irreplaceable\nand invaluable tool. We thank and most warmly commend\nour brother Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, who, in the\nspace of nine months, has produced proposals designed to\nkeep us all in step with the times and future challenges. In\nour quest for peace, security, progress, prosperity and\njustice, the Secretary-General is proposing that we define\nand redefine the instrument of our solidarity and our\ncommon condition. Burkina Faso will join wholeheartedly\nin this exercise and will support any movement that can\nlead us to development, which is one of the cardinal points\nof our quest and a platform on which all of the United\nNations essential missions can come together: the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, the\npromotion of justice and international law, the strengthening\nof cooperation for development, the protection of human\nrights and humanitarian assistance.\nWhile we welcome and applaud the generous\ncontribution a wealthy individual has made to the United\nNations, we must also remind all States that their\ncontributions are a fulfilment of solemn and voluntary\ncommitments. Contributions to the budget must be made in\nfull, on time and without conditions. This is also part of the\nneeded reform.\nThe developments we are witnessing are profoundly\ncontradictory. The future is marked by pairs of opposites \u2014\nintegration and disintegration; stability and instability;\nwealth and poverty; health and incurable disease; the\nopening and closing of borders; democracies and\ndictatorships; inter alia. They, it is said, are the very stuff\nof life.\nThe pendulum swings from optimism to pessimism\nand then back again. To stop it as it swings towards\noptimism, we will need, as never before, to see to it that\nthe international community can find and cultivate the\nvirtues of inclusion and justice, for otherwise we will see\ndevelop before our eyes, to an increasing degree, a world\nof cruel and pitiless violence.\nThe United Nations is our chance for a world of\nhope, justice, peace and progress. Let us seize this\nchance.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me first to\ncongratulate my colleague from Ukraine, Minister Hennadiy\nUdovenko, on his election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly, and to convey to him our appreciation and the\nconfidence we place in his personal qualities and experience\nto steer the work of the current session. In his election, I\nsee also the recognition of the role played on the\ninternational stage by Ukraine, a European nation with\nwhich we have friendly ties. I am pleased to recall the\noccasion on the margins of the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) meeting in Portugal last May when\nhe initialled a \u201cletter on the special partnership between\nNATO and Ukraine\u201d.\nI would also like to pay tribute to the outgoing\nPresident, Ambassador Razali Ismail, for the dedicated and\ncompetent manner in which he presided over the work of\nthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly, and notably\nfor his promotion of United Nations reform, which we\nconsider to be essential.\nI wish to express my appreciation to the Secretary-\nGeneral for the new dynamism he has brought to the\nOrganization and for the proposals he has made for its\nmodernization.\nMy colleague from Luxembourg has already addressed\nthe Assembly on behalf of the 15 member States of the\nEuropean Union. However, I would like to reflect on a\nnumber of questions of particular importance to my\ncountry.\nThe main question on our agenda is undoubtedly the\nreform of the United Nations. Despite its achievements and\nincreasing importance on the international stage, the United\nNations today needs a profound transformation to enable it\nto face the challenges of the next millennium.\nPortugal expresses its appreciation for the programme\nof reforms presented by the Secretary-General and reaffirms\nits readiness to participate in the further development of\nthis initiative, taking up the challenge to build up a more\neffective Organization, with a better capacity to respond\nand a more rational utilization of its resources. The\nPortuguese Government supports in general terms the\nproposals contained in that programme.\nAmong the instrumental measures proposed, Portugal\nsees merit in the creation of the post of Deputy Secretary-\nGeneral. We also welcome the proposal to rationalize the\ndebates of the General Assembly so that it may focus on\nspecific themes.\nWith regard to the area of peace and security, the\nprimary focus of the action of the United Nations, we\nsupport the strengthening of its institutional capacity in\nthe field of preventive diplomacy and of post-conflict\npeace-building. The creation of a rapidly deployable\nmission headquarters and the initiative of some Member\nStates to constitute a high-readiness brigade are\ninstruments that will permit the United Nations to\nstrengthen its capacity to react to emerging crises. I am\npleased to note that Portugal is ranked twenty-sixth\namong nations contributing troops for United Nations\npeacekeeping operations.\nWe also believe that cooperation between the United\nNations and regional organizations should continue to be\nencouraged, particularly as concerns the African\ncontinent.\nWith regard to the defence and promotion of human\nrights, I would like to commend the emphasis given by\nthe Secretary-General to its cross-sectoral nature, which\nmust be taken into due account in all the activities and\nprogrammes of the United Nations.\nIn this context, we are also particularly pleased to\nsee the proposal to fuse the Centre for Human Rights\nwith the Office of the High Commissioner for Human\nRights. The process of reform in this area will be carried\nout by the new High Commissioner, Mrs. Mary Robinson,\nwhom I congratulate on her recent appointment.\nThe effectiveness of intervention by the United\nNations in humanitarian assistance is of special concern\nto us, including within the framework of the Security\nCouncil. Therefore, Portugal welcomes the proposal of the\nSecretary-General to restructure this sector by\nstrengthening the role of the Emergency Relief\nCoordinator, as well as the suggestion for the\nestablishment of an Economic and Social Council\nsegment for humanitarian affairs.\nThe promotion of social and economic progress is a\nfundamental goal of the United Nations. As the Secretary-\n11\n\n\nGeneral rightly reminded us in an Agenda for Development,\ndevelopment cannot be attained in the absence of peace and\nsecurity or in absence of respect for all human rights and\nfundamental freedoms.\nPortugal notes with satisfaction the process of\nreadjustment proposed by the Secretary-General to\nstrengthen the macroeconomic coordinating mechanisms of\nthe activities of the United Nations and its specialized\nagencies.\nIn the area of assistance for development, we see with\nequal satisfaction the focus on guaranteeing an integrated,\ncoherent and coordinated activity of all funds, programmes\nand agencies involved. As we see it, however, such efforts\nmust not jeopardize their respective autonomy and\nspecificity.\nWe understand the goals of the challenge launched by\nthe Secretary-General to replenish the levels of financing\nfor development activities of the United Nations. For our\npart, we pledge to continue our efforts, within the limits of\nour capabilities. We also believe that the persuasion and\nmobilization of the private sector may turn out to be very\nuseful at a time of acute budgetary restrictions.\nIn this context, and in the light of the increasing\ndisparity between developed and developing countries, the\nproposal of the Secretary-General to channel savings\nresulting from reforms towards development activities is\nparticularly welcome to us. The promotion of sustainable,\nequitable and socially just development has increasingly\nbecome a top priority for the United Nations. The guarantee\nof a balance between economic growth, the conservation of\nthe environment and the protection of natural resources is\nessential for the future of our planet. Portugal therefore\nsupports the proposals of the Secretary-General aimed at\nstrengthening the United Nations Environment Programme\nas the core environmental agency of the United Nations.\nFinally, we cannot fail to underline that the goal of the\nreforms, particularly in the economic and social sector,\nshould not be exclusively to reduce costs but to rationalize\nstructures and consequently to improve the capacity of the\nOrganization.\nWe support a reform and enlargement of the Security\nCouncil that reflects the increase in the Members of the\nUnited Nations, takes into account the new political and\neconomic realities and ensures fairer geographical\ndistribution. In this way, the Security Council will be more\ndemocratic and therefore more effective in the\nformulation and implementation of its decisions.\nWith regard to the composition of the Security\nCouncil, we advocate an equitable increase in both\ncategories of membership, encompassing all regional\ngroups, in order to make it more representative.\nAs to the selection of new permanent members, we\nbelieve that certain criteria should be applied, namely,\nrespect for the principles of the United Nations Charter,\nfull acceptance of the jurisdiction of the International\nCourt of Justice and the capacity and will to contribute to\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, as\nwell as global influence.\nThe Portuguese Government reaffirms its support for\nthe inclusion of Germany and Japan as permanent\nmembers of the Security Council. But it would be\ndifficult to understand if the increase in the number of\npermanent members did not also include States from the\nregions of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.\nIn this context, among eligible countries, there is Brazil,\na founding Member of the United Nations, the largest\ncountry in Latin America and a State that is committed to\nthe principles of the Charter.\nPortugal believes particular emphasis should be\ngiven to the review of the working methods of the\nSecurity Council, not only in order to strengthen the\ntransparency of its decision-making process, but also to\ncreate the conditions for an improved ability for\nnon-members to accompany the work of the Council. In\nfact, this was one of the concerns of the Portuguese\ncandidature for the Security Council for 1997-1998 and\nwas one of the main priorities of the Portuguese\npresidency of the Council last April. Within the Security\nCouncil, we have advocated the holding of open Council\ndebates to allow non-members to participate in\ndiscussions of matters of direct interest to them.\nWe have also encouraged the involvement of the\nSecurity Council in debating themes which have particular\nrelevance to its work, such as the promotion of human\nrights, the protection of refugees, humanitarian assistance\nand the impact of sanctions, aiming at providing a more\ncoherent framework for the Council to act in the future.\nOne of the most pressing concerns requiring an\nurgent response is resolution of the Organization\u2019s serious\nfinancial crisis. We believe that the solution lies in the\nfull and timely fulfilment of obligations, the unconditional\n12\n\n\npayment of arrears to the Organization, review of the scales\nof assessment so as to reflect the real capacity to pay of\nMember States, and applying financial rigour and\nrationalizing the use of existing resources. These proposals\nseek to guarantee a sound financial base for the United\nNations.\nPortugal, a member of the troika of observer countries\nof the peace process in Angola, and a member of the\nSecurity Council, continues to pay particular attention to\ndevelopments in that African country. We were particularly\nencouraged to witness the positive events of March this\nyear: the formation of a Government of Unity and National\nReconciliation including members of UNITA, as well as the\nreturn to the National Assembly of that movement\u2019s\nparliamentary group. These important fulfilments of the\n1994 Lusaka Protocol, which is the framework for the\nentire process, were undoubtedly an important step forward\nin the eyes of all those, foremost among them the Angolan\npeople themselves, who yearn to see this great African\ncountry enter fully into a future of peace, national\nreconciliation and economic and social development. We\nare therefore understandably concerned about the new\ndifficulties affecting the peace process, which have already\nresulted in the timely, and we hope decisive, intervention\nby the Security Council through its resolution 1127 (1997),\nadopted last month. As we stated on the occasion of its\nadoption, we consider the terms of the resolution \u2014 the\nability to impose sanctions \u2014 to be a stimulus for UNITA\nto fulfil its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol, which it\naccepted freely. This is not an attempt to condemn UNITA\nto isolation or to exclude it from the peace process, of\nwhich it is, and should continue to be, an integral part.\nPeace in Angola is possible and necessary. But, as we\nhave stated before, in the final analysis it depends on the\npolitical will of the Lusaka Protocol signatories. They must\nnot, however, ignore the human, financial and material\ninvestments the international community has already made\nin Angola in defence of the peace process. Should the\ncurrent impasse in the Angolan peace process continue, the\ninternational community will undoubtedly adopt the\nmeasures required under the circumstances. We therefore\nreiterate our appeal to the parties, and in particular to\nUNITA, to show the international community, by taking\nconcrete steps, that they have decidedly opted for the road\nto peace, once and for all relegating to the past the spectre\nof a fratricidal war.\nFinally, I could not end this reference to Angola\nwithout saluting the Special Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral for Angola, Maitre Alioune Blondin Beye, who has\nbeen tireless in his mission to defend the peace process.\nWe would also like to place on record our sincere\nappreciation to all those who, working with either great\ncommitment with the United Nations Angola Verification\nMission (UNAVEM III) or the United Nations Observer\nMission in Angola (MONUA), embody the international\ncommunity\u2019s hope that a brighter future awaits the\nAngolan people.\nYear after year Portugal has brought to the attention\nof this Assembly the question of East Timor. Some may\nhave thought that time would consign this question to\noblivion. But the events of this last year have confirmed\nthat the problem of East Timor is more alive than ever\nbefore in the conscience of the international community.\nI recall the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 to\nMonsignor Ximenes Belo and Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta, two\nEast Timorese who, in different fields, have greatly\ndistinguished themselves in taking up the rights and the\nidentity of the people of East Timor. The award of that\nPrize also demonstrates the respect and solidarity of world\npublic opinion for the struggle of a people for freedom\nand for their inalienable right to self-determination, which\nall Members of the United Nations are duty-bound to\nrespect.\nHere, I would like to praise the recent initiative of\nthe President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, in support\nof the efforts of the Secretary-General, aimed at the\nrelease of the East Timorese leader Xanana Gusmao and\nof all other East Timorese political prisoners.\nUnfortunately, this increasing international attention\nto the question of East Timor has not resulted in an\nimprovement of the situation in the territory, where the\nsystematic violation of the most basic human rights\npersists and whose people continue to be denied the right\nto express and affirm their identity, despite the\ndeliberations, year after year, of the Human Rights\nCommission.\nI would like to express our recognition of the new\nimpetus which, in accordance with the mandate given to\nhim by resolution 37/30, the Secretary-General has sought\nto give to the search for a negotiated settlement to the\nproblem of East Timor by: appointing a Personal\nRepresentative dedicated exclusively to this matter, in the\neminent person of Ambassador Jamsheed Marker;\nproviding a more operational and active impulse to the\ntripartite negotiations under his auspices; and relaunching\n13\n\n\nthe all-inclusive East Timorese dialogue which involves the\nactive participation of the East Timorese in this process,\ninvolvement that is essential to its success.\nOnly through negotiations will it be possible to find a\nlasting solution to the problem of East Timor. Portugal is\ncontributing, with hope and commitment, to this new cycle\nof negotiations aimed at achieving a just, comprehensive\nand internationally acceptable solution for East Timor,\naccording to the terms of the Charter and the relevant\nresolutions of the United Nations.\nPortugal has sought to give fresh impetus to its\nparticipation in international organizations, recognizing the\ndynamism and increased importance of multilateral forums\nin international life. Since the last General Assembly\nsession, Portugal has hosted two important international\nmeetings: the Summit Meeting of the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe and the spring\nministerial meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO). Portugal has also recently hosted\ntwo rounds of negotiations on Western Sahara. We\nwelcome the positive results achieved on this question by\nthe special envoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. James\nBaker.\nIn 1998, Portugal will be hosting the eighth Ibero-\nAmerican Summit, and will organize, in close cooperation\nwith the United Nations, the first world conference of youth\nministers, which will take action on the United Nations\nWorld Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000\nand Beyond.\nI would like also to refer to the Community of\nPortuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP). The promotion of\nthe Portuguese language, spoken today by more than 200\nmillion people, the new modalities of institutional\ncooperation which have been established and the\ncoordination of the diplomatic and political positions of the\nfounder countries in the many international forums\ninvolved, have made this organization, despite its youth, an\nattentive participant within the international community.\nThe problems associated with the many components of\nthe drug phenomenon are among the biggest challenges\nfaced by our societies today. The phenomenon particularly\naffects our young people, and its global nature certainly\nrequires a concerted response on the part of the entire\ninternational community. In this context, and given that\nPortugal is presiding over the preparatory work for the\nspecial session of the General Assembly on drugs, which\nwill take place in June 1998, I would like to underline the\nimportance we attribute to that event. We sincerely hope\nthat that session will produce a clear political commitment\non the part of Governments to combat the drug plague,\nand that concrete steps will be taken in that direction.\nWith a view to achieving these objectives, I appeal to\nMember States to be represented at the special session at\nthe highest political level.\nWith regard to sustainable development, Portugal has\nclosely followed the implementation of the principles\nestablished by the Rio Summit. The nineteenth special\nsession of the General Assembly confirmed, however, that\nwe are still far from implementing fully the goals\nestablished there. Allow me to underline the three\ncomponents to which Portugal attributes particular\nimportance: combating desertification, protecting the\nforests and protecting the oceans. Portugal considers that\nin the fight against desertification the United Nations\nConvention is the fundamental legal instrument for the\nimplementation of new international actions on this\nmatter. With regard to the northern Mediterranean, we\nwill continue to promote the most extensive cooperation\nwith our partners, and we are open to closer association\nwith the countries of North Africa in a joint effort\ninvolving the entire Mediterranean region.\nIn the area of the preservation of forests, we support\naction undertaken, particularly in the context of the\nUnited Nations, with a view to the conservation,\nintegrated development and sustainable management of\nthis important heritage of mankind. I would like to draw\nattention to the holding in Lisbon in June 1998 of the\nthird Pan-European ministerial Meeting on the protection\nof the forests, which we hope will contribute significantly\nto protecting forest ecosystems that have deteriorated.\nAs regards the oceans and seas, Portugal will\ncontinue to support efforts to preserve them, advocating\nin particular the more effective protection of marine\nbiodiversity and the integrated management of coastal,\ncontinental and insular zones.\nFollowing the proclamation of 1998 as the\nInternational Year of the Ocean, Portugal is proud to be\norganizing in Lisbon the last universal exposition of this\ncentury, Expo 98, which will be dedicated to the theme\n\u201cOceans: a heritage for the future\u201d.\nParticularly relevant in this context will be the work\nof the Independent World Commission on the Oceans,\nchaired by the former President of the Portuguese\nRepublic, Mr. Mario Soares, the conclusions of which\n14\n\n\nwill be presented to the General Assembly at its next\nsession.\nI would like to end my statement with a word of hope\nand optimism for the future of the Organization. We believe\nin a revitalized and even stronger United Nations for the\ntwenty-first century. The Assembly can count on our efforts\nto work towards that goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPlease allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at\nits current session. I believe your wisdom and experience\nwill enable you to accomplish your lofty mission with\ndistinction. At the same time, I would like to express my\nappreciation to Mr. Razali Ismail for his contribution as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its last session.\nThis year, 1997, is no ordinary year for China. Last\nFebruary, when Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of\nChina\u2019s reform and opening-up, passed away, the 1.2\nbillion Chinese people were immersed in deep sorrow.\nTurning grief into strength, we are determined to heed his\nbehest by deepening reform, opening the country still wider\nto the outside world, stepping up national development and\npromoting the cause of world peace. Here, on behalf of the\nChinese Government and people, I would like once again\nto thank the United Nations and its Member States for the\nsincere condolences they expressed on the passing of Deng\nXiaoping. Your kind words gave us strength at our time of\nbereavement.\nJust a few days ago, the Fifteenth National Congress\nof the Communist Party of China came to a triumphant\nconclusion in Beijing. This Congress, holding high the great\nbanner of Deng Xiaoping theory, charts the future course of\nChina\u2019s development with a blueprint and displays the\nresolve to carry forward the cause of building socialism\nwith Chinese characteristics well into the twenty-first\ncentury.\nOn 1 July of this year, China resumed its exercise of\nsovereignty over Hong Kong, which wiped out our national\nhumiliation of one and a half centuries and opened up a\nnew chapter in our peaceful reunification. During the more\nthan two months since its return, Hong Kong has enjoyed\nsocial stability and economic prosperity, which fills the\npeople of Hong Kong, of China and of the world at large\nwith great joy.\nThe realization of Deng Xiaoping\u2019s concept of \u201cone\ncountry, two systems\u201d in Hong Kong carries profound\nsignificance. Firmly adhering to this concept, we will\nkeep up the peaceful reunification of our motherland by\nensuring a smooth return of Macao and eventually\nresolving the Taiwan question. Taiwan is an inalienable\npart of Chinese territory, and the Taiwan question is\npurely an internal affair of China. Any country that\nattempts to use the Taiwan question to put pressure on\nChina or even clamours for \u201ctwo Chinas\u201d or \u201cone China,\none Taiwan\u201d has acted in total contravention of the\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and\nthe relevant General Assembly resolutions. Such\nbehaviour will be absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese\npeople, as well as to all the countries upholding justice in\nthe world.\nAs the international situation continues to undergo\nprofound changes, peace and development have become\nthe main themes of our times. The world is evolving\ntowards multipolarity with growing diversity in countries\u2019\npolitical, economic and cultural lives. This trend has\nbecome an irresistible tide of history.\nThe two world wars in the first half of the twentieth\ncentury plunged mankind into unprecedented havoc. And\nthe cold war, which lasted for more than four decades in\nthe latter half of our century, kept humanity in the dark\nshadow of war. Reviewing the past and looking to the\nfuture, people throughout the world are anxiously waiting\nfor the establishment of a just and equitable new\ninternational political and economic order, and they are\nhoping to see lasting peace and prosperity for all in the\ncoming century.\nThe cold-war security regime that featured military\nalliances and the arms race is, as has been proved,\nincapable of making peace. Expanding military blocs and\nenhancing military alliances under new circumstances can\ndo little to bring about greater security. Relations between\nStates should be based on the five principles of mutual\nrespect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual\nnon-aggression, non-interference in each other\u2019s internal\naffairs, equality and mutual benefit and peaceful\ncoexistence. Each country has the right to choose a road\nof development according to its own national conditions,\nand no country should interfere in the internal affairs of\nother countries on whatever grounds. This must serve as\nthe political prerequisite for global and regional security.\n16\n\n\nAll countries should increase their mutually beneficial\ncooperation in the economic field, eliminate unequal\npractices in trade and economic relations, and do away with\ndiscriminatory policies with a view to gradually narrowing\nthe gap between the rich and the poor and achieving\ncommon prosperity. This should serve as the economic\nfoundation for global and regional security.\nAll countries should step up consultation and\ncooperation in the security field, increase mutual\nunderstanding and trust, and undertake to settle through\npeaceful means, whatever differences and disputes they may\nhave. This is the practical way to achieve global and\nregional security.\nIn the first half of the year, five countries \u2014 China,\nRussia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan \u2014 signed\nthe agreement on mutual reduction of military forces in the\nborder areas; the four-party talks aimed at bringing about a\nnew peace mechanism on the Korean peninsula were\nlaunched; and the Regional Forum of the Association of\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) introduced a\npreliminary form of cooperation on security issues featuring\nequal participation and negotiated consensus. These are\nsome of the examples of searching for new models of\nsecurity cooperation and of the initial progress already\nmade.\nWe feel concerned about the recent setbacks in the\nMiddle East peace process. We are of the view that the\nrelevant United Nations resolutions should be complied\nwith, agreements reached among the parties concerned in\nthe peace process should be honoured, the principle of land\nfor peace should be adhered to, and terrorist activities\nshould stop. We hope that the parties concerned will work\ntogether on that basis so that the Madrid Peace Conference\non peace in the Middle East will resume at an early date.\nWe are also deeply concerned about the incessant conflicts\nand turmoil which have plagued Africa since the beginning\nof this year, and wish the African countries steady progress\nalong the road of peace and development.\nThe past year has seen new progress in the field of\ninternational arms control and disarmament. The Chemical\nWeapons Convention has entered into force; the Preparatory\nCommittee of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\nhas started its work; the extent of nuclear-weapon-free\nzones is increasing; and negotiations on the efficacy of the\nBiological Weapons Convention have made further\nheadway.\nIn our view, no one should try to monopolize the\nmarket in the name of preventing proliferation or try to\ninterfere in the economic and technological cooperation of\nother countries, developing countries in particular. An\noverhaul of the discriminatory and exclusive\nnon-proliferation regimes and arrangements is thus\nnecessary, on the basis of universal participation, and the\nUnited Nations should see to it that it accomplishes\nsomething in this regard.\nWe maintain that continued efforts should be made\nto advance the process of multilateral arms control and\ndisarmament. The universality of international arms-\ncontrol treaties should be strengthened and complete\nadherence to them ensured. Instead of weakening and\nundermining security, arms-control and disarmament\nefforts should reinforce it. The target of disarmament\nshould not be shifted to developing countries, as countries\nwith the largest and most sophisticated arsenals bear a\nspecial responsibility for disarmament.\nI would also like to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention\nto China\u2019s recent announcement of a unilateral step of\ndisarmament \u2014 that is, having reduced its troop strength\nby 1 million in the 1980s, China will further reduce its\nmilitary by 500,000 troops within the next three years.\nThis is a move of major significance in the field of\ndisarmament.\nIn the past year, the overall situation of the world\neconomy has been good. Economic links and mutual\npenetration among countries and regions are on the\nconstant increase. The importance of international\ncooperation should be given a fresh evaluation with a\nview to making it broader, closer and more fruitful.\nDeveloping countries are most vulnerable to the\nimpact of adverse environmental conditions because of\ntheir weak economic foundations. At present, the\ninternational financial market is highly globalized and\nvery risky. We should work to stabilize the financial\nmarket and ensure steady economic growth of the\ndeveloping countries.\nThe Uruguay Round agreements should be\nimplemented in a comprehensive, faithful and balanced\nmanner, and attempts to impose a linkage between\nenvironmental or labour standards and trade must be\nopposed.\nEnvironment and development pose a common\nchallenge to mankind. The United Nations has held two\n17\n\n\nimportant conferences in the 1990s, setting forth a set of\nguiding principles for the solution of the issue. We hope the\ninternational community, developed countries in particular,\nwill honour its pledges to provide funds and transfer\ntechnology to the developing countries so as to translate the\ndeclaration of partnership into real action.\nMany transboundary issues, such as poverty,\nunemployment, refugees, drugs and crime, need to be\naddressed through consultation by the international\ncommunity. The work of the United Nations in the social\nfield needs to be strengthened. All countries should, in\nkeeping with the principles of mutual respect, equality and\nmutual benefit, endeavour to promote international\ncooperation. They should get down to practical tasks, the\nfirst of which is to help developing countries deal with their\nmost urgent difficulties. We hope that the special session of\nthe General Assembly on international drug control,\nscheduled for next year, will yield positive results by\nformulating a cross-century strategy for combating drug-\nrelated crimes through strengthened international\ncooperation along with effective measures of\nimplementation.\nChina will continue to support the United Nations in\nits work in the social field and will make a greater\ncontribution to social progress around the world.\nThe realization of human rights is the common ideal\nof mankind. All countries have made great efforts to this\nend, with both achievements and lessons. We maintain that\nthe universality of human rights should be respected; yet\ntheir realization must be integrated with the conditions of\neach country. A review of United Nations practice over the\npast 50 years and more shows that when countries or\nregions do this they will enjoy social stability, economic\ndevelopment and popular contentment. When they do not,\nsociety will face disintegration, with people losing their\nmost basic human rights and freedoms, and gross violations\nof human rights will even take place when chaos erupts as\na result of war.\nWe say it is quite natural for people to differ on the\nhuman rights issue. The question is how to deal with these\ndifferences. Which is the better approach: dialogue or\nconfrontation? I opt for dialogue. Only dialogue can\nenhance mutual understanding and cooperation.\nConfrontation, on the other hand, can only lead to further\nestrangement and do nobody any good. We are pleased to\nsee that more and more countries are in favour of dialogue\nin handling the human rights issue.\nThe Chinese Government attaches importance to\nhuman rights and is dedicated to promoting and protecting\nhuman rights of its people. Having repeatedly suffered\nfrom foreign aggression in the past, the Chinese people\nknow full well how state sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity fundamentally guarantee the realization of their\nhuman rights. We in China \u2014 taking upon ourselves the\ntask of feeding, clothing, sheltering and educating, and\nproviding travel facilities to, our 1.2 billion people \u2014\nknow full well how vitally important our right to\nsubsistence and our right to development are. To enable\nour people to lead a freer, happier and more democratic\nlife, we are focusing above all on the development of our\neconomy and on advancing democracy and our legal\nsystem.\nChina will soon sign the International Covenant on\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights and is studying\nearnestly the International Covenant on Civil and Political\nRights. We stand ready to work with other countries in a\ncontinued effort to promote cooperation in the\ninternational human rights field.\nAs the most important intergovernmental\norganization in the world, the United Nations occupies an\nirreplaceable position in international life. At the same\ntime, an evolving situation calls for reform of the United\nNations.\nLast July, Secretary-General Kofi Annan submitted\nan extensive report on the reform of the United Nations.\nWe appreciate his effort.\nWe are in favour of reforming the United Nations.\nThe purpose of such reform is to strengthen the role of\nthe United Nations and enhance its efficiency. Measures\ntaken in this regard must reflect the common interests of\nall Member States and the results must be able to stand\nthe test of time. To this end, we offer the following\nviews.\nUnited Nations reform is the shared cause of all\nMember States. It should allow full play to democracy,\nheed the voices of all sides and take into account the\ninterests of various parties. The reform plan should be\nwidely acceptable to Member States.\nTo enhance efficiency, an appropriate reduction of\npersonnel and expenditure is necessary. What is\nimportant, however, is for the reform to put greater\nemphasis on development issues with a view to\n18\n\n\nstrengthening rather than weakening the United Nations role\nin the promotion of economic and social development.\nThe reform should help preserve the diversity in the\nUnited Nations, which is a microcosm of the diversity of\nthe world. Only when world diversity is recognized and\nrespected can different countries live in harmony and make\nprogress together.\nThe reform should stress practical results, place value\non quality, and progress in an incremental manner.\nThe enlargement of the Security Council should follow\nthe principle of equitable geographical distribution and\nensure a proper balance between developing and developed\ncountries. The Security Council will better perform the lofty\nmission entrusted to it under the United Nations Charter\nonly when it becomes more broadly representative.\nPayment of assessed dues is the bounden duty of\nevery Member State under the Charter of the United\nNations. We urge the countries concerned to pay off their\narrears without conditions and as early as possible in order\nto put the United Nations on a sound financial basis for\nnormal operation.\nCountries around the world need the United Nations.\nSo does the United Nations need their support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to congratulate you, Sir, on behalf\nof my country, Guinea-Bissau, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly and to reiterate our\nconfidence in your ability to conduct the work of this\nsession successfully. You can rest assured of the\nwillingness of the delegation of Guinea-Bissau to cooperate\nwith you.\nI should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to\nyour predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia,\nfor the innovative and constructive manner in which he\ncarried out his task.\nCongratulations are also due the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, who, since his assumption of the\nOrganization\u2019s highest office, has shouldered his important\nresponsibilities with great resolve, inter alia with regard to\nUnited Nations reform. We encourage him to continue his\nwork with the same dynamic spirit in order better to adapt\nour Organization to the current and future needs of a\nworld in flux.\nThe General Assembly is meeting at a time when the\nOrganization is going through a period of complex\ntransition that has brought several questions to the fore.\nGuinea-Bissau is nevertheless convinced of the ability of\nthe Organization and of Member States to define new\npolicies and to develop suitable structures to deal with the\nnew challenges that are being posed by international\nproblems.\nDuring the observance of the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe United Nations the leaders of the entire world\nsolemnly reaffirmed the irreplaceable nature of the\nOrganization\u2019s role as well as the need to reform and\nmodernize the United Nations. The historic Declaration\nadopted at that time should continue to form the basis of\nthe Organization\u2019s work, laying down as it does a\nframework for global action based on the principles and\nideals of the Charter.\nAccordingly, we welcome the important initiatives\nfor reform taken by the Secretary-General, which in my\ndelegation\u2019s view are deserving of the support of Member\nStates.\nMy delegation believes that the expansion and\ndemocratization of the Security Council are also priority\nmatters. That important body must reflect, both in its\ncomposition and in its decisions, the concerns of all\nMembers and should have a more transparent basis and\na more equitable geographical representation.\n\n\nTherefore, in keeping with the Harare Declaration of\nHeads of State and Government of the countries members\nof the Organization of African Unity (OAU), we believe\nthat Africa should have two permanent seats in the Security\nCouncil, with the same privileges as the current members.\nSimilarly, we believe that the candidacies of Japan,\nGermany and Brazil to be permanent members of the\nSecurity Council deserve the serious attention of Guinea-\nBissau, without prejudice to other proposals before us for\nconsideration.\nThe United Nations has played a decisive role in\ninternational affairs since its founding. However, the\nchallenges we are facing at the threshold of the twenty-first\ncentury are unprecedented and call for greater efforts from\nthe Organization and all its Members, particularly in\nseeking the solution to financial problems, a sine qua non\nfor effective progress in the reform process.\nDespite the Organization\u2019s commitment to\ninternational peace and security, conflicts and fratricidal\nwars continue in various parts of the world, causing loss of\nlife, massive displacements of population and floods of\nrefugees. Africa, unfortunately, continues to furnish tragic\nexamples of such scourges. The seriousness of these crises\non our continent prompted the Security Council to devote\na ministerial meeting to such problems on 25 September of\nthis year in an effort to analyse their causes and propose\nsuitable solutions.\nIn addition to conflicts in Angola, Burundi, Rwanda\nand Somalia, there are new tensions and crises in Sierra\nLeone, the Republic of the Congo and the Central African\nRepublic.\nIn respect to Angola, a country with which Guinea-\nBissau enjoys a relationship of deep friendship, we\nwelcome the progress made there towards restoring peace\nand achieving national reconciliation, and we encourage\nUNITA to make the efforts necessary to bring to\ncompletion the tasks set forth in the Lusaka Protocol.\nIn Burundi, the Republic of the Congo, the Central\nAfrican Republic and Somalia dialogue must prevail in the\nsearch for solutions to the problems that affect those\ncountries.\nIn Sierra Leone, the United Nations \u2014 the Security\nCouncil in particular \u2014 must support the efforts of the\nEconomic Community of West African States and OAU to\nrestore the democratically elected Government.\nIn Liberia, we welcome the holding of free and fair\nelections and the return to peace. We urge the\ninternational community to continue to provide aid for\nreconstruction and the consolidation of peace and\ndemocracy in that country.\nTurning to Western Sahara, Guinea-Bissau welcomes\nthe recent agreement concluded between the various\nparties and hopes that this new understanding will lead to\na definitive solution to this question through the holding\nof a referendum on self-determination.\nThe sanctions imposed on Libya by the Security\nCouncil in 1992 seriously affect innocent people. Guinea-\nBissau encourages the parties concerned to seek, through\nnegotiations, a just solution to that question. The joint\nproposals of OAU and the League of Arab States merit\nthe attention of the international community.\nRecent events in the Middle East have weakened the\npeace process. We urge the State of Israel and the\nPalestinian Authority to continue their dialogue to restore\na climate of confidence, which is so essential to the\nestablishment of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\nin the region.\nWe are also concerned at the slow pace of the\nimplementation of the peace agreement in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, and we appeal to the various parties to show\ngreater determination to resolve the conflict.\nIn East Timor, we continue to support the\nnegotiations conducted under the auspices of the\nSecretary-General to find a just and definitive solution to\nthis question.\nThe embargo imposed on Cuba continues seriously\nto affect that country\u2019s people and development process.\nWe appeal to the parties to take the necessary steps\ntowards a definitive and satisfactory solution to this\nproblem.\nOn behalf of our Government, we should also like\nto reiterate our conviction that the Republic of China on\nTaiwan deserves to regain its rightful place in the United\nNations on the basis of respect for the principle of\nuniversality and the sovereign equality of States. The\nRepublic of China on Taiwan, a democratic country of\nover 20 million people that has made enormous progress\nin the economic and social field and with regard to\nrespect for basic human rights, is today a reality that\ncannot be ignored. The readmission of the Republic of\n2\n\n\nChina to the United Nations and to all its specialized\nagencies would be an important factor for peace, stability\nand international cooperation.\nMindful of the fact that the United Nations, and the\nSecurity Council in particular, play an essential role in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, we attach\nspecial importance to regional bodies with respect to\nconflict prevention and resolution.\nIn our subregion, the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States has, with unprecedented success, been\nmanaging the crisis in Liberia through the establishment\nand deployment of the ECOWAS Monitoring Group. The\nsteps undertaken through the Mechanism for Conflict\nPrevention, Management and Resolution of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) deserve special\nmention. Given the magnitude and complexity of the\nproblems to be resolved, that organ needs increased support\nfrom the international community to complete its mission.\nIn this context, we believe that any approach to\nstrengthening the capacities of African countries to prevent,\nmanage and resolve conflicts must be supported. Thus, we\nwelcome with interest the joint initiative of the United\nStates, France and Great Britain in this area under the aegis\nof OAU.\nGuinea-Bissau welcomes the adoption in Oslo of a\ndraft convention for the complete elimination of anti-\npersonnel landmines and urges all countries to accede to it\nso that it may enter into force as soon as possible.\nThe intolerable persistence of poverty in the world,\nparticularly in Africa, requires the ongoing mobilization of\nthe international community and the elaboration within\ninternational bodies of coherent policies to confront the\nmajor problems of development. Given the fact that Africa\nhas more least developed countries than any other continent\nin the world, the General Assembly\u2019s recent adoption of the\nAgenda for Development is of the greatest interest to us.\nAfrica continues to suffer the negative effects of the\nproblems of external debt, deteriorating terms of trade,\ndifficult access for its products to international markets and\ndecreased investment. Moreover, the effects of the\nglobalization of the economy and the drop in official\ndevelopment assistance have reduced the capacity of\nAfrican countries to tackle socio-economic problems\nsuccessfully. The initiatives of the Paris Club, the World\nBank and the International Monetary Fund to provide debt\nrelief \u2014 initiatives that have already benefited some\nAfrican countries \u2014 meet our concerns and we hope that\nGuinea-Bissau will soon be able to profit by them.\nRespect for and the full exercise of fundamental\nhuman rights are factors for freedom, peace and\nguaranteed internal stability. Guinea-Bissau, which\nrecognizes the importance of good governance, pluralistic\ndemocracy and a state of law, continues to work for the\npreservation of values intrinsic to the dignity of the\nindividual and his full, harmonious development. In this\nregard, we wish to congratulate Mrs. Mary Robinson on\nher timely nomination to the post of United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights. We wish her every\nsuccess in the performance of her duties and call on all\nMember States to lend her the support she needs.\nThe rational use of our world\u2019s natural resources and\nenvironmental protection are responsibilities which, to\nvarying degrees, fall to all mankind. Guinea-Bissau has,\ntogether with its partners, defined a strategy for\nsustainable development that respects ecological balances.\nThe disappointing results of the review of the\nimplementation of Agenda 21 at last June\u2019s special\nsession of the General Assembly is clear proof that the\ninternational community must be much more committed\nto defining agreed policies for environmental protection.\nThe achievement of the ideals of the United Nations\nto which our peoples aspire, the need to reform and\nmodernize our Organization, and international cooperative\nefforts are all the subjects of our collective thinking and\nthe inspiration of our ongoing commitment. Indeed, given\nthe challenges of the late twentieth century, our\nOrganization continues to embody the greatest hopes of\nour peoples for a future of progress, well-being, social\njustice and understanding among all peoples.\nAs Mr. Jo\u00e3o Bernardo Vieira, President of the\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau, said during the celebration of\nthe United Nations fiftieth anniversary:\n\u201cI would call for greater ... coordination of our\nefforts in order to forge a world Organization\ncapable of preserving future generations from the\nscourge of war and to give the poorest and most\nhelpless true reasons for hope, thus safeguarding the\ncommon interests of mankind.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like, first of all,\non behalf of the Bulgarian delegation to congratulate\nMr. Udovenko on his election to the presidency of the fifty-\nsecond session of the General Assembly. His vast\nexperience and knowledge will be of great importance for\nthe successful fulfilment of the tasks facing the\nOrganization today. I would also like to express our\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Razali Ismail, for his\ncompetence in presiding over the fifty-first session.\nThe statements of previous speakers have proved the\nimportance of the necessity for an efficient overall reform\nof the United Nations. I would like to declare Bulgaria s\nsupport for the position of the European Union, as stated in\nthis general debate by the Deputy Prime Minister and\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, Mr. Jacques\nPoos.\nThe word \u201creform\u201d has been used so much today in\ndifferent parts of the world that I would be afraid of\nclassifying United Nations reform with the various other\nreforms advocated by numerous politicians. If I take the\nliberty of sharing the Bulgarian experience, it is because\nin early 1997 my country lived through its genuine\nreformist resurrection. Hundreds of thousands of citizens\nwalked in the streets of Sofia and other Bulgarian cities\nand towns to demand opportunities, not well-being. Their\nvoice precipitated early parliamentary elections and\nbrought a disastrous rule to an end.\nObviously, three things are needed for the success of\nreform: vision, strategy and courage. The vision about\nwhere we want to go, the strategy for getting there and\nthe courage to begin.\nI hope that the fifty-second session of the General\nAssembly will be remembered for decisive progress in\ndesigning and carrying out the reform of the United\nNations. We have already heard the profound analysis and\nthe valuable proposals put forward in the report of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan. It is now the turn of\nthe representatives of Member States to commit their\nvision, sense of strategy and courage.\nLet me briefly present our views on the main aspects\nof the reform of the United Nations. The Bulgarian\nGovernment has thoroughly studied the proposals and the\nreport of the Secretary-General. In principle, we support\nand approve of these proposals.\nThe Republic of Bulgaria considers the ongoing\ndiscussion within the United Nations on the reform and\nenlargement of the Security Council to be positive and\nsubstantive. In our view, the decisions on these important\nmatters should be reached by consensus. We believe that\nthe enlargement should reflect the increased number of\nUnited Nations Member States. On the other hand, the\ngrowing economic and political potential of some\nMember States may attest to their ability and maturity to\nsuccessfully assume the responsibilities and meet the\nchallenges of permanent members of the Security\nCouncil.\nA fair decision on the enlargement of the Council\nshould preserve the balance between the permanent and\nnon-permanent members, as well as among the regional\ngroups. Such a decision should also include the allocation\nof an additional non-permanent seat for the Group of\nEastern European States.\nWe support the efforts aimed at further improving\nthe early warning system of the Organization. The new\nchallenges to international peace and security demand an\n25\n\n\nenhanced role for United Nations peacekeeping operations.\nAs an active participant in United Nations peacekeeping\noperations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia,\nTajikistan and elsewhere, Bulgaria welcomes the growing\nefficiency of the Security Council and also supports an\nenhanced role for the Secretary-General in the field of\npreventive diplomacy.\nBulgaria shares the view that future peacekeeping\noperations should encompass the whole complex of\npolitical, humanitarian and military aspects of peacekeeping\nin order to achieve maximum efficiency. Close cooperation\nwith the regional security organizations and other relevant\nbodies is of key importance to the success of future United\nNations peacekeeping efforts as well.\nFor years now the United Nations has been operating\nunder the burden of a serious financial crisis. Bulgaria\nsupports the initiatives contained in the report of the\nSecretary-General aimed at elaborating criteria and\nmechanisms for stringent financial discipline, strict control\nand accountability. Such an approach could contribute to\nthe successful implementation of the administrative reform\nand reorganization of the Secretariat.\nWe believe that a new scale of assessments for\ncontributions to the United Nations regular and\npeacekeeping budgets would allow greater account to be\ntaken of the financial potential of individual Member States.\nBulgaria shares the ideas expressed by the Secretary-\nGeneral that the reform should be implemented within the\nframework of a complex approach that would not neglect\nthe specific needs of the countries in transition and the\nsmaller States.\nWe support the efforts aimed at restructuring the\ngoverning institutions of the United Nations in the socio-\neconomic field; at raising the operational capacity of the\nEconomic and Social Council and of the specialized funds\nand programmes; and at transferring funds from\nmanagement and administration to social and economic\nprogrammes.\nAs Assembly members are probably aware, 1997 was\na difficult but successful year for Bulgaria. The beginning\nof the year was marked by an acute economic, financial and\npolitical crisis, which resulted in the appointment of a\ncaretaker government, the dissolution of the Bulgarian\nParliament and early elections. At the same time, the\ncivilized, peaceful and constitutional way in which\nBulgarian society overcame the political crisis is a very\nimportant sign of the maturity of democracy in the country.\nAt the elections held last April the Union of\nDemocratic Forces won an overwhelming majority for\ntheir agenda: financial stabilization, market-oriented\nstructural economic reform and speedy privatization; the\nstrengthening and modernizing of State administration;\nrule of law and combating organized crime and\ncorruption; and the integration of Bulgaria into the Euro-\nAtlantic community of nations.\nWe have made every effort to implement this\nstrategy, and today we already have the first positive\nresults. In the political sphere, the transition to the rule of\nlaw, political pluralism and respect for fundamental\nhuman rights and freedoms has been completed. The\ndemocratic institutions are stable and enjoy the broad\nsupport of more than 50 per cent of the people. In the\neconomic sphere, a currency board was successfully\nintroduced as a means of guaranteeing financial\nstabilization and of restoring the confidence of the\ninternational financial institutions and business circles in\nBulgaria. This has resulted in a radical decrease of the\ninflation rate and an increase in foreign investment and\nthe country s currency reserves. The results of the\ncrackdown on crime and corruption have re-established\nrespect for law and order.\nHere I would like to point out that Bulgaria attaches\ngreat importance to the concerted efforts of the world\ncommunity in the fight against organized crime and\nterrorism. We look forward to contributing to the efforts\nto elaborate the future international convention for the\nsuppression of terrorist bombings and for the drafting of\na widely accepted text of the statute of the international\ncriminal court.\nWe are also committed to draft regional programmes\nfor preventing organized crime, international terrorism,\nillicit drugs and arms trafficking, illicit trade in nuclear\nmaterials and the trafficking of people.\nThe desire of the Bulgarian Government to join the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the\nEuropean Union underlies our foreign policy and is\noverwhelmingly supported by the Bulgarian nation. For\nus, accession to these institutions is an expression of the\nEuropean identity of Bulgaria and an integral element of\nthe political and economic transformation of the country.\nIt is a question of immediate national interest and\nstrategic priority, a matter of choice of civilization; and\nnot an issue of politics of the day.\n26\n\n\nBulgaria considers the decisions reached at the NATO\nSummit in Madrid as a historic opening of the alliance to\nthe new European democracies. We feel strongly that the\nenlargement should continue as a geographically balanced\nprocess aimed at achieving equal security and stability in\ndifferent regions; thus the risks of new dividing lines or\ngrey zones in Europe would be avoided.\nOur Government is making great efforts to intensify\nits preparations for accession to the European Union, with\na view to meeting the requirements for membership in the\nnearest possible future. We strongly hope for a political\ndecision by the European Union to start the negotiations\nwith all associated countries at the beginning of 1998. This\nwould be a confirmation of the position that all candidate\ncountries have equal chances of becoming members.\nBulgaria considers these integration processes as a\nsignificant contribution to the strengthening of regional\nstability and security in south-eastern Europe. The\nBulgarian Government is making every effort to promote\nEuropean standards of international conduct in this part of\nthe continent. Our approach has been backed by a number\nof important initiatives at the regional level. The\ncooperation between NATO members and partner countries\nin the area is an important element in this process, and\nBulgaria has advanced ideas for an enhanced Euro-Atlantic\ncooperation on the security of south-eastern Europe and the\nBlack Sea.\nBulgaria will also continue to work actively along the\nlines of its 1996 initiative for security, stability and\ncooperation in south-eastern Europe. We attach great\nimportance to the coordination of our efforts with the other\ninitiatives for cooperation in the region, especially with the\nRoyaumont process launched by the European Union and\nthe South-east European Cooperative Initiative, sponsored\nby the United States.\nOur aspiration to non-permanent membership of the\nSecurity Council for the 2002-2003 period demonstrates our\nreadiness to assume responsibilities for peace and security\nboth in the region and in a wider international context.\nAs members know, Bulgaria has suffered tremendous\nlosses as a result of the strict implementation of the\nsanctions imposed by the Security Council against the\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).\nCombined with the disadvantages caused by the sanctions\nagainst Libya and Iraq, the total amount of the direct and\nindirect costs to Bulgaria is comparable to the country s\nforeign debt. Therefore, the Republic of Bulgaria will\ncontinue to attach particular importance to the work being\ndone within the United Nations system to address more\neffectively problems related to the implementation of\nArticle 50 of the Charter.\nWe welcome the provisions of the General Assembly\nresolutions urging the organizations within the United\nNations system, international financial institutions and\nother international bodies to continue to address more\nspecifically and directly the issue of economic assistance\nto third States affected by the implementation of the\nsanctions. I should like to draw the Assembly s attention\nto the possibility of granting certain exemptions from\nsanctions or creating a preferential regime for the most\ngravely affected third States. Naturally, these exemptions\nand preferences should be in accordance with the Charter.\nWe believe that the burden of the specific economic\nproblems created by the sanctions should be fairly\ndistributed among all third countries and not borne by\nneighbouring States only.\nWe strongly believe that while negotiating with\nsanction-affected third countries, the international\nfinancial institutions should take account of the need to\ncompensate them indirectly.\nIt is our understanding that the United Nations\nspecialized agencies play an important role and provide\nvaluable support to countries in their efforts to achieve\nsustainable development. The reforms which are under\nway in these agencies need the support of the Member\nStates. The reform processes in the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the United Nations\nIndustrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and other\norganizations give us hope of success.\nBulgaria believes that the activities of international\nforums and bodies for human rights should be aimed at\nensuring the effective exercise of these rights by every\nhuman being. The implementation of international\nstandards could be achieved by improving existing\nmechanisms and by a constructive and open dialogue on\nthe most sensitive issues. This approach is not directed a\npriori against any country or group of countries. In this\ncontext, Bulgaria attaches high importance to the\nguarantees for the human rights of Bulgarians living\nabroad and is closely watching the situation of Bulgarian\nminorities. We consider respect for the rights of\nBulgarians in neighbouring States and the related\nimplementation of international human rights standards as\nan important factor in the promotion of bilateral relations.\n27\n\n\nThe monitoring and the effective control of the\nimplementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms\nremains of critical importance, and Bulgaria reiterates its\nsupport for the efforts of the High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights. I should like at this point to welcome the\nappointment of Ms. Mary Robinson to this high post and to\nwish her every success in her activities.\nThe Bulgarian Government regards the possible spread\nof weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery\nas one of the major concerns of the 1990s. The existing\nregimes of multilateral treaties, such as the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Chemical\nWeapons Convention and the Biological Weapons\nConvention, provide for basic restrictive norms in this field.\nThe Republic of Bulgaria supports all international\nendeavours to meet the goals of non-proliferation and\nstands for a further strengthening of these regimes.\nThe Conference on Disarmament is an appropriate\nforum for negotiations on the elimination of certain types\nof conventional weapons. A long-lasting solution should be\nfound to the problem of anti-personnel landmines, the ban\non which has humanitarian and disarmament aspects and\nneeds a verification regime. We believe that the text of a\nnew Convention that would ultimately ban all anti-\npersonnel landmines, which was agreed at the Oslo\nDiplomatic Conference this month, could well serve as a\nbasis for achieving a comprehensive and widely accepted\ninternational agreement. We also hope that the Ottawa\nprocess and the negotiations in the Conference on\nDisarmament will be mutually supportive and will result in\nan effective ban on anti-personnel landmines.\nIn conclusion, finding an adequate solution to these\nproblems will be impossible without the successful reform\nand restructuring of the United Nations Organization and of\nall its bodies. Therefore, we expect a decisive breakthrough\nin this direction at the present session of the General\nAssembly. I am personally convinced that by the end of\nthis session the United Nations will have changed, and that\nthis change will be for the better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe inhabit a modern\nworld in which we must accept change as the normal\ncondition of life. Communication around the globe is\nbecoming faster. The distance between our countries is\nbecoming shorter. I travelled to New York at twice the\nspeed of sound and I landed before I took off. Every word\nI say to the Assembly today will be sent to London down\na telephone line and within minutes it will appear on the\nWorld Wide Web.\nOur countries today are intertwined as never before in\na market place that is global. And our people have learned\nthat their purchasing decisions have an impact on jobs and\npay across the planet \u2014 from the fruit they buy at the\nsupermarket to the fuel they use in their cars. Changes to\nthe environment in one continent can produce changes to\nthe weather in another continent. Our countries are\nincreasingly interdependent, and the challenges we each\nface are global challenges \u2014 challenges that we must face\ntogether: poverty, conflict, climate change, international\ncrime and the drugs menace. These are all international\nproblems that require us to behave as a united nations not\njust in name but in reality.\nAnd so the United Nations should have a bigger role\nthan ever before. If it appears to be less relevant, it is not\nfor want of challenge but for want of reform. The United\nNations must modernize. It must be able to confront the\nnew global challenges that all its Members face. It will\nneed flexibility, competence and efficiency to meet the\ncomplex needs of the twenty-first century because the\nUnited Nations cannot give leadership to a changing\nworld if we ourselves refuse to change.\nThe outstanding leadership shown by the Secretary-\nGeneral is an important start. His proposals for\ninstitutional reform will retain what is best in the United\nNations system but give it the flexibility and the\nefficiency it needs to respond rapidly to the new\nchallenges of a new century. The member countries of the\nUnited Nations must support his commitment to\nmodernization. We must each stop measuring each\nproposal for reform in terms of narrow self-interest and,\ninstead, recognize that we all have a greater interest in\nsupporting reform.\nBritain\u2019s Labour Government is firmly committed to\nthe United Nations. We demonstrated this commitment as\nsoon as we were elected by rejoining the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n(UNESCO) and by confirming our intention to stay in the\nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization\n(UNIDO). We were elected because we offered Britain\nmodernization to succeed in a new century. We pledge\nourselves to back modernization of the United Nations.\nWe do so because we know that our country, like all\nother Member States, will benefit from a United Nations\nthat is efficient, representative and properly funded.\nLet me take each of those in turn. Efficient does not\nspell cheap. But we do want to see the United Nations do\nthe most it can with what it has got \u2014 a United Nations\nthat no longer spends $150 million producing 2,500 tons\nof documents every year. We thoroughly welcome the\nSecretary-General\u2019s commitment to reduce the number of\ndocuments by 25 per cent by next year. We want to see\nan end to the duplication between United Nations\nagencies, and I give my wholehearted support to the\nSecretary-General\u2019s proposal for a Special Commission to\nlook at the division of labour right across the United\nNations system.\n15\n\n\nAnother way in which the United Nations is out of\ndate is its Security Council. We are all agreed in this\nChamber that what was appropriate in 1945 is not what is\nright in 1997. The world has changed. Most of the\ncountries represented here today did not even exist when\nthe United Nations was formed. The Security Council must\nmove on if it is not to lose its legitimacy. Japan and\nGermany should both be included in an expanded\npermanent membership, and there should be a new balance\nbetween developed and developing countries in a\nmodernized Security Council. We are all agreed on the\nneed for change; we have been discussing it for four years.\nIt is time that we agreed that a proposal for change which\nhas the backing of the vast majority of Members is better\nthan a status quo which has the backing of none.\nIt is not just all the countries of the United Nations\nthat must be properly represented, but all the people of\nthose countries. More than half those people are women.\nBritain welcomes the United Nations willingness to put\ngender perspective into all areas of its work. The new\nLabour Government attaches particular importance to\nstrengthening the rights of women. Women do more than\nhalf the world\u2019s work. They should have equal status in the\ninternational organizations of the world.\nLet us also put the United Nations finances on a sound\nbasis. Speaker after speaker yesterday referred to the need\nfor us to cooperate to defeat those who make fortunes from\norganized crime and to contain the drugs trade, second only\nin value to the oil trade. We cannot defeat those well-\nresourced menaces to the modern world through a United\nNations that staggers from year to year on the verge of\nbankruptcy.\nWe need a solution based on the ability to pay. The\nmost equitable means of sharing the burden is to base\ncontributions on share of global gross national product. But\nthat measure will only be accepted as equitable if it is\nupdated regularly to reflect the rapid changes to the world\neconomy. And it is not equitable that some Members pay\ntheir contributions while other Members do not. Britain\npays in full and on time. Britain expects every Member\nState, however large or however small, to do the same.\nThese three issues \u2014 institutional reform, Security\nCouncil reform and financial reform \u2014 are critical to the\nUnited Nations future. Let us commit ourselves to progress\non all these issues by the end of 1997 and solutions by this\ntime next year. Next time we meet, let us celebrate a\nmodern United Nations that can face the future with\nconfidence, rather than looking back on another year of\nagreeing about all the questions but not being able to\nagree on any of the answers. And then the United Nations\nwill be able to get on with its job.\nThere are three key areas in which the United\nNations has a vital job to do \u2014 promoting sustainable\ndevelopment, promoting peace and promoting human\nrights. Those are not separate challenges, but different\nfaces of the same challenge. There can be no real and\nsustainable development or respect for human rights\nwithout peace. And there will be no permanent peace\nwhere there is only poverty and injustice.\nDuring every speech this week another 300 children\nwill die before their first birthday, most of them deaths\nthat could be easily and cheaply prevented. If the United\nNations is to be relevant to its Members, then more than\nanything else it must enable people to lift themselves out\nof poverty.\nBritain supports the United Nations aid target. As\nBritain\u2019s contribution to achieving it, the mew Labour\nGovernments has committed itself to reversing the decline\nin the British aid budget. Britain has also consistently\nurged faster action in tackling the problem of debt, and at\nthe Commonwealth Finance Ministers meeting in\nMauritius last week, British Chancellor Gordon Brown\nlaunched a new initiative to cut debt that will benefit 300\nmillion of the world\u2019s poorest people and help developing\ncountries escape from the debt trap.\nBut aid will not alone eliminate poverty. We need to\ncontinue breaking down the barriers that deny the poorest\ncountries access to the world\u2019s most lucrative markets.\nWe need to make sure that producers in Africa are\nallowed to sell their goods to Europe and to America as\neasily as their producers can sell their goods to Africa.\nSustainable development will do more than just\nreduce poverty. Poverty is also one of the greatest threats\nto the environment. If we want to preserve the planet for\nfuture generations, we must make sure that development\nrespects the environment and does not destroy it. The\nUnited Nations Commission on Sustainable Development\nhas made important progress towards this goal. But it is\nnot a task any country can subcontract to the United\nNations. We are all in this together. No country can opt\nout of global warming or fence in its own private climate.\nWe need common action to save our common\nenvironment.\n16\n\n\nThe new Labour Government has set itself the\nambitious target of reducing Britain\u2019s emissions of\ngreenhouse gases by 20 per cent by the year 2010. At the\nthird session of the Conference of the Parties to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in\nKyoto, the nations of the world must sign up to binding\ntargets and then they must keep to them.\nThe second key goal is peace \u2014 preventing conflicts\nbefore they happen, helping to end them when they do\nhappen and helping to rebuild lasting peace after conflict.\nEach of these contributions to peace is equally vital.\nBut it is the United Nations peacekeeping operations\nthat have the highest profile, and with good reason. The\nblue berets have prevented worse conflict across the world,\nfrom Eastern Slavonia to the Western Sahara. Many have\nlaid down their lives, not in the conduct of war but in the\npursuit of peace. The death of a dozen international\npolicemen and envoys, among them a British diplomat, in\nthe United Nations helicopter that crashed in Bosnia last\nweek, was a grim reminder of the risks we ask our peace-\nbuilders to take. I pay tribute to their courage and salute\nthem for their professionalism and their skill.\nThe last area in which the United Nations must focus\nis human rights. As the world becomes smaller, and news\nand ideas travel faster, so the principle that certain rights\nare universal becomes even more compelling. The\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights sets out the right to\nfreedom from the fear of violence and the right to liberty\nfrom the threat of unjust imprisonment. Those are rights to\nwhich every citizen of the world irrespective of race, creed\nor colour. They must not be limited to any one culture or\nany one continent. As the Secretary-General has pointed out\nSecretary-General has pointed out, the mothers from every\nculture weep when their sons and daughters are killed or\nmaimed by repressive rule.\nNor do human rights hinder economic development.\nThe past two decades have demonstrated that political\nfreedom and economic development are not in conflict but\nare mutually reinforcing. Free societies are efficient\neconomies. Authoritarian rule more often produces\neconomic stagnation. That is why Britain supports the\nSecretary-General\u2019s proposals to integrate human rights into\nall the work that the United Nations does.\nThis is my first General Assembly. I attend it with\nboth hope and with anxiety \u2014 hope that, if it modernizes,\nthe United Nations can help us face the global challenges\nof the future; anxiety that, without modernizing, the\nUnited Nations will lose legitimacy and its effectiveness.\nWe must not let that happen. There are too many\nchildren stunted by poverty, too many mothers fearful of\nwar, too many people whose basic human rights are being\nabuse. The United Nations offers them hope. Let us\ncommit ourselves this week to achieving a modern,\nreformed United Nations that will turn hope into reality.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I begin, Sir, by\nextending to you our warm felicitations on your election\nto the presidency of the General Assembly. Your long\nassociation with the United Nations as Ukraine\u2019s\nPermanent Representative and your diplomatic skills and\naccomplishments as your country\u2019s Foreign Minister\nundoubtedly, if I may say so, make you eminently suited\nfor the task of guiding our deliberations this year.\nWe would like to place on record our deep\nappreciation for the achievements of your predecessor,\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia. As President of\nthe General Assembly last year he left an indelible mark\nin the annals of this institution by giving it bold and\nvigorous leadership at a time when far-reaching changes\nin the United Nations system are being undertaken.\nI also wish to convey our warm greetings, and\nindeed a very special welcome, to the Secretary-General\nas he participates in this, his first General Assembly\ndebate since he became the chief executive of our\nOrganization. He has, in a very short time, developed and\nlaunched a far-reaching programme of reforms, which is\nundoubtedly the most comprehensive undertaken in the\n52-year history of the Organization. We pledge our fullest\ncooperation to him in his arduous work. We pledge to\nmake a positive response to his initiative for reform.\nThis year the General Assembly is preoccupied \u2014\nand very rightly so \u2014 with the question of reform. It is\nno doubt an important question, a question on which all\ndelegations have a view. Indeed, there are many\nconflicting views on the subject. My Government also has\na view, one that it shares with a large number of\ndelegations, especially those of the countries of the Non-\nAligned Movement. I will in a moment make my brief\nobservations on the question of reform.\nBut this year I wish to devote my address to the\nGeneral Assembly, in the main, to a different theme. I\nwish to place before the delegations here assembled,\nfairly and squarely, and to plead fervently, a cause to\nwhich my Government is deeply committed and for which\nit has deep concern. It is a cause that deserves the strong\nsupport of all Governments and all the peoples of the\nworld. It is a cause that challenges the conscience of\nmankind. It is a cause that cries out for redress, for\nimmediate, concerted, vigorous action. It is the cause of\nthe innocent, helpless victims of war. More specifically,\nmy theme is the impact of armed conflict on children: a\nsubject that in the experience of Sri Lanka is drenched in\n6\n\n\nblood and tears. I will return to my theme in a moment.\nBut first, the question of reform.\nAlthough 1997 is often referred to as the year of\nreform, we would prefer it to be remembered as the year of\nrenewal and reform. Reform by itself is no substitute for\nempowering the United Nations. Renewal of the spirit of\nmultilateralism enshrined in the Charter is an essential\ncorollary to the reform exercise launched by the Secretary-\nGeneral. If reform is to be conceptually sound and capable\nof effective implementation, it must command in the fullest\nsense consensus in the General Assembly.\nSri Lanka certainly shares the vision of the Secretary-\nGeneral to make the United Nations a dynamic and cost-\neffective institution responsive to the challenges of our day\nand age. We recognize the necessity for reorganizing the\nSecretariat, the consolidation of United Nations activities\ninto core areas, the creation of a senior management group,\nand the coordination of United Nations field activities as a\nmanifestation of sound principles of good management. The\ncreation of a United Nations Development Group that\nwould consolidate and coordinate the activities of a variety\nof bodies is another proposal that merits close attention. We\nendorse the measures to strengthen the United Nations\noperational capacity to combat drugs, crime and terrorism\nby bringing together disparate international efforts under a\nsingle dedicated organization.\nSri Lanka shares with many other delegations the\ndisappointment that consensus has so far eluded our efforts\nto expand the Security Council. The General Assembly\u2019s\nOpen-ended Working Group on this issue has been\ndeliberating since 1994 with very little progress\naccomplished, which is itself evidence of the contentious\nnature of the question. Sri Lanka was one of the 10\ncountries that brought the question of equitable\nrepresentation and increase in the membership of the\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly agenda in 1979.\nMany Member States have consistently demanded that the\ncomposition of the Security Council should be broadened\nand that its working methods should be rendered\ntransparent. The Council cannot remain structurally\nfossilized and anachronistic in a world of dynamic change.\nWe are pleased to note that the need for change is\nnow being widely recognized. In order to be credible,\nviable and successful, reform of the Security Council\nshould prudently take into account the interests clearly set\nforth by the non-aligned nations. We are pleased to note\nthat the United States of America has now agreed that an\nexpanded Security Council should contain three\nrepresentatives of the developing countries as permanent\nmembers.\nWe agree with the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal that\nthere should be a dedicated locus for the United Nations\noperational activities against crime and terrorism. United\nNations action against terrorism can no longer be\nconfined to rhetorical statements and exhortations. We\ntherefore endorse the Secretary- General\u2019s timely proposal\nto place United Nations action to combat crime and\nterrorism in an operational mode.\nThere is convincing evidence that civil society and\nthe rule of law are increasingly threatened by\ntransnational networking in illicit arms, terrorism,\nnarcotics, money-laundering and crime. The former\nSecretary-General rightly described this phenomenon as\na \u201csupra-national subversive threat\u201d to peace and stability.\nThe present Secretary-General has correctly focused on\nthe fact that underworld groups and terrorists have\nmastered the abuse of technology and the globalized\ninformation network to propagate their sinister designs.\nTheir misuse and abuse of modern technology have vastly\nincreased the power and influence of these criminal\ngroups, which pose a massive threat to law and order,\ndemocratic political institutions and economic activities\nwithin and between nations.\nIt should be a priority on the international agenda\nthat effective measures be taken to control, if not\neliminate, these pernicious elements. We agree with the\nrecommendation that a redoubling of efforts involving\nnew partnerships among national and international\nagencies will be needed to achieve this objective. It is to\nbe emphasized that there should be coordination between\nthe merged focal points on crime, drugs and terrorism and\nthe United Nations department handling the flow of small\narms and the illicit arms trade.\nWe also hope that the United Nations Ad Hoc\nCommittee on an International Convention for the\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings, of which Sri Lanka\nis a Vice-Chairman, will conclude its negotiations and\nsubmit a text for adoption at this session. Thereafter, we\nurge the international community, especially the large and\npowerful nations, to update their domestic legislation so\nas to arm themselves with adequate legislative authority\nto eradicate the fund-raising and other activities which\ntake place on their soil in support of terrorist activities\nthat take place on the soil of other States. Today terrorism\nis a phenomenon with international ramifications. Only\n7\n\n\nwell-organized, well-coordinated international action can\ncombat international terrorism effectively.\nI turn now to the question of human rights. The\ndelicate and complex process of protecting and promoting\nhuman rights, good governance and accountability in an\nenvironment of underdevelopment, violence and terrorism\nis one that should be carefully developed and resolutely\nmoved forward. The Declaration of Human Rights is\nuniversal and unalterable. Sri Lanka does not believe that\nthe Declaration should be diluted, modified or ignored.\nWhat we believe, and strongly advocate, is that\ninternational action to enforce human rights should be fair\nand even-handed. Human rights should never be used by\npowerful States to bludgeon and bully weaker States for\nspurious political reasons. The essence of peace and\ndevelopment is that each human being should be enabled to\nenjoy \u201cbetter standards of life in larger freedom\u201d.\nUndeterred by the extraordinary security problems\nposed by terrorism and the threats levelled against the\ndemocratic traditions and institutions of Sri Lanka, we have\nbeen able to make much headway in the promotion and\nprotection of human rights in our country. Sri Lanka is now\na party to 13 international human rights instruments. At the\nrisk of exposing itself to tendentious propaganda by terrorist\ngroups, the Government has taken a number of national and\ninternational measures on a broad front, to pursue an open\npolicy on human rights in accordance with international\nnorms. We have established a national Human Rights\nCommission, which is an independent organization with\ninvestigative, monitoring and advisory powers. The\nCommission is now functional and is in touch with regional\nand international institutions including the United Nations\nCentre for Human Rights.\nI am also pleased to mention that I have today, just a\nshort while ago, deposited with the Secretary-General Sri\nLanka\u2019s instrument of accession to the Optional Protocol to\nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\nThis important decision to permit international scrutiny of\ngovernmental actions affecting the human rights of our\ncitizens is consistent with our policy of openness on human\nrights.\nSri Lanka warmly welcomes the appointment of Mary\nRobinson as the new High Commissioner for Human\nRights. I had the pleasure of discussing human rights issues\nwith her a few days ago. I am confident that she will bring\nto her task an open mind and a fair approach; that she will\nseek and promote informed dialogue, not confrontation; that\nshe will strive to win the trust of developing countries; and\nthat she will not apply double standards nor wield human\nrights concerns as a weapon against them. We wish her\nevery success as she assumes her important duties. She\nmay rest assured that she will receive from Sri Lanka the\nfullest cooperation.\nI have now reached the central theme of my address:\nthe impact of armed conflict on children. Every year the\nUnited Nations builds a mountain of paper: according to\nthe British Foreign Secretary, 2,500 tons of paper are\nproduced annually at a cost of $150 million. At this time\nof year, every year, the General Assembly is engulfed by\na flood of words that rises to new heights as the\nmembership of our Organization grows in number. There\nis much waste, much repetition, much verbiage in our\nmethods of work. But we must always remember that\nwithin this pile of papers there are some documents which\ndeserve \u2014 which require \u2014 the closest attention of the\ninternational community.\nOne such document, outstanding for its sweep, its\ndepth and the careful research that went into its\npreparation is the study on the impact of armed conflict\non children compiled by Ms. Gra\u00e7a Machel and her\ncollaborators and submitted to the General Assembly last\nyear under the symbols A/51/306 and A/51/306/Add.1. It\nis a document so profound in its impact, so searing in the\nrevelations it makes of matters that the world little\nunderstands that to ignore it would be a permanent rebuke\nto the collective conscience of mankind.\nThe study exposes the plight of children as the\nvictims of armed conflict. It covers the agonizing\nsituation of children as refugees, as objects of exploitation\nand gender-based violence and above all as child soldiers.\nThe study recommends measures for the rehabilitation and\nreconciliation of children affected by war, for promoting\ntheir psychological recovery and social integration, for\ntheir education and for dealing with a number of other\nquestions relevant to the problem of mitigating the impact\nof war on children. The study points out that millions of\nchildren are caught up in conflicts in which they are not\nmerely bystanders but targets. Some fall victim to a\ngeneral onslaught against civilians; others die as part of\na calculated genocide. Still other children suffer the\neffects of sexual violence or the multiple deprivations of\narmed conflict that expose them to hunger or disease. Just\nas shocking, thousands of young children are cynically\nexploited as combatants.\nIn 1995, according to the study, 30 major conflicts\nraged in different locations around the world. All of them\n8\n\n\ntook place within States, between factions split along\nethnic, religious or cultural lines. The conflict destroyed\ncrops, places of worship and schools. Nothing was spared,\nheld sacred or protected: not children, not families, not\ncommunities. In the past decade, an estimated two million\nchildren have been killed in armed conflict. Three times as\nmany have been seriously injured or permanently disabled.\nCountless others have been forced to witness or even take\npart in horrifying acts of violence. These statistics are\nshocking enough, but more chilling, says the study, is the\nconclusion to be drawn from them: that more and more of\nthe world is being sucked into a desolate moral vacuum.\nThis is a space devoid of the most basic human values; a\nspace in which children are slaughtered, raped and maimed;\na space in which children are exploited as soldiers; a space\nin which children are starved and exposed to extreme\nbrutality. Unregulated terror and violence speak of\ndeliberate victimization. There are few further depths to\nwhich humanity could sink.\nMs. Machel pleads that whatever the causes of\nmodern-day brutalities towards children, the time has come\nto call a halt. I make the same plea to the General\nAssembly today. The study exposes the extent of the\nproblem and proposes many practical ways to pull back\nfrom the brink. Its most fundamental demand is that\nchildren simply have no part in warfare. The international\ncommunity must denounce this attack on children for what\nit is: intolerable and unacceptable.\nViolent conflict has always made victims of non-\ncombatants. The patterns and characteristics of\ncontemporary armed conflicts, however, have increased the\nrisks for children. The personalization of power and\nleadership and the manipulation of ethnicity and religion to\nserve personal or narrow group interests have had similarly\ndebilitating effects on countries in conflict. Armed conflicts\nacross and between communities result in massive levels of\ndestruction: physical, human, moral, cultural. Not only are\nlarge numbers of children killed and injured, but countless\nothers grow up deprived of their material and emotional\nneeds, including the structures that give meaning to social\nand cultural life. The entire fabric of their societies \u2014 their\nhomes, schools, health systems and religious institutions \u2014\nare torn to pieces.\nThe Machel study rightly points out that war violates\nevery right of a child: the right to life, the right to be with\nfamily and community, the right to health, the right to the\ndevelopment of the personality and the right to be nurtured\nand protected. Many of today\u2019s conflicts last the whole\nlength of a childhood, meaning that from birth to early\nadulthood, many children will experience multiple and\ncumulative assaults.\nAgainst the background I have outlined, I wish to\nfocus sharply on the terrible plight of child soldiers. The\nMachel study has pointed out that one of the most\nalarming trends in armed conflict is the participation of\nchildren as soldiers. Children serve armies in supporting\nroles, as cooks, porters, messengers and spies.\nIncreasingly, however, adults are deliberately conscripting\nchildren as soldiers. Some commanders have even noted\nthe desirability of using child soldiers in war because they\nare\n\u201c more obedient, do not question orders and are\neasier to manipulate than adult soldiers'\u201d. [A/51/306,\npara. 34]\nA series of 24 case studies on the use of children as\nsoldiers prepared for the Machel study, covering conflicts\nover the past 30 years, indicates that Government or rebel\narmies around the world have recruited tens of thousands\nof children. Many child soldiers are 10 years of age or\nyounger. While the majority are boys, girls also are\nrecruited. The children most likely to become soldiers are\nthose from impoverished and marginalized backgrounds\nand those who have become separated from their families.\nIn Sri Lanka we know exactly what the Machel\nstudy is talking about. We have for almost two decades\nbeen in the grip of a war being fought against the State\nby a group of heavily armed terrorists known as the\nLiberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), and\ninternationally known as one of the deadliest terrorist\norganizations the world has ever seen. It is fighting to\ncreate a separate State in Sri Lanka by force of arms. Last\nJuly the Senate of the United States unanimously\nconcluded that the LTTE is a terrorist organization and\nrequested the State Department to declare it to be so. Last\nAugust a Canadian court declared the LTTE to be a\nterrorist organization and ordered the deportation of its\nchief fund-raiser in Canada.\nThe LTTE has killed thousands of unarmed civilians\nand has destroyed public property worth millions of\ndollars. In January last year it bombed and destroyed the\nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka, killing hundreds of civilians,\nand in July last year it bombed a rush-hour commuter\ntrain full of workers going home, again killing hundreds\nof civilians. These are but a few of the atrocities the\nLTTE has committed against civilians in the course of a\nlong campaign of terror. Only a few months ago it killed\n9\n\n\ntwo of our Members of Parliament, adding to the large tally\nof politicians and other leaders murdered by the LTTE over\nthe years, including a President of Sri Lanka and a Prime\nMinister of India. Recently the LTTE attacked international\ncivilian shipping that provides essential services and\nsupplies to the Tamil community in the north of Sri Lanka,\nthe very community on whose behalf it claims to be\nfighting.\nThe LTTE has conscripted thousands of teenage\nchildren to fight its war. Involving children as soldiers has\nbeen made easier by the proliferation of inexpensive light\nweapons. But the LTTE is committing more dastardly and\nmore heinous crimes against Tamil children. It brazenly\nkidnaps them or lures them to its cause by glorifying and\nromanticizing war. They are brainwashed into believing in\nthe cult of martyrdom. They swear fanatical allegiance to\nthe leader. The Machel study identified Sri Lanka as one of\nthe countries where children are being lured into \u201ccults of\nmartyrdom\u201d [A/51/306, para. 43] by the \u201cideological\nindoctrination\u201d [ibid.] of the LTTE. A book entitled\nChildren, the Invisible Soldiers, released by the Save the\nChildren organization in Stockholm, has condemned the use\nof children in suicide attacks by the LTTE. The\ninternational news agency IPS reported last May that\n\u201cas adults are killed, up to half the fighters of the\nLTTE are children, many among them girls\u201d.\nIn another recent study, the United Nations Special\nRapporteur on Violence against Women has strongly\ncondemned the use of women in war by the LTTE.\nMany of these children, boys and girls, are no more\nthan 10 years of age. Many of them are transformed into\nsuicide bombers. They wear cyanide capsules around their\nnecks. They are hurled into battle as human bombs. The\nMachel study itself has observed, with specific reference to\nSri Lanka, that\n\u201cadults have used young people\u2019s immaturity to their\nown advantage, recruiting and training adolescents for\nsuicide bombings.\u201d [ibid.]\nA recent press report on fighting in the north of Sri Lanka\nnoted that\n\u201cyoung boys barely in their teens are blindfolded and\nescorted by a woman Tiger cadre to the battlefield, in\ngroups of eight to 10, their blindfolds removed and\nthey are ordered to fire at troops\u201d.\nIn December 1995 the former United Nations Children\u2019s\nFund (UNICEF) representative in Sri Lanka said in a\npress release\n\u201cThe LTTE recruits boys and girls from the age of\n10 upwards. Their dependence on child combatants\nis increasing rapidly.\u201d\nThe Machel study has referred to the role which\ninternational organizations, non-governmental\norganizations, religious groups and civil society in general\ncan play in preventing this diabolical practice. It is indeed\na matter of great regret that in my own country, despite\nthe notorious prevalence of the LTTE practice of\nrecruiting children as fighters, these organizations, which\nare often quite vocal in their pleas for peace and swift to\ncastigate excesses on the part of the armed forces, have\nremained strangely silent on this issue. By their failure to\ncondemn such acts, they are surely guilty of a grave\ndereliction of the duty to uphold the moral and spiritual\nvalues of a civilized society. By their silence it would\nappear that they are oblivious to the immense tragedy of\na whole generation of young lives being sacrificed to\nMoloch, while a misguided few applaud the helpless\nvictims as martyrs, and yet others seek to romanticize the\nso-called liberation of girls who have hitherto been\nbrought up in a long-respected traditional mode, caring\nnought for the dehumanization that is involved.\nI strongly urge the international community to take\naction on the lines suggested in paragraph 62 of the\nMachel study. These recommendations envisage a global\ncampaign aimed at eradicating the use of children under\nthe age of 18 years in armed conflict and the public\nexposure of such practices by the media, creating\ninternational pressure against those who resort to them. I\nalso urge strict adherence to the Convention on the Rights\nof the Child by all actors in armed conflicts, and I stress\nthe need for specific measures to demobilize and\nreintegrate child soldiers into society and the need for\nearly action to conclude the drafting of the optional\nprotocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child in\nregard to the involvement of children in armed conflicts\nand the prohibition of recruitment of children under the\nage of 18.\nWe reject the complacent assumption made by some\nthat the involvement of children in armed conflict is\ninevitable and unavoidable. This is clearly not the case.\nTheir participation is the result of heartless, deliberate and\ncalculated decisions made by ruthless men, regardless of\nthe loss of innocent lives, relentlessly pursuing their\n10\n\n\nmegalomaniac ambitions. The leader of the LTTE, while\nsending to their deaths thousands of young children \u2014 the\nyoungest of the young \u2014 brings up his own children in\ncomfort and safety, far from the battlefields, far away from\nthe country itself. This barbaric practice of conscripting or\nluring children for war must be condemned by all civilized\nStates, without any room for equivocation or doubt, and\nmust be eliminated from our world if we are to preserve\nour humanity.\nI appeal to the affluent countries in which the LTTE\nhas established offices and raises funds to prosecute its\ninfamous war in Sri Lanka not to tolerate its presence or\ngive it shelter when it engages in the commission of\ndastardly crimes against children \u2014 indeed, the children of\nits own community.\nOn behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka, I greatly\nwelcome the appointment of a distinguished Ugandan\ndiplomat, Mr. Olara Otunnu, as the Secretary-General\u2019s\nSpecial Representative to study the impact of armed\nconflict on children. His appointment has also been\nwelcomed by Canada. The Canadian Foreign Minister also\nreferred to and condemned the recruitment of children as\nsoldiers. We must give our wholehearted support to\nMr. Otunnu. He intends to propose and initiate concrete\nmeasures to tackle the problem. He will launch a campaign\nof public advocacy to bring to the notice of the world the\nterrible plight of children in war. I appeal to the\ninternational community not to allow his work to suffer for\nlack of funds.\nAs we look back at the half century that has elapsed\nsince the founding of the United Nations, we have, in truth,\nto acknowledge a sense of satisfaction at what has been\nachieved, however limited in scope, through our collective\ndecisions and actions during that period. There have been\nundeniable gains in the spheres of economic and social\ndevelopment, however modest they appear to be when\nmeasured against our aspirations and objectives. Yet the\nfundamental problems of the developing world remain\nunresolved, while the developed countries have gone from\nstrength to strength.\nIn the sphere of collective security and the\nmaintenance of world peace, although major catastrophes\nhave been averted, the United Nations has not succeeded in\nmaking real the dream of every human being to live in\npeace in a world free from the pestilence of war and all the\nattendant horrors of human carnage and the senseless\ndestruction of everything we hold dear. Even the end of the\ncold war has made no great difference to countries such as\nours embroiled in internal civil conflicts, all too often\nnourished by the giant armament manufacturers of the\nworld, while the United Nations endlessly debates\ndisarmament.\nHowever deep our sense of disappointment and\ndisenchantment may be, have we any hope apart from the\nUnited Nations? I do not think we have. If the United\nNations has fallen short of our expectations, it is because\nwe, the Member States, have failed to honour our\nobligations and fulfil our responsibilities to the world\ncommunity, selfishly placing our national interests above\nthe common good.\nIf we continue in this fashion the United Nations\nwill cease to be relevant altogether, and history will\nsurely record it as yet another pious venture which we did\nnot have the courage and commitment to make real.\nAs the German Foreign Minister said from this\npodium a few days ago,\n\u201cit is on our children, the weakest members of\nany society ... that the world\u2019s future and hopes\ndepend ... They are little people who need big rights.\nHow much worse off would they be if there were no\nUnited Nations? What would become of the world\u2019s\nconscience? Who would demand consideration for\nand solidarity with such children if we allowed this\nOrganization to decline?\u201d [See Official Records of\nthe General Assembly, Fifty-Second Session, Plenary\nMeetings, 9th Meeting]\nIn order to realize the ideals of the founders of this\nworld body, and the hopes and dreams of countless\nmillions of people who look to the United Nations for\ntheir realization, we need to renew our faith and trust in\nthe United Nations \u2014 not in the old United Nations,\nwhich is looked upon with cynicism, even suspicion, but\nin a United Nations that will, in a sense, be a new\ncreation and a new being. But for the United Nations to\nbe born anew we need to bring about fundamental\nstructural changes in the international order, changes that\nwill give it new life and strength for the coming century.\nThese changes will entail sacrifice; they will be changes\nwhich many States will hesitate to welcome and be\nreluctant to accept lest they endanger their sovereignty\nand their so-called vital interests. Nevertheless, such\nchange will be in the nature of an uncompromising\ndemand that will confront us all. Nothing worthwhile can\nbe achieved without sacrifice. That is indeed a universal\ntruth concerning human redemption, and the United\n11\n\n\nNations is, after all, like any other human institution. Its\nweaknesses and strengths are those of humankind.\nThe obligation to act in the common interest cannot be\nundertaken selectively; nor does the assumption of this\nonerous duty admit of any double standard. All the nations\nof the world, the powerful and the weak, the rich and the\npoor, must jointly agree to curtail their independence and\ntheir claims to act unilaterally. Each must agree to\nsubordinate its individual decision and discretion to a global\npolitical will, manifested through truly democratic and\nrepresentative organs of the United Nations, reflecting the\nauthentic judgement of the world community of States.\nApart from, or bereft of, the collective decisions and\nconcerted acts of such a reformed and restructured United\nNations, carried into effect resolutely and with\ndetermination, I doubt whether we can honestly expect a\nbetter future for humankind in the new millennium. We\nmust not fail the United Nations, or else we shall assuredly\ngo down in history as \u201cthe hollow men\u201d of the twentieth\ncentury.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset I would like to\noffer my sincere congratulations upon Mr. Udovenko\u2019s\nelection to the honourable post of President of the United\nNations General Assembly at its fifty-second session. The\nPolish delegation expresses its satisfaction that the\npresidency of this session has been entrusted to an eminent\nstatesman from Ukraine, a country with which we have ties\nof friendship and cooperation based on common values and\naspirations. The President may count on my delegation\u2019s\nfull cooperation in the performance of his important tasks.\nPlease also allow me to extend expressions of\nappreciation and respect to Mr. Razali Ismail, a prominent\nrepresentative of Malaysia, for his excellent guidance of the\nwork of the General Assembly during its fifty-first session.\nI would also like to address words of the deepest respect\nto Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, for the\noutstanding manner in which he has demonstrated his\nqualities of leadership and good judgement.\nSeven years since the downfall of a polarized world\nand less than three years away from the year 2000, we\nare already living in a new era. Are we, the citizens of\nthe Earth, aware of the momentous changes and the new\nresponsibilities which they entail? When looking at\nourselves from the perspective of the Pathfinder on Mars,\nor of the space station Mir, do we see humanity in its\nentirety or, rather, spasmodic movements of an anthill,\nalways prepared to fight over every scrap, devoid of the\ngift of synthesis and without ability to perceive the\nwhole?\nThese are the questions which all of us, especially\nhere in this Hall, are confronted with. The burden of\nresponsibility of the United Nations for resisting dangers\nand facing challenges, for eliminating tensions and\nconstantly building foundations for the future, has not\nbeen relieved. It has not diminished. Perhaps it weighs\neven heavier today than ever before.\nFrom that moment in 1945, in San Francisco, when\nArthur Rubinstein, an outstanding piano virtuoso and a\ngreat Polish patriot, proudly inaugurated the United\nNations era with the notes of the Polish national anthem,\nuntil today, our Organization has given the impression of\nbeing oriented towards emergency actions rather than\nsystematic and comprehensive work programmes. The\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council are\nexcessively preoccupied with current issues. Nonetheless,\ntorn apart by the global confrontation between the free\nworld and totalitarianism, they attempted to find\nmechanisms of dialogue and negotiation that would\nprotect the world from global conflict. They have fulfilled\nthat role. No one, neither the fiercest opponents of the\nidea of the United Nations nor the greatest promoters of\nits radical modernization, can deny the United Nations\nachievements in maintaining world peace and security and\nresolving local conflicts. One has to bow to the visionary\nskills and political genius of the creators of the Atlantic\nCharter, which provided the foundation for our\nOrganization. Their work has stood the test of time in\ncircumstances unforeseeable when the system was\nestablished.\nUntil now we have been concentrating on avoiding\nwar. Shocked by the tragedy of the Second World War\nand the experience of ravages of previous wars, we have\n14\n\n\nput all our energy into the creed \u201cNever again\u201d. However,\nconcentrating on avoiding war, the United Nations has not\nalways been able to pay sufficient attention to building a\nworld for people, a world of harmonious existence and\nbalanced development. I should like to emphasize this point\nagain and again.\nThe time has come to pay more attention to building\na world for all people, of all races, all religions and all\ncultures, for people in the wealthier North and the poorer\nSouth.\nAn important area of international cooperation has\nbeen the effort to eliminate weapons of mass destruction:\nnuclear, chemical and biological. This Organization has\nmade a significant contribution to this activity. Among the\nrecent milestones in this domain, I should mention the\nenactment of the Convention on the Prohibition of the\nDevelopment, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical\nWeapons and on Their Destruction, as well as the signing\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We also\nconsider extremely important the ongoing work towards\nwider application and universalization of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the basis for a\nglobal regime of nuclear-arms non-proliferation.\nWe attach particular significance to the willingness of\nthe United States and the Russian Federation, as confirmed\nat the Helsinki summit this year, to continue the START\nnegotiations, taking them to a qualitatively new stage\ninvolving the radical reduction of nuclear arsenals. We trust\nthat the ratification of START II by the Russian Federation,\nupon which these negotiations are conditioned, will soon be\na fact, just as we hope that our expectations with regard to\nthe immediate ratification by Russia of the Chemical\nWeapons Convention will become a reality in the near\nfuture. We welcome President Clinton\u2019s decision to submit\nto the Senate for ratification the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty, as he announced from this rostrum.\nBoth for humanitarian reasons and for reasons of our\ncountry\u2019s security interests, we attach great importance to\neffective actions aimed at limiting or banning conventional\nweapons, including anti-personnel landmines. We welcome\nthe momentous arrangements concerning this issue that\nwere agreed at the recent Oslo Diplomatic Conference. We\nbelieve, however, that the consolidation and universalization\nof these agreements should continue to be sought\npersistently at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament.\nThis would guarantee participation in the negotiations of the\nmain manufacturers and exporters, which in turn would\nserve to take better into account the legitimate security\ninterests of all countries.\nIn this context of conventional disarmament, allow\nme to confess that it was with immense sadness that my\ndelegation \u2014 just like everyone else in the world \u2014\nreceived the news of the tragic death of Diana, Princess\nof Wales, a great supporter of a ban on landmines.\nWe are currently starting a new and different stage\nin the history of the United Nations. The moment has\ncome to pose truly fundamental questions about the future\nand to provide answers. Global peace is a primary value,\nbut should we not reach beyond that? In our view, global\npeace is a fundamental precondition to the preservation of\nhuman dignity and the observance of human rights, to the\nenhancement of economic and political justice and to\nharmonious and sustainable development. But the time\nhas come for the United Nations to open up more so as\nto meet other challenges of contemporary civilization.\nUnited Nations agencies have already made progress\nin this direction. The experience they have accumulated,\nas well as their lasting achievements in the definite\nimprovement of living conditions for millions of people,\nconstitute an important starting point. In this respect,\nsufficient funding aimed at specific programmes is the\nprerequisite for success. We welcome donations and\nphilanthropy, which are an important source of additional\nfunding and a clear sign of public support. However, the\nUnited Nations needs a solid foundation for its activities,\nand regular contributions by all Members are\nindispensable.\nThe reforms proposed by the Secretary-General in\nhis report, \u201cRenewing the United Nations: A Programme\nfor Reform\u201d, provide the basis for fundamental changes\nin the activities of our Organization that will allow it to\nserve better the needs and expectations of all the Member\nnations facing the challenges of the twenty-first century.\nIt is with hope and optimism that we welcome the\ninitiatives of the Secretary-General. We believe they will\nlead to improved effectiveness and better management of\nthe United Nations system. They increase the focus on\ndevelopment programmes and enhance the credibility of\nthe Organization. They strengthen the relationship\nbetween Member States and the United Nations. Poland\nsupports the proposed direction of the United Nations\nreforms. We are prepared to cooperate actively in this\nprocess, and we are vitally interested in further efforts to\nreinvigorate the United Nations system, including its\neconomic and social sectors.\n15\n\n\nThere is no immediate threat of a global conflict, but\nlocal conflicts might often lead to conflicts on a much\ngreater scale. The world was not free of regional or even\ninternal conflicts before, but either their importance and\nramifications seemed less significant in the face of a threat\nof worldwide conflict, or they were temporarily frozen by\nthe cold war. With the ice melting, local conflicts ignited\nwith renewed intensity. The international community, fully\naware of the threat they presented, made efforts to assist in\ndefusing them, with varying degree of success.\nUnderstandably, the United Nations had a perception of its\nresponsibility and took action using the means at the\ndisposal of the Security Council. Poland supports all the\nefforts to institute the concept of rapid deployment in order\nto improve the capability of the United Nations to respond\nquickly to crisis situations. Our experience proves that the\nability to address local conflicts should be one of the\npriorities in our efforts to reform the Security Council.\nThe basic premise for balanced enlargement and\nreform of the Council should be the increased effectiveness\nof its work in an international environment which is\nundergoing fundamental changes. With our experience of\nnearly two years of participation in the Security Council,\nwe are inclined to conclude that the effectiveness of\nSecurity Council activities is greatly enhanced when it\nenjoys the full support of the respective regions represented\nin the United Nations. Therefore, we support the aspirations\nof various regional groups to additional seats in the Council\nif its membership is expanded. At the same time, Poland\nwould find it necessary to increase the representation of\nCentral and Eastern Europe in the Council by an additional\nmember. Thus, my Government is in favour of the\naccession of Japan and Germany to permanent seats.\nPoland is among the countries convinced of the\nnecessity of reforming the Council to adapt it to current and\nfuture tasks. While implementing these reforms, we should\ntake into consideration two parallel and sometimes\nconflicting tendencies: globalization and regionalization.\nThe emerging concept of regional responsibility should\nundergo consolidation. Its burden is being carried by\nregional organizations engaged in resolving regional\nconflicts, prominent cases in point being the activities of\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina as well as those of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity.\nWe believe that regional organizations should be more\nengaged in preventive diplomacy and maintaining peace\nwhile ensuring full compatibility with the United Nations\nCharter. Thus, the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) is contributing to the\nfulfillment of the basic task of the United Nations \u2014\nmaintaining international peace and security \u2014 through\nactive regional cooperation in both conflict prevention and\ncrisis management, as well as in post-conflict\nrehabilitation.\nWhen Poland assumes the duties of OSCE\nChairman-in-Office in 1998, it will make every effort to\nmaintain and develop further a high standard of\ncooperation between that Organization and the United\nNations.\nIn an atmosphere of global peace there is a much\nbetter chance to stand up to conflicts as old as humanity,\nsuch as religious conflicts, those between rich and poor\nand those between various ethnic groups.\nThe Polish people, with its historical experience of\ntimes of freedom and times of bondage, is gaining new\nexperience today. As the pioneer of the 1990s\nbreakthrough, which led to the end of a polarized world,\ntoday Poland is experiencing both joy and hardship: the\njoy of returning to the family of free nations and the\nhardship of a transformation period and the restructuring\nof our economy.\nThis year Poland has been undergoing a bitter test,\nfighting against a natural disaster unparalleled in\ncenturies: the catastrophic flood in the south and west of\nthe country. May I take this opportunity to extend our\nheartfelt thanks to the countries, organizations and persons\nof goodwill that have come to our assistance. If there is\nany lesson to be drawn from this horrible experience, it\nis that massive natural disasters are a kind of danger that\nwe all have to learn to withstand together.\nThis year\u2019s flood, whose destructive force struck our\ncountry, also had a disastrous effect on our neighbors, in\nparticular the Czech Republic and Germany. We found\nthat such disasters can be faced much more effectively if\nthe preventive and rescue operations are organized on an\ninternational and, especially, a transboundary scale.\nThere is an old saying that a friend in need is a\nfriend indeed. But one can also find friends in moments\nof success and moments of joy. Thanks to the help of our\nfriends, and to their satisfaction, Poland crossed two great\nthresholds this year. It was invited to the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization and to the European Union.\nNegotiations with NATO are already under way, and\nthose with the European Union will commence at the\n16\n\n\nbeginning of next year. Our readiness to shoulder\nresponsibility and our ability to meet the requirements have\nbeen recognized. Poland is now considered a reliable and\nrespected member of the community of democratic nations.\nThe outcome of our recently held parliamentary\nelections has confirmed that this basic orientation of our\nforeign policy will remain unchanged and is supported by\nthe overwhelming majority of the Polish people.\nThe world is still imperfect. Millions of people are\npaying \u2014 with their freedom, their dignity and sometimes\neven their lives \u2014 the price of lack of democracy and lack\nof respect for human rights. There are forces that feed on\nethnic antagonisms. Poverty is the fate of millions of people\nacross vast territories. But other problems on a global scale\nare also visible \u2014 climate changes and diverse\nenvironmental concerns, the constantly widening gap\nbetween rich and poor and the insufficient reach of\neducation and health care. The reforms which we undertake\nshould increase the United Nations capability to address\nthese important issues. Let me now elaborate on some of\nthem.\nThrough deep and carefully thought-out reform, we\nshould equip the United Nations with mechanisms capable\nof ensuring respect for the human rights of all the world\u2019s\ncitizens to a greater degree than before. The United Nations\nevolution and reform introduce the human rights issue in\nquite a natural way to the Security Council agenda. We\nwelcome this trend. There is a clear connection between\ninternational security and respect for human rights, which\nshould be reflected in the activities of the Security Council.\nThe events of the past few years in Africa have again\ndramatically confirmed the existence of such a relationship.\n1998 will be a special year for human rights. Half a\ncentury ago the General Assembly adopted the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, a catalogue of the\nindividual\u2019s rights and duties. However, the concept of\nhuman rights still varies from region to region. I think that\non the threshold of the twenty-first century, as we\nemphasized in Warsaw this January when inaugurating the\ncelebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, it is worth considering how\nto use this variety to build a universal concept of human\nrights, just as the Declaration initially assumed. At the same\ntime, however, we oppose any attempt at the so-called\nrevision of the Universal Declaration, which must remain\na common minimal standard for all humanity.\nAs a member of the United Nations Commission on\nHuman Rights starting on 1 January 1998, Poland\nconfirms its willingness to continue the dialogue and\ncooperation with representatives of all regional groups.\nObservance and promotion of human rights are for all of\nus a great challenge at the threshold of the twenty-first\ncentury.\nWe also believe that closer economic cooperation\nwith developing countries will help them overcome\ndifficulties and actively participate in the world economy.\nPoland is undertaking and will continue to undertake\nimportant projects in this field. We also want to point out\nthe important role of international institutions in providing\ndevelopment assistance for partners with lower levels of\nincome. We will continue to give them our support as\ntheir tasks require and our capacity allows.\nA year ago, in this General Assembly Hall, the\nPresident of Poland, Mr. Aleksander Kwasniewski,\nformulated a proposal for the elaboration of an\ninternational convention against organized transnational\ncrime. We were encouraged by the massive support that\nthe Polish initiative received from the membership of this\nOrganization. We think that the international community\nshould take active measures to stop the spreading cancer\nof transnational crime. We must secure the effective\ncooperation of countries and organizations concerned.\nWe believe that the United Nations will find for\nitself a creative and constructive role through the\nCommission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice,\nwhich has been entrusted with the task of elaborating this\nconvention. Poland is ready to cooperate with other\ncountries to extend the scope and range of the convention\nif such extension would meet the needs and expectations\nof Member States. We appreciate the work of the\nCommission on this subject and hope that the Assembly\nwill receive a final draft of the convention at its next\nsession.\nEqually important are the environmental issues. The\nmost important among them are those related to climate\nchanges. To deal effectively with such problems as the\ngreenhouse effect, melting of glaciers and the protection\nof tropical forests is a task far exceeding the ability of\nany single country or even region. It is hard to imagine\neffective action in this area unless we all join forces.\nIt is justifiable to reconsider whether the United\nNations is an organization capable of dealing with these\ntasks. The doubts voiced by the skeptics should not be\n17\n\n\nignored. However, Poland is among the countries that\nbelieve that the United Nations system can, through the\ncollective effort of its Members, meet the challenges. This\neffort has to be directed towards, among other things,\nunderstanding current and future dilemmas which reach\nbeyond this century. It must be sustained with a vision,\nshared by all Members of the system, of the shape they\nwish to give to tomorrow. It must involve the will to\ndevelop an organizational system and make it effective,\nwith each Member bearing its share of responsibility.\nToday\u2019s Poland \u2014 democratic, economically successful,\nenjoying good relations with all its neighbours, binding\nitself to alliances with the European Union and NATO \u2014\nis ready to participate in carrying out this task.\nWe must rise to the expectations of the United\nNations. As one of the Organization\u2019s founding Members,\nPoland will not cease in its support of the United Nations\nas a global forum for resolving problems and conflicts, and\nespecially for ensuring a just and effective system of global\ngovernance aimed at eliminating threats to humanity.\nPoland stands ready to do its part for the purpose of\nachieving these lofty goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me first of all, on behalf of the\ndelegation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea,\nto congratulate Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, the Minister For\nForeign Affairs of Ukraine, on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its current session.\nWe believe that his rich experience and diplomatic skill\nin dealing with international affairs will lead this session\nto fruitful results.\nI also express my gratitude to the former President,\nMr. Razali Ismail, Malaysian Ambassador to the United\nNations, for his great contributions to the successful\nconclusion of the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly. At the same time, I take this opportunity to\nexpress appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, for his efforts devoted to the activities of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe fifty-second session of the General Assembly is\nnow being held just two years before we enter a new\ncentury. The twenty-first century should be different from\nthe present century, characterized by a history of hot and\ncold wars. It is the desire of humankind and the common\ntask of the international community to make the\nforthcoming century peaceful and prosperous.\n17\n\n\nThough we are at the end of the twentieth century, we\nare still facing complex and intricate challenges. A\ntendency towards domination continues to prevail in\ninternational relations even after the abolition of\ncolonialism. Today the United Nations, which once\ncontributed to eradicating colonialism, has been placed in\ndanger of being converted into a tool that would allow\nhigh-handedness and arbitrariness.\nThough the cold war has ended, the nuclear stockpiles\nremain as enormous as ever before, and the thinking of the\ncold-war era dominates international relations. Today such\nchallenges are clearest in North-East Asia and, more\nprecisely, in the Korean peninsula. In the Korean peninsula,\nnational division, the legacy of the cold war era, continues,\nthe power and confrontation politics of the cold war era\npersist and relations between the North and South of Korea\nare ever worsening. The aggressive military alliances,\nvestiges of the cold war, are being rearranged, and\nprovocative joint military exercises are being conducted\nagainst the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea with\nannually increased military expenditures amid the tense\nsituation in the Korean peninsula. In addition to the military\npressures, which have continued since the cold war era,\nissues such as human rights, terrorism, economic sanctions,\nfood aid and so on are also being abused as tools for high-\nhandedness and interference in our internal affairs. All these\nattempts are aimed at stifling our socialist system.\nLike all other United Nations Member States, the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea is a sovereign State\nwith the right to choose its own political system, and it\ndeserves respect for this. Our style of socialism is the one\nour people have chosen by themselves, and it is not a\nsystem doomed to collapse even though others may attempt\nto bring this about. The single-hearted unity between the\nleader, the party and the masses is the source of the\ninvincibility of our system.\nOn 8 July this year, which marked the third year of\nthe demise of the great leader President Kim Il Sung, all\nour people became mourners and observed the memorial\nservice. Simultaneously with the end of the mourning\nperiod, we instituted a Juche calendar with the year 1912\nas the base year, and designated 15 April as the Day of Sun\nin memory of the birthday of the great leader President\nKim Il Sung. This affords a good illustration of the\nunanimous will of our people who are determined to hand\ndown, forever, the revolutionary life and the immortal\nexploits of the fatherly leader who created the Juche idea\nand built socialism centred on the popular masses. Today\nis 2 October, Juche 86 in our country, according to our\nJuche Calendar.\nFor our Korean people, the last three years have\nbeen a period of severe trials during which our people\nsuffered the greatest loss of the nation, confronted the\npersistent manoeuvres of the hostile forces to stifle our\nsocialist system and suffered from a series of natural\ncalamities.\nNevertheless, our people have been always optimistic\nand able to continue their victorious advancement by\novercoming all sorts of challenges, because they hold in\nhigh esteem another great leader, General Kim Jong Il, an\niron-willed and brilliant commander.\nCurrently, the nomination process is under way in\nmy country to elect the great leader Comrade Kim Jong\nIl as the General Secretary of the Korean Workers\u2019 Party,\nand all our people are full of boundless joy and emotion\nover their long-cherished desire being realized.\nThis clearly demonstrates the firm will and\nconviction of our people to carry through the Juche cause,\nholding in high esteem forever the great leader Comrade\nKim Jong Il as the head of our Party and our revolution.\nThis is the reality of socialist Korea, where the\npeople enjoy the blessing of the leadership and the leader\nenjoys the blessing of the people through the generations.\nI take this opportunity to reiterate our deep thanks to\nthe Governments, organizations and individuals of various\ncountries, and to the governmental and non-governmental\ninternational organizations, including the United Nations,\nfor their deep sympathy and condolences, as well as for\nthe humanitarian assistance extended to our people who\nsuffered the deepest sorrow and natural calamities.\nKorea\u2019s reunification question is, in essence, a\nquestion of regaining national sovereignty throughout the\ncountry, which is being trampled by foreign forces and of\nabolishing the legacy of the cold war era.\nThe Government of our Republic regards as its\nThree Charters for National Reunification the three\nprinciples of independence, peaceful reunification and\ngreat national unity, the 10-Point Programme of the Great\nUnity of the Whole Nation and the proposal for the\nfounding of the Democratic Confederal Republic of\nKoryo.\n18\n\n\nThe great leader General Kim Jong Il, in his\nprogrammatic work published on 4 August of this year,\nmade clear our firm will and determination to clearly\nreunify the country, holding aloft the Three Charters of\nNational Reunification set forth by the fatherly leader. The\nthree principles of national reunification constitute the great\ncommon reunification programme for the Korean nation,\nwhich was confirmed by the north and south through their\n4 July Joint Statement and was supported by the twenty-\neighth session of the United Nations General Assembly as\nwell.\nThe 10-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the\nWhole Nation for National Reunification is a political\nprogramme aimed at attaining the unity of the whole nation\nto strengthen the driving force of national reunification.\nThis programme indicates comprehensively the objective\nand ideological basis, as well as the principles and methods,\nfor achieving the great national unity.\nThe proposed Democratic Confederal Republic of\nKoryo is the blueprint which gives the full picture of a\nreunified State and the ways for its realization as well.\nMore than half a century has passed since the north\nand south of Korea have existed with different systems.\nUnder such circumstances, the establishment of a unified\nnational State through the confederation formula \u2014 based\non one nation and one State, two systems and two\nGovernments \u2014 becomes the most reasonable way of\nefficiently resolving the issues pertaining to national\nreunification.\nThe emergence of a unified national State \u2014\nindependent, peaceful and neutral \u2014 in the Korean\npeninsula will make a great contribution to lasting peace\nand stability in North-East Asia, where the great Powers are\ncontiguous to each other.\nNo matter how the situation and circumstances may\nchange in the future, our people will remain unshakeable in\ntheir will, and the Government of our Republic will adhere\nto its consistent reunification policy in reunifying the\ncountry, on the basis of the Three Charters for National\nReunification.\nImproved relations between the north and south of\nKorea are an urgent requirement for achieving the\nindependent and peaceful reunification of the country. If the\nsouth Korean authorities give up their anti-national and\nanti-reunification confrontation policies and make a positive\nchange in practice, we will meet them at any time to have\nopen-minded negotiations on the destiny of the nation and\nmake joint efforts for the country\u2019s reunification.\nFor a correct solution to the Korean question, the\ncountries concerned must also play positive roles with a\nsincere attitude about helping Korea\u2019s reunification. The\nUnited States, a State party which is directly responsible\nfor the Korean question, should make a radical change in\nits anachronistic policy towards Korea and refrain from\nlaying obstacles in the way of the independent and\npeaceful reunification of Korea. Japan, which imposed\nimmeasurable misfortune and disaster upon the Korean\npeople in the past, must sincerely reflect upon its past,\ndiscontinue its hostile policy towards our Republic and\nstop provoking Korea\u2019s division and hindering its\nreunification.\nIt is the consistent stand of the Government of our\nRepublic to prevent war and to ensure a lasting peace in\nthe Korean peninsula. This becomes our primary task in\nthe efforts to reunify the country peacefully, without\nrecourse to the armed forces. In order to ensure peace in\nthe Korean peninsula, it is imperative to oppose\naggression and war manoeuvres and to remove the danger\nof war.\nThe prevailing situation in the Korean peninsula is\nso tense that a war could break out at any moment, due\nto the attempts of the United States, Japan and South\nKorean authorities against our socialist Republic. In recent\nyears alone, the United States introduced over $3 billion\nworth of war equipment into South Korea. At the same\ntime, it has been conducting joint military exercises more\nfrequently than ever before, and even directing the guns\nof the United States forces in Japan and the Pacific fleet\ntowards the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\nOf late, Japan is also accelerating its political, legal\nand diplomatic moves with a view to legalizing its\nengagement of the self-defence force in a possible Korean\nwar under the signboard of the \u201crevision\u201d of the\n\u201cGuidelines for United States-Japan Military\nCooperation\u201d.\nIn addition, the South Korean authorities increased\ntheir military budget up to $17 billion for this year and\nagain decided to increase next year\u2019s military budget up\nto $19 billion, while bolstering military \u201ccooperation\u201d\nwith foreign forces against their fellow countrymen.\nSuch moves, reflecting the policies of the cold-war\nera, inevitably provoke self-defensive counter-measures\n19\n\n\nfrom our Republic, thus maintaining the present tense\nsituation in a vicious cycle of aggravation.\nThis situation of the Korean peninsula urgently\nrequires the establishment of a new peace arrangement. In\norder to ease tension and avert the danger of a war in the\nKorean peninsula, the United States should, before anything\nelse, abandon its hostile policy against our Republic and\nsign a peace agreement with the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea. The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea and the United States are still in a state of temporary\nceasefire. The United States is in direct confrontation with\nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, maintaining\ntens of thousands of its troops in and around South Korea.\nRemoving the danger of war and ensuring peace in the\nKorean peninsula presupposes the withdrawal of the United\nStates troops and the conclusion of a peace agreement\nbetween the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and\nthe United States. Hence, the resolution of the major issues\npertaining to the maintenance of peace and security in the\nKorean peninsula falls under the responsibilities of the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United\nStates. We recognize that these issues should be the top\npriority on the agenda to be considered at the proposed\nfour-party talks if the talks are to be held to discuss the\nissues of ensuring peace and security in the Korean\npeninsula.\nIf the United States is sincerely interested in ensuring\npeace in the Korean peninsula, it should, inter alia, show\nits credibility by taking practical steps to discontinue\nmilitary threats and lift economic sanctions against the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\nThe countries concerned should refrain from any acts\nthat would be likely to impede the withdrawal of the United\nStates troops from South Korea and the conclusion of the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea-United States peace\nagreement.\nThe Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea will continue, as in the past, to make every effort\nto ensure peace in the Korean peninsula and to bring about\nthe peaceful reunification of the country, thus contributing\ntowards peace and security in North-East Asia and the rest\nof the world.\nIn order to prepare itself for the demands of the next\ncentury, the United Nations should make an early departure\nfrom outdated structures that serve the interests of only a\nfew countries, allowing them privileges and high-\nhandedness. First of all, international society should be\ndemocratized through the democratic reform of the United\nNations. The United Nations should be restructured so as\nto reflect the will of developing countries, which make up\nthe majority of United Nations Members, and to enable\nthem to exercise their sovereignty on an equal footing.\nThe General Assembly, in which all United Nations\nMember States are equally represented, has been\ndemocratized, compared to the Security Council. Yet its\nauthority has been severely restricted. On the other hand,\nthe Security Council lacks democracy to a great extent,\nalthough it enjoys powerful authority. The present\ncomposition of the permanent membership of the Security\nCouncil does not fully represent the developing countries,\nwhich form the overwhelming majority of Member States.\nNeither does the non-permanent membership reflect\ngeographical representation.\nThe end of the cold war has provided possibilities\nfor channelling more resources into the field of\ndevelopment cooperation, but the present structure of the\nUnited Nations system does not correspond to this\nsituation.\nAt this session of the General Assembly the\ndelegation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\nwill exert constructive efforts to resolve such problems\nand seek active cooperation with other Member States,\nincluding the non-aligned countries.\nDespite the end of the cold war, the arms build-up\ncontinues unabated in different parts of the world. The\nUnited Nations has long called for comprehensive and\ncomplete disarmament, especially nuclear disarmament.\nHowever, some nuclear and military Powers are still\nboosting their efforts aimed at the qualitative\nmodernization of military strength under cover of calls for\nselective disarmament. As a result, in most cases\ndisarmament is now being replaced by the process of\nreplacing with more sophisticated weapons those that\nhave become obsolete as a result of technical\ndevelopments.\nToday, after the conclusion of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the nuclear Powers are resorting\nto subcritical nuclear tests to further modernize their\nnuclear arsenals.\nInternational society, and the non-nuclear-weapon\nStates in particular, should give due attention to taking\nmeasures to overcome this phenomenon. It is in this\n20\n\n\ncontext that we support the proposal to convene the fourth\nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to\ndisarmament.\nIn recent years there have been ample discussions on\nhuman rights at the United Nations and in other\ninternational forums. However, the desired results have not\nyet been achieved. This is mainly attributable to the fact\nthat United Nations Member States are pursuing different\nends in their deliberations on human rights and have\nconflicting views with regard to standards for human rights.\nAs long as human rights issues continue to be abused\nas a political means to put pressure on and interfere in the\ninternal affairs of others, any deliberations on human rights\nwill only have adverse effects upon international relations,\nas is the case today. Furthermore, the application of double\nstandards has not ceased with regard to other crucial issues\nsuch as disarmament and terrorism.\nIn order to eliminate high-handedness and\narbitrariness, and also to ensure fairness and justice in\nresolving international issues, international society should\nbe democratized at the earliest possible date.\nThe twenty-first century should be a century devoted\nto development and cooperation. Development is directly\nlinked to international peace and security.\nIn recent years major conferences, such as World\nSummit for Social Development, the United Nations\nConference on Human Settlements and the World Food\nSummit, were convened under the auspices of the United\nNations. These conferences made significant contributions\nto elaborating action programmes and providing guidance\nfor international society with regard to cooperation in the\nfield of economic and social development.\nThe role of the United Nations should be further\nstrengthened to translate these documents into tangible\nresults. The United Nations has an important role in\npersuading developed countries fully to implement their\ncommitments concerning official development assistance\nand should pay due attention to resolving the issue of\nexternal debt.\nWe are of the view that the ongoing reform process of\nUnited Nations-affiliated organizations dealing with\neconomic and social issues and of the United Nations\nSecretariat should be carried out in such a way as to enable\nthem to make the best use of their potential for\ndevelopment and cooperation.\nDeveloped countries are urged to be wise enough to\nforesee that replacing the present unfair international\neconomic relations with new ones that are more fair, will,\nin the long term, be beneficial to them, and they should\ncooperate fully with other Member States in enhancing\nthe role of the United Nations in that direction.\nWe appreciate and support the joint efforts of the\ncountries of Asia, Africa and Latin America to expand\nand strengthen regional cooperation for political\nsovereignty and socio-economic development in a spirit\nof collective self-reliance.\nWe support Syria and other Arab countries in their\njust struggle to seek a fair and comprehensive solution to\nthe Middle East problem based on the principle of land\nfor peace, and hold that Israel should withdraw from all\noccupied Arab territories.\nThe Government of the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea adheres to the main ideal of our\nforeign policy of independence, peace and friendship in\nconformity with the purposes and principles of the United\nNations Charter, and will continue to do so in the future.\nThe delegation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea will make every sincere effort for the success of\ndeliberations on all agenda items that are before the\nGeneral Assembly at this session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We commit\nourselves to working with him for the improvement of our\nOrganization.\nNext year the Philippines will commemorate the\ncentenary of its proclamation of independence. Next year\nalso the Philippines is scheduled to conduct the most sacred\nexercise that democracy requires: electing national leaders\nthrough the popular will. As we mark our first century as\nthe first Republic to arise in Asia, and as we prepare to\nchoose those who will lead our country into the twenty-first\ncentury, we reflect on what we have achieved as a country\nand as a member of our community of nations. Today\npeace reigns in my country. Where there was strife, there\nis now national reconciliation. Where there was violent\nrebellion, there is now progress and hope.\nLast year, with the wisdom and guidance of the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), in particular\nthe OIC\u2019s Committee of Six, under the enlightened\nleadership of Indonesia and with the active support of\nLibya, the Philippine Government and the Moro National\nLiberation Front (MNLF) concluded a historic agreement\nthat brought peace to Mindanao after more than a quarter\ncentury of open secessionist rebellion. The leader of the\nMNLF is now the elected Governor of the Autonomous\nRegion of Muslim Mindanao and Chairman of the Southern\nPhilippines Council for Peace and Development. MNLF\nfighters are now being integrated into the armed forces of\nthe Philippines and the Philippine National Police.\nIndeed, there is much for us to celebrate as a nation\nand as a Republic. And this gives us even greater reason to\nreflect on the world and to ask ourselves fundamental\nquestions about its present state and its emerging future.\nOne such question that comes to mind is this: Is our\nworld a safer place? The end of the cold war has in a sense\nmade it so. But is the world safe enough when we continue\nto live under the threat posed by weapons of mass\ndestruction? Fortunately, the conclusion of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty last year and the\nongoing review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons give us some added security.\nWe must not stop here. Let us pursue negotiations\non the complete and total elimination of nuclear weapons\nby a certain time. This call is already supported by the\nInternational Court of Justice, which last year recognized\nthat all States have an obligation to pursue such\nnegotiations in good faith.\nOn 27 March 1997 the South-East Asia Nuclear-\nWeapon-Free Zone Treaty entered into force. On that day,\nthe world of nuclear weapons became much smaller. We\nnow urge the nuclear-weapon States to support the Treaty\nby becoming parties to its Protocol. At this session we\nwill once again consider the initiative of consolidating\nexisting nuclear-weapon-free zones and of promoting\ncooperation among them with a view to the total\nelimination of such weapons.\nGlobal safety also demands control of the\nproliferation of conventional arms, particularly small arms\nand anti-personnel landmines, whether deployed or in\nnational stockpiles. In Oslo earlier this month the Ottawa\nprocess produced, after less than a year, the text of a\ntreaty banning anti-personnel landmines. We will sign this\ntreaty in December. We will also continue to support the\nnoble efforts of the Organization, of individual\nGovernments and of non-governmental organizations to\nclear minefields, to assist mine victims and to rehabilitate\nareas plagued by these infernal devices.\nAt the dawn of the post-cold-war era, we must\nacknowledge that the potential for the most serious\nconflict has shifted almost entirely from the global to the\nregional level. In the Asia-Pacific region, the Association\nof South-East Asian Nations, in response to this new\nreality, has led in creating the ASEAN Regional Forum,\na ministerial-level, multilateral forum for promoting\nregional-security dialogue and cooperation. Today in the\nAsia-Pacific region dialogue and cooperation are the pre-\neminent modes for securing peace.\nHowever, the disputes in the South China Sea\nremain a source of tension for our region. In 1992,\nASEAN issued, at Manila, a Declaration on the South\nChina Sea, which called for the settlement of disputes\nexclusively by peaceful means and for the exercise of\nself-restraint by all of the claimants. Other States have\nendorsed this Declaration. We are determined to advance\ntowards a settlement of these disputes in conformity with\ninternational law, including the United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, while avoiding all acts\ninimical to stability and a sense of security in the region.\n9\n\n\nLike many here, we were saddened by the recent\nevents in the political life of Cambodia. We in ASEAN\nhave initiated a dialogue to address the Cambodian issue,\neven as we look forward to the early admission of\nCambodia into the ASEAN family.\nOn the Korean peninsula, we hope that the current\ntalks will lead not only to large dividends of peace but also\nto greater cooperation towards economic growth and\nprogress for East Asia.\nIn South Africa, following the collapse of apartheid,\nwe are witnessing bold and sincere efforts towards deeper\nnational reconciliation. In other parts of Africa we see\nactive regional cooperation to promote peace and justice in\nthe aftermath of terrible conflicts. In Liberia, in particular,\nwe welcome the holding of free and fair elections with the\nsupport of the international community, led by the\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).\nIn the Middle East, peace is gravely imperilled by\nterrorism and political aggression. We call on all parties to\nrenounce all forms of violence and intimidation to preserve\nthe peace process that was begun only a few years ago to\nthe applause of the whole world.\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, where much remains to be\ndone, we regret the deterioration of civil order and\ncondemn the violence directed against United Nations\npersonnel.\nIn Latin America, we welcome the honourable\ntermination of the civil war that had raged in Guatemala for\n36 years.\nIs the world a safer place for the world itself? The\nenvironment of our planet is under threat. Our response\nmust be to accelerate implementation of Agenda 21 in line\nwith the programme adopted last June. As a priority, we\nmust address the lack of financial resources, technology,\nknow-how and international cooperation that inhibits the\npromotion of worldwide sustainable development.\nThis December we will meet again to discuss a legally\nbinding instrument under the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change to control harmful\nemissions. We must agree now on emission reduction\ntargets, particularly for those who have emitted too much\nfor far too long.\nHow safe, we should also ask, is the world for the\nindividual human being? We can answer positively only\nwhen it becomes universally accepted that every human\nbeing has rights inherent in his or her person, and that all\nbasic rights \u2014 political, civil, social and economic \u2014\nmust be in balanced harmony with one another. Thus, as\nlong as human rights are violated, as long as the right to\ndevelopment is vitiated, as long as the rights of women\nare not fully respected, as long as people are traded like\nchattels, as long as migrant workers, especially women\nmigrant workers, are abused and exploited, we cannot say\nthat the world is a safer place for the individual human\nperson.\nWe must protect our women. We must act on the\ndecisions we reached in Beijing, and we must do more to\ndeepen and broaden respect for the rights of women\nthrough the use of existing human rights agreements and\nmechanisms.\nWe must protect our children. We must effectively\nimplement the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and\nwe must append to this Convention a protocol that would\norganize global measures against child slavery,\nprostitution and pornography.\nIn addition, we call for universal adherence to the\nInternational Convention on the Protection of the Rights\nof All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.\nThe protection of human rights finds its most\neffective guarantees in democracy. Any threat to\ndemocracy also poses a direct and indirect threat to the\nrights of the human person. Today, in many countries,\nincluding my own, democracy is no longer endangered by\nthe extreme political left or right. Rather, the threats to\ndemocracy are more base and more insidious. Among\nthem are terrorism and the illicit traffic in narcotics.\nWith the objective of creating a regional consensus\non how best to address the issue of illicit drugs and other\ntransnational crimes, the Philippines will next year host\nthe regional ministerial meeting for Asia and the Pacific\non organized transnational crime and corruption. For this\nmeeting, we hope to take inspiration from and add to the\nconsensus achieved in the regional meetings held in\nAfrica and Latin America.\nOur efforts to make the world a safer place, and to\nsafeguard the rights of the individual, would lose much of\ntheir meaning if we were unable to answer the basic\nquestion: have the opportunities for growth and economic\nprogress improved?\n10\n\n\nThe rising tide of globalization has brought\nunprecedented opportunities for the developed and\ndeveloping worlds alike. The acceptance of market-oriented\ndevelopment and of free trade by an increasing number of\ndeveloping nations has expanded their participation in the\ngrowth and commerce of the global economy. Yet the\nbenefits of globalization remain unevenly distributed.\nDeveloping countries still suffer from the old problems of\nexternal debt and of protectionism in developed-country\nmarkets.\nThe recent currency turbulence in East Asia, the\nregion with the best long-term growth prospects in the\nworld, is a sobering reminder that globalization can cause\ninstability even where it has generated the greatest growth.\nThe existence of unbridled international speculation and of\nother market ills that hinder rather than help development\nis a powerful rationale for strengthening the United Nations\nrole in global development.\nOnly in the United Nations can we work to share,\namong rich and poor nations alike, the burden of structural\nadjustment imposed by globalization. Only within the\nUnited Nations system can we mobilize concerted global\naction to support progress in the poor regions of the globe,\nparticularly in Africa, whose needs call for special\nattention.\nThe Bretton Woods system and the multilateral\ndevelopment banks also need reform. Global flows of\nmultilateral development financing have to be increased,\nespecially since bilateral official development assistance is\ndeclining.\nCountries that wish to reduce their share in the\nfinancing of the United Nations should be willing to do the\nsame in international financial institutions, so that those that\nwant to increase their contributions to these institutions are\nable to do so without hindrance.\nAnother fundamental question we must ask is: are we\nready, as an Organization of States, as nations united, to\nface the challenges of tomorrow? The short answer is \u201cNo\u201d.\nFor this reason, the Philippines strongly believes that\nwe must immediately embark upon the reform of the\nUnited Nations. We need to enhance the capacity of the\nworld body to meet the exigencies of modern times. A\nfundamental objective of reform should be to restore\ndevelopment to the centre of the United Nations agenda.\nThe Philippines, therefore, endorses the\nrecommendations of the Open-ended High Level Working\nGroup on the Strengthening of the United Nations\nSystem. If properly implemented, they could render the\nGeneral Assembly more effective in fulfilling its Charter\nresponsibilities.\nOur Secretary-General has given us a report on his\nown reform proposals. These deserve the serious\nconsideration of the General Assembly. We appreciate the\nemphasis placed by the Secretary-General on\ndevelopment.\nWe also need to accelerate discussions on the reform\nof the Security Council. In this regard, we welcome the\nprogress that has been made in clarifying and identifying\nthe elements that must be negotiated if we are to move\ntowards any expansion of the membership of the Council.\nThe Philippines favours the enlargement of the\nmembership of the Council in order to enhance its\nefficiency and effectiveness. Security Council membership\nshould be more representative of the world\u2019s developing\nregions and more reflective of modern global realities.\nNew permanent members should enjoy the same rights as\ncurrent permanent members. The use of the veto should\nbe limited to actions under Chapter VII of the Charter.\nTalking of reform is good. But our talk will lead\nnowhere if our Organization does not have the resources\nrequired to improve and revitalize itself. We survived the\nbalance of terror of the cold war. Let us now work on\nbalancing our cheque-books in the post-cold-war era.\nThere is much irony in this. The end of the cold war\nshould also have meant an end to the astronomical\nfinances spent on deterrence. It might have been\nreasonable to expect that a fraction of those finances\ncould now be shared to help the United Nations promote\nworld peace, progress and prosperity.\nYet this is obviously not the case. The Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s proposed revolving credit fund of $1 billion, to\nbe financed though voluntary contributions or other\nmeans \u2014 if it materializes \u2014 may provide temporary\nrelief. However, there is a real danger that this proposal\nwill encourage those in arrears to delay further their\npayments to the Organization.\nThe Philippines is in favour of reform. But\nreforming the United Nations should not be seen as an\nopportunity to hold our Organization to ransom. We are\nall in favour of reforming and strengthening the United\n11\n\n\nNations. But setting benchmarks of reform should not be a\nprecondition for a Member State to pay its assessed\ncontributions.\nIn the 100 years since my country declared its\nindependence, war and occupation, dictatorship and partisan\npolitics have at one time or another endangered our\ndemocracy. And in those eventful 100 years, we have\ncultivated certain insights that might prove relevant to us\nhere today. We have learned, as a country, that we must\ncherish the ideals of democracy in all aspects of our\nnational life, including in our dealings with other nations.\nAfter my people emerged victorious in our last major\nbattle with forces opposed to democracy over a decade ago,\nwe resolved to share our experience with the rest of the\nworld. Thus, we organized in Manila the first meeting of\nthe International Conference of New or Restored\nDemocracies (ICNRD) in 1988. From the 13 nations that\nfirst met in Manila, ICNRD has grown to 76 countries\ntoday. I congratulate Romania for its successful hosting of\nICNRD\u2019s third meeting earlier this month.\nGiven the diversity of the membership of our\nOrganization, it is not surprising that we may have some\ndifferences even on such fundamental issues as international\npeace, global development and the protection of the\nindividual. However, I submit that, if our Organization is to\nfunction properly and if Member States are to relate to each\nother in an effective manner, then we must all follow\ncertain basic principles and ideals. These principles and\nideals are those that democracy has taught us. Let us work\ntogether with all the creative energy at our command and\nwith the ideals of democracy as our guiding light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffYour election to the presidency of the General Assembly\nat its fifty-second session, Sir, gives me the pleasant\nopportunity to congratulate you most warmly and to wish\nyou all the best for success in carrying out the noble task\nentrusted to you.\nI wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor,\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, who discharged his mandate\nwith a skill and effectiveness that earned our respect and\nappreciation.\nMy praise goes also to Mr. Kofi Annan, who since\ntaking up his duties has worked with courage and\nselflessness to revitalize the Organization with a view to\nbringing it into step with the times and with the\naspirations of the peoples it brings together.\n10\n\n\nWe are meeting once again at a time when it is being\nconfirmed and reconfirmed that the international\nOrganization is facing a comprehensive transition involving\ntwo fundamental questions: whether mankind is able, first,\nto form a concept of the Organization and to put that\nconcept into practice, and secondly, to ensure that the\nconcept and its implementation enjoy universal participation\nrather than being the sole preserve of the dominant Powers.\nThe fact is that this transition has both a political and\na strategic dimension. Now, soon after the cold war, the\nclosure of the East-West rift and the end of the bipolar\nsystem, we must find a new pattern of balances in order to\nestablish a new, more just and more unified world order, a\nworld order that respects the interests and aspirations of all,\na world order that quite simply restores the values and\nideals on which our Organization was built.\nThis transitional phase also has a basic economic\ndimension: the challenge of globalization, which must be\nfaced by us all in unity so that there will be room for the\naspirations of each of us. The test is to master\nglobalization, for unbridled globalization would bring new\nsetbacks and new exclusions, which would pose a threat to\nall.\nFinally, this transition has a new dimension: that of\ncoping with threats thus far misunderstood or\nunderestimated, such as the scourges of international\nterrorism, drug trafficking, international organized crime\nand environmental degradation. In a related vein, we must\nshare the objective of establishing States based on the rule\nof law, human rights and good governance as the\nfoundation of the new international relations we are\nbuilding.\nClearly, the United Nations is an active partner in this\nglobal transition; hence, it must first of all adapt itself to\nongoing changes so that it can influence their development.\nThe Secretary-General has in fact taken the good step of\nbeginning reflection along these lines, for which we\ncommend him, and has taken the initiative to reform the\nOrganization.\nHere, let me share some of my thoughts on this great\nplan for the future.\nMy first thought is somewhat methodological in\nnature. In the package of reforms submitted we distinctly\nsee those which come within the sole purview of the\nSecretary-General of our Organization, and he has the right\nas well as the duty to implement these reforms. But at the\nsame time, it is equally clear that other proposed reforms\ncome only within the purview of Member States, which\nmust naturally discuss them before taking a decision.\nMy second thought gives me the opportunity first of\nall to express our satisfaction at the inclusion of new\npriorities in United Nations activities \u2014 be they in the\narea of human rights, humanitarian affairs, the\nenvironment, combating terrorism or the crackdown on\ndrug trafficking. These are all new universal concerns,\nand the United Nations has a central place in dealing with\nthem.\nHaving said that, the objective of streamlining our\nOrganization\u2019s activities should not sacrifice what has\nbeen and remains the very reason for being of the United\nNations \u2014 the two pillars on which it has always rested,\nnamely peace and development.\nFrom this standpoint, international cooperation for\ndevelopment, as much as international security and\ndisarmament affairs, must not suffer on account of the\nrestructuring contemplated. Otherwise, the credibility and\neffectiveness of the United Nations would be eroded in\nthese areas of action, which are destined to remain at the\nforefront of the challenges which our countries will have\nto face.\nMy third thought concerns the financial crisis of our\nOrganization. Proposals made by the Secretary-General,\nbe it to introduce a new culture of management of\nresources or to create a revolving fund, are of some\ninterest. However, it is important that Member States be\nmotivated, first and foremost, by the obligation they have\npursuant to the provisions of the Charter to pay their\ncontribution to the budget of the Organization regularly\nand fully. This, in effect, is where we find the genuine\nand lasting solution to a problem which seems to go on\nindefinitely and which should be distinguished and solved\nas such, without its serving as justification for depriving\nthe United Nations of essential functions which it intends\nto undertake in the service of all.\nMy fourth thought relates to the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly. If it has become absolutely necessary\ntoday to streamline the work of this central body and to\nre-examine its programme and work methods, we should,\nby the same token, see to it that the Assembly continues\nto be the special forum of States where essential issues\nconcerning peace, security and development can be\ndebated and considered. This is certainly one of the most\nappropriate ways to ensure effective participation in the\n11\n\n\nmanagement of world affairs, in our quest for solutions to\ninternational problems, and to promote genuine\ndemocratization of international relations.\nIn the era of democracy, transparency and proper\nmanagement that we are claiming for our countries, there\nis nothing more normal than to insist, together, on the same\nvalues and principles in this Organization which unites us.\nIt is in this same spirit that we see the problem of the\nlegal nature of General Assembly decisions and resolutions,\nwhich should be given the necessary effectiveness. It is also\nin this spirit that we see the problem of re-balancing the\npowers of the Secretary-General and the General Assembly,\nwhich should come consistently within the scope of\nredefining all the relationships among the principal organs\nof the United Nations.\nFinally, and this is my last thought, a revision of the\nUnited Nations Charter is of crucial importance and\nrequires in-depth thought which would raise our\nOrganization to a level on par with the vision, principles\nand objectives which are inherent in it.\nIn this same line of thought, and even if this goes\nbeyond the context of reforms proposed by the Secretary-\nGeneral, I would like to refer to the issue of the expansion\nof the Security Council. The Council is, quite obviously,\nthe body whose role and responsibilities best reflect the\nhopes, expectations and, above all, the frustrations of\nStates. Consequently, it is important that the reform tries to\nreflect correctly the qualitative and quantitative changes\nwhich have taken place in international relations.\nThe enhancement of the political and moral authority,\nas well as the legitimacy, of this vital body requires a\nbalanced representation within it, whether with regard to\npermanent or non-permanent seats. Furthermore, any\ndecisions regarding its expansion and the revision of its\nmethods of deliberation and decision-making would benefit\nby having the broadest possible support of Member States.\nThe declaration of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of\nthe Non-Aligned Countries in New Delhi in April 1997,\nwhich was reaffirmed here in New York, and that of\nAfrican heads of State and Government in Harare in June\n1997 are, in this regard, valuable contributions for our\ncollective thinking regarding the membership and\nfunctioning of the Security Council which we all hope will\nserve our common expectations.\nAmong the new challenges facing the international\ncommunity, terrorism is the one which apparently is the\nmost formidable because of its threats not only to the\nbasic rights of the individual but also to the very\ndemocratic foundations of our societies. No State can\nconsider itself immune from these threats in the long run.\nIn this regard, we should welcome the international\ncommunity\u2019s awareness which has taken shape of the real\nnature of this phenomenon. This has been accompanied\nby greater mobilization of efforts against this scourge,\nwhich, above and beyond hindering economic and social\ndevelopment of States, engenders the most serious\ndangers to international peace and security. In addition,\nwe should welcome the decision of the General Assembly\nto include the campaign against international terrorism\namong the major priorities in its medium-term plan of\naction. The present stage requires that we make effective\nuse of every achievement by guiding United Nations\naction in an innovative and practical direction, based on\noperational legal aspects of multilateral activities against\nterrorism.\nIn the same vein, the conclusion of an international\nconvention to suppress acts of terrorism in an integrated,\nglobal manner must be one of the major priority areas for\nmore effective international action. The international\ncommunity must, above all, resolutely respond to the\nneeds of the struggle against terrorism, depriving terrorists\nof sanctuary and strictly abiding by the relevant\ninternational instruments.\nIn every sphere, Algeria is continuing to work for\nthe emergence and consolidation of mutually beneficial\nframeworks for dialogue, solidarity and cooperation and\nfor the promotion of relations based on confidence,\nmutual respect and common interest. That is what guides\nAlgeria in its commitment to building a Maghreb that is\nunited, acts in solidarity and is stable and prosperous.\nAlgeria, which has made the Maghreb project a national\npriority, is resolved to work together with its partners\nthere to relaunch the process of building the Maghreb on\na solid and durable basis.\nTo this end, my country is contributing to the search\nfor a just and lasting solution to the question of Western\nSahara. Aware of its responsibilities as both a\nneighbouring country and an official observer of the\nSettlement Plan, Algeria has repeatedly urged the\n12\n\n\ninternational community to shoulder its responsibilities with\nregard to the peace process in Western Sahara. The recent\nagreement in Houston, resulting from the direct talks\nbetween the Kingdom of Morocco and the POLISARIO\nFront, under the auspices of Mr. James Baker, the Personal\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General, brought a solution to\nproblems that had until then prevented implementation of\nthe United Nations Settlement Plan. This constitutes major\nprogress towards the final settlement of this conflict, and\nAlgeria, like the rest of the international community, is\ndelighted. Concerned for the stability and security of the\nregion, Algeria will continue to make a full contribution to\nthe efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy\naimed at the holding of a referendum to enable the people\nof Western Sahara freely to exercise their right to self-\ndetermination.\nIn the Mediterranean almost a quarter of a century ago\nmy country distinguished itself through its pioneering role\nin highlighting the indivisible link between the two coasts\nof our common sea with regard to security and cooperation\nmatters. The Helsinki process began at that time. Because\nof its dedication to the Barcelona process, Algeria is today\ncontinuing to work to establish and consolidate permanent\nframeworks for dialogue and cooperation so as to ensure\nthat we deal in a satisfactory manner with the political,\nsecurity, economic and human concerns of all the States in\nthe European-Mediterranean theatre as well as the\nlegitimate aspirations of their peoples. We are encouraged\nin this regard by the reaffirmation at the Second Euro-\nMediterranean Conference, held in Malta on 15 and 16\nApril 1997, of the dedication of the Mediterranean countries\nto the Barcelona process, which rightly constitutes a major\npolitical achievement that should be preserved and promoted.\nIn the same context, I am pleased to refer to the\nholding of the fourth meeting of Foreign Ministers of the\nMediterranean Forum in Algiers on 11 and 12 July. This\nprovided the European-Mediterranean theatre with a special\nmeeting place for dialogue to foster mutual understanding\nand give a new dynamic to the promotion of the European-\nMediterranean partnership, at both the multilateral and\nbilateral levels.\nWithin the Mediterranean theatre, recent developments\nin the Middle East are in many respects causing great alarm\nand legitimate concerns on the part of the international\ncommunity. Prospects for peace that were recently opened\nup by the peace process now seem dangerously distant, and\nfear of a return to confrontation is increasing every day.\nAt the heart of the current impasse are the Israeli\nAdministration\u2019s renunciation of the Oslo declaration and\nthe Washington agreements; its negation of the principle\nof land for peace and its refusal to resume negotiations at\nthe point at which they were suspended; and its\ncontinuing policy of settlement, including in Al-Quds Al-\nSharif, where a programme of systematic judaization is\ncontinuing. The Israeli Administration must understand\nthat only a lasting peace \u2014 that is, a just and\ncomprehensive peace \u2014 can ensure genuine security for\nall the peoples of the region.\nThe revitalization of the peace process requires the\nIsraeli Administration urgently to end its unilateral\nactions, which are contrary to the spirit and letter of the\ncommitments that it entered into.\nSimilarly, it cannot indefinitely and with impunity go\nagainst the will of the international community, which has\nset as an absolute requirement for peace withdrawal from\nthe Golan and southern Lebanon, as well as the right to\nself-determination of the Palestinian people, including\ntheir right to an independent State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif\nas its capital.\nAlso in that part of the world the Iraqi people are\ncontinuing to suffer unjustly from the effects of a cruel\nembargo. My country can only renew its appeal for the\nlifting of sanctions, which have lasted for too long and\ncannot be justified today. This appeal also applies to the\nsituation of the Libyan people, who also continue to be\nsubjected to an embargo that is as unjust as it is invalid.\nGiven the start of the process of disengagement from\nAfrica by the international community, and the dangers of\nmarginalization, Africa\u2019s resurgence demonstrates its firm\ndetermination to take charge of its destiny and to break\nthe cycle of dependence once and for all. This welcome\ndevelopment also demonstrates the collective\ndetermination of Africa to face the considerable\nchallenges that confront it by relying first and foremost\non its own resources. In fact, every day Africa gives the\nlie to the theory that it is condemned to be a zone without\nlaws or development, a zone of insecurity and instability.\nThe democracy and pluralism, which are gaining\nground every day in Africa and taking firm hold and the\neconomic growth at rates that are often spectacular, point\nto new development prospects. At the same time, Africa\nis showing a promising capacity for conflict management\nand resolution.\n13\n\n\nThe establishment of the Organization of African\nUnity Central Organ\u2019s Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\nManagement and Resolution and the Treaty setting up the\nAfrican Economic Community are the product of the spirit\nof solidarity and mutual assistance which is rooted in\nAfrican culture and of a strategy for giving fresh impetus\nto intra-African factors of integration and complementarity.\nThis is the forum to state that the international community\nmust encourage and help these praiseworthy efforts.\nIn this regard, we welcome the convening of a special\nministerial meeting of the Security Council on Africa,\nwhich is a major political advance. We venture to hope that\nwe are thereby taking steps towards international solidarity\nwith the African continent, which will finally be considered\nan active partner which cannot be excluded from\nhumankind\u2019s great march towards the fulfilment of its\ndestiny.\nThe signs of recovery which have recently been\nevident through the growth of the world economy are a real\nsource of satisfaction. However, this slight improvement\nneeds to be consolidated so as to make it the lasting trend\nof the end of the century.\nIn this regard, it is particularly important that the\nproblems of development around the world, and particularly\nin developing countries, be given priority, since the current\ncontribution of developing countries is still well below their\npotential and falls short of the role they legitimately want\nto play.\nThe phenomenon of globalization, which promises so\nmuch, instead continues to bring great uncertainty to the\ncountries of the South, which is compounded by concern at\nseeing many of them further marginalized and even\nexcluded from the long-awaited overall development\nprocess they so desire. This state of affairs is mainly due to\na structure of international relations still marked by the\nNorth-South divide. It highlights the continuation of the\nbasically adverse nature of an international economic\nenvironment characterized by the North\u2019s increasing\nmonopoly of the decisive elements of development: trade,\nfinancial and stock markets, flows of capital and\ninvestment, and technology transfer.\nThe countries of the South have made economically\nand socially costly adjustments, and carried out bold\nreforms in their quest for greater integration into world\ntrade, but they still encounter numerous difficulties. These\nare aggravated by, inter alia: stifling external indebtedness;\na continued deterioration of the terms of trade; an alarming\ndecline in official development assistance; and an equally\nworrying reduction of international cooperation for\ndevelopment in general.\nThese disturbing trends are in contrast with the\nglobal consensus that has emerged during major\ninternational conferences organized over the past decade\nunder the auspices of the United Nations. They raise\nlegitimate questions as to the very future of the system\nestablished to organize international cooperation for\ndevelopment.\nOn the eve of the third millennium, and at a time\nwhen we are trying to find consensus on the need to\nreform our Organization to prepare it to take up\nchallenges and face future tasks, we all need to do some\nsoul-searching. Tomorrow\u2019s United Nations will be what\nwe, the peoples of the United Nations, want it to be. And\nthe new United Nations that our countries intend to build\nwill, above all, need to be freed from the mistakes and\nbad habits of the past.\nYesterday, the United Nations was a melting pot for\nthe ideals and values that unite us; tomorrow its job is to\nreconcile these ideals and values with all the expectations\nof our peoples and nations that are still to be met. This\nreform project should result in our ideals and values being\ndealt with in the only way that matters, namely, turned\ninto a vision that become reality. This is what lies at the\nheart of this major project which we can undertake for the\nUnited Nations and, in the final analysis, for ourselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me first of all congratulate the President on his well-\ndeserved election. It is a source of satisfaction to us that\nthe President of his country, Ukraine, Mr. Leonid\nKuchma, is on this very day starting a state visit to\nMexico.\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, we\nextend our sincere gratitude for the extremely dynamic\nway in which he is discharging his important\nresponsibilities, and particularly for his significant\ncontribution to the process of reform of the Organization.\nThe work of this session of the General Assembly\nwill cover the main items on the international agenda.\nAllow me to begin this statement by referring to those\nwhich are of particular significance to my country.\nIn relation to the topic of disarmament, significant\nsteps have recently been taken. Some prominent ones\nhave been the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty, the approval of a Convention prohibiting\n22\n\n\nanti-personnel mines, and the forthcoming conclusion of an\ninter-American convention against the illicit traffic in arms,\nmunitions and explosives.\nAlso prominent at the regional level are the efforts the\nRio Group has decided to undertake towards beginning\nconsultations with a view to establishing criteria for self-\nregulation in the purchase and transfer of certain types of\nsophisticated conventional weapons. Latin America is one\nof the regions with the lowest military expenditures in the\nworld, and there will be no grounds for asserting that an\narms race exists among our countries. There is, nonetheless,\nagreement to prevent this from happening, and, accordingly,\nwe hope that the meeting to be convened in Cancun next\nJanuary by the Rio Group itself, with the participation of all\nits member States, will attain its objectives. Despite all\nthese advances, we reiterate our concern at the lack of\ntangible nuclear disarmament measures, and we stress that\nthe issue continues to be the responsibility of the\ninternational community as a whole, and not the exclusive\nprovince of the nuclear Powers. Accordingly, we regret that\nthe advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of\n8 July 1996, which called attention to the illegality of the\nuse of nuclear weapons and the obligation to negotiate\nnuclear disarmament measures, has not been taken into\naccount by the main nuclear-weapon States.\nIt is appropriate to recall that when the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was indefinitely\nextended, a series of commitments was drawn up with a\nview to making progress towards nuclear disarmament, but\nso far not even the most minimal progress has been made.\nIn an effort to break the impasse, Mexico, along with other\ncountries, submitted to the Conference on Disarmament in\nGeneva a programme of action, in which we called for the\nconsideration and analysis of certain concrete disarmament\nmeasures with all the seriousness they deserve.\nTo the same end, we support increasing the number of\nnuclear-weapon-free zones, along the lines of the Treaty for\nthe Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America \u2014\nthe Treaty of Tlatelolco. Mexico will continue to support\nthe Brazilian initiative to consolidate the southern\nhemisphere as a nuclear-weapon-free zone.\nWith reference to the Convention banning the use of\nanti-personnel mines, it should be pointed out that the\nrecent approval of that instrument in Oslo was the\nculmination of negotiations which had been conducted for\none year within the framework of what is called the Ottawa\nprocess, as a result of an initiative by the Core Group\nformed by Mexico, Canada and other countries in\nOctober 1996. The Government of Mexico considers that\nthe use of this category of weapons constitutes a flagrant\nviolation of international humanitarian law, and that the\nonly viable solution to the problems it poses is the total\nabolition of anti-personnel landmines and the destruction\nof those currently stockpiled. Mexico welcomes the result\nachieved, with the justified hope that the countries which\nstill remain outside the process will join in it.\nLet us not continue to regard peace as an\nunattainable objective or a utopian dream. Peace is not\nonly the absence of war, but a way of life which\nestablishes as the norm cooperation among free and equal\nnations to overcome the problems that plague human\nbeings in all corners of the world. Peace is and must be\npossible, because it is essential to us.\nMexico views drug trafficking as a serious threat to\nits national security and to the health of humankind. We\nmaintain that this phenomenon promotes violence,\ncorruption and other unlawful activities, such as illegal\narms-trafficking, money-laundering and the diversion of\nchemical precursors.\nAmong the possibilities offered by international\ncooperation in this sphere, Mexico has been extremely\nactive in signing bilateral agreements to combat drug\ntrafficking and in participating in forums dealing with the\nsubject, such as the Inter-American Commission for Drug\nAbuse and the Rio Group. To this must be added the\nimportant process initiated by Mexico for the purpose of\nholding, in June next year, a special session of the\nGeneral Assembly devoted to the consideration of the\nworld situation with regard to the illicit drug problem, so\nthat concrete measures against drug-trafficking and its\nassociated crimes can be agreed upon. We invite all the\nMember States of the United Nations to participate\nactively at the highest level in that special session.\nMexico rejects repressive police measures to prevent\nand control migratory flows, convinced as we are that the\nuse of such methods, far from resolving problems, clouds\nrelations between frontier communities and many times\nleads to the abuse and mistreatment of migrants by the\nauthorities responsible for applying migration policy.\nAs part of an effort to seek multilateral solutions to\nthis problem within the framework of the fifty-third\nsession of the Commission on Human Rights, the\nMexican delegation submitted a draft resolution on\nmigrants and human rights, which was adopted by\n23\n\n\nconsensus, both in the Commission and in the Economic\nand Social Council.\nOn the basis of the Mexican initiative, the\nCommission on Human Rights decided to establish a group\nof experts to formulate recommendations on strengthening\nthe promotion, protection and exercise of these rights. We\nhave a well-founded hope that it will be possible to secure\nthe establishment of a minimum standard of conduct for\ncountries in relation to migrants, regardless of their legal\nstatus.\nRecently, in the states of Texas and Virginia of the\nUnited States of America, two Mexican citizens were\nexecuted after all the means of recourse that could be used\nto obtain the commutation of their death sentences had been\nexhausted. In neither of the two cases was the person\nconcerned able to contact the consulate of his country at the\ntime he was arrested. This was a flagrant violation of article\n36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. This\nirregularity probably cost them their lives. There are 35\nmore Mexicans who have been sentenced to death in the\nUnited States, and a number of them did not have access to\nthe consular protection to which they were entitled. The\nstate of Texas went so far as to justify the omission by\nsaying that it was not a party to the Convention in question.\nIn the case of Virginia the State Department of the United\nStates offered \u201cprofuse apologies\u201d to the Government of\nMexico after the Mexican national had been executed.\nMexico wishes to denounce, in this highest forum of\nmankind, this appalling state of affairs. We shall be seeking\nan advisory opinion from the Inter-American Court of\nHuman Rights on the legality of applying the death penalty\nwhen an international convention that affects due process\nhas not been complied with. In our view, this violates the\nspirit and letter of the International Covenant on Civil and\nPolitical Rights and the American Declaration on the Rights\nand Duties of Man, the juridical importance of which has\nbeen recognized by the Court to which I have referred.\nWe are convinced that at this session of the General\nAssembly \u2014 imbued with new leadership and having\nplaced on its agenda a number of reports containing\nspecific proposals for progress in the reform process,\nincluding the one submitted by the Secretary-General\nhimself on 16 July this year \u2014 we are at the threshold of\na new phase in the Organization's development.\nWith the same resolve with which it has invariably\nwelcomed any effort to raise international affairs to the\nsphere of law, Mexico, as a founding Member of the\nOrganization, reiterates its full readiness to contribute to\nthe efforts we shall have to make to face this challenge.\nFor a number of years, when the issue of reform was\ndiscussed we were content to pursue the rationalization of\nthe work of the United Nations through changes which\ndid not entail amendments to its founding Charter.\nNevertheless, the present juncture is so crucial that we\nneed to analyse where the defects that have prevented us\nfrom being more efficient as an Organization are to be\nfound, in order to redress them.\nI would like to reiterate some of the basic positions\nMexico maintains on the subject of the reform of the\nOrganization, while at the same time adding now some\ncomments regarding the proposals made by the Secretary-\nGeneral, as well as referring to some decisions which we\nhave taken recently.\nWe maintain that absolutely scrupulous respect for\nthe principles of law embodied in the Charter, including\nin the decisions the Security Council has to take on\nmatters affecting the peace and security of the world, is\na fundamental rule of conduct of countries in their\ninternational relations.\nSince 1945 Mexico has attacked the very concept of\na division between permanent and non-permanent\nmembers of the Security Council, basically because the\nexistence of the two categories establishes a\ndiscriminatory situation \u2014 a situation which is\nexacerbated by the permanent members having been given\nthe right of the veto, a privilege that has certainly been\nabused and has frequently prevented the Council from\nfulfilling its basic task.\nWe also maintain that the need to increase the\ncapacity of the United Nations to prevent conflicts and\nresolve those that exist requires not only the reform of the\nSecurity Council and its working methods, but also the\nstrengthening of the mechanisms for resolving conflicts\nthrough peaceful means.\nWith regard to the Secretary-General\u2019s proposals, we\nwelcome them and view with special interest the idea of\nstrengthening the Secretariat by creating a post of Deputy\nSecretary-General and establishing a strategic planning\nunit. We do not believe, however, that the objective of\ncutting costs should guide the reform process. Avoiding\nduplication and implementing the programme of the\nOrganization in an optimal way are the objectives that\nshould guide our work.\n24\n\n\nMexico has repeatedly maintained that the financial\nsituation the Organization is experiencing stems from a\nfailure to comply with the obligations derived from the\nCharter. The current financial situation has no link with the\nassessment system. The way to deal with it is by making\nfull, timely and unconditional payments of the assessments\nthe General Assembly assigns to Member States. If we\nmust review the financial situation, then certainly all of us\nMember States are ready to do so, as long as the result is\nan equitable solution.\nThe financial crisis of the Organization should not lead\nus to take decisions that distort the spirit of reform we\nshare. Carried to the extreme, this logic would call for the\ndesignation of Ted Turner as a permanent member of the\nSecurity Council, with the right of veto. By the way, we\nappreciate Mr. Turner\u2019s generosity.\nWe view with concern some of the proposals made for\nmerging subsidiary bodies of the Economic and Social\nCouncil \u2014 for example, the Commissions on Narcotic\nDrugs and Crime Prevention \u2014 which could in our view\ndevalue the treatment accorded to these subjects. The\nmerger of the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for Human\nRights, on the other hand, would undoubtedly strengthen\ntreatment of the subject. Thus, while we consider that the\nnew tasks to be performed by the High Commissioner\nshould be in conformity with the provisions of the\ninternational instruments in force and the guidelines of the\ncompetent bodies in this field, we strongly support this\nproposal. We also welcome Mary Robinson as High\nCommissioner.\nIn relation to the reform of the Security Council, the\nMexican Government wishes to draw particular attention to\nthe following elements in the declaration adopted by the\nHeads of State and Government of the Rio Group on 24\nAugust 1997 in Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, marking the first\noccasion on which that forum has conducted an in-depth\nexchange of views on this important issue.\nReform of the Council is needed in order to correct\nthe imbalances in its current composition, improve its\ndecision-making mechanisms and make the conduct of its\nwork more transparent. A reform resulting in treatment that\ndiscriminates between developed and developing countries\nwould not be acceptable. The veto should be restricted, as\na first step, to Chapter VII of the Charter. The expansion,\nthe reform of working methods and the question of the veto\nform an integral part of the reform of the Security Council\nand should form parts of the same agreement; in other\nwords, we view them as an indivisible whole.\nLastly, the Heads of State and Government of the\nRio Group reiterated their readiness to continue\nparticipating actively in the Working Group dealing with\nthe subject, with a view to securing general agreement,\nand decided to give their Ministers for Foreign Affairs\n\u201cresponsibility for maintaining a broad dialogue on\nthe issue which takes the regional interest into\naccount and seeking understandings on the subject\u201d.\nRepresentativeness, political legitimacy, the regional\napproach and consensus solutions are thus the elements\nthat should guide the work being undertaken.\nTo the extent that the above criteria are met, Mexico\nwants to make it clear that it is fully prepared to\nparticipate in an expanded, renewed and representative\nSecurity Council. Nevertheless, the reform of the Security\nCouncil must be a factor promoting cohesion and a\ncatalyst of cooperation among countries. At present, there\nare so many and such diverse formulas that we run the\nrisk of the issue causing divisions and tensions.\nClearly, the international community has not yet\nfound the formula for achieving consensus on this delicate\nmatter. The issue calls for additional consultations and\nbetter definitions of the very meaning of reform. States\ncannot conceive of Security Council reform as a source\nof national prestige or a way of consolidating regional\nhegemonies. Any reform that is adopted must be inclusive\nand strengthen regional equilibriums, which are\nsometimes very fragile and very vulnerable.\nToday, the States Members of the United Nations\nappear, for the most part, to feel threatened more than\nimbued with hope by the proposals that are circulating\nwith regard to the Security Council. A wave of lobbying\nand national and regional expectations has been unleashed\nin which the interests of the Organization itself are\nconspicuous by their absence. This is precisely the\nopposite of the spirit we want to achieve through reform.\nIt would be paradoxical and unacceptable if this\ncrucial challenge which the reform of the Security\nCouncil poses us were to result in a fragmenting of the\nUnited Nations at a time when unity of purpose and\ncommunity of efforts are more important than ever. The\nissue is too important to be dealt with hastily.\n25\n\n\nThe reform package proposed by the Secretary-\nGeneral is capable of making rapid progress, supported by\na broad consensus. The issue of the Security Council does\nnot appear to have secured the same level of agreement.\nLet us make progress on the first and continue to reflect\non the second."

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me express my\npleasure at seeing you, Sir, the Foreign Minister of\nUkraine \u2014 with which Austria has close historical links\nand enjoys excellent relations \u2014 presiding over the\nGeneral Assembly. We are confident that your profound\nprofessional experience in the United Nations system\nand your negotiating skills will ensure substantial\nprogress in our ambitious agenda.\nOn behalf of the Federal Government of Austria, I\nshould also like to express our sincere appreciation to\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, whose wise leadership\nof the Organization we fully support. In the short time\nsince he took office he has succeeded in reaching out\nnot only to Governments but also to the people and the\nmedia, thus fostering a new awareness about the goals,\naspirations and achievements of the United Nations as\nthe indispensable instrument of global cooperation.\nMy colleague from Luxembourg has already\nexpressed the position of the European Union, which\nwe fully endorse. I should like to elaborate on a few\npoints to which Austria attaches particular importance.\nThe United Nations is currently preparing itself for\nthe challenges of the twenty-first century. The\nSecretary-General and his team, with the\nencouragement of Member States, have initiated\ncomprehensive reform. Austria welcomes this major\neffort to redirect the Organization towards the needs of\nthe future, and we fully endorse the Secretary-General's\nproposals. In particular I should like to emphasize the\nfollowing points: first, the streamlining of leadership\nand management structure; secondly, the consolidation\nof the United Nations presence in the field; thirdly, the\nreturn of development to the centre of United Nations\nactivities and the better combining of the potential of\nUnited Nations funds and programmes; and, fourthly,\nthe strengthening of human rights in all aspects of the\nwork of the United Nations.\n8\n\n\nWithout adequate resources, however, the United\nNations will not succeed in carrying out its tasks. As\nlong as Member States do not fully honour their\nobligations, the financial situation of the Organization\nwill remain critical. Settling the arrears is therefore an\nimperative. Austria is proud of its traditional record of\npaying its contributions to the United Nations in full and\non time. The serious political will and sincere\ncommitment of every Government will be required.\nNeedless to say, unilateral decisions are unacceptable in\nthe framework of multilateral cooperation.\nThe fight against drugs, crime and terrorism has\nrightly become a first priority for the international\ncommunity. Nearly 1 per cent of the world's population\nabove the age of 15 today has abused stimulants. An\nestimated 300 tons of heroin a year have been produced\nduring this decade to supply about 8 million addicts.\nWhile I hope that regional cooperation will soon\ncontribute effectively to the fight against illegal\ntrafficking and drug abuse, the Secretary-General's\nintention to strengthen the United Nations capacities in\nthis field deserves the support of all Member States.\nAustria will cooperate closely with the newly\nappointed Director-General of the United Nations Office\nat Vienna, Mr. Pino Arlacchi. We are convinced that his\nprofound knowledge and experience in fighting organized\ncrime will be a strong asset in pooling the resources of\nthe United Nations system, the Member States and\nrelevant institutions. To demonstrate its support, Austria\nwill make a significant financial contribution to the\nUnited Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice\nTrust Fund.\nIllegal migration is increasingly linked to\ntransnational crime. The reckless exploitation of humans\nin distress is a particularly reprehensible form of\ninternational crime. An increasing number of people\nsmuggled illegally across borders find themselves\nhelpless victims deprived of all financial means and with\nan illegal status in a foreign country. The perpetrators, at\nthe same time, earn the profits and escape justice by\ncynically making use of a loophole in the international\ncriminal law regime. There is an urgent need for an\ninternational legal instrument making the smuggling of\nillegal migrants punishable as a transnational crime, thus\nensuring that the perpetrators are brought to justice.\nI have asked legal experts to prepare a draft\ninternational convention against the smuggling of illegal\nmigrants. This draft is being circulated as an official\ndocument under the appropriate agenda item. We\npropose that the United Nations Commission on Crime\nPrevention and Criminal Justice consider this draft as a\nmatter of priority at its next session. I am confident that\nour initiative will help in closing a dangerous legal\nlacuna, thereby strengthening international judicial\ncooperation in this field.\nSubstance abuse and drug-related crimes continue\nto take a high toll in both the developing and the\nindustrialized worlds. Human and social development is\nthreatened on a global scale. Strengthening and\nupdating existing international anti-drug capacities will\nrequire innovation and new methods. In this respect, the\nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to\ninternational drug control, which is to be held in June\n1998, will provide us with an excellent opportunity to\nrenew our political commitment by closing our ranks\nagainst illegal drug trafficking and striving jointly for\nprogress in preventive efforts.\nAnti-personnel landmines constitute a particularly\nmalicious threat to the security of individuals and\ncountries. Even decades after the end of a conflict, such\nas the Second World War, these hidden killers take a\nterrible toll among civilian populations, killing or\nmaiming more than 20,000 people each and every year.\nEvery year 20 times more mines are laid than cleared.\nEstimates speak of 110 million mines laid in more than\n60 countries. I think that this spiral of death must be\nstopped.\nAustria was one of the first countries to ban anti-\npersonnel landmines at the national level. We strongly\nadvocated a total ban, and we prepared the draft for\nsuch a convention. Non-governmental organizations\nhave played a prominent role in creating the necessary\nmomentum, and I would like to thank them respectfully\nfor that on behalf of the Austrian Government. The\nOslo Diplomatic Conference negotiated a treaty on this\nbasis, and I look forward to signing the Convention in\nOttawa, together with so many of my colleagues who\nshare this goal. I urge the countries that were not able\nto join the consensus in Oslo to become part of the\nprocess as soon as possible.\nTed Turner has generously earmarked a part of his\nunprecedented $1 billion donation to support intensified\ndemining efforts. I wish to thank him for this unique\ngesture.\n9\n\n\nThe dignity and worth of the human person are\nuniversal. Consequently, it is the duty of our universal\nOrganization to help implement governmental\ncommitments in this field. Since the Vienna World\nConference on Human Rights, human rights have moved\ninto the centre of United Nations programmes and\nactivities. Austria welcomes this trend. There is an\nintrinsic relationship between respect for human rights,\ndemocracy and sustainable development. Guaranteeing\nhuman rights is an essential precondition for lasting\nsecurity and stability. This link has been highlighted by\nthe Secretary-General in his commendable report on the\nwork of the Organization.\nI take this opportunity to warmly welcome the\nappointment of President Mary Robinson as High\nCommissioner for Human Rights and to pledge Austria's\nfull support for her work. Her outstanding personality\nwill undoubtedly contribute to further strengthening the\nUnited Nations role in human rights.\nThe review of the Vienna Declaration and\nProgramme of Action and the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights make 1998 the\nyear of human rights. This will provide us with a unique\nopportunity to shape the international human rights\nprogramme for the new millennium. Its central objective\nmust remain that international human rights standards be\nrespected at the level of each nation. For this, the role of\nGovernments is crucial; so is that of civil society. The\ninternational community, therefore, not only has to ensure\ncompliance with these commitments and provide the\nnecessary assistance, but it must also promote the role of\ncivil society. We see this year of human rights as an\noccasion for reaching out to human rights defenders in all\ncorners of the world. As host country of the World\nConference and as the country assuming the presidency\nof the European Union in the second half of 1998,\nAustria offers its cooperation to ensure a successful\nhuman rights year 1998 in all parts of the world.\nAustria places great emphasis on the promotion and\nprotection of minorities. We do so on the basis of our\nhistorical experience and owing to our conviction that\nethnic minorities do not threaten but rather enrich our\nsocieties. In this context, I am pleased to refer to the\nsuccessful solution of an important minority issue. The\nAustrian minority in South Tyrol today enjoys a well-\nbalanced autonomy on the basis of the Paris Treaty of\n1946 between Austria and Italy. This autonomy has\ngenerated considerable interest in other parts of the\nworld.\nWith regard to the human rights year, the\nimplementation of the Beijing Platform continues to be\na priority. In particular, Austria supports efforts to\nstrengthen the Convention on the Elimination of All\nForms of Discrimination against Women. We also are\ncontributing to the enhanced practical implementation\nof other international human rights treaties, such as the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, in particular\nwith regard to juvenile justice.\nEmployment, as a matter of growing global\nconcern, rightly ranks high on the political agenda.\nGovernments are urged to develop further instruments\nto fight unemployment through the effective monitoring\nof labour policies. The World Summit for Social\nDevelopment in Copenhagen provided a set of\nprinciples and goals in this respect. In order to confirm\nthese commitments and to identify good practices, I\nshould like to recall that Austria, as a follow-up to\nCopenhagen, will host an international expert meeting\non employment in early February 1998.\nIn our joint efforts to promote sustainable\ndevelopment, the peaceful use of outer space for the\nbenefit of all countries has become an issue of rapidly\ngrowing importance to the United Nations in the last\nfew years. I should like to reaffirm the full support of\nmy country for the United Nations aim to expand\nactivities in this field. We welcome the holding of the\nthird United Nations Conference on the Exploration and\nPeaceful Uses of Outer Space, which will be convened\nas a special session of the Committee on the Peaceful\nUses of Outer Space, open to all Member States, in\nVienna in July 1999.\nMy country is deeply committed to the peace\nprocess in the former Yugoslavia, in particular in\nBosnia and Herzegovina. The Dayton accords provide\nthe framework for the return of Bosnia to normalcy and\nstability, for its economic recovery and for\nreconciliation among its ethnic groups. Full and\ncomprehensive implementation of the Dayton\nAgreement is therefore imperative. This includes\nbringing to justice all indicted war criminals, wherever\nthey may be. If we want to safeguard the Dayton\nprocess, the international community must remain\nfirmly committed to taking the necessary political,\neconomic and military measures even beyond July\n1998. International support must remain conditional on\nfull compliance with all international obligations. I\nshould like to pay a special tribute to the United\nNations Transitional Administration for Eastern\n10\n\n\nSlavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium, which has made\nan invaluable contribution to fostering peace in that\nregion.\nAustria is in favour of integrating the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia fully into the United Nations\nfamily as soon as the necessary preconditions, including\nthe application for membership, are fulfilled. In this\nrespect, I stress our expectation that Belgrade will grant a\nlarge degree of autonomy to Kosovo and the Albanian\nminority.\nAustria has followed the situation in the Middle East\nwith great concern. We regret the fact that the peace\nprocess has come to a near-standstill. The confidence\nbuilt up by the Oslo process has been largely destroyed.\nOur main task must be to re-establish and to strengthen\nthis confidence step by step and to bring the parties back\nto the negotiating table. The present situation increases\nthe risk of extremist activity. A precondition for progress\nin the peace process will certainly be respect by all\nparties for the agreements concluded and the\nengagements undertaken.\nAustria is seriously preoccupied by the precarious\neconomic and social situation in the Palestinian\nterritories, where the unemployment rate is 70 per cent. It\nis of paramount importance to create the necessary\neconomic conditions as a basis for political stability.\nThere will be no lasting peace without a credible\nresponse to the economic needs of the people in the\nregion.\nSince 1960, Austria has participated very actively in\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. Considering the\ngrowing importance in contemporary peacekeeping of\nregional arrangements under Chapter VIII of the Charter\nof the United Nations, my country has started to\ncooperate closely with those States and organizations that\nhave taken leading roles in this field. In 1997 Austria\nprovided about 1,200 troops, military observers and\ncivilian police to 11 different peacekeeping operations\nthroughout the world, including the Stabilization Force\n(SFOR) and the operation in Albania.\nAustria actively supports the standby arrangement\nsystem, created in 1994, and in this connection took part\nin establishing the United Nations Stand-by Forces High-\nReadiness Brigade in December 1996, which was created\nto build a capacity for quick preventive action and crisis\nresponse.\nI am deeply convinced that, especially in times of\nscarce financial resources, the international community\nshould make a greater investment in the field of conflict\nprevention and preventive diplomacy. The United\nNations has the mandate to take a leading role in\nfurther developing instruments for preventive\ndiplomacy.\nAustria is, and will continue to be, a loyal\nMember and a strong supporter of the world\nOrganization. The United Nations \u2014 our\nOrganization \u2014 is the only global instrument that can\nprovide the necessary response to existing global\nchallenges: eradicating poverty; protecting our planet's\nenvironment; combating drugs, organized crime and\nterrorism; and promoting human rights, including the\nrights of children. To this end we have to strengthen\nthe United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to congratulate the President on his\nbrilliant election to the presidency of the fifty-second\nsession of the General Assembly. This election is both a\nsign of the respect his country enjoys in the international\ncommunity and a tribute by the Members of our\nOrganization to his qualities as a diplomat and his\noutstanding experience in the United Nations system. All\nof this is, undoubtedly, assurance that efficiency will\nmark his presidency and a guarantee that the work of the\nsession will be successful. My delegation would also like\nto express its full gratitude and congratulations to\nMr. Udovenko\u2019s predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail\nof Malaysia, for his outstanding, imaginative and effective\nwork, in particular regarding his numerous initiatives \u2014\nespecially the initiative that gave a decisive impetus to the\nreform of the Security Council.\n25\n\n\nThe Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, has, in a very\nshort space of time, done considerable work, in particular\nin the area of reform. The results of this work will bring a\nnew perspective to the work and objectives of our\nOrganization.\nI must tell this Assembly that my sorrow is great\nbecause so many Congolese children, men and women have\nfallen every day since 5 June 1997, under the crossfire of\nshells in the civil war that has cast a pall over my country.\nTherefore, with the indulgence of the General Assembly, I\nwish to devote my comments to this tragic situation.\nBut what a dilemma confronts me at this rostrum! As\na Minister, I might be tempted to paint a picture of\npropaganda, of oversimplification, of extremism and\nexclusively of governmental platitudes. The intellectual and\nthe patriot I would wish to be must go beyond diplomatic\nconvention and express what I feel in my heart \u2014 my\ndeepest convictions \u2014 which are undoubtedly shared by\nother Congolese of my generation.\nThey feel, as I do, great sorrow for all the victims\nwho continue to fall in the camp of President Lissouba and\nin that of former President Sassou-Nguesso. And they feel\nstrongly, as I do, that the international community has left\nthem to their own devices to face this tragedy. And yet in\nmy country, which today is in the grip of civil war, almost\neverything has been done since the sovereign national\nconference to spare our young democracy from the tragic\nupheavals inherent in any sudden social change, which in\nthis case consisted of the move from a single-party political\nregime banning any organized opposition to a veritable\nexplosion of freedoms \u2014 individual, political and religious.\nThe Constitution, the charter of national unity and the\nentire institutional and legislative framework set up since\nthe transition period, which lasted for more than a year, fall\nwithin this framework. The holding of transparent, free and\nfair elections \u2014 and in particular the presidential election,\nwhich put President Pascal Lissouba at the helm of the\nState with more than 61 per cent of the vote \u2014 was the\nharbinger of an outstanding future for the process of\ndemocratization in the Congo.\nMoreover, President Lissouba has since his election\nfocused on establishing mechanisms to consolidate our\nyoung democracy. In his quest to establish national\ndialogue and social peace, President Lissouba, immediately\nfollowing his inauguration, launched an appeal to the\nopposition to participate in the government of the Republic.\nThat offer, whose purpose was to correct or at least\nminimize certain constitutional restrictions, was rejected\nby the opposition. From that point on, for the opposition\neach lost election became grounds for contention and\nconflict. This has further distanced it from political power\nand endangered the future of its own leaders.\nThe war that has brought bloodshed to Brazzaville,\nour capital, is the culmination of the rejection by one\nparty of our political class to accept the rules of\ndemocracy. The seeds of this war can be found in the\neconomic problems and difficulties of the country. Faced\nwith this war, we understand \u2014 though of course we do\nnot share \u2014 the indifference of the international\ncommunity to the fate of several thousand Africans, lost\nin one corner of the globe. The concern of the great\neconomic Powers lies in preserving the richness of the\nsoil and the subsoil of that area, and the lives of its\ninhabitants mean little to them.\nBut there are lessons to be learned from this\nindifference. It has caused us to look at ourselves as if in\na mirror, in order better to understand the place that\nAfricans really hold in the community of nations. It has\nalso taught us that while patriotism could be a value\ncommonly shared by Africans, the cruel reality of Africa,\nat least a part of it, is that it counts only for its wealth. So\nin times of political setback, Africa can expect from the\ninternational community only indifference at the outset\nand condescending judgements later on. Often, and\nbelatedly, the only consideration it receives is to be\nreminded of the human rights violations perpetrated in\nwartime by conflicting parties.\nBut that right to judge, which we readily recognize\nfor other peace-loving and democracy-loving peoples,\ndoes it not in turn imply a duty on the part of those who,\nin time of war, stand by silently, failing to provide\nhumanitarian assistance to a people threatened with death\nand extinction? The people of the Congo, who have, since\n5 June 1997, been dying slowly under fire from rockets\nand cannons \u2014 bought by the Congolese, yes, but sold to\nthem by Western \u201cphilanthropists\u201d \u2014 do they not deserve\nto benefit from that much-vaunted right to humanitarian\nintervention?\nWe refuse to believe that, in the framework of our\nOrganization, whose solid, founding values include the\nprinciple of justice and equality among peoples, this right\nto humanitarian intervention, which on a global scale\ninvolves an obligation to solidarity and to safeguard life,\napplies only to certain colours or geographic locations,\ndepending on the colour or the geographic location of the\n26\n\n\nvictims. If that belief were to be a certainty, or even to\nexist, then it would \u2014 at least for some of the Members of\nour Organization \u2014 undermine needlessly and in a lasting\nway the legitimate trust that so many peoples, the innocent\nvictims of atrocities and injustice, have placed in the United\nNations.\nSome Members of this Organization are tempted to\nsay that the Congolese must solve their problems\nthemselves, and we must take this appeal to our sense of\nresponsibility into consideration. Yet while today it is the\nCongolese people who are hostages, perhaps tomorrow it\nwill be another people\u2019s turn to be taken hostage by a\npolitical class that is driven by selfish ambitions,\nunprepared to accept the rules of democracy and\nuninterested in seeking and maintaining peace.\nEvery day and at an increasing human cost, the\nexcessive demands of some and the lack of tolerance of\nothers defer to a later date the establishment of conditions\nfor a negotiated peace. That is what happened at Libreville\nduring the second week of September 1997. President\nPascal Lissouba agreed with President Omar Bongo,\nPresident of the international mediation committee, on a\nplan for the country to be run by a presidential college\ncomposed of the incumbent President of the Republic and\nthree Vice-Presidents. But many Congolese saw in this\nproposal an effort at power-sharing among those individuals\nvying for power in the Congo and, hence, an end to the\nwar.\nUnfortunately, their hopes were dashed as a nightmare\nscenario unfolded. In response to this proposal from the\ninternational mediation committee, the United Democratic\nForces of former President Sassou-Nguesso demanded that\nthe First Vice-President be one of their own and that he\nexercise also the functions of Prime Minister of Minister of\nDefence. Such a demand, in view of the political history of\nour country, marked as it is by numerous coups d\u2019\u00e9tat that\nto this day still have supporters, could not be accepted by\nthe Government nor by the other parties of the most\nrepresentative opposition.\nFollowing that refusal by former President Sassou-\nNguesso, a new Government was formed. Mr. Bernard\nKol\u00e9las, Mayor of the city of Brazzaville and leader of the\nopposition, was appointed head of that new Government.\nSeveral ministerial posts were reserved for the former\nsingle party, the Congolese Labour Party of former\nPresident Sassou-Nguesso.\nTo date, this effort to join the Government has also\nbeen rejected by the armed opposition. What is to be\ndone?\nThe Government continues to believe in the virtue of\ndialogue and not in the force of weapons. That is why it\ncontinues to hope that the efforts of the International\nMediation Committee will offer the Congo a chance for\nlasting peace, and for a transition managed jointly by the\nvarious political forces of the country so that our people\ncan freely elect its President.\nWith the goal of finding this negotiated solution,\nPresident Pascal Lissouba and Prime Minister Bernard\nKol\u00e9las recently signed the ceasefire plan proposed by the\nInternational Mediation Committee. To date, only\nMr. Sassou-Nguesso has not signed.\nWhen those who make secret contributions to\nfratricidal massacres and destabilization in some\ndemocratic States, guided by their own interests, invoke\nthe principle of non-interference as a pretext to give them\ngreater freedom to manoeuvre, should we not fear that\nhere non-interference may well become, given the\ncomplaisance and the silence of the United Nations, the\nworst form of interference against these massacred\npeoples and these destabilized States?\nJust about a year ago, speaking before this same\nAssembly, I questioned the relevance of applying the rule\nof rotation of power in the context of democratization in\nour countries, which are economically weak and whose\npolitical classes have for a long time gained their fortunes\nand their social ascendancy exclusively from political\nactions. The events in my country, unfortunately, give\ngreater meaning to this question. We are called upon to\nunderstand better our contemporary political history and\nthe need to share power in order to ensure a lasting peace\nand to better ensure the success of the democratic regime.\nIn the economic and historical context of some\nAfrican countries, this approach towards democracy, with\nthe development of respect for its basic needs, can be a\nfactor for peace and development, instead of being a\nfactor for destabilization and a vehicle for heightened\nethnic hatreds during elections, as in the case today in my\ncountry.\nThis is a fundamental question, and undoubtedly my\ncountry, today at war, will be able to answer it by finding\nthe road of reason, peace and pursuit of the democratic\nprocess. The road leading to democracy in my country,\n27\n\n\nwhich has for a long time been under the yoke of a single-\nparty regime that flouted freedoms under a quickly\nabandoned ideology, has been seen as a crossroads by our\npeople.\nThe opposite would have been preferred but\nsurprising, because the single-party regime and\ntotalitarianism cannot disappear without jolts or resistance.\nOur struggle \u2014 that of all the Congolese who believe\nin the values of democracy, in the development of the\nhuman being in a democracy, in the unleashing of greater\nintelligence and energy in our country thanks to democracy\nand its regime of freedom will be in vain if the\ninternational community \u2014 primarily the United Nations \u2014\ndoes not show us any sign of the solidarity that could, once\nand for all, in spirit and in fact, do away with the\ntemptation to resort to weapons to gain power.\nThe Government of the Republic of Congo wishes to\nexpress once again its regret and its great compassion to the\nGovernment and to the brotherly people of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo for the damage and loss of life\nresulting from the Brazzaville war. We are convinced that\nthe peoples of the two Congos, who have already shed too\nmuch blood and too many tears in their history and in their\nreturn to a state of law, wish to live in peace together.\nThat is why this situation has shown us how urgent it\nis for all peace-loving and democracy-loving forces to come\nto the aid of the Congolese as quickly as possible in order\nto find a solution to return peace to Brazzaville and to\nspare the entire subregion the further spread of destabilizing\nacts and war.\nWe greatly appreciate the commitment of some\nGovernments that, in view of the Congolese tragedy, have\nmade known their readiness to provide troops that could\nconstitute a multinational interposition force, given the\nprocrastination of the United Nations.\nThe wounded and the dead in our own country have\nhelped us better understand and better regret such suffering\nin the rest of the world. We wish here to express our\nfeeling of solidarity with all other peoples that are\nsuffering, the Algerian people in particular. There again,\nour hope is that reason will prevail over any other\nconsideration so that Algeria can pursue its economic\ndevelopment.\nI wish to conclude by affirming that the political\ndetermination to restore peace to Brazzaville exists.\nHowever, the return to peace is made difficult in the field\nby the fact that any deliberate or uncontrolled shooting\nmight, at any moment, lead to a further escalation of\nviolence and might endanger numerous human lives.\nThese acts are committed with such ease, irresponsibility\nand impunity that there is no neutral international force in\nBrazzaville that can determine who is responsible.\nWe believe that the presence of the troops of the\nmultinational force envisaged by the Secretary-General,\nwhich was never established, would have enabled us to\nmove more quickly and more surely towards lasting\npeace.\nMay our appeal for help be heard, or may it result\nin greater understanding for future calls of distress. And\nmay my comments from this rostrum resonate within each\nof us, like an echo in this General Assembly, to spare\nother African peoples from ever suffering the torments of\nwar or the dictatorship of a handful of lawless and\nfaithless politicians, with wheelers and dealers on all sides\nwho are themselves lawless and faithless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to begin by\nextending to you, Sir, my warmest congratulations on\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-second session. We are certain that your long\nexperience and diplomatic skills will guide us successfully\nin our work at this session of the General Assembly.\nI would also like to thank your predecessor,\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for the determined\nleadership with which he steered our work at the fifty-\nfirst session.\nOur Organization, with its universal membership,\ncomprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities,\nis the only global forum able to pursue and achieve the\nuniversal goals we all strive for: a secure and peaceful\nfuture, a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor, full\nrespect for human rights, free and equitable trade, the\nprotection of the environment and the promotion of\nsustainable development.\nI am pleased once again to be able to take this\nopportunity to renew our commitment to the ideals and\naims that all of us here share.\nThis year is a landmark in the reform process of the\nUnited Nations because of the active measures taken by\nthe Secretary-General of our Organization to tackle long-\nstanding and deep-rooted issues. Last July, the Secretary-\nGeneral presented to us a comprehensive package of\nreforms designed to help the Organization rationalize and\nstreamline its operations, secure its financial position and\n\n\nrefocus itself to meet the changes in the global order, thus\nallowing the United Nations to fully utilize the strengths\nand expertise it already possesses.\nWe are therefore particularly pleased to welcome these\nproposals by the Secretary-General. We hope that, by the\nconclusion of the debate on this issue that will take place\nin the plenary during this session, we shall reach a\nconsensus, thus creating the necessary momentum for their\nspeedy implementation, and produce concrete results before\nwe reach the new millennium.\nThe reforms are being introduced at a time when it is\ngenerally acknowledged that the High-Level Working\nGroups mandated by the General Assembly to examine\nspecific issues, from the restructuring and strengthening of\nthe main United Nations organs to ensuring a firmer and\nlasting financing for our Organization, have yet to achieve\nsubstantial progress.\nFrom this rostrum, I have stated before that we\nsubscribe to the need to reform the Security Council by\nmaking it representative of the increase in the membership\nof the United Nations and reflect the changes in the post-\ncold-war world. We consider the need to reform the\nSecurity Council a top priority, for it directly affects its\ncapacity to discharge its cardinal responsibility \u2014 that of\nmaintaining international peace and security.\nIn this regard, we welcome the progress already\nachieved in the working methods of the Security Council\nand expect further steps towards transparency and\ndemocratization. A number of proposals have been put\nforward by Member States over the last three years. Further\ndeliberations are required, however, to achieve an\nagreement that would command the general support of the\nmembership of the Organization.\nAn important step this year concerns the work of the\nOrganization in the field of international economic and\nsocial cooperation. After three years of hard deliberation,\nthe General Assembly adopted its Agenda for Development\nlast June. This is a great step forward because, as the\nSecretary-General himself states in his report on the work\nof the Organization, it addresses not only the conventional\ndevelopment issues but also stresses the mutually supportive\nthough complex relationships among development, peace,\ndemocracy, good governance and human rights.\nEqually important was the convening of the nineteenth\nspecial session of the General Assembly to review the\nimplementation of Agenda 21 \u2014 the global plan of action\nfor sustainable development \u2014 which was adopted five\nyears ago at the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development in Rio de Janeiro.\nI believe that an important part of the future work of\nthis Organization will lie in following up the work done\nat the major conferences and in reviewing the\nimplementation of the plans and programmes they\nadopted.\nThe United Nations of the future must give most\nurgent priority to the Agenda for Development. Any\nmodern concept of international peace must recognize that\npeace, security and development are indivisible.\nIt is indisputable that one of the major strengths of\nthe United Nations is its universality. It is at once global,\nregional and locally based. It has achieved great results in\nthe fields of international interaction. Its activities have a\ntremendous effect on our everyday lives.\nAt this juncture, I should commend and stress the\nimportant role of the Organization in the promotion of\nfull respect for and universal application of human rights,\nas well as for the progressive development and\ncodification of international law. In this respect, we fully\nsupport the establishment of the international criminal\ncourt, which we have long advocated, and welcome the\nprogress made in the Preparatory Committee and the\nincreased momentum towards its fruition.\nThough local and ethnic conflicts still persist,\nseriously affecting the maintenance of international peace\nand security, the role of the Organization in disarmament\nfor the past twelve months has been marked by great\nsteps. A number of significant conventions have already\nbeen concluded or have entered into force. In welcoming\nthese achievements we feel we must continue to move\nahead for their full and effective implementation.\nWe must also cherish the Organization\u2019s contribution\nto development and education, its work against hunger\nand illiteracy and, in short, its role in restoring and\nupholding human dignity.\nWe believe in the United Nations and in the Charter,\nnot as an abstract ideal, but as a functioning,\nindispensable, concrete entity. The principles and ideals\nof the United Nations have formed the cornerstone of our\nforeign policy since our independence and membership in\nthe United Nations. We are fully committed to\nstrengthening the Organization by helping it tackle its\n2\n\n\nprecarious financial position, streamline and rationalize its\noperations and exploit to the full its uniqueness and its\nunrivalled expertise. We are confident that the Organization\nwill be able to harness the forces of change in ways that\nwill benefit us all.\nThis year the United Nations has been especially\nactive on certain long-outstanding issues such as East\nTimor, Western Sahara, the situation in the Middle East and\nCyprus.\nWe welcome the developments on the question of\nWestern Sahara and the agreement reached on the\nimplementation of the settlement plan under the auspices of\nthe Secretary-General and his Special Envoy. We hope that\nthese positive achievements will move the peace process\nforward and bring a final settlement to this long drawn-out\nsituation of tension and conflict.\nDespite our earlier hopes based on the peace\nagreement, the current events in the Middle East and the\nworsening situation in the occupied territories are cause for\ngreat concern. As a neighbouring country, we wish to\nreiterate our support for the efforts to achieve peace in the\narea on the basis of the agreements reached and of the\nrelevant United Nations resolutions.\nAs to the question of Cyprus, 1997 has been a year of\nintense diplomatic activity, culminating in face-to-face\nintercommunal talks under the auspices of the United\nNations last July and August in Troutbeck and Glion,\nrespectively. The resumption of the talks was the result of\nthe untiring efforts of the Secretary-General, encouraged\nand actively supported by the international community. The\nSecurity Council closely pursued the developments on the\nquestion of Cyprus, and nine individual countries appointed\nspecial representatives on Cyprus. The European Union,\nthrough the Special Representative of the Presidency, was\nalso following developments closely.\nWhen invited by Mr. Kofi Annan last June to attend\nface-to-face talks with the leader of the Turkish Cypriot\ncommunity in Troutbeck and later in Glion, we responded\npositively and demonstrated our sincere and unwavering\ncommitment to the peace process as the only means of\nsolving the Cyprus question, and our will to work for a\ncomprehensive, just and viable solution.\nOur will was tested even harder when, on the eve of\nthe talks, Turkey and the so-called Turkish Republic of\nNorthern Cyprus, which is not recognized internationally\nexcept by Turkey, signed an illegal agreement purporting to\nlead to the annexation by Turkey of the areas occupied by\nthe Turkish forces if the European Union proceeded to\naccession negotiations with Cyprus. Despite this enormous\nprovocation, we reacted in a low key in order to avoid\ntension which would affect adversely the climate of the\ntalks.\nDuring the talks we worked hard and cooperated\nconstructively with Mr. Cordovez, the Secretary-General\u2019s\nSpecial Adviser, with the sole aim of breaking the\nimpasse and moving forward to reverse the status quo\ncreated and maintained by Turkey since 1974 by the use\nof force and declared unacceptable by numerous Security\nCouncil resolutions.\nIn contrast, the response of the other side was\ncompletely negative. Despite our constructive attitude,\ndespite the efforts of Mr. Cordovez and those of other\ninterested countries through their representatives,\nMr. Denktas\u00b8 refused to hold any discussions on the\nsubstance of the Cyprus problem unless the European\nUnion froze its plans for accession talks with the\nGovernment of the Republic of Cyprus, which were in\naccordance with the European decision of 6 March 1995.\nMr. Denktas\u00b8 even threatened that if the European Union\ndecided to proceed with Cyprus\u2019 application he would not\nnegotiate at all in the future. It was therefore abundantly\nclear that the other side did not go to the talks with the\naim of finding a solution to the problem, but in an\nattempt to impede Cyprus\u2019 European Union accession\nprocess.\nAny doubts as to the real cause of the failure of the\ntalks to produce results on the substantive aspects of the\nCyprus problem were dissolved by the unanimous verdict\nof the international community, pronounced last 20\nAugust by the President of the Security Council in a\nstatement to the press after the briefing by Mr. Cordovez\non the outcome of the talks in Glion. In the statement, our\npositive attitude and cooperation was commended,\nwhereas the Turkish Cypriot side was blamed for\nimpeding substantive progress by the attempt to bring in\npreconditions to the table. The same verdict was reached\nby the European Union, which also rejected any link\nbetween the talks and the start of the European Union\u2019s\naccession negotiations with Cyprus.\nIt is with great regret that once again in addressing\nthe General Assembly I have to report that no progress\nhas been made towards the solution of the Cyprus\nproblem due to the inflexibility of the Turkish side.\n3\n\n\nThe result of this deliberate inflexibility is the\nperpetuation of the illegal Turkish occupation of 37 per cent\nof the territory of the Republic by Turkish military forces,\nthe artificial forceful separation of the two communities, the\ncolonization of the occupied area by illegal settlers from\nTurkey, the refugee problem, the usurpation of the Greek\nCypriot properties in the occupied area and the continued\nblunt violation by the Turkish side of General Assembly\nand Security Council resolutions.\nI fully share the disappointment of the Security\nCouncil at the absence of progress during the Glion talks,\ndespite the interest shown by the international community,\nand more particularly by those countries that had their\nrepresentatives in the wings observing the talks. The clear\nconclusion to be drawn, however, is that more active\ninvolvement of the international community, and in\nparticular of those who are in the wings of the talks, is\nneeded if the talks are to produce results.\nAfter the end of the talks, Mr. Denktash and Ankara\ncontinued to maintain the same negative attitude. There was\na barrage of threatening statements against Cyprus, in direct\nviolation of international law, and in particular of the\nUnited Nations resolutions on Cyprus, which, inter alia,\ncall for the respect of the sovereignty, independence,\nterritorial integrity and unity of the Republic of Cyprus and\nthe withdrawal of all foreign troops.\nThe Turkish side continues to threaten to annex to\nTurkey the territory of the Republic occupied by Turkish\nforces if the European Union commences accession\nnegotiations with Cyprus, and to use force against the\nRepublic of Cyprus to prevent the implementation of the\nagreement to buy and instal in Cyprus the S-300 defensive\nground-to-air missile system.\nLast year we pledged before this body our\ncommitment to do everything in our power to help the\nSecretary-General of our Organization succeed in his\nrenewed efforts in the search for a lasting solution to the\nCyprus problem. I believe that we have honoured our\npledge to the full. I wish to reiterate our commitment to\ncontinue our constructive attitude, despite our\ndisappointment.\nHowever, I wish to make it abundantly clear that we\ncannot and we will not relinquish our inalienable right to\ndefend our country and to decide about our armaments. As\nlong as the Turkish threat emanating from the continued\naggression and occupation of 37 per cent of the territory of\nthe Republic exists, we have not only the right but also the\nduty to provide for the security of the people of Cyprus.\nWe will not tie our hands behind our backs and allow the\nTurkish air force to bomb our towns and villages at will\n\u2014 as it has done in the past \u2014 without the ability to\ndefend ourselves. If it is again necessary for our forces to\ntake the battlefield, never again will they do so without\nadequate protection from air attacks by the Turkish air\nforce.\nDuring the talks in Glion, in an attempt to assist the\npeace process, I proposed to Mr. Denktash that both\nleaders should make a declaration denouncing the use of\nforce as a means of solving the Cyprus problem and\nshould agree to work for a specific programme of\nreduction of military forces and equipment and a\nprogramme for demilitarizing the island and limiting the\nimportation of arms.\nI believe that my proposal, if accepted by the other\nside, may open the way for substantive progress towards\na comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus question and\nthe restoration of respect for the human rights of the\npeople of Cyprus, which have been grossly violated for\nthe last 23 years.\nTo my Turkish Cypriot compatriots I wish to say\nthis: Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots will live in\nCyprus for centuries to come. We must live as friends\nand as citizens of a bi-communal, bi-zonal federal\nRepublic, respecting each other\u2019s ethnic origins, traditions,\nculture and religion and the equal political status of our\nrespective communities. We must also be citizens of the\nEuropean Union. This will give us greater security and\nprosperity, both for our respective communities and for\nCyprus, our country.\nThe question of Cyprus has been on the agenda of\nthe United Nations for too long. A momentum has been\ncreated for the solution of the Cyprus problem as a result\nof the renewed efforts of the United Nations, strongly\nsupported by the international community. Let us not miss\nthis opportunity. It is clear by now where the attention of\nthe Security Council and the international community\nshould be focused. It should use all the means in its\npower to persuade the Turkish side to abandon its\nintransigent position.\nLet me assure this body once again that my\nGovernment will continue to work with the Secretary-\nGeneral in his efforts to find a solution based on a State\nof Cyprus with a single sovereignty and international\npersonality and a single citizenship, with its independence\n4\n\n\nand territorial integrity safeguarded and comprising two\npolitically equal communities, as described in the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions, in a bi-communal and bi-zonal\nfederation, and that such settlement must exclude union, in\nwhole or in part, with any other country or any form of\npartition or secession.\nAt this point I wish to express the gratitude of the\nGovernment and the people of Cyprus to all those countries\nthat have been assisting and supporting the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s efforts.\nBefore I conclude allow me to refer to a matter which\nis of great importance to my Government. This is the issue\nof missing persons in Cyprus.\nMy Government considers this issue a purely\nhumanitarian one whose solution is long overdue. All\nefforts should be made so that the legitimate rights of the\nfamilies to be informed in a convincing and conclusive\nmanner about the fate of their loved ones are fully\nrespected by all concerned. This also includes the right to\na decent burial for the missing persons who are proved to\nbe dead.\nIn this spirit, I recently had two meetings in Cyprus\nwith the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community,\nMr. Rauf Denktash. Certain steps were agreed in the\npresence of the resident Deputy Special Representative of\nthe Secretary-General that we believe will contribute\ntowards the desired progress in the efforts to solve this\nhumanitarian problem.\nThe hopes and expectations of all \u2014 especially the\nrelatives of the missing persons \u2014 centre on the\nimplementation of what was agreed in a true spirit of\nhumanitarian principles and practice.\nHowever, the agreement I reached with the Turkish\nCypriot leader, Mr. Denktash, will prove of little use if the\nthird member of the Committee on Missing Persons is not\nappointed. It also is my earnest view that the work of the\nCommittee on Missing Persons will be greatly assisted and\nexpedited if experienced investigators are appointed to\nassist it in its task.\nIn conclusion, may I reassure the Assembly \u2014 and\nindeed the world community \u2014 of my country\u2019s dedication\nto the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter,\nas well as emphasize our determination to spare no effort\nin working, in concert with other nations, for the prevalence\nof justice, peace, progress and stability in the volatile\nregion that is our part of the world.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Eight weeks ago, the\npeople of Solomon Islands elected a new Parliament that\nbrought to office the \u201cAlliance for Change\u201d, a reform-\noriented Government committed to revitalizing the nation\nand its economy. Programmes to fulfil the public\u2019s desire\nfor sustainable development are being designed and\nimplemented with professionalism, transparency,\naccountability and due respect for traditional values.\n\nThe demand for change is being heard in the villages\nand towns of Solomon Islands, as it is elsewhere. Change\nfor the better, however, is not easily achieved. It requires\npeople with vision and the judgment and courage to inspire\nproductive action. The United Nations and the General\nAssembly are blessed with such people. Secretary-General\nKofi Annan, in less than 10 months in office, has\ndemonstrated insight and a refreshing openness that is felt\nthroughout the Organization. His proposals to create a more\neffective and efficient United Nations are having a\nsignificant impact on our efforts here. The Solomon Islands\ndelegation will work to achieve the consensus his\nprogramme for reform needs.\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, Minister for Foreign Affairs\nof Ukraine, brings to the presidency of the General\nAssembly more than a decade of experience at the United\nNations and participation in the historic political and\neconomic transformation of his country. In this time of\nchange at the United Nations, his diplomatic skills will\nprove indispensable.\nAs President of the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly, Malaysia\u2019s Ambassador Razali Ismail provided\nenthusiastic leadership and challenging proposals that\nhelped advance the reform process. We thank him.\nSolomon Islands gratefully recognizes the debt owed\nto the people of the Secretariat, the specialized agencies,\nthe assistance programmes, the humanitarian and\npeacekeeping operations of the Organization and allies such\nas the International Committee of the Red Cross. Often\nworking under difficult and even dangerous conditions,\nthese men and women are heroes of our time. They will\ncontinue to have our full support.\nThe extraordinary and rapid changes with which this\ncentury is ending understandably fuel uncertainty and fear\nof the future as we participate in the transformation of the\nworld through international communications, commerce and\nlaw, as well as medicine, science and technology. Even\nhumankind\u2019s successful venture into outer space draws\ndoubters and critics alike. During the last years of the\nnineteenth century, rapid scientific and technological\ninnovation, armed conflict and the migration of vast\nnumbers of people generated uncertainty and the fear of\ncivilization\u2019s decline among the influential circles of\nEurope. Intellectuals wrote about the ongoing degeneration\nof humankind and envisioned cataclysmic wars.\nIn the twentieth century brutal local and global\nconflicts, the development and use of the cruellest weapons,\nthe attempted extermination of entire peoples and a\nseemingly endless cold war gave credibility to the\nnightmare visions of that earlier generation. We are now\nengaged in the difficult process of understanding and\ntransforming this legacy of horror into something we can\nuse for humankind\u2019s benefit. In this effort the United\nNations is vital.\nSolomon Islands welcomes the adoption of the\nAgenda for Development and looks forward to the\nconclusion of the discussion of the scale of assessments\nand the issue of the capacity to pay. For the small\ndeveloping States, an effective and financially stable\nUnited Nations that meets the challenges of development,\nas well as of the Organization\u2019s other core activities,\nremains critical.\nThe Solomon Islands Government supports the\nSecretary-General\u2019s programme of reform. We have no\nillusions, however, that it will be easy for the Member\nStates to reach a consensus on its adoption. Certain\ncontroversial proposals face intense debate, but we are\nconfident that the outcome of our deliberations will\nbenefit all. These discussions should take place in only\none forum so that small delegations such as my own can\nfully participate.\nIn an ideal United Nations, the future design of the\nSecurity Council could be characterized as \u201cequality of\nmembership, yes; the veto, no\u201d. Political reality, however,\nrequires another approach. The Security Council should\nbe expanded, with permanent and non-permanent seats for\ndeveloped and developing States. Solomon Islands will\ngive serious consideration to permanent membership for\nGermany, Japan and several developing countries. Since\nthe present permanent members insist on retaining the\nveto, it must be restricted to questions relating to Chapter\nVII of the Charter.\nSolomon Islands and other States in the great\ncontinent of Oceania are especially sensitive to\nenvironmental change. Our commitment to the principles\nof the Rio Declaration and the objectives of Agenda 21 is\nreflected in Solomon Islands\u2019 ratification of the\nConvention on Biological Diversity and the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We\nvigorously support the Alliance of Small Island States\ndraft protocol to the Framework Convention, and we will\ncontinue in the joint effort towards the achievement of a\nlegally binding instrument to be negotiated in Kyoto this\nDecember. We are moving quickly to enact legislation\n15\n\n\nthat will enable Solomon Islands to meet its obligations\nunder the Climate Change Convention.\nSolomon Islands, which has ratified the Convention on\nthe Law of the Sea, is committed to the adoption of a\nseabed mining code with strong provisions for protecting\nthe marine environment. In 1998 we will actively\nparticipate in the International Year of the Ocean.\nWe are committed to the international nuclear non-\nproliferation regime. Of special concern to us is the\ntransport, dumping or storage of radioactive and other\ndangerous wastes in the Pacific region. Solomon Islands has\nsigned the Waigani Convention to Ban the Importation into\nForum Island Countries of Hazardous and Radioactive\nWastes and the Noum\u00e9a Convention to protect the region\u2019s\nmarine and terrestrial environments. For these and similar\ntreaties, it is important that relevant international standards\nbe met by the responsible parties.\nSolomon Islands, which has ratified the Treaty of\nRarotonga, continues to support the creation of a nuclear-\nweapon-free southern hemisphere, as well as similar zones\nelsewhere. We worked closely with Marshall Islands and\nWestern Samoa in arguing before the International Court of\nJustice that the use of any nuclear weapon would violate\ninternational and humanitarian law. Our position was\nlargely upheld by the landmark advisory opinion the Court\nhanded down last year. We were pleased to co-sponsor\nGeneral Assembly resolution 51/45 M in support of the\nInternational Court of Justice opinion. Solomon Islands\ncontinues its call for the creation of a forum of non-\nnuclear-weapon States. The forum, committed to the\nelimination of all nuclear weapons, and in keeping with the\nCourt\u2019s advisory opinion, would seek agreement on a\nunified approach to the full implementation of Article VI of\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\nand would monitor progress towards that goal.\nSolomon Islands, which has closely followed the\nOttawa process, will enthusiastically sign the treaty banning\nanti-personnel landmines. We thank Canada for this\ninitiative. Recognition must also be given to the\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross and several non-\ngovernmental organizations for their efforts.\nA deadly legacy of the Second World War continues\nto haunt the Solomon Islands. Over 100 ships laden with\nfuel and unexploded munitions rest on the bottom of our\nchannels and on land. A large number of unexploded\nbombs still litter our shores. The leaking fuel contaminates\nfish breeding grounds and affects the aquatic food chain.\nEstimates of the costs of clearance run to $1 billion or\nmore, but a thorough technical and financial assessment\nof the problem is required. Those countries that waged\nwar in the Solomon Islands have a responsibility to assist\nus.\nRecognizing the need to restructure the Solomon\nIslands economy, my Government is closely reviewing\nseveral key areas, such as public expenditure, banking and\nthe taxation regime. We will seek assistance from the\ninternational lending agencies and the developed\ncountries. To meet the demands of globalization, we are\nundertaking the expansion of investment and trade.\nWith 80 per cent of its population of under 400,000\nliving in rural settings on hundreds of islands dispersed\nover 1,600 kilometres of ocean, Solomon Islands is using\na village-centred development strategy that is democratic\nin origin and operation and sensitive to the cultural values\nof an ethnically and linguistically diverse people. My\nGovernment is placing increased emphasis on education\nand recreation for women and youth, who comprise three\nquarters of our population. Formal as well as informal\nprogrammes are being used to foster the study of\nagriculture, biology and other sciences, health care,\nappropriate technologies and the humanities. We are\ncommitted to upgrading the Solomon Islands College of\nHigher Education and transforming it into our National\nUniversity.\nThe Government is also focusing on programmes to\nincrease agricultural productivity through research and\nbetter land use. We are pursuing policies to promote\nlivestock development and aquaculture. Fishing remains\na vital industry for us, and Solomon Islands has ratified\nthe Agreement on the Conservation and Management of\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.\nOver half of my Government\u2019s revenue comes from\nforest harvesting. Our ultimate goal is sustainable forestry.\nReforestation and the conservation of our preserves are\nnow essential elements of our environmental policy.\nSeeking to maximize the economic return to Solomon\nIslanders, we are reviewing the process of granting\nlicences and considering the establishment of facilities for\nlumber processing entirely within our country.\nSustainable development in the Solomon Islands\nrequires electrification, especially by means of solar and\nhydro energy. Whether to enhance rural life or to open\nnew industries, electrification is essential. My\n16\n\n\nGovernment is giving energy resource development high\npriority.\nEmbracing the purposes and principles of the Charter,\nSolomon Islands has on several occasions at the United\nNations called upon the Republic of China on Taiwan and\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China to take the necessary steps\ntowards opening negotiations to achieve reunification. The\nGovernment of the Republic of China is committed to the\npeaceful and equitable reunification of China. Peaceful\nreunification is also the stated goal of the People\u2019s Republic\nof China. Both parties have offered strikingly similar\nproposals. Yet there has been no decisive movement\ntowards negotiation. Delay makes them ever harder to\ninitiate, increases tension across the Taiwan Strait and\nthreatens international peace and security. Responsibility for\npeaceful reunification rests with the two parties and the\ninternational community. Bringing about and successfully\ncompleting negotiations will be a long and difficult process\nthat would be greatly assisted by the participation of the\nRepublic of China in the United Nations. The Republic of\nChina, which is fully committed to the purposes and\nprinciples of the Charter, has the means to be an active\ncontributor to the Organization\u2019s work.\nRegrettably, threats have been made and actions taken\nagainst Solomon Islands and other Member States that have\nspoken on behalf of the Republic of China. Even the use of\nforce against us has been threatened, in violation of the\nCharter\u2019s principles and the letter and spirit of numerous\nGeneral Assembly resolutions. Threats have no place at the\nUnited Nations.\nFinally, as we enter the twenty-first century, a more\neffective Organization requires the participation and\ndedication of all sectors of civil society. Let us renew our\npledge to cooperate with the United Nations. It is time to\njoin hands in shaping the present for the benefit of future\ngenerations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nGovernment and people of Antigua and Barbuda, I would\nlike to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to preside\nover this fifty-second session of the General Assembly. You\nare well known to many of the envoys to the United\nNations, and we feel confident that under your guidance we\nwill have a productive session. I likewise wish to express\nmy country\u2019s recognition to the Permanent Representative\nof Malaysia, for the manner in which he conducted the\nwork of the fifty-first session. I also pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General, who is entrusted with the advancement\nof this Organization at such a critical time in its history.\nOne cannot walk through the edifices of the United\nNations without being asked to comment on the reform\nprocess and the value of the number of conferences that the\nOrganization has staged. The conferences of this decade\nhave certainly had an impact on our understanding of\ncertain concepts, practices and generationally imparted\nbeliefs. Though we have taken many decisions,\nimplementation has proved to be difficult, and a\nfundamental aspect of the reason or reasons for this is that\nthe United Nations needs to be reformed, and Governments\nneed to zealously renew their commitments to its existence\nand continued advancement.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s report is most welcome, and\nthere are many points on which my country is in agreement\nand others on which we think continued discussion and\ndebate are needed. Peace, security and disarmament are\nvital to a safe and secure planet, and the countless\nindividuals who live daily in constant fear \u2014 whether\nbecause of terrorists, hatred between ethnic groups,\ninternecine warfare or religious persecution \u2014 gives us\nmuch concern.\nThe Organization must have trained and equipped\nforces at all times, and the decision of a group of Member\nStates to participate in the establishment of a standby high-\nreadiness brigade is most encouraging. Additionally, there\nis a need for the demobilization of paramilitary groups,\nfor demining and for an intensification of peacemaking,\npeacekeeping and peace-building. Subsequently, the\nproblems associated with financing peace operations need\nto be addressed in a meaningful manner.\nAntigua and Barbuda strongly supports the concept\nof results-based budgeting and endorses the proposal to\nhave the Secretary-General and the representatives of\nMember States enter into a dialogue aimed at shifting the\nUnited Nations programme budget from a system of input\naccounting to one of results-based accountability.\nLikewise, my country welcomes the reforms already put\nin place in the Secretariat, through which field operations\nhave been considerably expanded, as a result of\ncooperation between the Department of Political Affairs,\nthe Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the\nDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs and other relevant\ndepartments.\nWe are anxiously looking forward to June of next\nyear, when the diplomatic conference on the need to\nestablish an international criminal court will convene.\nThis undertaking is long overdue, and Antigua and\nBarbuda has been working with neighbouring countries to\nthwart the dangers of increased international crime, which\nis so active in this hemisphere. Of particular concern is\nthe need for greater coordination among nations if the\nblight of narcotics is to be meaningfully tackled. Strong\nand determined efforts within certain countries will be\nseriously undermined if there is not a united global\napproach to manifestations and practices which will\ndestroy not only the fabric of our societies but the lives\nof countless individuals.\nThe most talked-about aspect of reform, however, is\nthe \u201cQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\nin the membership of the Security Council and related\nmatters\u201d. Numerous proposals on the question have been\nadvanced, some adding more confusion to the existing\ndeliberations. As such, Antigua and Barbuda wishes to\nreiterate its declared position that any expansion should\ninclude developing countries, and that both the Group of\nAfrican States and the Group of Latin American and\nCaribbean States should be represented.\nWe would similarly like to see certain restrictions\nplaced on the use of the veto. We understand that all\nefforts at restructuring and reform in the United Nations,\nhowever, should be focused on economic growth and\ndevelopment. In addition, my country is calling for a\n7\n\n\nreversal in the diminishing role of the General Assembly.\nThe accountability of the Security Council to the General\nAssembly must be re-emphasized, and the General\nAssembly should more actively assert its role in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, in\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 377 (V) of 3\nNovember 1950, entitled \u201cUniting for peace\u201d.\nThe buzzword that we are constantly hearing is\n\u201cglobalization\u201d. Those of us from small developing\ncountries would rather have the emphasis placed on poverty\nalleviation, but the present-day reality incorporates the\nbelief that the emphasized process of globalization and\neconomic integration is unavoidable. There are new\ntechniques of production and new forms of organization\nwhich have given flexibility to the location of industrial\nactivities and have reduced the share of wages in\nproduction costs. In many of our democratic societies\nthroughout the world, where sacrifices have been made to\nreduce unemployment, Governments are faced with the\ndaunting and even frightening reality that labour is\nbecoming a dispensable commodity. The International\nMonetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade\nOrganization all are promoting the emergence of a global\nmarket. The small countries of the Caribbean are forced to\nadapt, and our businessmen must accept the reality that the\nconcept of protected markets is fast disappearing.\nThe multilateral financial institutions which provide\nresources to developing countries at concessional rates\ncontinue to use the gross national product as a basis for\njudging our economic wherewithal. Antigua and Barbuda is\ndeemed to be middle-income, but the reality of my\ncountry\u2019s various vulnerabilities causes our people and\nthose of other Caribbean countries to bow to the flattery\nand highlight the unjustness of this means of measurement.\nOur sister island of Montserrat has recently had a\nseries of severe volcanic eruptions which have caused the\ninhabitants much pain and anguish, and Antigua and\nBarbuda, along with other Caribbean Community countries,\nhas endeavoured to render assistance. As a result, the\npopulation of Antigua and Barbuda has increased by some\n5 percent, which means that the resources of Government\nfor housing, health, education and all other services are\nstrained. Our citizens have, however, rendered much\nsupport, and Antigua and Barbuda will do all in its power\nto help alleviate the plight of our brothers and sisters from\nthat lovely but now unsafe island. We strongly support the\nrecommendation of the Committee of 24 that the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United\nNations Development Programme should move swiftly to\nassist in alleviating the plight of the sturdy but\nbeleaguered population of the Emerald Isle of the\nCaribbean.\nThere are other dangerous volcanoes in the\nCaribbean, and one is presently forming undersea in the\nvicinity of Grenada. In 1974 Antigua and Barbuda\nexperienced an earthquake which measured 7.8 on the\nRichter scale and which caused considerable destruction.\nIn 1995 Hurricane Luis unleashed its fury on our country\nfor 48 hours and was declared to have been the worst\nstorm of the century. Indeed, a single hurricane can set\nback our development some 10 years. Yet the gross\nnational product continues to be used to measure our\neconomic performance, resulting in the absurd distortion\nof Antigua and Barbuda\u2019s being deemed more developed\nthan Mexico or Brazil.\nWe are pleased to read that at the 1995 Copenhagen\nWorld Summit for Social Development, the conclusion\nwas reached that an economic system has no intrinsic\nvalue. It has to be assessed in relation to the betterment\nof the human condition. As such, a good economic\nsystem should of necessity provide opportunities for\nsufficient income to all members of the society; generate\nenough resources to enable public institutions to fulfil\ntheir responsibilities and promote the common good; and\npermit, in addition to the government, participation by\ncitizens and other public and private actors in the\ndecision-making process. To this end, the Government of\nAntigua and Barbuda is presently holding meetings in\nvarious forums to discuss precisely the realities of\nglobalization and the achievement of a single market\nwithin the Caribbean Community.\nIn June of this year a special session of the General\nAssembly was held on the overall review and appraisal of\nthe implementation of Agenda 21. Though there was\ndisappointment at the outcome due to the inability of\ncountries to coalesce around a common position or\ncommon commitments, there was the clear recognition\nthat the threat to the global commons remains a profound\nreality. There is continued overexploitation and\ndegradation of what has been bequeathed to mankind,\nwhether in regard to overfishing, overgrazing, excessive\ndestruction of forests, or air and water pollution. We have\ncollectively failed to capitalize on the promise and\naccomplishments of the 1992 Rio Conference.\nNine out of ten people in both the developed and\ndeveloping world have no idea what the term \u201csustainable\ndevelopment\u201d means and how it affects them. Nine out of\n8\n\n\nten also have little appreciation of why mutual recognition\nand mutual action are necessary. People have not been\nmade partners in the process of sustainable development,\nand Governments should do more to make them so by\neducation via the mass media, in the schools, in public\ndebate and in public presentations.\nThe industrialized countries must take the lead in\nchanging their patterns of production and consumption to\nsave the global environment and assist developing countries\nsuch as mine in our effort to meet our peoples\u2019 basic needs,\nto eradicate poverty and achieve economic growth. During\nthe special session in June, Caribbean newspapers reported\nthat every Caribbean representative zeroed in on the\n\u201cpoverty issue\u201d.\nTo eradicate poverty and achieve economic growth is\nnot an easy task and has been further compounded by the\nfact that official development assistance, a crucial part of\nthe Rio agreements, has fallen from 0.33 per cent in 1992\nto 0.27 per cent in 1995. This is well below the agreed and\naccepted target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product\nof the industrialized countries pledged to development\nassistance. The precipitous fall in official development\nassistance has shifted the burden for sustainable\ndevelopment unfairly to developing countries, destroying in\nthe process the equitable balance which was reached at that\nvery important Conference. Private capital and foreign\ndirect investment, once touted as the panacea for\nsustainable development in developing countries, have\nshown only selective benefits to some countries and have\nbypassed the vast majority. A combination of private capital\nflows, foreign direct investment and debt relief as part of an\noverall financial package may be a solution.\nIn recognizing that an integrated approach to\nsustainable development is necessary, since political,\neconomic, social and environmental issues are closely\ninterlinked and intertwined, we cannot overlook the integral\nrole that women can and should play in the quest for\nsustainable development. In Rio, women were considered\na major group whose involvement was necessary to receive\nthe sought-after goals. Mainstreaming women\u2019s concerns\nand participation in the planning, implementation and\nmonitoring of all development and management of\nenvironmental programmes to ensure that women benefit is\nnecessary for sustainable development. In this regard, we\ncall on the multilateral and bilateral donors to increase their\nsupport for women\u2019s organizations in countries such as\nmine to enable them to play an active role in all aspects of\nthe developmental process.\nThere is, however, the fact that we must stress\nrepeatedly: the need to reduce the speed of the\nglobalization thrust. Dominant Governments and\ninstitutions are setting deadlines and establishing agendas\nwith such severe demands that most other actors find\nthem impossible to follow. The alternative to\nparticipation, as it now stands, is marginalization. If all\ncountries are required to fully participate, then there is a\nclear need for selective linking processes with reference\nto both national circumstances and national cultures.\nThis brings me to the vexing question of bananas.\nThe undoing of the Lom\u00e9 trade agreement and the injury\nwhich this hostile act will inflict on small, banana-\nexporting countries of the Organization of Eastern\nCaribbean States, of which Antigua and Barbuda is a\nmember, is tantamount to an act of war. Small, peace-\nloving States, causing no harm to any other State under\nthe terms of the Lom\u00e9 agreement, have found themselves\nyoked by the recent World Trade Organization ruling.\nWithout some form of protection, the banana industry in\nthe States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\nwould collapse, leading to severe social dislocation which\nwould ultimately manifest itself in political catastrophe.\nBe reminded that on more than one occasion, the\nPresident of the United States has cautioned that in this\ngalloping global economy, small States cannot be\ntrampled upon by their large neighbours.\nWhen my country chose to host in May of this year\nthe regional seminar of the Committee of 24, better\nknown as the Special Committee on Decolonization, it\nwas because we knew that the Caribbean has many other\nobstacles to overcome in the emerging history of our\nregion and the global community. Highlighted at the\nmeeting was the principled position of the Special\nCommittee that the sustained economic growth and social\nadvancement of the Non-Self-Governing Territories is an\nessential prerequisite of the implementation of the\nDeclaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial\nCountries and Peoples. Of necessity, particular attention\nhas to be given to the environment, natural disaster\nmitigation, public health, education, economic self-\nsufficiency, the prevention of crime and illicit drug\ntrafficking.\nThe Non-Self-Governing Territories of the Caribbean\nhave the same problems as the independent countries in\nregard to narcotics. There is a multidimensional thrust\nupon our entities, as there is the challenge to\ngovernability by non-State actors, the drug operators.\nCaribbean countries additionally have to contend with\n9\n\n\nextraterritoriality and other forms of sovereignty challenges\nfrom other States, primarily because of conflicting interests\nand because the Caribbean States are small and lack\nsignificant power.\nThe countries of CARICOM are, however,\nendeavouring to improve most aspects of their existence,\nand new ground in the integration arrangement has been\nbroken. Haiti has joined the ranks of CARICOM, a\ndevelopment which is considered to be of immense\nsignificance, and we wish to applaud the decision to have\nthe United Nations Mission in Haiti extended. There has\nbeen further movement towards the CARICOM single\nmarket and economy. When Protocol II is ratified, the\nground will be laid for the free movement of factors of\nproduction among countries which have agreed to be bound\nby its provisions. A plan is being developed for the\nsustainability of both tourist and airline industries in the\nregion. Approval was given to a comprehensive human\nresource development plan for the specific purpose of\nbuilding a more creative and productive workforce in the\nCaribbean. Indeed, the countries of CARICOM are\nendeavouring to overcome the major legacy of colonialism:\nbeing placed on the periphery of the industrialized world.\nAs a collective body seeking the betterment of\nmankind, the countries which form the United Nations need\nto recognize that human advancement requires managing\nmarkets as well as liberating them. Clearly, unbridled\nmarkets tend to produce a race to the bottom, manifested\nthrough a global search for the location with the weakest\nregulatory, environmental, social and labour standards.\nWhat is required is for rich and poor countries to have a\ncommonality of purpose that ensures a path of sustainable\ndevelopment. Year after year my country pleads for genuine\nacceptance of the principle of multilateralism, yet what is\nprojected under the banner is of a selective nature projected\nby and through the powerful and the dominant. Together\nwe must find a way towards a global regime that reduces\nemissions of greenhouse gases, accepting the necessity of\nwell-off nations to transfer the technology to make this\npossible rather than viewing this shift as another\nopportunity for private industry to profit.\nIt is sad that competitiveness can be pushed in a\ndirection which handicaps and retards human development.\nState socialism failed, and in the process deprived hundreds\nof millions of individuals of both liberty and prosperity.\nMarket forces, taken to the extreme, yield poorly distributed\nrates of growth, plunder the natural environment and are\nmost devastating in regard to the wreckage of humans. The\nStates of the developing world are not just emerging\nmarkets, they are human societies. Markets must be our\nservant, not our master. Clearly, the reality of commerce\nis global, but the paths to human development have\nhistorically been proven to be local.\nIn approaching the twenty-first century, the\nGovernment of the twin island States of Antigua and\nBarbuda has decided that it should focus on human\ncapital and its development rather than focusing narrowly\non the economic question. There will be a continuance of\nthe policy of carrying out intense investigations and\nfeasibility studies to decide where to concentrate limited\nresources. In addition, even though the Government is\ndivesting itself of some of its holdings and encouraging\ngreater private investment in vital services and\ncommodities, there are some areas, particularly those\nsurrounding technology, in which the Government has to\nremain directly involved and catalytic; it will continue\nwith its practice of seeking consensus on determining key\nindustries and activities crucial and critical for\ndevelopment.\nWe will continue to take pride in and to cherish the\nUnited Nations, as we recognize its capacity for\nachievements in areas beyond the reach of national or\nregional authorities. Now the nations which comprise this\nbody must redouble their collective commitment for\ntranslating vision into reality. That is why it is essential\nto have international cooperation for development in the\nforefront of our activities. The United Nations is still our\ngreatest hope for peace, development and social justice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish at the outset to congratulate you, Mr. Udovenko, on\nyour election to the important post of President of the\nGeneral Assembly, and to wish you success in guiding the\nwork of a forum that is so important for the entire\ninternational community.\nSpeaking from this rostrum three years ago, I stressed\nthat, in spite of the armed confrontation that was then on\nthe increase in my country, the leadership of Tajikistan had\nopted for a consistent policy of political dialogue as the\nonly means of achieving peace and national reconciliation.\nToday the results of that policy can be seen. With\nactive international support, the negotiation process led to\nhistoric decisions being taken by the Tajik people, laying\nthe groundwork for successful progress towards peace and\nnational reconciliation.\nI should like to take this opportunity to express\nsincere gratitude to the members of the General\nAssembly, the Security Council, the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, and his Special Representative in\nTajikistan, Mr. Gerd Merrem, for the constant and close\nattention that they have paid to achieving a settlement in\nTajikistan, and, indeed, to the problems of Tajikistan in\ngeneral. We greatly appreciate the efforts of the Russian\nFederation, the Islamic Republic of Iran and other States,\nas well as international and regional organizations, that\nacted as observers at the inter-Tajik talks and made a\nsignificant contribution to the very difficult negotiation\nprocess. We are deeply grateful to all friendly countries,\nto international organizations and primarily to members of\nthe United Nations system that have assisted and continue\nto provide assistance in the establishment of a lasting\npeace and accord in Tajikistan.\nWe are fully determined to strive consistently and\nunwaveringly for the full implementation of the General\nAgreement on the Establishment of Peace and National\nAccord in Tajikistan and for the achievement of national\naccord. Here we count on growing support from the\nUnited Nations and its observer missions, acting in close\ncooperation with the Peacekeeping Forces of the\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Without\n\n\nsuch cooperation, it would be extremely difficult to\nimplement the military component of the inter-Tajik\nagreements or to achieve a final solution to the problem of\nrefugees.\nAnother important aspect of United Nations assistance\nto the peace process in Tajikistan is the development and\nimplementation of a comprehensive strategy on\nhumanitarian aid and post-conflict reconstruction of our\neconomy. An excellent framework for this effort is\nprovided by General Assembly resolution 51/30 J adopted\non 25 April 1997 on emergency international humanitarian\nassistance for lasting peace and reconciliation in Tajikistan.\nWe hope that in the course of this session this useful\ninitiative will be continued and that an updated resolution\nwill be adopted taking fully into account the specifics of the\ntransition period and the humanitarian needs of the people\nof Tajikistan.\nAmong the multitude of conflicts and crisis situations\nwhich unfortunately entered a new phase during the period\nfollowing the cold war, we are particularly concerned about\nthe situation in the neighbouring Islamic State of\nAfghanistan. Together with our Central Asian partners in\nthe CIS and with Russia, we have repeatedly expressed our\nprofound concern over the destabilizing impact of the\nsituation in Afghanistan on the entire region, as well as on\nthe situation beyond the region.\nOn the initiative of the Almaty Five, about a year ago\nthe Security Council became more actively involved in\nAfghan problems. Along with resolutions adopted by the\nGeneral Assembly, Security Council decisions are the best\nfoundation for ending the fratricidal war that has been\ngoing on for so many years there.\nI have to say frankly that the fact that the Afghan\nproblem remains unsettled may undermine the fragile peace\nin Tajikistan. We hope that, taking into account the agreed\nposition of the \u201cBig Eight\u201d Summit participants in Denver,\nand using their experience of cooperation to solve conflicts\nin the Balkans and other hot spots in the world, Russia and\nthe United States, cooperating with other States concerned\nand supporting United Nations involvement, will play a\ndecisive part in an Afghan settlement in the nearest possible\nfuture.\nI will be honest with the Assembly: it is in\nTajikistan\u2019s vital interests that peace be established in\nAfghanistan for another reason \u2014 it would help to reduce\nsubstantially the flow of arms and drugs across the Tajik-\nAfghan border, and it would reduce the proliferation of\nterrorism and waves of extremism which are destabilizing\nthe entire region.\nI would like to comment now on the issue of reform\nof our Organization. We attribute great importance to the\nUnited Nations as a key instrument for maintaining\ninternational peace and security. The idea of adjusting the\nUnited Nations to today\u2019s realities is certainly important\nand necessary. In today\u2019s transitional conditions, the\nstabilizing role of the United Nations must grow steadily.\nWe believe it is important to approach United\nNations reform in a pragmatic way, concentrating on the\nmost pressing issues, and maintaining a reasonable\nbalance between innovation and strengthening\nmechanisms that have proved their effectiveness.\nAs a State that has experienced first-hand all the\nhardships of civil war and has travelled the difficult road\ntowards national reconciliation with active support and\nassistance from the United Nations, Tajikistan is\nconvinced of the need to preserve strong and efficient\npeacemaking mechanisms. First and foremost, this relates\nto the work of the Security Council, which has to\nmaintain timeliness and effectiveness. We believe that\nSecurity Council representation would be enhanced if its\nmembership were expanded not only to candidates from\nindustrialized States, such as Germany and Japan, but also\nto representatives from developing countries on a\nrotational basis.\nOn administrative and budget issues, we consider it\nimportant to ensure zero actual and, if possible, zero\nnominal growth of the United Nations budget. We must\nutilize material and human resources more efficiently, and\nwe must strengthen mechanisms monitoring the work of\nthe United Nations apparatus. We must also count on the\nunderstanding of the international community in respect\nof temporary financial difficulties facing some developing\nStates and countries emerging from conflicts.\nWe consider it right that the strategy for the twenty-\nfirst century should be sustainable development, ensuring\nconservation of the environment and natural resources.\nAlthough we were not entirely satisfied with the results of\nthe recent nineteenth special session of the General\nAssembly, held last summer, it is important that that\nsession outlined ways of expediting progress in key areas\nof sustainable development, as defined in Agenda 21.\nAs a country that has suffered from civil war and is\nin transition to market relationships, Tajikistan expects the\n2\n\n\nUnited Nations to pay closer attention and participate more\nefficiently in ensuring sustainable development in countries\nwith transitional economies, including introducing measures\nto neutralize the negative social consequences of such\ntransitions. We believe that the United Nations can and\nmust maintain its unique role in providing international\nsupport for the integration of States in transition into global\neconomic and trade systems and for their involvement in\nthe existing and emerging regulatory institutions and\nmechanisms. These demands were reflected in the Agenda\nfor Development, which was adopted by the General\nAssembly in June this year.\nThe absence of peaceful conditions in Tajikistan has\nprevented it from moving towards sustainable development\nin any significant way, and consequently it has not been\nable fully to implement the recommendations of Agenda 21.\nDue to the civil confrontations that have swept the\ncountry, the main efforts of the Government of Tajikistan\nin recent years have been aimed at eradicating conflict,\nestablishing peace and tranquillity, and creating conditions\nto integrate the population into active economic and\ncreative work.\nThe new prospects for peace provide us with an\nopportunity to redouble our efforts and concentrate on\nunsolved problems. The most important of these include the\nrapid reconstruction of the social and economic\ninfrastructure that had been destroyed; the return of\nrefugees to their homes, together with their social and\npsychological adjustment and reintegration into the new\nconditions of life; the active involvement of citizens in\neconomic activity through the creation of jobs, which are\ncrucial; and, above all, the creation of conditions conducive\nto the democratic development of Tajik society.\nToday, an intensive transition to a socially oriented\nmarket economy is under way in Tajikistan. Against the\nbackground of an increasingly far-reaching peace process,\nthe Government of Tajikistan is carrying out economic\nreforms that promise positive results in the foreseeable\nfuture. The country\u2019s natural wealth, water supply, energy\nand intellectual resources are favourable to such a\ndevelopment.\nHowever, reality demands that we confront the\nsituation with honesty. We must admit that without\ninternational support it would be extremely difficult for us\nto carry out the reconstruction and creative tasks quickly.\nIn the first place, it is a question of donors continuing their\ncommendable efforts to extend humanitarian assistance to\nour most vulnerable population groups, which have\nsuffered from the civil war. Economic reforms under way\nin the country also need efficient and targeted support.\nThis would involve an additional flow of investment into\nTajikistan, the more active involvement of the country\u2019s\nexport potential in international trade transactions, and our\ngradual integration into international financial and trade\ninstitutions. I should like to express my conviction that,\nat this stage of its development, Tajikistan will not be left\nalone to deal with its problems.\nThe goal set out in the Charter of the United\nNations,\n\u201cto save succeeding generations from the scourge of\nwar\u201d,\nhas very special meaning for the people of Tajikistan,\nwho have experienced the bitter taste of fratricidal war.\nOur experience has shown that the work of the United\nNations, based on the coordinated efforts of its Member\nStates, can achieve tangible results and resolve seemingly\nirreconcilable differences, thereby enabling us to move\nonto a peaceful, non-violent track.\nWe note the tireless efforts of the United Nations in\nmaintaining and strengthening international peace and\nsecurity on a practical level under new and constantly\nchanging conditions. We believe that useful momentum\nfor this work could be provided by convening, in 1999, a\nthird international peace conference, an initiative that is\nenjoying growing support among members of the\ninternational community.

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst and foremost, Sir, I would like to echo\nthe eminent speakers who have already addressed you from\nthis rostrum in conveying the warm congratulations of the\nCentral African delegation on your resounding election to\nthe presidency of this, the fifty-second session of the\nGeneral Assembly. The fact that you, Sir, have been chosen\nbears witness to the fact that your country, Ukraine,\ncontinues to play an important role on the world stage.\nYour wealth of experience and your abilities as an\nexperienced diplomat augur well indeed for the success of\nour work, and I can also assure you that you can count on\nour support and our availability to assist you.\nI would also like to express our fullest satisfaction\nwith the work of your predecessor, Mr. Razali Ismail, for\nthe talent and skill with which he so wonderfully\ndischarged his duties. And we assure His Excellency\nMr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General, whose election was\nonly a just reward for his many years of service to the\nUnited Nations, of the renewed support of the people and\nGovernment of the Central African Republic.\nThis session is being held at a delicate time in the\nhistory of our Organization, because it is faced with many\ndifferent political, economic, social, cultural, legal and\ninstitutional problems which call for the appropriate\nreforms.\nTo renew the United Nations, to turn it into a\ndynamic, democratic and effective organization, is a major\nchallenge for this session, which the Secretary-General\nquite rightly described as the Reform Assembly. His\nbrilliant report presented on 16 July 1997 is perfectly in\ntune with the Member States\u2019 expectations, because it not\nonly highlights the challenges facing us on the threshold of\nthe first century of a new millennium, but it also, and\nabove all, puts forward proposals for the longer term.\nThe United Nations has a very important role to play\nin the areas of safeguarding and maintaining international\npeace and security and promoting social and economic\ndevelopment, democracy, human rights and justice. The\nOrganization must be reformed and strengthening so as to\nbetter confront the new realities of today\u2019s world. The\nCentral African Republic will make its own modest\ncontribution to this very important endeavour in close\ncollaboration with the member States of the Organization\nof African Unity and the Non-Aligned Movement.\nAs regards reforming the Security Council, the\nCentral African Republic hopes that the Council will be\nexpanded so as to provide equitable geographical\nrepresentation.\nBut what about the ever-widening gap between three\nquarters of humankind and the remainder? What about the\nproliferation of armed conflicts against a backdrop of\nintolerance, ethnic tension and deadly political\nconfrontations that jeopardize international peace and\nsecurity? Our Organization does not seem to be able to\ncome to grips with these problems.\nAnd yet, a few years ago, after a series of major\nevents radically transformed the old post-war order, we\nbelieved that the world was at last poised to move into a\nnew era because of the ensuing clear-cut improvement in\nthe international political climate and the new possibilities\nfor cooperation that emerged. These were supposed to\nbuild confidence among nations and facilitate the quest\nfor compromise on most of the questions of concern to\nthe international community.\nRegrettably, we were overly optimistic. In reflecting\non the sad realities of the day, I have in mind particularly\nthe many human lives lost in vain in Algeria and the\nthousands of women and children forcibly torn from their\nhomes and who, in the neighbouring Republic of the\nCongo, Burundi, Sierra Leone, Somalia and elsewhere,\nare still paying a heavy price for our imperfections, our\ncontradictions and our intolerance.\nI believe that it is time to call upon the international\ncommunity and our Organization \u2014 which in this\nalarmingly serious case seems not to be fulfilling its\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of international\npeace and security \u2014 to tackle resolutely the internal\nconflicts that are unfolding within our own States. We\nmust address these new conflicts, which entail serious\nviolations of fundamental human rights and which we are\nill-prepared to prevent and manage, because what is at\nstake is the very existence of our States, along with the\nbalance and cohesiveness of the international community.\nThe Central African Republic had cause to welcome\nthe convening on 25 September last of the ministerial-\nlevel meeting of the member States of the Security\nCouncil devoted to the situation in Africa. The\n4\n\n\nrecommendations emanating from those deliberations should\nbe translated into reality.\nThe delegation of the Central African Republic\nnonetheless welcomes the fact that significant progress\ntowards peace has been achieved in Angola, Liberia and\nHaiti. But we continue to believe that a great deal of work\nremains to be done by the parties concerned to overcome\nthe obstacles standing in the way of reconciliation and the\nrestoration of peace in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and\nin Cyprus.\nUnlike in other regions of the world, where renewed\neconomic growth is henceforth irreversible, Africa\u2019s lack of\ngood performance and its economic and social situation\nremain a cause for concern in this era of globalization.\nHowever, we are not underestimating the scope and the\ncomplexity of the crucial problems facing the international\ncommunity at century\u2019s end. To resolve these problems, a\nnew type of cooperation is urgently needed so as not to\nexclude three quarters of humankind from the march\ntowards progress and the common weal.\nAfrica continues to experience immense economic\ndifficulties because of its lack of control over certain\nexternal factors affecting its development, such as the\ncollapse in the prices fetched by its commodities, its debt\nburden and the inadequacy of its capital flows, which have\nprevented it from achieving sustained economic growth and\nraising the living standards of its peoples.\nWorse yet is the case of the least developed countries,\nmost of which are located on the African continent and\nwhose situation remains abysmal notwithstanding the timid\nsteps forward taken here and there. Though globalization\nhas given rise to a new social contract, the principle of\npartnership and of shared responsibility between the least\ndeveloped countries and the international community, with\nthe goal of reversing socio-economic decline and speeding\nup the process of sustained growth and sustainable\ndevelopment, should guide both sides in their commitment.\nNow the question is how to become competitive without the\nsupport of official development assistance, which is\ncontinuing to decline.\nAs we see it, this alarming situation calls for a\npragmatic approach to cooperation between Africa and its\npartners, in particular the international financial and\nmonetary institutions, which should not lose sight of these\nfactors in determining modalities for cooperating with the\ncontinent and providing it access to global resources. We\ncannot overemphasize the urgent need for a greater sense\nof responsibility and for a far stronger commitment on the\npart of the entire international community vis-\u00e0-vis this\ncontinent, which is foundering economically and socially.\nIt is this new awareness that will help Africa emerge at\nlast from the chaos and anarchy that continue to engulf it.\nWithout economic and social progress, there can be\nno talk of peace nor of democracy, because peace,\ndemocracy and development go hand in hand. This is\nespecially true in the case of the Central African\nRepublic, long known, owing to its long-standing\ncommitment to peace, as the Switzerland of Africa. Its\nPresident, Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9, rose to the highest office\nin the land through free and transparent elections and\ndaily preached peace and dialogue in the Central African\nsubregion. Nonetheless, the world was recently witness to\nthe sad spectacle of the Central African Republic\u2019s being\nassailed by what have come to be known as the serial\nmutinies of Bangui, simply because of its inability to\nconsolidate its still fledgling democratic experience\nthrough sustained economic and social development.\nThe case of the Central African Republic casts light\non the root causes of the wave of violence that is\nsweeping our subregion. The mutinies \u2014 which,\ntragically, lasted a full year and have thrown the entire\ncountry into near-civil war \u2014 occurred against the\nbackdrop of a tribally motivated attempt at regaining\npower and as the result of manipulation by outside forces\nseeking to put an end to our democratic process. But none\nof this would have been possible had it not been for the\nvery difficult economic and social situation of our\ncountry. The joint impact of a terrible legacy, the free-fall\ndevaluation of the CFA franc and the chronically meagre\nrevenues coming into the public treasury had for all\npractical purposes created a situation in which the State\ncould no longer regularly pay its civil servants.\nThe upshot of this crisis was all but catastrophic\nbecause the damage done by the tragic events of April,\nMay and November 1996 gravely undermined our\ncountry\u2019s potential for economic and social development.\nThe technical committee set up to take stock of the\ndamage concluded that for the first two cases of mutiny\nalone, it would cost some 41.9 billion CFA francs to\nmake up for the losses experienced by the State,\nbusinesses, projects and individuals \u2014 not to mention the\ncost of the measures needed to help the many victims of\nthat conflict.\nBeyond the necessary mobilization of all our\ncompatriots \u2014 to whom His Excellency Mr. Ange-F\u00e9lix\n5\n\n\nPatass\u00e9, President of the Republic, has issued a powerful\ncall for the restoration of peace and national unity as a\nfoundation for the genuine economic recovery of our\ncountry \u2014 it is only appropriate for our partners and the\nentire international community to stand with us and not\nagainst us. For it is the intention of the Central African\nRepublic to continue and consolidate the democratic process\nto which it is resolutely committed.\nAnd beyond the praiseworthy support of the Office of\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\n(UNHCR), my landlocked country must be given the\nwherewithal to continue to be \u2014 as we already are out of\na sense of moral duty \u2014 a land of welcome and hospitality\nfor Sudanese, Rwandan, Burundian, Congolese and other\nbrothers and sisters who are paying a heavy price for our\nworld\u2019s intolerance, ethnic tensions and deadly political\nwrangling.\nThe fact is that it is in adversity that one knows one\u2019s\ntrue friends. Our own adversity has enabled the people of\nthe Central African Republic to gauge the sympathy and\nsolidarity they have enjoyed during the most trying times of\ntheir history. On behalf of His Excellency Mr. Ange-F\u00e9lix\nPatass\u00e9, President of the Republic and Head of State and of\nGovernment, and of the people of the Central African\nRepublic, I reiterate our thanks to the entire international\ncommunity, and most particularly to France, the Federal\nRepublic of Germany, the United States of America, Japan,\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,\nGabon, Chad, Senegal, Togo, Mali, Burkina Faso, the\nUnited Nations, the Organization of African Unity and the\nEuropean Union, for the support and invaluable assistance\nthey are graciously according us.\nI take this opportunity also to convey particular thanks\nto all the States members of the Security Council, which on\n6 August last unanimously adopted resolution 1125 (1997)\non the Central African Republic. The immediate effect of\nthat decision was to deter open attempts at destabilization,\nand to enable \u2014 as it continues to do \u2014 the Inter-African\nMission to Monitor the Implementation of the Bangui\nAgreements (MISAB) better to ensure peace and security\nin the capital and the provinces of the Central African\nRepublic.\nThe peace is still fragile and precarious, and on behalf\nof the entire people of the Central African Republic we\nurgently appeal to the United Nations to enable the mandate\nof MISAB to be extended until the Central African\nRepublic possesses a loyal national army that can guarantee\nthe survival of our republican institutions.\nI wish the Assembly full success in its work on the\nbasis of the principle of universality which is so dear to\nour Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt affords me great\npleasure and honour to convey to you, Mr. President, on\nbehalf of my delegation, as well as on my own behalf, our\nheartiest congratulations on your unanimous election. It is\na fitting tribute not only to your outstanding diplomatic\nskills and long involvement with the United Nations, but\nalso to your country, with which we enjoy friendly\nrelations.\nTo your predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail of\nMalaysia, I should like to express our sincere appreciation\nfor the remarkable job that he did. His was an\nextraordinarily proactive presidency. Indeed, he has given\nnew stature to the office of President of the General\nAssembly.\nThis is the first regular session of the General\nAssembly for our Secretary-General Kofi Annan since his\nappointment to that high office. In the discharge of his very\nonerous responsibilities he brings to bear unmatched\nexpertise with regard to the United Nations system. Indeed,\nhe is the archetypical insider of that system. His\nappointment to the highest Secretariat position is\nrecognition of his manifest competence. The priority that he\nhas attached to the task of making the United Nations\nsystem more streamlined and attuned to present-day\nrealities and requirements is indeed commendable.\nWhile on the subject of reform, let me say that my\ndelegation lends its full support to the initiative of the\nSecretary-General in submitting his reform proposal, which\nthe Assembly will be examining later in the course of its\nbusiness. There is no denying that the proposal is timely\nand that it has been put forward to make the United\nNations more efficient and effective. We expect that the\nreform process will preserve and promote the centrality\nand sanctity of the principles and objectives of the United\nNations Charter. My delegation also wants the process of\nreform to be carried out with the primary objective of\nstrengthening the capacity of the Organization to address\nissues of development. Bangladesh would favour\nnegotiating the reform package in informal plenary\nmeetings with the full participation of all countries.\nThe United Nations Charter is of enduring validity.\nBy definition, reform has to be a dynamic and periodic\nprocess as times, problems and priorities change. My\ndelegation would fully support any endeavour to improve\nthe administration and management of the United Nations.\nMember States have the right and even the duty to insist\nthat optimal use be made of the resources that they have\nentrusted to the Organization for the promotion of the\nCharter objectives. Bangladesh assures its unstinted\ncooperation and support to eliminate duplication and\noverlap and to effect better coordination and prioritization.\nHowever, reform cannot be an acceptable surrogate for\npolitical will, and those two aspects must be mutually\nsupportive and reinforcing.\nIn the context of the reform exercise, Bangladesh\nwould like to stress that the exclusively international\ncharacter of the responsibilities of the Secretary-General\nand his staff should in no way be compromised.\nAccording to Article 101 of the Charter, the highest\nstandards of efficiency, competence and integrity should\nbe the basic determinants in making appointments to the\nSecretariat, with due regard to geographical distribution.\nWe therefore welcome the Secretary General\u2019s proposal\nto submit a code of conduct for international civil\nservants.\nNo endeavour at United Nations reform will be\nsuccessful without the necessary financial resources. The\ncontinuation of the current financial crisis of the United\nNations has seriously impaired the functioning of the\nOrganization. For a financially sick United Nations, the\nmuch needed shot in the arm can come only from the full\nand unconditional payment of outstanding contributions\nby those Member States that have not yet done so.\nThe cold-war era of adversarial alliances, power\nblocs and ideological divides is happily a thing of the\npast. However, another war, one in which the United\n4\n\n\nNations will have to be in the vanguard, remains to be\nfought and won before a meaningful peace and international\nsecurity can be achieved. That is the war against poverty,\nignorance and prejudice.\nPeace does not simply happen or come about\nfortuitously. It must be sedulously built and nurtured and\nunderpinned by a host of interrelated actions that are\ninextricably linked to development and human security. A\nculture of peace is essential to make it sustainable and all\nembracing. Over the years, the concept of security has\nevolved, as has the concept of development. The United\nNations can be, as the President of the General Assembly\nput it last year, the main development catalyst, one that can\nstrongly influence coordination at the macro level with\nother bodies that have more access to resources but that are\nless democratically set up.\nWe have been discussing for the past few years the\nquestion of Security Council expansion and reform. There\nis a clear logic and rationale for an expansion of the overall\nsize of the Council to make it more representative in\ncharacter. On this aspect of the question a general\nconsensus seems to have emerged, although there exist\ndifferences as to the exact size of any new Council. Where\na convergence of view \u2014 let alone consensus \u2014 continues\nto elude us is on the question of the expansion of the\nnumber of permanent seats. Bangladesh\u2019s concern, which\nwe have already articulated, is that, in any enlargement\nexercise, the concerns of the smaller and more vulnerable\nStates that have the most vital stake in an effective and\ndynamic United Nations should not be lost sight of.\nIn the decade of the 1990s we have had a series of\nhigh-profile global conferences. These mega-conferences\nhave addressed some of the major challenges that are\nconfronting us today and, with the United Nations playing\na central role, reached important political consensus. Those\ngatherings underscored in particular the primacy of human\ndevelopment in achieving sustained and sustainable\ndevelopment.\nThe Agenda for Development adopted in June this\nyear is in a sense the culmination of this series,\nrepresenting a synthesis of the plans and programmes of\naction that had been adopted. The Agenda is the result of\ntortuous and painstaking negotiations carried out over a\nperiod of four years. It is a matter of gratification to have\nachieved a development consensus that was so badly\nneeded and clearly warranted. It is, of course, most vital\nthat, along with the Agenda for Development, follow-up\nand implementation should match the outcome of these\nconferences.\nBangladesh believes that without the full\ninvolvement of civil society this process will remain\nincomplete. Recognizing the key role of civil society in\npromoting global partnership, we welcome the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s proposal for a people\u2019s millennium Assembly\nin the year 2000.\nIt is now widely accepted that free enterprise, the\nmarket economy, international trade and competition, as\nwell as broad-based public participation in economic\nexpansion, are the keys to economic growth and human\ndevelopment. To this mix must be added the components\nof democracy, good governance and the rule of law. This,\nhowever, in no way diminishes, particularly in the case of\nthe least developed countries, the imperative of a\nsupportive external environment. Improved access to\nworld markets, greater inflow of foreign private\ninvestment, transfer of technology and managerial know-\nhow and larger external assistance all have very important\nroles to play in ensuring development. Economic\nliberalization should invariably be combined, in our view,\nwith adequate social safety nets to safeguard the most\nvulnerable segments of society.\nIt is a matter of some concern to us that global\nofficial development assistance flows continue to slump.\nWe sincerely hope, though, that this trend will be\nreversed. The development of the South is not only an\ninvestment in peace and security, but would clearly also\nrebound to the advantage of the countries of the North in\nthe long and not so long run, since this would mean\nbigger markets for their exports, with all their\nconcomitant benefits. Development has been most aptly\ndescribed as a partnership.\nThe plight of the least developed countries, in\nparticular, calls for very careful consideration and has in\nthe past merited a special place and focus in the\ninternational agenda. Two major international conferences\non the least developed countries have been held in the\n1980s and 1990s and important decisions and programmes\nof action adopted. The implementation of these, however,\nhas been disappointing. We hope that the third United\nNations Conference on the least developed countries can\nbe held in the year 2000 to chart the course of global\nsupport for these weakest members at the start of next\nmillennium.\n5\n\n\nWe would urge special consideration and concessions\nfor the least developed countries in order to enable them to\nmeet World Trade Organization deadlines. Indeed, if the\nsituation so warrants, deadlines may even be made flexible\nfor that group of countries. We would also urge that, at the\nforthcoming high-level meeting in Geneva next month, all\nmajor issues of concern to the least developed countries,\nincluding duty-free access of their products to foreign\nmarkets, be given most favourable consideration.\nThe end of cold war perhaps naturally raised our\nhopes for a new and exciting world order in which nations\nwould share the responsibility for freedom and justice and\nthe strong would respect the rights of the weak \u2014 a world\nof open borders, open trade and open minds. Such a vision\ncan and should surely be our goal and inspiration. To\nachieve it, in particular at the regional level, cooperation in\ncarefully identified core areas of activity, including trade\nand investment, is a valuable tool of development.\nIn our own region, through the South Asian\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), we are\nstriving to accelerate progress in core areas of cooperation,\nsuch as poverty eradication, expansion of regional trade and\ninvestment. We have also, within the ambit of SAARC,\nlaunched a \u201cgrowth quadrangle\u201d involving four member\nStates \u2014 Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Bhutan \u2014 in order\nto explore areas of joint economic activity and take\nadvantage of the factor of contiguity. Moreover, outside of\nSAARC, Bangladesh has entered the Bangladesh-India-Sri\nLanka-Thailand Economic Cooperation (BIST-EC) in order\nto boost cooperation in the economic and commercial fields\namong its four member countries. A consensus decision has\nnow been taken to allow Myanmar to join this subregional\ngroup as a full member.\nLast year, while addressing the General Assembly, I\nreferred to the negotiations that were being held with India\non sharing the waters of the Ganges River. This had proved\nto be an intractable problem for over two decades and it is\na matter of great satisfaction to us all that, in December last\nyear, we signed a 30-year treaty at the highest political\nlevel with India on sharing arrangements. The signing of\nthis treaty, within months of the present Government\u2019s\nassumption of office, demonstrated that, given goodwill and\npolitical will, the most difficult problems can be resolved.\nAt the national level, we are affording every facility\nand cooperation to our private sector and providing liberal\nincentives to foreign entrepreneurs to invest in our country.\nThe Government\u2019s role will be to oversee and to provide\nsafety nets where necessary. The Government is making\nevery effort to combat the blighting scourges of\nwidespread poverty and deprivation, so that we may\nrealize the dream \u2014 to which the Father of the Nation,\nBangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, dedicated his\nentire political career and life \u2014 of a country free,\nprogressive and prosperous, at peace with the world and\nwith itself.\nOurs has also been a pioneering role in the field of\nmicrocredit. Initiated by the Grameen Bank and\nconsidered a most innovative approach to the eradication\nof poverty and empowerment of women, it has been\nrecognized and emulated in a good number of developing\nand developed countries. The Microcredit Summit held in\nWashington earlier this year was a success: a target was\nset there to free 100 million families from the\nstranglehold of poverty by the year 2005. At the United\nNations, the \u201cFriends of Microcredit\u201d ambassadors have\ntaken the initiative to follow up the implementation\nprocess throughout the United Nations system.\nIn Bangladesh, we have accorded priority to and\nplaced special emphasis on social sector development in\nsuch areas as health care, education, family planning,\nwomen in development and the preservation and\npromotion of human rights. The initiatives and efforts of\nour Prime Minister in this regard have been widely\nappreciated. I would particularly mention here that the\nGovernment, under the dynamic leadership of Prime\nMinister Sheikh Hasina, the illustrious daughter of the\nFather of the Nation, has announced the decision to set up\na National Human Rights Commission. Our Parliament is\nexpected to pass the required legislative mandate for this\nCommission next year. We are also working towards the\nestablishment of grameen, or rural, courts, which will\ntake justice to the people at the grass-roots level. This\nconcept of participatory justice is still a novel one. Its\npurpose is to ensure speedy, effective and inexpensive\njustice to the humblest of citizens.\nWhile on the subject of human rights, I should like\nto express our pleasure that an individual of the eminence\nand distinction of Mrs. Mary Robinson has been\nappointed United Nations High Commissioner for Human\nRights. We would like to assure her of the wholehearted\ncooperation of our Government. We look forward to\nworking with her in close concert in the promotion of\nhuman rights, a goal that all of us share and cherish, with\nspecial focus on the right to development and the rights\nof women and children.\n6\n\n\nThe Constitution of Bangladesh specifically provides\nfor our international relations to be based, inter alia, on the\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter. It is thus for us a\nmatter of singular pride and gratification that Bangladesh\nshould be playing such an active role in United Nations\npeacekeeping operations. This is a role that we consider to\nbe a solemn duty and an earnest of our commitment to the\nUnited Nations and the principles and purposes of the\nCharter.\nWe still have a long way to go in the area of\ndisarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament. The entry\ninto force of the Chemical Weapons Convention is a major\nstep forward.\nIt is a truism that our world is becoming increasingly\ninterdependent. The uncomfortable fact remains, though,\nthat it is still a far more dangerous place than that it should\nbe. West Asia, the Palestinian issue, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, Afghanistan and the Great Lakes region all\npresent problems that impinge on international peace and\nsecurity. The United Nations, of course, is playing a pivotal\nrole in seeking peaceful and equitable resolutions of these\nproblems.\nWe sincerely hope that the peace process in the\nMiddle East will move forward and that the years of\nnegotiations, investment and effort will bear fruit. Our\nviews on this particular issue are well known. Relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions exist, as do agreements\nnegotiated outside the ambit of the United Nations, on the\nbasis of which a meaningful peace can be achieved in the\nMiddle East and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian\npeople, including the right to an independent homeland,\nrestored.\nAs we approach the next century, it will have to be\nour collective endeavour to strengthen and to reinforce\ninstitutions at the global level that can effectively address\nthe problems of the post-cold-war world. The United\nNations in essence represents the entire human race in\nmicrocosm, with its wisdom and follies, its successes and\nshortcomings. It is an experiment, as was once said, in\nliving together as a single human family. To be sure, the\nUnited Nations is an Organization of Governments \u2014 the\napex of intergovernmental organs. And yet it is also true\nthat its foundations rest on the yearnings of the peoples of\nthe world for a lasting peace.\nThe opening words of the Charter read:\n\u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations determined\nto save succeeding generations from the scourge of\nwar\u201d.\nThe peoples and nations of the world will have to work\nin concert if stability, prosperity and a meaningful peace\nare to be achieved on a global scale. Bangladesh, of\ncourse, will be at the forefront of this endeavour.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nextend my warmest congratulations to you, Mr. President,\non your election. I am sure you will guide us well, and we\nlook forward to working with you.\nI would also like to congratulate our Secretary-General\non the excellent start he has made in answer to the\nMembers\u2019 call for reform. At the same time, I would like\nto thank the outgoing President for his support in this most\nimportant work.\nYou take office at a critical time, Mr President. There\nare obviously no easy solutions to the many challenges\nfaced by our Organization. But there is one thing I hope we\ncan all do: be positive and constructive in our approach.\nWith this in mind, I would like to comment briefly on two\naspects of current United Nations work that particularly\nconcern us in Brunei Darussalam. The first is peace and\nsecurity and the second is the Secretary-General\u2019s reform\npackage.\nOn peace and security, we were pleased to have had\nthe chance to do something to help in the Middle East and\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina. But we have been dismayed by\nwhat has taken place this year, particularly in the Middle\nEast. The current situation is not what we expected. The\ndisruption of the peace process clearly started when Israel\ndecided to build settlements in East Jerusalem. This was\nbad policy. It was obviously not aimed at helping the peace\nprocess. Thus, we would like to see the Israelis do\nsomething positive to repair the damage done.\nWe have made our position clear for many years. We\ndo not wish to return to the past. It is time for more than\nwords, arguments and resolutions. What we want to see is\na peace process that actually proceeds. Somehow, the\nimpasse must be broken, and we greatly appreciate the\nefforts being made by Jordan, Egypt and the United States\nto do that. We encourage them and all countries that can\nhelp to continue their efforts, despite the many difficulties.\nConcerning the situation in Bosnia, we have also been\ndisappointed by the way certain elements continue to\nundermine the cause of peace. There are overwhelming\nsigns from the peoples of Bosnia that they welcome the\nnew opportunities they have for a normal life. We are\ntherefore pleased to see the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) and the United Nations taking strong\naction to enforce the Dayton Agreement. In our view,\nsuch action is definitely being taken on behalf of the\nBosnian people. We offer them our full support.\nThese are just two of the areas where we have seen\nsetbacks to United Nations efforts. We can add many\nothers in Europe, Asia and Africa. What is required\neverywhere is a determination to resolve all problems\npeacefully by means of dialogue and negotiation.\nGiven that spirit, progress is possible. We have seen\nevidence of it in the great efforts being made in northeast\nAsia to try to find a solution to the problems on the\nKorean Peninsula. The difficult situation in Korea could\naffect all of us in the Asia-Pacific region, so we very\nmuch welcome the four-party talks as a way of reducing\ntension and building confidence. For the same reason, we\nare happy to support the initiative of the Korean\nPeninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO),\nsince it will help remove one serious threat to peace.\nOn the question of lasting peace, however, we have\nlearned to take nothing for granted.\nSome causes of instability have been dramatically\nhighlighted in our own region this year. The recent\nattacks on our currencies and our financial institutions\nhave shocked us all. They cannot be dismissed as mere\nups and downs in the market. It is all very well for\ncommentators to say so, but this is not good enough; it is\ntoo simplistic. The effect is like a disease, and it goes for\nthe heart of our economic systems. It seeks out weak\npoints, and developing countries have limited built-in\nresistance.\nYes, we will survive. Our foundations are sound. But\nthe experience has taught us a lesson. We are realizing\nhow deeply we are all affected by globalization, market\nforces and interdependence. The playing field is anything\nbut level, and this means that the world organizations to\nwhich we belong must be highly effective.\nThe most important of these is the United Nations,\nand this brings me to the questions I know the Secretary-\nGeneral is keen to hear all of us answer at this session:\nWhat do we think of his package of proposed reforms?\nAre they going to help developing nations?\nMy broad reply would be to say that we think the\npackage is better than the previous attempts to achieve\nreform. Overall, it firmly addresses the right questions,\n4\n\n\nand, having long supported the idea of United Nations\nreform, we welcome the proposals.\nHowever, we do have a few comments to offer. We\nbelieve they are constructive and hope they will be taken\ninto account by the Secretary-General. As many others have\nremarked, the proposal seems, basically, to be a\nmanagement package. It reflects the Secretary-General\u2019s\nlong experience in the Organization. But good management\nprinciples represent only one aspect of the reforms we need.\nWe hope that an acceptable consensus will be reached on\nmatters which especially concern developing nations.\nWe would like the Secretary-General to make\nabsolutely sure that nothing is going to weaken the things\nthe United Nations does so well for ordinary people. The\nUnited Nations work in the field gives the Organization\nmeaning for millions. We must not let our agencies down.\nWith regard to the proposals concerning peace and\nsecurity, we hope that the Working Group will soon\ncomplete its work on the Security Council. This aspect of\nreform will certainly strengthen the Organization as a\nwhole.\nWith regard to development cooperation, we welcome\nefforts to enhance it. It represents all that is best in\ninternational cooperation. It is also directly linked to the\nimportant Chapter IX of our Charter, which calls for higher\nstandards of living, full employment and economic and\nsocial progress. Without these, there can be no lasting\npeace and security in the developing world.\nLastly, there is the question of financial viability,\nperhaps the most important of all if reforms are to be\neffective. We find the various proposals interesting, but\nwhat we are concerned about is whether they provide a\nlong-term solution. We therefore want to give these matters\nmore thought. Naturally, we rely on the Committee to look\nvery carefully indeed into the details of any such scheme.\nHaving made these points, I should like to conclude\nby once again offering my congratulations to the Secretary-\nGeneral on his work. As I said, it is a good start. When the\nwork is finished, we hope that the result will be not only\nadministrative reform but a strong renewal of the deepest\nprinciples of our Charter.\nWe wish the Secretary-General, and you yourself, Mr.\nPresident, much success in the year ahead. We assure you\nthat we will do all we can to assist fellow Members in\nresponding well to what the Secretary-General has rightly\ndescribed as unprecedented demands and opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset, Sir,\nto congratulate you on your election as President of the\nfifty-second session of the General Assembly. We have no\ndoubt that under your able stewardship this session will\nsuccessfully address the many and complex issues\nconfronting the Assembly and the Organization.\nMay I take this opportunity to pay tribute to your\npredecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail, and to say how\nproud we Malaysians are of the manner in which he guided\nthe work of the fifty-first session of the General Assembly.\nMalaysia is honoured by the opportunity given him to serve\nthis Assembly and is deeply grateful for the support he\nreceived from Member States, the Secretariat and other\nmembers of the international community in the discharge of\nhis duties.\nI would also like to acknowledge the tireless efforts of\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who since\nassuming office less than nine months ago has swiftly\nbegun to energize and revitalize this Organization through\nhis proposals for change and reform. We wish him every\nsuccess in these efforts, for which we extend our full\ncooperation and support.\nThe general debate of this Assembly is the only truly\nuniversal forum where leaders representing diverse\nsovereign countries and their peoples are able to articulate\nvery freely their views, without fear or favour. Given the\nmonopoly of international information and communication\nby vested interests, the value of this Assembly as a forum\nfor the free expression of differing views by leaders\nrepresenting the sovereign Member States cannot be\noverstated. As an annual debate which serves the purpose\nof bringing to the attention of the international community\nthe priority issues of concern to sovereign Member States,\nit cannot be replaced.\nToday, I am privileged to have the benefit of this\nforum to share with Members the priority issues of concern\nto Malaysia. Let me begin with a matter of immediate\nconcern to us and to a number of other Association of\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, which\nexperienced the severe effects of the turmoil in currency\nand stock markets in recent weeks. Stock prices plunged\nwhile our national currencies depreciated, exacting a heavy\ntoll on economic growth and development. The sequence of\nevents did not take place as a result of war, conflict, natural\ndisaster or mismanagement. It was precipitated by\ncurrency speculators - indeed, manipulators - who, driven\nby sheer greed, took advantage of the vulnerabilities of\ndeveloping economies, especially the fragility of their\nnascent financial markets.\nWhat happened in South-East Asia could, of course,\noccur in other parts of the world which are increasingly\ndependent on capital flows for economic growth. Such\nrampant speculation or manipulation of hedge funds in the\ncurrency and equity markets of developing countries, at\na time when they are still feeling their way in a world of\nfierce global competition, would trigger off a defensive\nreflex on the part of the affected countries, thereby\narousing anti-liberalization, which would be detrimental\nto free trade.\nIn an interdependent world, the currency crisis in\nSouth-East Asia warrants the prompt action of the\nmultilateral financial institutions, such as the World Bank\nand the International Monetary Fund, and the developed\ncountries, which should assist the affected economies of\nEast Asia in overcoming the effects of this excessive\nmanipulation and in preventing its recurrence. Their\npositive response in this regard is especially important in\norder to maintain the developed countries\u2019 continued\ncommitment to, and confidence in, globalization, on\nwhich so much of international free trade depends.\nThreats to the well-being of States take many forms\nand can come from within as well as from outside. These\nthreats, including the notion of erosion of sovereignty,\nhave been facilitated by the advent of technology. The\nSecretary-General alluded to this development in his\nreport on the work of this Organization, where he\nrecognized that the same technological means that foster\nglobalization and the transnational expansion of civil\nsociety also provide the infrastructure for expanding\nglobal networks of \u201cuncivil society\u201d - organized crime,\ndrug-traffickers, money-launderers and terrorists.\nWe live in a time when it has become fashionable,\nin some quarters, to distinguish between the security of a\nState and individual security, especially in the context of\ndeveloping regions of the world. The perception has been\ncreated that the concept of security of the State is\nsomehow inimical to the rights of the individual in the\ndeveloping world, and this has been highlighted in the\ncontext of human rights. The elevation of the importance\nof human rights in the international agenda, a most\nwelcome development, has been exploited and politicized\nfor narrow self-serving interests and specific political\n10\n\n\nagendas. If our interest is to heap scorn and to indulge in\ndouble standards, selectivity and mutual recrimination, the\nnoble cause of promoting the universal value of human\nrights is bound to suffer. Blatant violations of human\nrights \u2014 whether in Bosnia and Herzegovina, occupied\nterritories of the Arabs and Palestinians or in other parts of\nthe world \u2014 must be condemned and prevented, and not\nhave a blind eye turned to them, if the United Nations is to\nplay an effective role in promoting and protecting these\nrights.\nAs we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights in 1998,\nconsideration needs to be given to a review of relevant\nhuman rights documents and their applications. We must\nrededicate ourselves to the need for a balanced approach to\nall aspects of human rights \u2014 civil, political, social,\neconomic and cultural. Selective interpretation or\napplication of human rights will not only demean their\nvalue but, more seriously, undermine the well-being of\nindividuals in parts of the world that are still engulfed by\nage-old hatreds and animosities. We should reiterate our\nrecognition of cultural peculiarities, which is an inherent\nand timeless characteristic of human society. We should\nassert that there is no intrinsic contradiction between the\nrights of the individual and those of the community.\nIndividual rights do not exist in a vacuum. Indeed,\nindividual and community rights are not mutually exclusive;\nthey thrive on the basis of a mutually reinforcing and\nbalanced relationship. As one reinforces the other, there\nshould be no artificial separation between the two by\nstressing the importance of one at the expense of the other.\nMalaysia welcomes the appointment of Mrs. Mary\nRobinson, former President of Ireland, as the new High\nCommissioner for Human Rights, and hopes that, together\nwith the United Nations Secretary-General, she will be able\nto improve the United Nations human rights machinery and\nrole, including the depoliticization of human rights and the\ntimely and full implementation of the right to development.\nThe United Nations remains, as the Secretary-General\nhas put it,\n\u201cthe only institution that has the breadth of mandate to\naddress the root causes of instability and conflict and\nto pursue in a comprehensive and integrated manner\nthe wide array of economic, social and environmental\nissues impinging on development.\u201d (A/51/950, para.\n128)\nWe must therefore be wary of those seeking to exploit\nspecific issues designed to marginalize the Organization.\nMore than 50 years after its creation, the pre-eminence of\nthe United Nations in multilateral issues can no longer be\ntaken for granted, despite its universal membership and\nbroad mandates dealing with all issues of peace, security,\ndisarmament and development.\nThe commitment of the United Nations to\ndevelopment remains its most significant role. While the\nOrganization\u2019s forays into peacekeeping make all the\nheadlines, it is its work in development, in terms of\nresources generated and the changes made in peoples\u2019\nlives, that is most vital and meaningful to Member States.\nIt has become clear that while the eradication of poverty\nand the enhancement of development are the\nresponsibilities of individual States, the United Nations\nsystem has a key conceptual and promotional role to play.\nThe ultimate objective \u2014 to secure the development\nof developing countries \u2014 remains the same. We need to\nconstantly re-examine the means by which to attain this\ngoal. The United Nations must strongly project the need\nfor higher levels of growth, accelerated development, and\nequitable geographical distribution of growth. In this\ncontext, we need to ensure that our approach to\ndevelopment takes into account the economic, political\nand technological realities of our time, especially the\nincreasing influence of the private sector.\nRegrettably, resources made available for\ndevelopment have declined substantially in recent years,\nadversely affecting the various United Nations\nprogrammes and agencies concerned. Culpability must\nrest with those who had promised to assist but failed to\ndeliver. In the light of such a disappointing let-down, the\nUnited Nations should explore the possibilities for closer\ncooperation with other stakeholders, particularly the\ncorporate sectors.\nWith their vast resources, expertise, financial clout\nand extensive global networking, those in the private\nsector should be welcomed as partners to operationalize\ncertain aspects of sustainable development. They could,\nfor example, provide assistance on environmentally sound\ntechnologies where Governments have left a void. The\nUnited Nations should ensure that it involves the private\nsector from all over the world. However, it must also\nensure that it will not be dominated by the interests of the\n11\n\n\nbusiness community, by holding the corporate actors\naccountable.\nThe United Nations must continue to be a democratic\ninstitution, accountable to all its Members. Unfortunately,\nthis cornerstone of the Organization continues to be assailed\nby those still bent on the quest for geopolitical dominance.\nIn an increasingly unipolar world it is imperative that the\nUnited Nations preserve its independence or autonomy and\ndecide in the interests of all Member States, not just those\nof a particular Member State or group of States.\nThe process of the democratization of the United\nNations is particularly important in the context of the\nreform of the Organization, especially that of the Security\nCouncil, which is long overdue. Malaysia supports an early\nresolution of the issue. Ambassador Razali Ismail, in his\ncapacity as President of the fifty-first session of the General\nAssembly and as Chairman of the high-level working group\non the reform and restructuring of the Security Council,\ntried his best to move the process forward.\nConcerted efforts must continue to be made to ensure\nthat, since the Council\u2019s permanent members cannot be\nabolished, its continued existence must reflect current\nrealities, in particular the significant role of the developing\ncountries in international affairs. At the same time, as a\nmatter of principle, there should be no discrimination or\ndifferentiation between the old and the new permanent\nmembers. If reform of the Council is to be truly\ncomprehensive and consistent with the spirit and realities of\nour time, then we must seek to remove \u2014 or at least, as a\nfirst step, restrict \u2014 the use of the veto power. Democracy\nin the United Nations is a mockery if the voice of the\nmajority is rendered meaningless by the narrow interests of\na dominant few.\nMalaysia believes that genuine global peace and\nsecurity and the survival of mankind can only be assured in\na world free of weapons of mass destruction. Therefore,\ndisarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, remains a\nforemost priority of the global community, and we urge the\nSecretary-General to reaffirm his support \u2014\nnotwithstanding his preoccupation with certain aspects of\nproliferation issues, particularly small arms.\nWe are deeply concerned over the trend in some\nquarters to ignore the need to stop vertical proliferation. We\nurge the international community to expedite efforts to\nachieve the total elimination of nuclear weapons, to be\nformalized in a nuclear weapons convention. We hope that\nthe new and reconstituted Department of Disarmament and\nArms Regulation will place as high a priority on\ndisarmament as it does on proliferation of weapons and\narms regulation. For its part, like a number of other\nregional groups, has positively contributed to the\ndisarmament process by bringing into force the South-\nEast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone, which still awaits\nthe support of the nuclear-weapon States.\nWhile we stress the importance of non-proliferation,\nreal progress in disarmament will only be achieved by\naddressing the issue in all its aspects. While nations that\naspire to become nuclear Powers should disavow their\nintentions, the declared nuclear Powers, which are also\nthe world\u2019s largest arms traders, should also embark on\nthe road towards general and complete disarmament. In\nthis regard, we laud the global initiative to ban landmines,\nand call on the producers of these mines to help defray\ndemining and rehabilitation costs in the affected countries.\nInternational peace and security continues to be\nthreatened by the deteriorating situation in the Middle\nEast following the waning of the peace initiative in the\nMiddle East. Mutual distrust has replaced the synergy for\npeace as the modus operandi between Israel and the\nPalestinian Authority. Malaysia supports the call for the\nimmediate resumption of peace talks and affirms its\nsupport for the Palestinian people and their inalienable\nright to self-determination.\nWe urge the international community to persuade or\npressure Israel to honour its part of the Oslo accords by\nlifting the ban on Palestinian cities and towns, and to give\nup its intention to build settlements in what are occupied\nterritories. We are further alarmed by Israel\u2019s decision to\nbuild a dam in the occupied Golan Heights. We view this\nas a deliberate act of provocation and bad faith, and\nquestion its sincerity in seeking genuine and enduring\npeace with its Arab neighbours.\nIn the meantime, the international community should\ncontinue to provide the necessary financial support to\nameliorate the plight of the Palestinians \u2014 for example,\nthrough the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for\nPalestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), to which\nmy Government has made its modest contribution over\nthe years, in addition to our own bilateral assistance to\nPalestine. It is important that UNWRA be provided with\nadequate resources to fully implement its programmes and\nactivities.\nWe remain seriously concerned over the situation in\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Obstacles continue to impede\n12\n\n\nthe full implementation of the Dayton peace accord.\nFurther, mutual mistrust and animosity among the different\nethnic groups cast doubts over the future of the country. It\nis our fear that the withdrawal of the international forces\nfrom that country could trigger a new wave of violence and\nbloodshed. This fear is real, particularly since indicted war\ncriminals, who should have been removed from the scene\nlong ago, are still at large and exercising power and\ninfluence.\nMalaysia believes that creating an environment of trust\nand understanding among the peoples of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is a priority. The international community\nshould make efforts to promote goodwill among the\nBosnians and encourage them to live in peace and harmony.\nOne such initiative could take the form of informal round-\ntable conferences, participated in by Bosnians of all ethnic\norigins, representing the different sectors of society and\nprofessions, including academia, and participants from other\ncountries, to discuss all issues of ethnic relations with the\nview to enhancing understanding and cooperation among\nthem.\nIt is my hope that from this effort will emerge a\nsizeable group of leaders from various professions, acting\nas catalysts for the promotion of goodwill and cooperation\namong the ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nMalaysia is prepared to work with like-minded countries to\nhelp realize this idea. We have to ensure that peace and\nstability endure in Bosnia and Herzegovina and that we\ncontribute in the efforts towards its early reconstruction. At\nthe same time, we must all work to bring justice back to\nthe Balkan region by ensuring that just retribution is meted\nout to those who participated in some of the worst atrocities\nof this century.\nAs we approach the twenty-first century, our energies\nand preoccupation must centre on building and\nstrengthening peace and prosperity. Peace and security are\ntwo sides of the same coin: peace nurtures prosperity, while\nprosperity reinforces peace. Peace at the national level is\nsustained through democracy, good governance and close\ncollaboration between the different segments of society.\nMalaysia, a multiracial and multi-religious society,\nwhich less than a month ago observed its fortieth\nanniversary, has been blessed with peace and prosperity.\nWhile this may partly be due to fortuitous circumstances,\na lot of it has to do with an effective leadership and a\npeople determined to improve their lot. It is fortunate that\nwe have been able to rule the country by the process of the\nballot and not the bullet, with regular free and fair elections\nand with the different races accommodating and sharing\npower on the basis of democratic principles.\nBy engendering social and racial harmony based on\na political compact, we have been spared many of the\ntraumas experienced by less fortunate countries and we\nwere thus able to achieve our development goals in\nrelative peace and tranquillity. I am happy to say that we\nhave been able to share some of our experience in nation-\nbuilding with a number of our friends in the developing\nworld.\nIn spite of the many criticisms levelled at the United\nNations \u2014 some of them not entirely justified \u2014 this\nmuch maligned Organization of ours has remained\nsteadfast in its mission to serve the international\ncommunity, even as its resources have been dwindling in\nrecent years. Clearly, in an ever-changing world that is\ngrowing more complex and increasingly unipolar, the\nUnited Nations has served as a pillar of international\norder. Serving as the collective conscience of humanity\nand the arbiter of its conflicts, the Organization, despite\nits deficiencies, has functioned as an indispensable norm-\nmaking and institution-creating instrument of international\nrelations.\nIn my view the process of United Nations bashing\nhas gone on far too long. While the introspection that\nfollowed was inevitable and has had a sobering effect on\nthe Organization, it is time for us to pick up the pieces\nand allow the Organization to get on with its mission. For\nthis purpose, the Secretary-General has put forward a\ncomprehensive package of reform proposals for which he\nmust be given a lot of credit. Obviously, such a wide-\nranging package by its very nature cannot please every\none of the 185 Members of the Organization. The\nSecretary-General has attempted to put together proposals\nand strategies that are intended to secure the broadest\nsupport from Member States predicated on a slate of\nshared common goals.\nMalaysia is supportive of the general thrusts of the\nSecretary-General\u2019s package of reform proposals. Many\nof the highlights of these proposals are indeed interesting\nand deserve our serious consideration. We support the\nCabinet-style management approach that the Secretary-\nGeneral is introducing, revolving around the Senior\nManagement Group, as well as his proposal to create the\npost of Deputy Secretary-General. We hope that the\nDeputy Secretary-General will not only assist an already\noverburdened Secretary-General in the management of the\nSecretariat, but would also have substantive responsibility\n13\n\n\nin overseeing the core area of development which is dear to\nthe hearts of developing countries.\nMalaysia also welcomes the measures being taken to\nincrease and improve coordination between United Nations\nHeadquarters and its field operations. We also support the\nrationalization of the work of the Organization involving\nthe reconstitution or amalgamation of the various\ndepartments aimed at consolidating and integrating their\nwork so as to enhance their effectiveness and efficiency.\nWe trust that in carrying out the reorganization exercise, the\nSecretary-General will be guided by the need to ensure that\nthe changes will benefit all of the Member States,\nparticularly those in the developing world.\nMy delegation will take an active part in the detailed\ndiscussion of the Secretary-General\u2019s reform proposals in\nany format that will be agreed upon by Member States\nwhich will facilitate their implementation at an early date.\nIn carrying out these reforms, however, we should not lose\nsight of the importance of the financial health of the\nOrganization, which has been highlighted by the Secretary-\nGeneral himself. The proposed revolving credit fund is a\nwelcome measure insofar as it provides financial solvency\nin the short term. But it is unfair and unethical that the rest\nof the world is held to ransom by the few who disregard\ninternational treaties and agreements and Charter provisions\nfor the sake of their narrow national interests. We join the\nSecretary-General in urging Member States to work towards\nthe speedy resolution of the financial crisis of the United\nNations by fulfilling their financial obligations towards the\nOrganization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
